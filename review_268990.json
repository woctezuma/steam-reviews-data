expect the \"driving force\" of this game, is the gameplay side of it, the narrative its fine, but frankly it won't make that much sense unless you have played the first game, which I have, but not for a very, very, very long time...\n\nEven then, the gameplay is enough for me personally to recommend this game.\n\nIt is fantastic, it's fast, violent, just incredibly brutal in every way, there's ways that you can execute your enemies that end up dismembering them, or simply turning them into amorph combinations of meat, and bones.\n\nThe whole things plays out like some sort of \"arcadey\" hack'n slash video game, you have to characters to play the game with, both with different narratives, from what i've seen, both of them use different weapons, but most of them are \"melee\" at that you can get katanas, chainsaws, or even, as it was in my case, a massive, freaking, needle.\n\nThe problem with this weapons is that for the most part I found the \"switching\" system between them to be slow, and sluggish, the game tries to create a flow through the fight by allowing you to combine different weapons, to create interesting, and prolongued \"combos\" that end up tearing your enemies apart, but I never really found an incentive to use them other than to see if they felt any different from the ones I already have, which I was pleased with, turns out most of them, even while fully upgrading them, end up being worse weapons than the ones you already have from the start.\n\nIt wasn't until I got the minigun which allowed me to SHOOT enemies, plus, its subsequent upgrade, a shotgun blast that you can trigger in the middle of a \"barrage\" of attacks, when I understood that the weapons you got where supposed to be used in the middle of the combat as an addition to your base weapons, instead of the ones being your main ones.\n\nBut at that point I had already developed strategies, and familiarity with the default loadout, even while imposing to myself the experimentation between the weapons I had in relation to new ones, wasn't enough for me to find them even satisfying, let alone useful in any way.\n\nThat however, didn't detracted from the joy of the incredibly fast-paced, and violent combat system, shared with the interesting and straightfoward level design that held plenty of secrets that I could find.\n\nSuch as \"beads\" that all have their own unique, different design, plus advantages that can grant you things like increased damage against certain enemies, or getting a more frequent drop of a certain item.\n\nIt works really well, and I found those collectibles as well as the different \"guitar solos\" that you can find to be fun, and useful minigames that ended up making the game a bit more diverse.\n\nThis \"guitar solos\" play like a musical game would, you pretty much hear the music, look at some flashing, colored lights, and follow the incoming button prompts, you have to be accurate in order to get a 100% of each song, which would then give you more \"money\".\n\nThat then you can use to upgrade your equipment, such as your weapons, and, or health, whilst also allowing you to purchase items that you can use in the middle of a fight, I personally didn't find that much use to them, but I was playing at easier difficulties, so there...\n\nI guess that's also one thing I must mention about this game, I remember the first \"Dishwasher\" game that I played years ago was very difficult, so much so that the developers of this game listened to player, and critics, feedback, and ended up making different difficulties for different people, so the game retains a much more \"casual\" appeal than the first one, while still promoting much more \"hardcore\" players play on higher difficulties, by even unlocking an even harder difficulty than the one available from the start, after you finish the game in any.\n\nSo overall, I totally recommend this game, its great fun, its brutal, and violent, there's always a bunch of blood and limbs flying all over the place, I like the aesthetic even if at times in can be both depressing, and \"messy\" but I find it distinctive, and unique, particular of this games, and the developers who created them, it has been almost an \"staple\" for a lot of its other \"projects\".\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514489230, "timestamp_updated": 1514489230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

played this year, and that's a time period that includes Salt & Sanctuary.\n\nThere's another Dishwasher game that comes before this, but it's not on steam and you don't need to play it to appreciate Vampire Smile. Honestly, part of why I love this might be that I went in totally blind and everything the game threw at me was a totally welcome surprise. \n\nI went in expecting a platformer, and instead got a highly technical frantic 2D character action game built around combat flow. All of your moves, even your heavies, come out lightning-fast. Everything strings together. Everything can be canceled into with a dash. The dash (at least on the route I played) is a teleport with i-frames and a slowdown effect when you dodge through a significant enemy attack, giving you a quarter second to assess where you are in the battle and where you need to be. \n\nBut wait. There's more.\n\nLand a long enough string of hits on an enemy, and you can instakill them with a grab. Nearly all of combat is a teleporting, air-dashing, combo-stringing, grab-killing waltz of blood and viscera, but there are guns (mainly for pushback and breathing room) and spells to help clear particularly thick waves of enemies.\n\nDespite being on rails, the game has some light metroidvania elements and slightly heavier RPG elements. Like a DMC title, you can upgrade health, magic, individual weapons, etc with currency from murdered enemies. Unlike a DMC title, you get your full selection of moves very early on, but there's no unlocking new combos. Mastery comes from knowing what to switch to and when, and also from controlling combat flow. I'm not good at these types of games, but I felt like a god every time I got into a flow-state with this.\n\nAnd really, that would be enough to recommend this to anyone who likes the character action genre, but wait.\n\nThere's more.\n\nVampire Smile has the kind of story, implicit world-building, and enemy design that a soulslike would be proud of.\n\nThe atmosphere, sound design, and visual effects in Vampire Smile are all deeply moody like in other Ska games, but it isn't bleak like Salt & Sanctuary. It isn't irreverent like Charlie Murder, either. Vampire Smile has an utterly gonzo, but equally serious story to tell. You don't need the prequel game as context (and again, I suggest going in blind, starting with the Prisoner's route), as things are revealed to you when you need to know them. To give you a taste, there are cyborgs, robots, undead, government agents, and reality demons, it's all set on the moon, magic is real, everything of importance is settled with katanna duels, and your goal is to assassinate capitalism.\n\nOn top of that, Vampire Smile isn't afraid to switch genre and gameplay elements on the fly, spontaneously turning into Silent Hill, Guitar Hero, and at one memorable point an Atari title. Its boss designs are visually and mechanically pleasing, which is to say they're white-knuckled controller-gripping affairs (don't play this with mouse and keyboard. I'm not even sure if you can) that all contribute something to the lore.\n\nIf I have a single gripe about this game, it's that the first twenty minute pick up a little slow, but that's scraping the bottom of the critique-barrel. \n\nI would love to see another title in this series, but until one is announced, this thing is a steal at $10.", "timestamp_created": 1509891844, "timestamp_updated": 1509891844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36278413": {"recommendationid": "36278413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110186768", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510314603}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 go play the game its worth every single cent", "timestamp_created": 1509822887, "timestamp_updated": 1509822887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36250613": {"recommendationid": "36250613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129936651", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 1627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509727200}, "language": "english", "review": "Now before I start talking about this game, this is a sequel to the game The Dishwasher dead samurai. I have not played it yet so I won\u2019t talk about if this game is better than the first one. Now to this game.\n\nThe Dishwasher: Vampire Smile is one of the most fun games I have ever played; there is a lot to talk about this game, so let\u2019s start with the story.\n\nYou can play up to two characters. Yuki or her step brother a guy called the dishwasher. Now first Yuki\u2019s story, \n\nyou play as Yuki a young girl pinned for the crime of destroying the world. She is sent to the spaceship prison Iffenhaus, but during a nightmare, she has she wakes up to the image of her slaughtering a prison guard and discovers she has this, newfound powers.\n\nSo she decides to escape and pursue a quest for revenge, against the three figures of power known as The Banker, General and Judge. Who put her there.\n\nOkay now for Yuki\u2019s step brother.\n\nyou play as the undead warrior called the dishwasher. After the first game The Dishwasher and a guy called Chef destroyed the world after it became uninhabitable, because of the evil Sinthesis AI - The Master Computer and the Fallen Engineer and there\u2019re evil Cyborg army.\n\nBut even with the world destroyed the dishwasher sees that a new evil Cyborg army is taking power; on the last home for humans the moon. So it\u2019s up to him to hunt down and destroy this new evil Cyborg army and they corrupt leaders.\n\nNow what I loved about this game, is that it\u2019s very fair but still hard, what I mean about that is the enemy\u2019s don\u2019t feel cheap. If you die it\u2019s your own fault, but with time you can win. \n\nSpeaking about the enemies. I loved the enemies and bosses especially the bosses, they have unique looks and some are very scary looking. \n\nMy fav bosses are Goreface, the lich, skeletank, and the scourge. The only boss I wish they did more with was the invalid, but other than that all the other bosses are all good and fucked up.\n\nCombat was good, especially with the different weapons in the game. From swords and guns, to more unique ones like a giant needle, and the squirt gun with an electric toaster. So you can come up with your own way of killing enemies. I liked the art style. Music was good too.\n\nNow the only well, not bad but still could have made the game better. There was no pause dialogue, what I mean is, well in game\u2019s cutscenes they are done like a comic book but it goes so fast you can\u2019t read what\u2019s on them all.\n\nNow with that, the game is still kickass. Hard but fair game play, scary and unique bosses, and a scary Cyberpunk feeling.

The combat is fluid and fun, it can be picked up immediately without a tutorial, and once you get through the first two or three levels, the difficulty really kicks in. Mechanics are a blast and the art style is unique adds greatly to the experience.\n\nI must also note just how wonderfully helpful and responsive the developers are.  Yesterday I was having a slight problem with my saves (which turned out to be entirely my fault, not a bug). I posted the problem I was having on the discussion board asking for help in general, and within an hour or two one of the developers personally responded to my comments. Through several exchanges, he walked me through possible causes of the issue and solutions, and even had me email him my save file so he could inspect it. It was really a pleasure getting extensive help from such an engaged developer, and really bodes well for the future of this game and all their others (like Salt and Sanctuary, which is just amazing!).\n\nSo, hats off to the developers for making such a great game.

I remembered playing this with my brother when I was a kid after buying it from the XBLA. However, I was hesitant to buy it, afraid that my love for it would be torn after not looking at it through the nostalgic glasses. I bit the bullet and decided to get it. I'm happy to say that it more than holds up to me.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game... is amazing. Even though it looks like a metroidvania, it is not. It has elements such as getting keys and backtracking, however it is divided into levels. The hacking and slashing feels fluent and always feels like I'm in control. It's frantic hack n' slash at it's best with an amazing soundtrack. That being said, the game is hard. However, it doesn't take the easy way out with manufactured difficulty by throwing too much at you. The combat is genuinely challenging and requires you to change your weapons on the fly. There are a couple mechanics that are not fully realized, such as the dodge/shift ability. I always felt that you should be able to stun them if you phase through them. These mechanics would mean nothing if the game was poorly ported. However, that is not the case. I did not encounter a single crash and while there are no graphical settings apart from monitor selection, resolution, full-screen/windowed/borderless-windowed mode select, and v-sync toggle (happy to say the with it on, I did not see any input lag), the game is not graphically demanding at all and should run fine on most rigs. The only downside I see is the frame-rate locked at 60fps, even with vsync off. It didn't affect me since I have a 60hz monitor, but I know some people care about their unlocked framerates. \n\nThe game is short, me beating one of the stories in a little under 4.5 hours. That beign said, it is a game that offers more than one playthrough. You have challenges, the arcade, and playing the other side of the story. Oh yeah, and do yourself a favor and use a controller. You're welcome.\n\nGraphics:\nOriginally being an XBLA title, you shouldn't expect breathtaking visuals. However, the art style in itself is breathtaking. It does have that flash game comic feel to the graphics on the surface, however it's stylized and polished in such a way that it doesn't feel like it could have been released on newgrounds in 2009. The dark and grungy color pallet suits the massive amounts of red that you'll be spraying all over the enviornments. I do not have the original version on hand, however I'll have to assume that they made the textures sharper. I don't remember if the XBLA version was 60fps either.\n\nThe story:\nI won't be spoiling anything here, just my thoughts on the basic premise of the story. It's a story. It's not the center point, as the action is. There are two characters to play as, each has their own story. Well, kind of. They do have their own weapons and kind of their own story, but it follows the basic outline. It kind of feels like a reskin when playing as a different character.\n\nThe verdict:\nI love this game. It holds up extremely well and I'm extremely happy to get it. It is well optomized, has an amazing soundtrack that compliments the dark and grusome atmosphere amazingly. At $10, it's a great value.", "timestamp_created": 1506457111, "timestamp_updated": 1506457111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35196271": {"recommendationid": "35196271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268051184", "num_games_owned": 337, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512018599}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved Salt and Sanctuary and that\u2019s why I bought this game. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely different, but I love it. \n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s a beat em up Salt and Sanctuary with a good story.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1506314069, "timestamp_updated": 1506314069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521776", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35050845": {"recommendationid": "35050845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249801926", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504896746}, "language": "english", "review": "The Dishwasher games were my introduction into the world of Ska Studios and to this day remains my favorite 2D platformer.

The combat feels raw and visceral while the handdrawn style of the Silvas is awe inspiring and certainly not to be slept on.

It was fun for a playthrough but there is effectively zero replay value unless you're an achievement whore.

First question you guys might ask yourselves when looking at this game:\nQ: \"Is the gameplay any good?\"\nA: Yes. BIG yes. So far, gameplay wise, it's the best side scrolling beat'em up I've ever played. The gameplay is fast paced, smooth, and VERY satisfying. Both with controller AND keyboard.\n-\nNOTE: For the keyboard though, you're gonna want to go into your options, and switch your, \"Blood Warp\" ability to the, \"F\" key. You'll know what I mean once you get the Blood Warp ability. (You get it within the 1st 5-10 minutes of playing)\n=========\nNow, as for the art style; it's incredible. (Like how I used that semicolon? Yah, I'm a smart boy.) Very stylized and well drawn. I really don't know what else to say about it besides I love it.\n=========\nTHE STORY! I like it. It's got a main character you can get behind and root for, villains you can hate, and some cute moments sprinkled around here and there. (\"I'm gonna call you Paka, cat~. Coming with me?\" -Yuki)\n=========\nWifu potential?: Aahhh, we're at this part of the review.\nDishwasher: Would be good husbandu. Glowing personality, good sense of humor, takes initiative, and is a dishwasher-vampire-ninja/samurai, so that's cool.\n-\nYuki: Precious cinnamon bun who wants reveng, and to cuddle with her kitty. Simple girl with simple wants. 2 kyoot 4 tis' wurld. But yo, real talk tho, (I kinda hope my IRL friends don't see this but...) her battle grunts are actually super cute... \"HUAAAH!!!\" \"OOOUUU!!!\" Cute. Also she has a chainsaw for one of her arms, that's pretty neat.\n=========\nPRICE: Game is only ten bucks, $10.00. It's so worth it.\n=========\nHow would I rate this game overall?: 69/69 (Aaaaawww, yeeeeah.)\nBut yo tho, this game is actually amazing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1499492048, "timestamp_updated": 1499492048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530601", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33310563": {"recommendationid": "33310563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194053409", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 847, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508402971}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5de8\u4e73\u306e\u59b9\u3068\u4e0a\u534a\u8eab\u88f8\u306e\u30ef\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u306a\u5144\u306b\u3088\u308b\u5fa9\u8b90\u5287\u304c\u304a\u3082\u306a\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u6575\u3092\u5207\u3063\u3066\u6295\u3052\u3066\u6483\u3063\u3066\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u3067\u6c7a\u3081\u3066\u3068\u6d3e\u624b\u3067\u304b\u3064\u723d\u5feb\u611f\u3042\u308b\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u306a\u30a2\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u306e\u306f\u3042\u308a\u305d\u3046\u3067\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u6c17\u306b\u5165\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u305f\u3060\u6575\u3082\u30ac\u30fc\u30c9\u3057\u3066\u304f\u308b\u4e0a\u306b\u4e00\u6483\u304c\u91cd\u3044\u306e\u3067\u53b3\u3057\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u305f\u304f\u3055\u3093\u3042\u308a\u3001\u3069\u3093\u3069\u3093\u6575\u304c\u308f\u3044\u3066\u304f\u308b\u306e\u3067\u3060\u308c\u308b\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3082\u51fa\u3066\u304d\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u53f3\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u3067\u7e26\u6a2a\u7121\u5c3d\u306b\u79fb\u52d5\u3067\u304d\u304b\u3064\u30c0\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u4e2d\u306f\u7121\u6575\u306b\u306a\u308b\u306e\u3067\u5e38\u306b\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u6226\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306a\u308b\u70ba\n\u8ffd\u3044\u8a70\u3081\u3089\u308c\u305f\u308a\u5730\u5473\u306a\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u306b\u306f\u306a\u3089\u306a\u3044\u69d8\u306b\u306a\u3063\u3066\u307e\u3059\u3002\uff08\u5c1a\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306f\u9632\u5fa1\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u305b\u3093\uff09\nXBOX360\u3067\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248\u304c\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3057\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u4e2d\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5\uff1f\u306e\u30a8\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u601d\u3044\u3063\u304d\u308a\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\uff08\u52dd\u3064\u305f\u3081\u306e\u6599\u7406\u306e\u9b54\u6cd5\u306e\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\uff1f\uff09\u304c\u66f8\u304b\u308c\u3066\u307e\u3059\u306e\u3067\u4eca\u5f8c\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u7248\u304c\u3067\u308b\u304b\u3082\u3057\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n\u3042\u3068XBOX360\u3088\u308a\u9b54\u6cd5\u304c\u5f37\u304f\u306a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u6c17\u304c\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u4ed6\u306b\u3082\u7d30\u304b\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u6539\u5584\u3055\u308c\u3066\u308b\u3063\u307d\u3044\u306e\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6e08\u307f\u306e\u65b9\u306b\u3082\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u4f59\u8ac7\u3067\u3059\u304cshank\u3082\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f62\u614b\u3084\u9023\u7d9a\u6280\u304c\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u540c\u3058\u611f\u3058\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3053\u3063\u3061\u306f\u5c11\u3005\u5730\u5473\u3067\u3059\u304c\u304a\u52e7\u3081\u3067\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1499345448, "timestamp_updated": 1499426398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33266799": {"recommendationid": "33266799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107385672", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 98, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499245472}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh-MY-....

SO MUCH BLOOD.\n\nI don't own a 360 controller anymore (now using mouse and keyboard) and the only issue I have with the port is that when you play a guitar solo it uses LMB, RMB, E, and SPACE.

40k and throw in some vampires (The cool kind, not the twilight ones).\n\nFun Gameplay: Fast paced side scrolling button mashing that results in a lot of blood. Glorious blood. \n\nStory: The story is pretty cool and you can choose your character who gets their own story. \n\nMETAL!!!: Yeah... look for the amps, play that music.

I played the hell out of Salt&Sanctuary (same devs) and noticed/enjoyed a lot of the same elements and themes.  A lot of the soundeffects are totally identical to S&S but they're damn good soundeffects so I didn't mind. The combo system was gory and fun. The weapons were creative and with a little bit of effort I found them easy to master. The dodging system (or warping as I call it) was a little confusing at first, mainly because I found it hard to believe that dodging could be so OP (you basically can warp in any direction with 0 cooldown, essentially granting you unlimited invulnerable flight).  However, this mechanic fits the game's playstyle and doesn't negate the difficulty at all. Pretty dope. The only negative thing I have to say is that while the story was excellent and visceral, it simply wasn't long enough.  Today is my second day owing the game and I've already completed the game with both characters. No, I didn't spend all day on it either, overall I spent about 3 1/2 hours on each playthrough and I'm not a speedrunner. Granted, I haven't spent much time on arcade mode or gone back through to make sure I found all beads, upgrades, guitar solos, etc. So aside from a short story mode, I thoroughly enjoyed this game and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys gory brawler games or who has played S&S.", "timestamp_created": 1495563997, "timestamp_updated": 1495563997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31915117": {"recommendationid": "31915117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107475299", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502447376}, "language": "english", "review": "I've followed SKA Studios for a while and love their games.

Finding out this game was recently released on PC after so long was like being in a dream.\n\nThrough past experience with the game on the Xbox 360, I can assure anyone who is holding off on buying this game that it's worth buying. \n\nReasons for buying:\n\n1. Beat em up arcade gameplay. \n\n2. Dark storyline.\n\n3. Cool weapons you can combo with that change playstyle.\n\n4. Upgrades for your character. \n\n5. Crazy boss fights.\n\n6.

period.  The previous title secured Xbox's Summer of Arcade as a staple of the console's lifespan, and this one is everything that was but bigger, better and bloodier.  Plus a chainsaw arm.\n\nIf the developer didn't go their own different way with their take on the 2D Beat-em up with Charlie Murder and the equally acclaimed Salt & Sanctuary, I would have been perfectly fine if this became one of the faces of Xbox.  While that's clearly not the route they took, to have it now up on Steam for all is certainly a treat, especially to newcomers.  The only part lacking is the, well, lack of the original title.

Por ahora me dejare llevar por lo que he jugado, que no es poco.\nEste t\u00edtulo sali\u00f3 en Xbox Live en 2011. Lo jugu\u00e9 y realmente me encant\u00f3, hasta el punto de que por alguna extra\u00f1a raz\u00f3n, dejo una marca en mis recuerdos. Me qued\u00f3 una espinita al no poder acabarlo en su momento. Cuando me enter\u00e9 de que sal\u00eda para PC me dio una gran alegr\u00eda. Uno de los t\u00edtulos que m\u00e1s deseba de este a\u00f1o. De hecho, ahora que lo compr\u00e9 por una cantidad muy a tener en cuenta (10\u20ac), al ponerme a los mandos, no solo me ha satisfecho, sino que, adem\u00e1s, ha superado todas mis expectativas y aquellos recuerdos; sorprendiendome con un estilo de combate muy poderoso y basado puramente en la habilidad, claramente influenciado por titulos como Devil May Cry, God of War... Haciendo gala de una velocidad endiablada y tremendamente bien ejecutada imposible de conseguir si no fuera por un dise\u00f1o inteligente de mecanicas de juego, de enemigos y jefes. Todo mezclado, funciona a las mil maravillas y que alucinar\u00e1 a los seguidores de los Hack and Slash. Eso si, aviso, el juego se desarrolla en entornos completamente en 2D sin profundidad. Algo que para algunos les puede tirar para atr\u00e1s.\n*A mi me parece que beneficia su estilo de combate y permite dotarle de una mayor sensacion de velocidad y una mayor profundidad a nivel mec\u00e1nico. Recomendad\u00edsimo. Una peque\u00f1a joya imperfecta que por meritos propios se merece estar entre mis juegos favoritos de todos los tiempos. Cuando haya jugado m\u00e1s y lo complete al 100% espero realizar una cr\u00edtica mejor fundamentada de sus pros y sus contras, que ya voy adelantando, son pocos.

That's what Dishwasher is. A side-scrolling stylish action game where your dodge is basically Nightcrawler's teleport. You constantly warp and roll around, slicing at enemies, tangling with their blocks, bleeding them out, and then ripping them apart with an execution when they're ready to die. Weapon switch cancelling, dodge cancelling, slow-downs on powerful hits, all the good stuff is there. (FYI: Weapon switch cancelling is the most important part.)\n\nThe slow weapons hit like beasts, the fast weapons still feel good too.\n\nFor a game made by just two people, it's really good. The combat mechanics are dead on (Though I would take issue with a couple of enemy attack hitboxes), the aesthetic is heavy metal complete with electric guitar/violin solos as rhythm minigames. The story plays into this well, managing to be edgy enough for heavy metal but not enough to cause cringe*. Two characters, 9 weapons plus guns... This is simply an excellent port of an excellent game.\n\nThere is not much to the game beyond the combat. The levels tend to have several paths to hide items/equippables but they don't waste your time. Four difficulties and a timed speed-run mode with leaderboards. Then a challenge mode with well over 50 combat challenges of varying configurations, and then a survival mode. Dishwasher knows what it is good at and gives you a lot of ways to enjoy it. If you are at all interested in side-scrolling stylish combat action or curious to see what the devs of Salt and Sanctuary did before that game, take a plunge.\n\n*As an aside, this storytelling skill is what S&S vets might expect.

I played this game originally on console and it was one of the first 2D games I played with unbelievable amounts of gore. The point of the game is very simple: \"Kill the bad guys and dont die\" (quote from the \"How to Play\" menu). It's a very fast action hack and slash game where you use everything at your disposal to destroy your enemies. There's quite a few play styles through chosing different weapons and gear, tons of references, some crude humor, and A LOT of \"Because Why Not\" situations lol. I would highly recommend this game if you're someone who enjoys a 2D hack and slash style of gaming. \n\nNow that all of that has been mentioned, on the polar opposite if you've played this game before and enjoyed it then be prepared to use a keyboard and a mouse. This threw me off quite a bit and it's something that I'm going to have to get used to as if I'm playing the game from scratch. Also this game was added not too long ago meaning that there may be some issues that I'm not aware of yet as of the date I posted this comment. I've made it about a third of the way through the game and so far I haven't encountered any bugs yet.\n\nLastly if you'd like to see a small gameplay video of it before buying it yourself then check out my channel on YouTube called Mico Prime.

I'm a huge fan of Bayonetta and why I'm bringing this here??? Well.... the shortest way to put it out... This is Bayonetta in 2D.\n\nI missed the game when the game came out in 2011... I didn't have an Xbox and I didn't heard about it when I bought the game I didn't know which kind of game to expect but.... I bought it, downloaded it and I started to play and was a huge surprise specially when I started to play... the game has a very deep combo system like the good hack & slash games... there's a score for the combo of course and also there are penalties if you take hits.... if you are a Bayonetta player you know what I'm talking about at this point \n\nThen the game let you have two set of weapons, each one with a couple of weapons....I can add that each playable character have 10/12 weapons with a very very deep combo system... so... with 10/12 weapons, you can imagine the possibilties you can get in between weapons combinations and set of weapons... it's insane the depth of this game.\n\nAlso as far as I know the game have more than one playable character and the story is different. Also the weapons are different for each playable character.\n\nAs you play the game, the game has difficulty levels to unblock... again like Bayonetta and also the game have an arcade mode... this is like Angel Slayer from Bayonetta...it's basically like a challenge system inside of an arena and I hasn't start that part yet but it's a huge part of the game... 51 missions/verses in the arcade mode... \n\nThe game has a combo practice room where you can see the combo list for the weapons that you have and practise with an enemy... the game has boss battles... is pretty much Bayonetta in 2D in every single way...\n\nAlso the price of the game is like 7/8 pounds...I can't recommend enough this game.\n\nIf you like a game with a very deep gameplay system where the control \nis all about presicion and technique... this is your game right here...this \ngame offer hundreds of hours of good gameplay if you want to master it.", "timestamp_created": 1494702120, "timestamp_updated": 1494717186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31730081": {"recommendationid": "31730081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101628555", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507081031}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this on the xbox and I love it on here too.

Beat the first one then replayed Vampire Smile. Safe to say I really enjoyed this game. Anyway a few years later my older brother moved out of the house and took the 360 since he bought it. And for years and years I've wanted to replay both Dishwasher games, it's been on my mind for years, I kept looking up \"Dishwasher PC release\" and kept checking to see if it would atleast come to xbox one as a Backwards Compatible game since I own a Xbox One, I read some news that it would never come to xbox one due to technical reasons and word on the PC release was lost, the last thing was a unoffical fan port to PC that got taken down and a statement that they want to port it back in like 2013. I honestly lost all hope but the urge to replay this fucking game wouldn't go away, I emailed the dev's about it multiple times with no answer back I honestly was so close to buying a preowned Xbox 360 just to play it again. And then, today in 2017, I check steam, see it on the top of new releases and fucking shat myself, I was beside myself. \nI know this isn't really a review or anything, obviously I like the game and still do even though I find it hilariously edgy now that I'm older.

This game deserves some words regardless. In one hour I am confident enough to recommend it cause it's.. DAMN.. GOOD!\n\nOne thing first though. Do not expect a lot of depth per weapon. It's fairly basic hack'n'slash spam one to two buttons, no huge Devil May Cry-like combos. Does that make it bad? Heck no! Just a fair warning to not have unreasonable expectations.\n\nOkay? Okay...\n\nLook at that price! 10 dollars. What would you expect out of 10 dollars? Bugger all probably, that's the kind of price \"walking-simulators\" tend to go for. But no, no no no no nooo. What you get is bloody gore-fest that even has local co-op. Yeah you read that right, LOCAL.. CO-OP! Multiplayer too.\n\nSpeaking of bloody gore, there's ton of it, and all very well animated for the artstyle chosen. You feel the strength of your actions and get to enjoy the murderous rampage you are in throughout the whole experience. Said experience being a Metrovania game at heart but with a level selection.\n\nThough it doesn't only let you select levels, it lets you select character even! In fact, depending on the character you pick or depending whether you play co-op or not you get to see different cutscenes. The cutscenes are kinda like a very short comic, following the general artstyle of the game, which is not bad, though personally I didn't really like it that much. They don't look as crispy as the rest of the game, fairly pixelated. But whatever, they don't last too long.\n\nHaving that said, the story isn't really that engaging so those low-quality cutscenes are kinda the icing on the cake. Minor spoilers, it's a [spoiler] revenge story where your character starts from the bottom of the situation, gets powerful, goes after revenge. [/spoiler] However, there's enough hints around to keep it a tiny bit spicy, making you wonder what happened and wanting to get those few answers. Will they come? No idea, but even if they do not there's still some satisfying combat to be had!\n\nWhat can I say about combat? It's amazingly satisfying. There, done! Okay fine... \n\nThere's a complete lack of blocking, only dodging, so it's all about keeping up a fast pace and picking your enemies out fast enough to not die, and at higher difficulties you WILL die. The game tends to drop a lot of enemies at you and the AI is not dumb. If they could they would be killing you actively but there's some limitations to them thankfully. On the other hand, at lower difficulties the game should be fairly \"relaxing\", as relaxing as a massacre of screaming humanoids could be, though I imagine a few accidental deaths can happen there too. The bosses get tricky very fast. In usual Metrovania style you get multiple weapons and magic that you can swap around on the fly and sometimes use to unlock new passages even, which is where a big part of the fun comes from, mastering the swaping and usage of all your arsenal.\n\nThough nothing is perfect, and the kinda annoying issue that the game has is that you cannot cancel animations into dodge, so no matter how fast you are you could get hit because you were mid combo. Luckily, there's some ways around it but it's possible you will feel a bit cheated sometimes. Just don't spam that attack button will you?\n\nWell, that's about it really. Most importantly it's SO freaking worth it for 10 dollars, be it alone or with a friend. Do you think you'd like it from what the videos and screenshots show?

So I thought I would write something up on the PC ports of both version. You can find my Charlie Murder version linked at the end.\n\nGetting into the gameplay breifly, Vampire Smile is an incredibly unique character action 2D Hack'N'Slash game. It's one of those games with a very recognizable artistic style. It's got this dirty yet pleasing look to it. Many games try doing this dark and gritty look but it's always too high fidelity and often comes off too polished than what it should be.\nSmile feels like it is rooted properly in a visual style that bleeds uneasiness. Gameplay is also very interesting. It's a character action game with a combo system including aerial attacks and multiple weapon styles but it's also set as a side scroller. It's a really fun, action-packed title with a story to tell that blends well with the dark art style.\n\nOnto the port!\nVampire Smile and Charlie Murder are very identical in terms of the PC port so what I say here is comparable to Charlie Murder. Vampire has a ton of resolution options, some of which go beyond 1080p. The game also supports borderless windowed mode, fullscreen and windowed mode in addition to having seperate volume sliders for sound effects and music. The game was original an Xbox 360 Arcade title when it was released back in the summer of 2013 so it's not really a graphical powerhouse. The dirty, muddy art style actually holds up really nicely as it doesn't bring down the fact that this was once an Xbox 360 title. As a result there aren't any graphics options. This will run on almost anything.\n\nYou also have options to rebind your keyboard and mouse controls. However, some of the defaults aren't exactly ideal. For starters, the in-game menu is bound to Escape, the settings menu is bound to Enter and the default attack is bound to the U key. Once again you do have the option to rebind all of them and having the mouse and keyboard use the same actions is pretty cool but it is finicky when first booting it up.\n\nThere is also an issue if you want to record gameplay with Radeon Relive (AMD's Capture Software). The game refused to be recorded if you start in fullscreen mode and if you change back to fullscreen accidently the software will bug out and break. The multiplayer also doesn't have any kind of lobby/server system to find games.\n\nOverall it's a great port. If you're looking for more of a brawler and don't mind needing to use a gamepad for the most part, Charlie Murder is more up your alley. However, for 9.99 The Dishwasher: Vampire Smile is a really good, unique game that a lot of people will enjoy once they give it a chance. The 2-player co-op is also a nice touch for couch gaming.\n\nYou can check out more info on Charlie Murder here (written): http://steamcommunity.com/id/76561198009283722/recommended/405290\nOr you can check out the video linked above at 6:18 where I talk about it:\n\nThanks for reading.", "timestamp_created": 1494642377, "timestamp_updated": 1494647642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31713444": {"recommendationid": "31713444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102002324", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509775497}, "language": "english", "review": "Vsync has problem .. please improve .

Its hard because you can't block and the enemies deal so much of damage. But you can warp all around the stage all you want.

Playing as the Dishwasher was more fun than playing as Yuki but thats my opinion. Yuki is faster and optimal but the Dishwasher is more crazier. The Dishwasher has much more fun and dynamic weapons. Remember when your mother told you not to run around with scissors? Well now is your chance. Just mash up Y X Y X Y X and you are cutting everything in your way. The Dekkentozter is a very unorthodox weapon but it is a very strong weapon. Its because you have to squirt water (which does no damage) and then hit your enemy with the electric thingy (which does SUPER damage). \n\nI have not yet tried out coop mode because the 360 build was a bit fuzzy.

I feel in love with the original The Dishwasher: Dead Samurai, and this game is one of those extrememly rare examples of stellar sequels that somehow manage to keep all that made the original great while adding to it. Paint the grimy, bleak and dreary environments in red cyborg guts with a wide variety of weapons, all the while feeling like an absolute badass as you weave between waves of creative enemies. There's a bit of exploration, rewarded by finding helpful hidden items, or keys to progress, and loads of great bossfights interspersed throughout. \n\nThe real gem / takeaway from the game is something hard to describe without playing it - it's the \"feel\" of it. Dark and brooding atmosphere, bottomless buckets of gore, and a stellar soundtrack all combine to make a unique game out of a plain genre. I don't even really like hack-n'-slash games.\n\nThe music adds a lot - so much so that I've been trying in vain for a while now to get Pain Administrator or The Sunken March to play in Salt & Sanctuary when a boss shows up. I had the chance to see Ska Studios a while ago during PAX when they were promoting Charlie Murder, and when I was done sperglording out I had asked about how the music is done. I'm still struggling over how James nonchalantly said \"Garage Band\" - that's insane.  \n\nFantastic game from fantastic people! Combat is super-smooth and crisp, finishers gruesome and satisfying. If you're into hack-n'-slash / beat em' ups, this game is pure unadulterated joy. One of my favorite aspects of Vampire Smile (and all Ska Games) is that it's so uniquely their own game. Its everything that makes passionate indie titles so great - I could never play anything like this from anybody else; when just two (!) people create a game, everything in it is from them alone. Everything that makes the game up becomes almost personal in that way, like a vision from them to you.\n\nFantastic / 10 would ride the Dragon hellivator in an endless loop of retries again.", "timestamp_created": 1494615057, "timestamp_updated": 1494615057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750778", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31707689": {"recommendationid": "31707689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042814621", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494716959}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fast paced bloody hack and slash with many combos and weapons.

The story is also kinda descent too.\n\nAlthough when playing with a controller the buttons wouldn't respond well occasionally but that's probably the only complaint I have with this game.", "timestamp_created": 1515835057, "timestamp_updated": 1515835057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39179631": {"recommendationid": "39179631", "author": {"steamid": "76561198365190862", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 174, "last_played": 1515716448}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would buy again", "timestamp_created": 1515413084, "timestamp_updated": 1515413084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39104735": {"recommendationid": "39104735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349416972", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 481, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 193, "last_played": 1515616206}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very fun\nthe characters are intersting\nthe ending fights are BULLSHIT", "timestamp_created": 1515207712, "timestamp_updated": 1515207712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39053539": {"recommendationid": "39053539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107815391", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 464, "last_played": 1515505974}, "language": "schinese", "review": "2D\u7248\u5fcd\u9f99\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1515082747, "timestamp_updated": 1515082747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39017685": {"recommendationid": "39017685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049493952", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514996968}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440 \u043d\u0435 \u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u043e.", "timestamp_created": 1514999345, "timestamp_updated": 1514999345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38955054": {"recommendationid": "38955054", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240026130", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 466, "last_played": 1515252919}, "language": "french", "review": "\"il est probablement le jeu le plus metal au quel j'ai jou\u00e9\" \n\n\nIl a un gameplay extr\u00eamement jouissif est agr\u00e8able de prise en mains, les combos sont divers et vari\u00e9s et demande un certain entra\u00eenement avant de devenir le \"dishwasher\" par excellence.\n\n\nLes graphismes ne rappelent pas moins des titres tel que Castle Crashers ou Alien Hominid mais gardant sa touche bien \u00e0 elle, en rappelant bien que le gore est bien plus omni pr\u00e9sent, il est probablement le jeu le plus metal au quel j'ai jou\u00e9 (que serait cette licence sans son c\u00f4ter gore bien \u00e0 lui :3)\n\n\nAu niveau de l'histoire, je trouve qu'il y a toujours cette subtilit\u00e9, \u00e7a avance vraiment \u00e0 son rythme, rythme au quel pas tout le monde pourrait crocher forcement ; en rappelant quand m\u00eame bien que ce jeu n'est pas le premier de sa licence !!\n\n\nah et bien sur la petite bande son metal que j'aime depuis les d\u00e9buts <33, et gros coup de coeur sur le retour enfin !!!!

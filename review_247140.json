Most levels \"feel\" right; some levels even have special gimmicks to them that make them unique. Even the free \"DLC\" wasn't compromised in terms of quality, with equal amounts of intricacy poured into them.\n\nPacing of the main portion of the game was just right. New levels weren't too difficult to unlock, but heart levels exist for an extra challenge for the player. And more masochistic people (like me) can aim to collect every single heart and 100% every single level.\n\nAnd now the community portion of the game. Arguably the best part of the game is the ability to share and create levels. Although the in-built auto-generation is a little... subpar... at best, the level editor proper has great tools for creatives to develop new levels to their favourite songs. And that's a great thing.\n\n[b]Overall, even several years after being first released, it's still fun to revisit every now and again, maybe replay a few older songs, maybe play new community-created content, maybe check out the new occasional update.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1514040331, "timestamp_updated": 1514040403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38577536": {"recommendationid": "38577536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082069220", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511506696}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub09c\uc790\uc5d0 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uae30\uc704\ud55c \uc815\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \ubab8\ubd80\ub9bc\uc744 \ub9ac\ub4ec\uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c \ud45c\ud604\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub9c9\uc544\ub0b4\uc57c\ud558\uace0, \uc800\ub4e4\uc740 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uc62c\uac83\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514035044, "timestamp_updated": 1514035044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38513645": {"recommendationid": "38513645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192440486", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514411824}, "language": "english", "review": "Great music game with good visuals.

This game will no doubt suit your taste in games. With the added feature of being able to input your own music, Soundodger+ definitely wasn't designed for the chill tunes. Throw an intense song in here and you'll have yourself a challenge. \n\nI personally think that the concept is kind of cool but overall as a game I don't see myself playing it too much. I prefer the type of music driven games that get you engrossed in the music but aren't too difficult. Concentrating too hard takes away from the experience for me.\n\nWith that said the game is simplistic and is run well. You can generate your own levels by inputting your music, it includes an editor and you can access community content, giving you lots to do and play.\n\nIf you like hectic game genres like bullet-hell and shoot-em-ups there is a chance you might enjoy this game.

Le joueur y incarne un point seul dans une ar\u00e8ne circulaire qui ne doit pas rentrer en contact avec les ennemis qui apparaissent en rythme. Tels des danseurs, les ennemis qui sont de simples triangles, effectuent leur ballet et ne sont pas affect\u00e9s par notre pr\u00e9sence. C'est donc \u00e0 nous de nous trouver une place au milieu de cette danse. Le disque sur lequel nous \u00e9voluons tourne au rythme de la musique et influence les mouvements des danseurs,il s\u2019arr\u00eate parfois et repart dans un sens diff\u00e9rent. Les danseurs apparaissent partout autour de nous. Ils se ressemblent tous mais parfois de diff\u00e9rents plus gros apparaissent, certains s\u2019int\u00e9resseront m\u00eame \u00e0 nous quelques instants nous obligeant \u00e0 rester mobile. \n\t\nLorsque l'on rentre maladroitement en contact avec un danseur, la musique se distord quelques instants puis reprend. Nous disposons alors d'une invincibilit\u00e9 de quelques secondes le temps de retrouver sa place dans la danse. La distorsion du son accompagn\u00e9e d'une perte de compl\u00e9tion globale sont les seules punitions inflig\u00e9es au joueur. Dans sounddodger il est impossible de mourir ou m\u00eame d'\u00e9chouer lors d'un niveau. La faible punitivit\u00e9 a pour principal objectif de ne pas irriter le joueur, SoundDodger est un jeu qui se veut relaxant, il est m\u00eame possible de d\u00e9sactiver la distorsion sonore lors des contacts permettant ainsi de pleinement profiter de la musique. \n\t\nCependant soundodger permet tout de m\u00eame au achiever de trouver leur compte en proposant de ralentir le musique le temps d'une esquive. Mais une utilisation intensive du Slow Motion rognera la compl\u00e9tion globale du niveau, compl\u00e9tion qui s\u2019affiche d\u2019ailleurs en temps r\u00e9el sur le disque. Elle sert \u00e0 d\u00e9bloquer les niveaux suivants et surtout \u00e0 encourager la rejouabilit\u00e9 pour atteindre le 100%.\n\n\n[b][i]Musique[/i][/b]\nLe pilier sur lequel repose un jeu musical est bien s\u00fbr sa musique. Le studio Bean a su choisir les bons morceaux pour apporter une ambiance relaxante. La plupart des  musiques ne comportent pas de voix mais plut\u00f4t un rythme distinctif et entra\u00eenant. Dans les compositeurs on peut retrouver beaucoup de monde du jeu vid\u00e9o ind\u00e9pendant comme Disasterpeace (l'homme derri\u00e8re l'OST de Fez et Hyper light Drifter) ou encore Danny Baranowsky  (l'homme derri\u00e8re la BO de Super  Meat Boy). M\u00eame si la bande son tourne principalement autour du jeu vid\u00e9o, elle r\u00e9ussit dans ses 20 morceaux \u00e0 \u00eatre vari\u00e9s. Cependant, la repr\u00e9sentation de nombreux genres diff\u00e9rents offre forc\u00e9ment des morceaux qui ne plairont pas \u00e0 tous les joueurs.  \n\t\nGros point fort du jeu : il est possible de s'improviser chor\u00e9graphe d'un niveau sur la musique que l'on veut. L'\u00e9diteur de niveaux est plut\u00f4t r\u00e9ussi et permet d'obtenir de bons r\u00e9sultats sans trop de probl\u00e8mes. Il n'existe malheureusement pas de workshop, pour partager ses creations et tester celles des autres il faut passer par le site cr\u00e9er par la communaut\u00e9 du jeu : http://soundodger-community.com/ . On y trouve de tout, aussi bien des niveaux surprenants et tr\u00e8s plaisants que des niveaux impossibles et brouillons. \n\n[b][i]Mais...[/i][/b]\nEn plus de l'absence de Workshop Sounddodger + poss\u00e8de quelques d\u00e9fauts comme la courbe de difficult\u00e9 qui vient nous frapper violemment, les derniers niveaux ne sont plus relaxants ou amusants. Les musiques sont les m\u00eames mais les danseurs sont beaucoup plus nombreux et la place que nous pouvions nous trouver pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment devient ici presque introuvable. Ces niveaux qui visent plus les joueurs cherchant le d\u00e9fis poss\u00e8dent parfois des c\u0153urs qu'il faudra attraper en d\u00e9but de danse et qu'il faudra garder avec soit tout le long du morceau. Pour ma part, j'ai le sentiment que leur pr\u00e9sence a simplement pour but d'augmenter la dur\u00e9e de vie assez courte du jeu. Je me suis retrouv\u00e9 \u00e0 refaire les premiers niveaux pour tenter le 100% ou par simple plaisir de r\u00e9entendre les musiques mais je n'ai pas retouch\u00e9 aux niveaux avanc\u00e9s qui sont trop frustrants. \n\n\n[b]Soundodger + a de grandes chances de plaire \u00e0 tout amateur de jeux musicaux, les musiques sont bonnes et le partage de niveaux lui apporte un contenu plus que cons\u00e9quent.

Easy moving by just having your character follow the mouse, which I really liked, however there is a lack of levels, and most require you to use DLC or at least unlock them by playing other levels and getting a better record on them.

Even though I do think the appearence is very nice and do not care about the\npreferred 30fps you play it with, there is a slight problem: There is no real stress or adrenaline-powering motion within 90% of the game. Let me explain it a bit further. \n\nMost songs are pretty long, which isn't a real problem itself, but how the game works is that you try to hit as few 'bullets' as possible. The player is really free to move however he wants to, because he is not asked to move to a specific point most of the time, but to the emptiness to hide from everything that is flying across the screen. Even though this may sound promising, in reality it makes it really dificult to know where the *** you have to go for the first hours you play the game. \n\nSecondly, the only moment you feel happy is when you're able to get 100% out of a level, while hitting things doesn't mean you die, it only means a little number goes down. I do really think the game would be better if you somehow could die and the level started again, while it makes the ending of the song more of an surprise and makes you more active trying to dodge all bullets. \n\nThe game looks like a very intens game, but when played, feels like the slowest thing you have ever done with a mouse, even though everything rushes past you. \n\nBut this is all just my opinion, I have a few friends who don't think this is a real problem and LOVE it. So, even though I do think playing this game for a long time isn't really what it's made for, it sure is fun at the beginning. \n\nSorry if my opinion isn't really build up well, first time doing this :p", "timestamp_created": 1488997504, "timestamp_updated": 1488997504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645205", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30376909": {"recommendationid": "30376909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242133188", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 25671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "last_played": 1521504382}, "language": "english", "review": "i would've never imagined that perfection was a Portmanteau... loved the game, the editor.\n There are some tricky bugs but, it's okay.

From classical music (Austin Wintory) and electronic ambiances (Louis Gorenfeld, Anoctave, and even the creator Bean himself !), with also 8-bit (Bill Kiley) and dubstep (Ghost Kollective, Mike Forst), the game shows numerous music styles, which is so rare in games nowadays. \n\nYou've also got the minimalistic design that fits so well, for example the vast choice of colours that gives the player a different view of the music he's playing. 140 and Super Hexagon are cool references for Soundodger+, there is even a level on a Chipzel's song (the composer of Super Hexagon). Disasterpeace, the composer from the game FEZ (which i cannot recommend playing enough) is also in the game, with a more rock-ish music. \n\nThe editor is very intuitive and unique, with infinite possibilities, though the autogen-mode would need some improvements (soundodger memes intensify). Many level creators are very talented, so you have a whole lot of levels waiting for you from the community !\n\nI will conclude this review by saying that Soundodger+ really gave me a new way to see music. If you're a fan of any sort of style, you will most likely love this game, by the approach it gives you on songs you're familiar to, or discover. It expends your culture and makes you understand that there is quality anywhere in music, not in just ONE single genre. The price is nice, the soundtrack's amazing and constantly evolving with the community levels, and the gameplay really changes from other rythms games like Melody Escape or Geometry Dash, because it really feels like you're dancing with the songs as you move through them.", "timestamp_created": 1483386974, "timestamp_updated": 1483387021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28817470": {"recommendationid": "28817470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317912338", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482984468}, "language": "english", "review": "not very fun", "timestamp_created": 1483076700, "timestamp_updated": 1483076700, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493421", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28737979": {"recommendationid": "28737979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197827881", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482907165}, "language": "english", "review": "better than the undertale battle system even though its similar/10", "timestamp_created": 1482897491, "timestamp_updated": 1482897491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28721822": {"recommendationid": "28721822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261029706", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 818, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485971241}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043c\u043e\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442, \u043f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0443 \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430, \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0451\u043b sounddodger... \u041d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 - \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f (\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0434) \u042f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 Geometry Dash, Super Hexagon, \u043d\u043e GD \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u0430 SH \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443. \u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u0412\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e, \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 100% \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043b\u0451\u0433\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438. \u0412 Super Hexagon \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u044f\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f, \u0437\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u043e, \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0435\u0451 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430. \u041d\u043e, \u0443\u0432\u044b, \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0438 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0451\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438.

You must dodge them on the inside of the circle. The main game includes 20 basic levels, 18 advanced levels, and 5 heart levels. Each of the advanced levels is an upgraded version of one of the basic levels with harder bullet patterns. Levels are unlocked in sequence by getting enough score on all the previous levels. Each advanced level also contains a heart bullet, which if collected acts as a free hit. Heart levels are unlocked by finishing the required number of advanced levels with your heart intact, and consist of two upgraded basic songs and three all-new songs. The game also comes with 12 DLC levels for free, which do not contribute to the main game. Finally, the game includes a level editor and auto-generation feature so that you can play levels from your own songs. \n\nPros:\n+The soundtrack is incredible. I listen to nearly all of the songs in it on a daily basis. They aren't just regular game-soundtrack songs, they're SONGS, from genres all across the spectrum. Dubstep, downbeat, chiptune, and classical are all there.\n+The main levels are very fun with a fairly consistent difficulty curve. \n+This game has several very talented creators who make great user levels and have been for a while, so there's no shortage of content. \n+The level editor itself is intuitive and fairly easy to use, although it has a few bugs and can lag. \n+There is a community for this game, and it isn't literal trash. It's actually pleasant to be in.\n\nCons:\n-It has a few game-breaking bugs, but if you're just playing the main game you're very unlikely to come across any of them.\n-The auto-generation feature doesn't make good levels, or even levels that sync up with the chosen song very well. Use it only if you want to hear a level from a specific song and don't want to bother making it yourself. \n-The difficulty markers are vague at best, and often non-indicative of the difficulty of the actual level. They are rarely very far off, though -- there are no 3-difficulty levels that should be marked 5-difficulty.\n\nTips for playing: \n=In the audio settings, there is an option for \"smooth listening.\" Turning it on means the level no longer speeds up when you get hit, although score is calculated the same. Turn this on, it's better. \n=The 60fps mode works and works well, but may mess up some levels with lots of rewind. I recommend not using it because you don't want to get used to it and then turn it off to fully experience the levels it doesn't like.\n=Your first level you make in the level editor will, invariably, be not very good. Don't be disheartened. \n\n\nOverall, the cons are very minor gripes and the pros vastly outweigh them.

The levels in this game all feel natural and everything that fires at you fires at the right time. Think of Beat Hazard but with actual structure to it. Nothing about this game feels out of place and everything flows naturally. \n\nThe level editor, coupled with the tutorials from the developer himself, are very simple to grasp and use. And with the community making so many pretty good levels, there's plenty of content that this game provides. The auto-generated levels are not so good, as it's not even close to being as deep as the core levels are, basing more on the loudness of the track over any indtrumentation going on.\n\nAnd of course, the soundtrack is great too! It has songs that I've had on since I bought the game and listen to regurlarly. The songs fit the game perfectly with their instrumentation and melodies and provide an amazing look when paired with the visuals.\n\nIn my short time with this game, I've had tons of fun with it.

yourself to see if you're into it.\nbut if you like listenening to music and trying to not suck at bullet hells, then you won't regret getting this game.\nhowever, make sure you have a good computer, because flash.\n\n\n\nalright, let's start off with the positive points:\n\n+ this game has an awesome OST, the default level are really well made AND the DLC levels are just as good if not better (and they're free!)\n\n+ this game has a slow-motion mechanic, which I personaly never think about using, but when you remember to use it, it can really help you\n\n+ the community is, in my opinion, one of the best out there: friendly, fun and helpful.\n\non top of that, Soundodger+ probably has my favorite level editor, it's really simple but it allows you to do so much when you wrap your head around it (which only takes about 2 hours, that's how simple it is)\n\n\nnow, for the negative points:\n\n- this game has bugs, mainly with the editor, but nothing too big, as a simple restart will fix them.\n\n- if you work on a level in the editor for too long, the game seems to slow down, as if something isn't being unloaded, which forces you to restart the game.\n\n- as with many other flash games, this game does not run well on low end computers at all.\n\n\n\nto sum this review up, this game will be a great addition to your library if you like music, bullet hells and making levels.\n\nFinal Rating: 8/10\n\n\nalso: if you're still unsure about whether or not you should get this game, the first game 'soundodger' can be played here:\nhttp://games.adultswim.com/soundodger-puzzle-online-game.html\n\nso if you want to know if you'll like it and if you can run it, then go check out this version!", "timestamp_created":

Everything about it is beautiful. The simple, yet challenging task of dodging bullets shot to the beat of the music really makes you tense up and get nervous with each pattern of bullets you make it through (though I highly doubt you'll make it every time.. c: Well, that's the case for me, at least..) The music is also stunning; an awesome collection of dubstep, electronic, and many other types of music... And if you don't like what they have to offer? Meh, there's just a level editor. It only allows ANY song you could ever think of to be turned into a bullet hell waltz. Or tango. Or break dance. ..I will say though, the way the bullets spawn is more of a creative process than something like Audiosurf where the notes are created based on the song itself. I'd compare Soundodger to Osu where the player places the bullets themselves in the level editor.. Just something to keep in mind.. ^^\n\nSoundodger+ is an awesome game, and a hard one at that too.. Not too punishing, but not too forgiving either. Plus, a level editor! Give it a try..

The editor is mainly the reason why this game got so much replayability. Would I have put currently nearing 400 hours in it if it wasn't for the editor? no I wouldn't.\n\nI can't stop you from reading the negative reviews, however, I think most of them don't say correct things, so keep that in mind. You like editors? You like difficult games? You like relaxing games? with the editor and custom levels, there's bound to be stuff for you, lots of it. You can literally use any music you like, not even copyrights can stop you there.\nI guess the only real question would be whether you like rhythm games and bullet hells in general.\nFor most people, I think this would be a game you could easily get into, so why not give it a shot? perhaps this is the game you've been looking for that you can just put tons of hours into.\n\nThe game is also a bit broken, sure, that's not enough to make me not enjoy the game, but it is really annoying when they do happen. There's lots of bugs, and it feels like Bean, the developer just doesn't care anymore. On top of that, the game doesn't have the best performance, this is because the game is made in flash. While you won't really notice the lag if you're just playing normally, if you have a bad PC, or get into making really big levels however, you will notice that.\nAnd please, do NOT use 60 FPS mode.\n\nAnd can't forget to mention, make sure to fully ignore autogen. if autogen is what you're buying the game for, and many have done this, that is bad choice. (edit: it's so bad because it does not sync correctly to the song at all, it just pays attention to how loud it is)\n\nI'd give it a 9 or 9.5/10, overall it's fun, editor adds replayability, but bugs and bad performance make it less good.", "timestamp_created": 1441647741, "timestamp_updated": 1511380778, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839215", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17931275": {"recommendationid": "17931275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041988940", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 83903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 276, "last_played": 1520959856}, "language": "english", "review": "ME:*Opens Game*\n\nME:*Plays Levels*\n\nME:\ud83d\udd0a\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udd0a\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udd0a\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udd0a\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udd0a\ud83c\udfb6 good beats go\u0c66\u0501 bEats\ud83d\udd0a thats \ud83c\udfb5 some good\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0abeats right\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0ath \ud83d\udd0a ere\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a right\ud83c\udfb5there \ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfb5if i do \u01bda\u04af so my sel\uff46 \ud83c\udfbc i say so \ud83c\udfbc thats what im talking about right there right there (chorus: \u02b3\u1da6\u1d4d\u02b0\u1d57 \u1d57\u02b0\u1d49\u02b3\u1d49) mMMMM\u13b7\u041c\ud83c\udfbc \ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a\u041dO0\u041e\u0b20\uff2fOO\uff2fO\u041e\u0b20\u0b20Oooo\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\u1d52\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0a \ud83c\udfbc \ud83d\udd0a\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb6\ud83c\udfb6\ud83d\udd0a\ud83d\udd0aGood beats\n\nEdit - User levers are pretty lit too", "timestamp_created": 1441646845, "timestamp_updated": 1479928189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.391713", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17907252": {"recommendationid": "17907252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066189283", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444622573}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing this game is really cathartic at times, and at other times it's just plain fun.

You play as a small circle, and it's your job to avoid a collision with the colorful array of cones and spheres thrown at you.\n\nIn typical bullet hell fashion, the lethal shapes you're set to avoid are often fired in pleasing patterns. Danmakus are like Dark Souls in that respect. They seem hard as hell, but once you know the patterns, it's merely a matter of conforming to the design to achieve success.\n\nThere are two (and a half) things, however, that I feel that make this game noteworthy when compared to already established bullet hells like Touhou. The first, and primary, is this is rhythm-based. No doubt, Touhou has some great music, but in Soundodger+, the curtain of fire you're meant to transverse is generated in a pattern synchronous with the music. If you're playing a DnB song, four-on-the-floor might as well describe the attack frequency. If you're doing a dub step track, when the song scratches out a rewind, you'll find the on-screen clutter suddenly reversing in sync - but it's still coming after you!\n\nThe second point that makes this title is its circular nature. Bullet hells are prefered to the usual SHMUPS because of the elaborate geometric designs of death exuding from the big guy of the stage. In Soudodger+, though, the stages are neither vertical- or horizontal-scrolling; they don't even scroll at all. Your whole arena is a circle with circles outside shooting at you in time with the music. Even though I'm unable to adequately describe it, having a static, circular arena lends a particularly unique feel to the genre. Because of its circular nature, instead of strafing through the colorful streams of bullets of typical danmakus, playing Soudodger+ feels like one designed with a Spirograph which I think adds a unique, if not terribly significant, difference to the staling genre.\n\nThe parenthetical \"half\" I mentioned previously is a more obvious characteristic of the game, and that's its general visual appeal. The design is minimalistic, and the colors are bright and bold (and I don't have to play as a loli). Apropos, while graphics of games are hardly paramount, I feel compelled to mention the game's 60 fps setting. The game looked just fine - great, even - with however many fps it was running by default, but when I turned on 60 fps mode... The difference was immediate and obvious.\n\nI only discussed the previous points first because this title is a game after all, but being a rhythm game, the quality of its soundtrack is inextricable from its quality as a game. To put it in an unimaginative adjective, it's awesome.  Broadly speaking, the OST is electronica (I guess?), but I see it as chiptunes crossed with drum and bass while listening to dubstep (but the tolerable kind; not the dial-up modem kind). It features songs from artists like Disasterpeace (Fez, BIt.Trip 2, It Follows), and a bunch of others I doubt you've heard of; I haven't. But that's inconsequential because, familiar or not, the tracks are wonderful. Of course there are a few I don't like (I Do, What I Want) or seem out of place (Lost Age), but that's unavoidable in music-based games. If it says anything, I've purchased the OST, and I've listened to it embarassingly more than I've played the game.\n\nThis game seems to me fairly niche, so I'd think that by now you'd know whether or not it's for you, but if you're still uncertain, Soundodger can be found as a game on Adult Swim's website if you care to check it out. I only gave it a few minutes try since I already had Soundodger+, but it seems to me to be just the same. Think of it as a demo, I guess.\n\nTL;DR Soundodger+ is an interesting rhythm-based twist on the small but well-defined bullet hell genre.

Not only did I just ruin my score, I also just got ear-wrecked.  Again, sounds petty, but it's sort of a big deal to me.  (I can likely mod a file for that or something?  But eh.)\n\nI love the game otherwise, seriously.  It's fun to swirl in circles and fluidly dance around a sweet pattern, and the light show it puts on even entertains others while they're watching.

I usually do not suffer from motion sickness in video games.  But the stark contrast of dark colors rotating rapidly, back and forth, on a white background was enough to make even my eyes and stomach cry mercy after little more than half an hour of play.  If you do suffer from motion sickness easily, than this is simply not the game for you.\n\nHowever, if you aren't subject to that, or play the game in small doses, then this is a pretty fun musical avoidance game.  Not unique, but well put together.  The music choices are solid.  It's easier with a mouse, but there's option to use a controller as well if you have one.  There's plenty of songs to unlock, and simply playing through a song once unlocks \"Zen mode\" where you can basically just have the song play through and not worry about being hit.\n\nOne other part that can be annoying for some: The game likes to mess with timing.  The things you're trying to dodge can slow down, or speed up, or even reverse, depending on the music.  This does make things more challenging.  It's somewhat frustrating, because an integral part of dodging is  being able to time things.  On the other hand, it does make for a bit more uniqueness in the game, and makes it just a little more challenging in those moments.\n\nPick the game up when it's on sale, but grab the soundtrack too - though it only has about half the songs.", "timestamp_created": 1429654508, "timestamp_updated": 1429655158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536741", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15461742": {"recommendationid": "15461742", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117195108", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456665974}, "language": "english", "review": "Just not my kind of game.

A breath of fresh air from all the triple A madness that goes on around the passing holidays. If you've ever played any arcade shooter, you already played soundodger. It's far from perfect and further from being original, but you will definitely forget about that once the music kicks in! You're a little circle that dodges the particles made by the music itself. \n\nYou dodge the sounds of music eminated by the likes of Austin Wintory, Mike Forst, and Disasterpeace! If you don't, the music will become mixed up and will transport ahead of your mistake, while keeping track of your percentages. You can also enter into a bullet-time like mode, but be warned; if you do it will affect your overall percentage! You can go a whole song in this mode, but you'll never complete with a 100% because of this. \n\nIt isn't without it's faults either, unfortunately! My main problem is it's repetitive nature, of course every game like this is going to be repetitive, but this is different. Like after a while (20 minutes I'd say) you're going to be bored with it. Not to mention the tracklist starts over when you hit the new levels! The game does have a level editor, which you can import songs and track it yourself, but the problem here is it's tedium. You'll be sitting at your desk, face smooshed into the screen, trying to get that one bullet into the perfect spot.\n\nIn reality, if you have time to kill, this game is right up your ally! It has a great soundtrack composed of some of the most talented personnel, ever. This game is meant to fill the gaps between shower and bed time or coffee and work! \n\nIs it worth your money?

I found the game suprisingly hard at first , compared to other similar games such as Beat Hazard, but soon got addicted to the challenging gameplay and lovely contrasting colours,and as the stage fires waves of bullets upon you, based upon the tempo, bpm and other characteristics of the song, you have to try and dodge them, and with each hit taken it fastforwards the song. However, on left click you have a 'time-slow' button that allows the player to slow the song down while retaining full movement, but at the cost of not having a multiplier bonus carry through the slow, in order to make the game a bit easier.

The games that get you immersed in the music and entwined with the beat. I could never get into audiosurf because the obstacles were on the beat, which meant you had to move out of time with the music - for me this breaks the definition of rhythm game.\n\nAnd I love bullet hell; played Perfect Cherry Blossom to death (which incidentally, had great music). So how does Soundodger+ stack up?\n\nWell, the bullet hell falls short at times. In a traditional shooter you have to focus on (a) dodging and (b) being in the right position to shoot your enemy(s). Here there's no shooting, just dodging -- which I have no problem with in theory, but in practice I found some levels had large periods of time where no bullets would come my way. I had a safe spot and with no other pressure to reposition I just sat still - which didn't make for very engaging gameplay. Other levels were better, including homing missiles to keep me on my toes.\n\nHow about the rhythm? Well, there's two things that [i]absolutely kill[/i] the rhythm of whatever song is playing. The first is the slow motion ability which you invoke via the left mouse button. This slows down the music aswell of course, and for me the effect simply doesn't work. The second occurs whenever you get hit - everything speeds up for a short time which has a hugely jarring effect on the music. I'm not suggesting death should be fun, but in a rhythm game the music [i]makes the game[/i], and if you kill my enjoyment of the music you kill my enjoyment of the game. Fortunately you can simply avoid activating slow motion, and there's an option (\"Easy listening\") to disable the speedup when you get hit. So while I don't think these are worthwhile features, I don't hold them against the game as a whole.\n\nSoundodger does a pretty good job of matching the song's energy, both in pre-made levels and the auto-generated mode (when you plug your own music in). But it suffers from the same issue I had with audiosurf - it doesn't encourage me to move [i]with[/i] the beat, or draw me into the music. Yes the level is generated from the music, but the gameplay \nthat emerges is on a totally different beat. As such I can't recommend it as a rhythm game.", "timestamp_created": 1413304742, "timestamp_updated": 1413304742, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646371", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12489189": {"recommendationid": "12489189", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990826273", "num_games_owned": 862, "num_reviews": 96, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413390757}, "language": "english", "review": "A bit funny.

Likely.\n\nSoundodger+ is a simple, yet elegant rhythm game that has nothing to do with the host of Daily Byte, and requires you to dodge a small variety of projectiles that shoot relatively to the beat of the music. The mechanics are extremely simple, dodge bullets with your mouse until the song ends. It obviously borrows from shmups, but don't let the term \"bullet hell\" scare you here: Lives are unlimited and you have a seemingly infinity slow mo (at the detriment of your final score). The less you are hit, the higher your percentage score is. That's practically it, though, the bullets shot from outside of the arena by generators range in angle, size, speed and heat-seeking ability while those said generators rotate around the arena. It comes with a decent handful of tracks, though the most fun and interesting art is to see how the auto-gen mode uses your own MP3 to thrown bullets at you.\n\nThere are also so extra user levels and you can create your own levels and bullet outputs to your music with a levle editor.\n\nThat's pretty much all to say about Soundodger+. Mouse control is smooth, vector graphics are stylized and look great when you change the settings to 60fps with \"pretty\" fullscreen settings. Soundodger+ is a carthartic and interesting way to experience your music. The game is worth of buy if this all sounds interesting to you. It isn't expensive, though some players may not find their value if they don't intend to play all the included songs for completion, or expect to get alot of time out of it with their own music.", "timestamp_created": 1407913490, "timestamp_updated": 1407913490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11672460": {"recommendationid": "11672460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059302994", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 179, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486621355}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc624\ub798 \ud560 \ub9cc\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc6b0\uc2a4\ub85c \ud558\uba74 \ub108\ubb34 \uc27d\uace0 \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub85c \ud558\uba74 \ub108\ubb34 \uc5b4\ub835\uace0 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uc548\ud558\ub294\uac8c \ub098\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1407832285, "timestamp_updated": 1407832285, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449438", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11497960": {"recommendationid": "11497960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145497614", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407356198}, "language": "french", "review": "bon petit jeu musical pos\u00e9e mais a certaiment moment joue avec nos r\u00e9flexe.\nsympas pour un jeu ind\u00e9pendant.", "timestamp_created": 1406845946, "timestamp_updated": 1406845946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11406465": {"recommendationid": "11406465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053157046", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471126140}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich finde das Spiel schon ziemlich unterhaltend f\u00fcr zwischendurch.

A music-based bullet hell that scores you based on how perfect you can avoid [i]sound[/i].\n\nThe main objective, as aforementioned, is to be perfect at avoiding [i]sound[/i]--bullets that spawn into the playing field and follow a particular rhythm and beat of the track. There are four different bullets: linears, bubbles, homers, and hearts. In game, the hearts unlock a new track that can be played as well if you seek to unlock special achievements.\n\n[b]Soundodger+[/b] includes user levels, an editor, and auto-gen mode (creates a randomized level with whatever song selected). By default, there are six premade stages, five that, like the advanced stages, have the heart bullet that can help unlock the same bonus tracks.\n\n[h1]Review[/h1]\n[b]The Good[/b]\nI'm finding myself enjoying the editor a lot, using my favorite songs to craft nice and partially fancy levels. And after achieving perfection with the standard songs, unlocking the advanced stages as well as a couple heart stages, I'm in a constant liking of this game. A nice time-killing on a boring day. I have yet to officially unlock all hearts and getting 100% score on more advanced and premade user levels.\n\n[b]The Bad[/b]\nPart of me wish there were at least another mode to this game, possibly an alternative, where the game rates how well you can collect specific bullets. Auto-gen, too, isn't very good in creating stages either, but there must be a way they're done. I don't know what more to put here...\n\n[h1]Conclusing Comments[/h1]\nSoundodger is a pretty amazing game with all it already has. Plus, this game is accompanied with a worthwhile soundtrack that I fell in love with the more I kept playing those particular stages. Hopefully, I'll share some of my created stages with the public later on...\n\n--Hermix", "timestamp_created": 1404807498, "timestamp_updated": 1470984008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11102045": {"recommendationid": "11102045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098002273", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495898488}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uba58\ud0c8\ud68c\ubcf5\ub418\ub294 \uac8c\uc784 \u3147\u3147..", "timestamp_created": 1404657837, "timestamp_updated": 1404657837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11048529": {"recommendationid": "11048529", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974002194", "num_games_owned": 1355, "num_reviews": 206, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452727010}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu vraiment superbe, agr\u00e9able \u00e0 l'\u0153il mais surtout les morceaux s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s sont excellents et nombreux.

First of all it claims that it's a Music game. Yeah it is... kinda.\nThe layouts of the levels are made as if you are playing against the song but the gameplay needs no understanding of the rythm or listening when you have to do something. You just dodge what the song is throwing at you. Every tone is one \"bullet\" that tries to hit you. And this is really well done. You feel like the song is your enemy. BUT the game should actually be called Soundpatternlearner+. The first levels are really fun and you feel like you need skill to beat the song. But when the game starts throwing hundreds of \"bullets\" at you there is no way that you dodge a wave at the first try. It's just learning patterns and trial and error. Or maybe I just suck at reacting :D. BUT the presentation of the game is brilliant. The visuals look so simple but they are pleasing to the eyes like the style of an Edmund McMillen(IndieGod :D). And the music is fucking amazing. If you like electronic music this is your heaven. Chiptune, House, Dupstep this game has everything you're looking for in the sound department.\nSo the conlusion is:\nPresentation: yes\nGameplay: No\nOh yeah this game also has an auto-gen mode where the game genarates a level to a mp3 file you give it, which is awesome.\nJust buy it because of the music it's worth it :DDD\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1395953875, "timestamp_updated": 1409600830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9506194": {"recommendationid": "9506194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077945902", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396214775}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the music.

Slow down and half speed modes make those nasty spots a little easier, but only just a little.  Though things slow down, the bullet keep appearing, so there is more stuff on the screen to avoid.  Use it sparingly, as the game itself recommends.  This game plays with the turntable aspect nicely too, even making the pieces move backward when the music slows and starts reversing.  Watch out :)\n\nAnother nice feature is that though you have to unlock newer levels, it doesn't make it difficult to do so.  Getting scores in the 80%+ range on each level locks another level or two.  Getting 80% is actually pretty easy to do, even if you get hit one or two times.  But, you'll probably want to replay most levels until you get the 100%.  Also, complete level editor - make your own, with your own music.\n\nControls? Pick your poison:  WASD, mouse and game controller all supported.\n\nIf you like bullet hell games, mixed with a variety of music (mostly trance/dance/chiptunes/etc), this is well worth buying.

Este vorba despre fratele mai mare al cunoscutului joc freeware Sounddodger, in care va trebui sa misti pe ritmul muzicii si sa eviti notele miscatoare, care vin inspre tine, in functie de ritmul piesei ascultate. Multumita Adult Swim Games, am avut posibilitatea de a testa acest nou joc cu cateva zile inainte de lansarea oficiala si am adunat deja cateva ore bune in el, asa ca e timpul sa vorbim putin despre el.\n\nIdeea din Soundodger+ este ca, indiferent cat de relaxanta pare o piesa, notele pot fi daunatoare pentru integritatea ta, cel putin in joc. Conceptul este unic, implementarea simpla, dar eficienta. Practic, tu controlezi o minge pe ecran, iar in functie de muzica pe care o asculti, din toate partile esti atacat de obiecte pe care trebuie sa le eviti. In unele cazuri va fi extrem de greu, dar ai posibilitatea de a activa modul slow motion si a scapa nevatamat. Ai trei tipuri de obiecte care vor sa te elimine: triunghiuri, care nu fac altceva decat sa mearga in linie dreapta cand sunt lansate, dar pot develi aglomerate rapid si, de multe ori, ele isi atu=ing pana la urma tinta, patrate, care alearga dupa tine si sfere mari, care, din nou merg in linie dreapta, dar ocupa o mare parte din suprafata disponibila, care este, de fapt, ca un disc de muzica. Tot ce trebuie sa faci este sa incerci sa rezisti pana la sfarsitul melodiei si sa reusesti asta fara sa fi atins de prea multe ori. Scorul se genereaza in procente, insa pentru a atinge Realizarile Steam va trebui sa te perfectionezi si sa incerci sa reusesti nivelele la 100% fara a folosi slow-motion.\n\nSoundodger+ beneficiaza de 23 de piese incluse, cu 11 mai mult decat varianta gratuita,  iar printre artisti se numara nume consacrate in industria jocurilor precum Disasterpeace (FEZ, Runner2), Danny Baranowsky (The Binding of Isaac) si multi altii. Este si normal ca un astfel de joc sa se invarta practic in jurul muzicii, iar daca aceasta baza esentiala nu este sufiecient de buna, este sortit esecului. Aici este punctul central al jocului, caci cei de la Studion Bean au inteles ca fiecare persoana are stiluri diferite de muzica preferate si au reusit sa adauge un element ce va multumi pe toata lumea. Este vorba despre editorul de nivele si generarea automata a acestora in functie de muzica disponibila pe calculator.\n\nModul clasic de a juca incepe usor, si iti da posibilitatea sa inveti dinamica jocului. Te vei misca cu mouse-ul sau controllerul, pentru ca Soundodger+ are suport complet pentru acesta si poti folosi modul slow-motion pentru a scapa din situatii dificile, utilizand butonul mouse-ului. Daca esti atins, toate piesele in miscare prind viteza si se duc spre margine pentru a-ti da posibilitatea de a reveni linistit la joc. Termini melodia si mergi mai departe. Punctajul acumulat iti deblocheaza melodii noi, care creaza automat nivele mai dificile. Ce mi-a placut mie cel mai mult la modul de joc clasic, a fost armonia cu care muzica interna a jocului se sincronizeaza cu gameplay-ul, lucru de care iti dai seama cand incarci melodiile tale din calculator. Aici am realizat cata munca a fost depusa in spatele acestui proiect si de ce a avut un succes urias la PAX 2013, unde a concurat cu jocuri care pareau superioare din toate punctele de vedere.\n\nExista si 5 nivele bonus care sunt greu de accesat, ceea ce face acest joc competitiv. practic, pentru a le putea juca trebuie sa culegi o inimioara, pe care o primesti in nivele superioare si care te ajuta sa primesti o lovitura fara a fi afectat. Totusi, daca esti atins, aceasta dispare, iar pentru a debloca u nastfel de nivel bonus, trebuie sa termini runda la 100% si fara a pierde acea inimioara, lucru extrem de greu de realizat.\n\nAm vorbit despre nivelul de joc clasic, sa trecem acum la partea cea mai interesanta: nivelele generate de catre jucator. Editorul de niveluri nu este foarte simplu de folosit, Studion Bean a pus la dispozitia utilizatorilor un set de tutoriale, dar doar cei care au cunostinte de muzica se vor apuca sa creeze nivelu lde la zero. Pentru noi restul, muritorii de rand, exista insa generarea automata de nivele. Mi-am dorit sa o incerc si am ramas uimit. Am facut chiar si competitii aici, incercand genuri variate de muzica, de la house la hip-hop, de la rock la manele, de la simfonii la dubstep. Avem doua videoclipuri inregistrate care surprind \u201cabilitatile\u201d noastre cu aceste melodii.\n\nPrimul astfel de video cuprinde urmatoarele melodii:\n\nBirdy Nam Nam \u2013 Goin In (Skrillex Goin Down Mix)\nGrasu XXL \u2013 Turbofin\nLove headshot-INS\n\n[url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAZ0NgoRqQA]Youtube Video[/url]\n\nLa la doilea ne-am facut de cap:\n\nB.U.G. Mafia \u2013 40 Kmh (feat.

The colors and contrast in the game is very colorful and pretty. The selections of songs they have vary from dubstep, to slower electronic music, to classical.

The game is basically a bullet hell dodgeball and as you finish each song, the more perecent you are closer to finidhing the song, the more it goes to unlocking more songs to play.The hitboxes on the \"bullets\" are only at the tips to give you more flexibility in your movements and allows for really tight dodges between two bullets. Although the selected music from the game is really nicely paced and progressively gets more challenging, the music you can load in yourself is a mixed bag of challenges depending on the song you decide to play. Most music you pick, unless it is a slow paced song, will have you mutilate the song by unsuccessfully dodging the unecessary amount of projectiles being flown at you as the game really doesn't keep a good flow to the songs you pick and analyze.

There are many edge-of-your-seat moments where focus and concentration are key. This may not be apparent from the first few levels or trailer; the game starts off slow, easing you into the later levels with simplified versions of the patterns; it feels a little too slow moving in, and you need to beat ~10 of these levels before the advanced levels can be played. This is my only real gripe though; the level of polish and love put into the later levels is evident in spades. (Look for advanced levels indicated by a black background.)\n\nThe quality of music is also exceptional. If you peruse the Indie section of Steam often, there's a good chance that you'll recognize some of the artists; Disasterpeace, Sonic (also known as Jasper Byrne, who did all of Lone Survivor [music too]), Austin Wintory, Danny Baranowsky, Lifeformed, and Bill Kiley. That's not to say that the others not mentioned are bad; far from it. You may recognize Ghost Kollective, but other names such as Mike Forst, D. WIGHT, Anoctave and Bean proved to be exceptional with the tracks they provided.\n\nNext, the editor. Soundodger+ has plenty of very interesting mechanics; you can slow down and invert time, fill the screen with bullets, and control the movement of the outside \"enemies.\" All of this can be accessed and used in the editor. Though initially appearing dense and convoluted, the editor makes a ton more sense after viewing the available online tutorials, and it can be a blast not only to play finished levels, but also to watch said levels as well. Be warned, Soundodger+ only accepts tracks encoded at 44.1 kHz; I ran into the problem of not being able to use some tracks I wanted to because of this.\n\nFinally, the Auto-Gen mode. I put this at the bottom because it's easily the weakest part of Soundodger+. Levels are typically created on a scale of how loud the music is, similar to Audiosurf. If you don't have loud tracks, you'll end up with a level that's too easy, on the scale of the early campaign levels. The levels generated often don't make sense either; the game creates a pattern only when there's a spike in the noise, causing bullets to fire off at seemingly random times. And again, the Auto-Gen mode only works for songs encoded at 44.1 kHz, same as the editor.\n\nTL;DR: Soundodger+ is highly recommended, especially if you're looking for something in the vein of Bit.Trip, Audiosurf, Sound Shapes or 140.

A premissa inicial, como dever\u00e3o estar a pensar, n\u00e3o \u00e9 extasiante, mas a sua execu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 surpreendentemente exemplar, incluindo um editor de n\u00edveis muito completo, um gerador autom\u00e1tico de part\u00edculas para quando queremos escolher uma m\u00fasica da nossa biblioteca e a possibilidade de abrandar o tempo para sobreviver em situa\u00e7\u00f5es mais sufocantes.\nPerante um g\u00e9nero em que a m\u00fasica \u00e9 o motor de todos os processos, fiquei apenas desapontado com a falta de variedade de estilos. Foi obviamente uma decis\u00e3o consciente j\u00e1 que a m\u00fasica utilizada vai desde a electr\u00f3nica at\u00e9 \u00e0 electr\u00f3nica, independentemente dos subg\u00e9neros que engloba dentro desse universo. Apesar de ser uma boa selec\u00e7\u00e3o de faixas, gostaria de testar a minha per\u00edcia com, por exemplo, m\u00fasica cl\u00e1ssica, jazz, rock ou mesmo folk, e sentir que cada g\u00e9nero teria a sua pr\u00f3pria consequ\u00eancia gr\u00e1fica e f\u00edsica. Ora, para tipos caretas como eu, o jogo oferece a op\u00e7\u00e3o de abrir uma faixa \u00e0 nossa escolha e jog\u00e1-la, o que o valoriza muito. No entanto, o gerador autom\u00e1tico de part\u00edculas n\u00e3o \u00e9 eficaz nem interessante o suficiente para executar as nossas faixas, tornando-as muito f\u00e1ceis e mon\u00f3tonas do ponto de vista da jogabilidade.

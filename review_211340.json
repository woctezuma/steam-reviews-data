The characters are much more complex that they initially appear, even the obvious expies have unique personalities and motivations of their own that make them stand out.\n\nThe cast is suprisingly fleshed out, with minor background characters clearly having their own stories playing out where you can't see, with defined personalities and relationships being shown quietly. It makes the game much more engaging and immersive.\n\nThe only complaint I would have is that the game is so SHORT. It takes place during a single school year, and it can move quite quickly. There are few excuses to use the multitude of spells you can learn, and some of the pacing seems a bit rushed. There are questions about families and lore that are left unanswered and leave you trying to fill in gaps yourself.\n\nWhile not a bad thing persay, the game could perhaps benefit from including routes based on the side characters that are yet unappreciated, extra events and club options, and being played out over the four years your character is meant to be attending the school for.\n\n[b]TL;DR: Solid game, great characters, excellent writing, but feels perpetually unfinished and too short.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1520783467, "timestamp_updated": 1520783467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40456338": {"recommendationid": "40456338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018910266", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519805631}, "language": "english", "review": "its very fun but could be longer, unfortunatly the game ends after one year out of 4 I think, I thought its going to be a long adventure but its very short.... so my feelings are mixed about this game", "timestamp_created": 1519805984, "timestamp_updated": 1519805984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40411141": {"recommendationid": "40411141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187759587", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485053999}, "language": "english", "review": "LOOVE THIS GAME!", "timestamp_created": 1519639246, "timestamp_updated": 1519639246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40295357": {"recommendationid": "40295357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017321912", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 693, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519289118}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a grown up bearded guy over 30 yo.

Everything that came before seems meaningless, your time wasted.

The one plot point of significance that I encountered felt like a prelude to something more, but then the game ended.\n\nMaybe I missed something fundamental. Maybe I was just unlucky and I stumbled into the most boring and restrictive route.  But \"stumbled\" is the operative word, because you cannot chase plot threads of your own volition. You cannot freely direct the protagonist to go somewhere or talk to someone. You can only hope your limited, infrequent decisions will lead to greater opportunities.\n\nAt best [i]Magical Diary[/i] is a short, mostly-directionless slice-of-life distraction with the trappings of a Harry Potter novel.

It\u2019s a Harry Potter-inspired tale of a female freshman student at a magic academy. As a \u201cwildseed\u201d, a mage born from non-magic family, she struggles to understand and adapt to an unfamiliar reality, with its pretty strict rules and unpredictable challenges. During her first year, she may succeed or fail as a mage, but also build various relationships with other students and professors at the school.[/b]\n\nThe game\u2019s cute, colourful artstyle might be misleading, as it tells a really well-crafted story with decent amounts of depth and multiple, interesting routes. In some parts it seriously surprised me with its sober tone and serious character development. It was mostly cheerful, but didn\u2019t avoid some dark themes and drama - and what\u2019s most important, none of those elements ever felt out of place. Some routes were more relaxed than others, but all had a decent mix of happy and sad moments, making you emotionally engaged and interested in what\u2019s going to happen next.\n\nThe game has a fairly strong romance element, but doesn\u2019t focus on it exclusively and most story paths can end with you making friends and building bonds rather than finding love. As it is with most games of this kind, sometimes criteria for a successful romance path are rather unclear and you\u2019ll need multiple tries to find an optimal approach to various situations. It creates quite a lot of replayability, while for the most part the endings you get without actively trying to screw yourself over are also satisfying and positive.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing to explore alternative paths after the first playthrough, [b]the game offers around 10 hours of content. While it\u2019s not a masterpiece, the mechanics it offers (learning spells, using them to pass exams, balancing your skills and stats while studying) are satisfying and the story is surprisingly good, better than in many \u201cpure\u201d VNs I\u2019ve played. I think it should prove an enjoyable experience for most players, even those normally not interested in visual novels \u2013 you just shouldn\u2019t judge it on visuals alone. Just like with Long Like the Queen, there\u2019s a lot of depth and fresh ideas under that cute, brightly colored surface.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1505947511, "timestamp_updated": 1506076321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608355", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35073779": {"recommendationid": "35073779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080948394", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505859065}, "language": "english", "review": "I actually found this game quite a while ago and I was quite engrossed into it for a little while. It would stay as a good memory if \"free\" version back in the days wasn't uncrackable. It stopped you from playing in the middle. Because of that, I simply forgot about it till I noticed it again randomly on Steam. I think I was searching for Arcemagia alternatives.\n\nOf course I bought it. It is one of those games that arent that good, but they still feel heartfelt. I guess if I would have to give it a score it would be 7 or 8 out of 10.\n\nSo game by itself is good, I like dungeons, merit school system, lots of characters, lots of event, entire year to play.

It eventually pushes you into \"dating simulation\", but it feels more like a feature, you get to pick who if who would you like to be with at the end of a year.

I love the way Academagia is made. I was astonished by its complexity, build and interconnectivity and tons of people, events and lore where you can do more than one event per day. Which get into the shadow of a random bug that prevents you from playing half way through after days of playtime (pre-steam version). Or new eyehurting interface (steam/gog version).\n\nHope both games inspire more of a kind :).

Have an adventure? Get kicked out? The choice is yours. The game mechanics are fun and the dungeon puzzles that come up at intervals do a nice job of switching things up.\n\nIt's one of my favourite games, but I also realise that it is one of those cases where people tend to be really divided.

It's fairly easy to fail the first exam, simply because you studied the wrong thing. But later on the magic system really shines.

You have a cast of characters, decisions to make about them, some time-management mechanics, and occasional dungeon/exams.\nThe characters aren't bad, nor are they too original. Your teachers are Fanon Snape and the child of Dumbledore and Ms. Frizzle; your roommates are a tomboy and a nerd; you have the misunderstood bad boy and the extroverted nice girl and the weird kid and the arrogant kid and so on. They're not completely one-dimensional, but you don\u2019t see much of any character\u2019s depths without actively pursuing their route. If you do so, they can be interesting (though not exceptional).\nThe time management is also simple. You can spend weekdays in one of five classes to improve your magic skills, in a couple of extracurriculars to improve your Smarts and Strength, or sleeping in to reduce the stress accumulated in other activities. Increasing your magic skill can teach you new spells; Smarts and Strength improve your mana and health points in dungeons. Special events may go along with classes, but they usually don't. On Saturday, you can choose to go to the mall (to slightly reduce stress or purchase items) or study (increasing your Smarts and possibly magic skills at the expense of Stress), assuming that you don't have detention.\nThe dungeons (which serve as your exams) are the weakest aspect of the game. While the goal is always well-explained, how the tools you have at your disposal relate to it is not. You will likely learn dozens of spells by the end of the game, but only a few of them will ever be useful during exams. (Protip: Teleport Other and Breeze both let you solve multiple dungeons with ease. Also, Teleport Other is the last useful blue spell.) Between the often-unclear solutions, the horrible controls, and the useless spell bloat, dungeons are a pain to slog through\u2014which is even more disappointing when you realize that all of that time management is based entirely around boosting your stats to tackle dungeons! Worst of all, the dungeons have limited replay value; once you\u2019ve found one easy solution, it\u2019s boring to go through again, even if you look for another easy solution.\nThis lack of replay value is, to a lesser extent, present in the rest of the game. I have played the game through four times, going through the main five romance/friendship arcs (though for various reasons, I could only complete one of them). Each time, I found the new material interesting, while the parts I had already seen were usually. There is a fast-forward option to skip through professor speeches and the like, but it doesn\u2019t let you skip through minor choices, class selection, or\u2014worst of all\u2014dungeons.\n\nThe writing of a visual novel is as critical to the experience as the controls or aesthetics of most other genres of game. I have no particular complaints about the writing; none of it jumped out at me as bad and even mediocrity was rare, but none of it seemed exceptionally good. The dialogue conveys character and emotion well, establishing characters and scenes efficiently, aided by the music and visuals. As to those, while neither was exceptional enough to be worth buying the game for, they do their respective jobs more than effectively. The music already started to grow a bit repetitive by the end of my first play session, and eventually starts to get irritating (especially if it gets stuck in your head). The aesthetics support the game's lighthearted tone, though they are not especially memorable or original.\nThe pacing of the game is excellent, aside from the exams thrown in at almost random points. The minimal time-management mechanics reduce downtime between story beats, and those story beats never overstayed their welcome. New characters, plot elements, and so on are introduced at a reasonable rate. There are some hiccups, particularly if you don\u2019t follow a single specific path, but it works well overall.\n\nThe game's largest issues come from their management of player expectations. At the beginning of the game, you design your character's appearance and even name her, suggesting that the character is primarily an avatar for the player\u2026yet she seems to have a predetermined personality, with remarkably little player input. This would not be much of an issue if the player had more agency in her future, but unfortunately the game is highly linear. You are given choices in individual events, such as an initiation party or preparations for a minor dance, but there is no apparent impact on anything beyond that scene. (This only changes on further playthroughs, and only because you already know how things go.)\nAnd let's get to that dance. This is where player expectations, discipline, and that achievement I received all come together. The dance is an event where spirits and magicians dance together. One of the first spells you are likely to learn in the game lets you see spirits, and the game gives you the option to use it, specifically mentioning that she has never actually seen a spirit before and wants to do so. Naturally sharing her curiosity, I chose that option.\nMy character felt a pain in the back of her eyeballs, blacked out, and woke up outside the gymnasium with the two professors over her. The profs chastised her for her foolishness and assigned her demerits and detention BEFORE explaining what happened. Apparently, the spirits react poorly to being seen. (I'm paraphrasing.) There was literally no indication of any of this, besides a vague, missable warning from a character you have reason to distrust. And no, neither of the teachers told either you the player or your character about this danger\u2014she was supposed to know about it on her own. Did I mention that she's the local equivalent of a Muggleborn wizard, meaning that she has no knowledge of the magical world beyond what her teachers teach and rumors her friends spread?\nBut it gets more irritating\u2014yes, more irritating than being punished for not knowing something the game went out of its way to make sure you didn\u2019t know even though your character really should have been warned. There's an achievement called Naughty for getting detention. Reasonable. However, this was the first time I had served detention, and it's the first detention new players are likely to stumble into. So I had the game call me Naughty for events which felt entirely out of control for both me and my character. Well, at least we were on the same page.\nThis wouldn't have been so bad if I had the option to call the teachers out on their crap\u2026but I had no such option, nor does the possibility occur to the protagonist to be dismissed, because the developers didn't think through their player expectations and reactions properly. Perhaps I shouldn't read this much into it, but it seems like the developers wrote options which made sense to them, without asking others for their input on what options they wish they had had. It was a useful insight into video game development, should I ever get around to making that game I've been thinking of for a while, but it was a frustrating experience. More frustrating than receiving an achievement should be, that's certain.\nOnce you know more about the game, carrying in knowledge from the wiki or previous playthroughs or what-have-you, this problem is reduced, but the player should NEVER need to metagame just to understand the consequences of their choices. Doing otherwise is just plain bad game design.\n\nIn summary: Magical Diary is, from an \"objective\" standpoint, good. It was made with care and skill in nearly every area, and for the most part is enjoyable (aside from the dungeons, which probably could have been removed or abstracted without losing anything of substance). There are several areas in which it could be improved, even outside the dungeons, but it is still probably worth your time.\nP.S.

It's an indie visual novel and sometimes dating sim (romance routes are optional and the game can be finished without dating anyone) that apes Harry Potter in an anime-influenced art style. At face value, this can seem like an amateur game, filled with predictably trope-laden characters. You are a teenage girl and a wild seed (a magical person born to a non-magical family), starting their first year at a magical school for witches and wizards. You're automatically assigned Horse Hall, which is roughly analogous to Gryffindor (although the traits valued are a little different, given that there's only three houses), and your roomates, Virginia and Ellen, are your equivalents of Ron and Hermione. That's really where the similarities end, although Professor Grabiner clearly refers back to those fanfiction versions of Professor Snape.\n\nYour basic goal is to learn enough magical spells (across five different categories, each associated with a colour, and learnt by attending classes on your weekly schedule) to pass your exams and advanced to your second year. Gameplay takes place across a year, with events being triggered on certain days of the week, if you've met the criteria necessary to trigger them. This is where the game's replay value comes in: as with most visual novels, you won't be able to run every path in one playthrough, particularly if you're going for the achievements. This can get a little tedious after a while--most of the romantic routes don't really trigger properly until after Christmas, so you'll spend the first four months of the game going through similar motions on each playthrough. On the other hand, you can prioritise different magic skills on each runthrough, and the exams have various solutions to them that you can have fun figuring out different ways of tackling the puzzle.\n\nMy only real complaint about Magical Diary is that it's never gotten the sequel it needs, which is to say that no matter what path you take, you'll always be a little frustrated about the game's lore and the rules the school enforces. As a wild seed, you're understandably a stranger to the magical world; while other characters, especially Virginia, will flesh out some of that knowledge, there's a lot that invariably never gets discussed. This may also just be my interpretation, but there's routes where I would frequently get the impression that the school raises its students in an almost cult-like manner, telling them not to do certain things (such as mixing science with magic) but without giving them a good explanation of why, and then forcefully wiping their memory when they disobey. I would love to know more about that, but without a sequel--and I'd love to see one even if it's just following your character through the rest of their time at the school--we'll never get that information.\n\nDespite that, I do think the game is a lot of fun, and the characters are fleshed out. While they may seem generic at first, pursuing their routes reveals hidden depths that really brings them to life. Your character customation options are a little limited, but I do appreciate the ability to choose from a range of skin colours and between two different body types. No matter what it looks like, I think the developers put a lot of thought and effort into the game, and it really shines through in the characters.", "timestamp_created": 1499346156, "timestamp_updated": 1499346156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575343", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33218773": {"recommendationid": "33218773", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996890063", "num_games_owned": 243, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499240537}, "language": "english", "review": "Three more years!

Definitely recommend!  I played for 5 hours straight and then immediately finished it up the next day.  \n\nThe star of this game is the wonderful, witty writing, which I thought was very true to being inside a girl's head.  It made even the most meaningless of details somehow feel meaningful.  Many times throughout the game I marveled at how involved I felt.  The music, effects, transitions, and backgrounds-- while not the greatest quality-- somehow worked together so well and hit all the right notes for me.  I laughed to myself so many times due to the crazy and unexpected events that happen throughout the story.  And the DRAMA!  It was like living inside a CW show, in a good way.   \n\nLoved the gameplay mechanics-- so refreshing to find a quality story-based game that actually makes you use your brain and doesn't hinge on combat.  I wish I could find more games like this!  The system of learning spells and getting to use them in the exam dungeons to solve puzzles was amazing.  Wish there had been way more of these exam/puzzles though-- it felt like there weren't nearly enough of them!\n\nThe choices throughout the game felt very meaningful, and you can tell it really changes the story depending on what you say/do, how well you fare in the dungeons, and which stats you focus on.  I'm very tempted to do a second play through to see what new paths I can find!\n\nIn summation, this game is amazing.  Please make sequels.

This isn't so much a problem, but she isn't fleshed out for you in the beginning, so you will continue to learn things about her that you probably should have known from the start all the way through.\n\nCustomization is pretty good, has a fair amount of choices and the inclusion of two different body types was great!\n\nThe music was absolutely perfect for the game, each song fit the mood of the scene it was in, and I could usually guess which characters were going to appear depending on the song.\n\nThe choices can be a little odd. If, for example, you have choices A and B, and in B you would meet a new person/group of people, but you choose A and don't meet them, the game still continues on slinging their names around as if you know who they are, despite never having met them before. It makes it all feel very one demensional. \n\nThe art is charming, very bright and cute, but (and this is admittedly nitpicky) the character's facial expressions don't always fit the mood they're trying to portray, and that's not always a bit deal, until you're unsure as to why they look perfectly calm, despite the music and text telling you they're really angry. \n\nAll in all, this game is okay.

You play as a sixteen-year-old girl of your own design (with the default name Mary Sue. Heh.) who goes to a school for wizards and witches. The game is very aware that this sounds a lot like Harry Potter, and not only makes few attempts to keep the player from making comparisons, it even takes a few playful jabs at itself with that punchline (for example; there is a student who inexplicably looks exactly like Harry Potter himself. He acts nothing like him and isn't important to the story at all.). \n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty simple. It's mostly a visual novel, with some light RPG elements (you take classes to raise your stats in various schools of magic, sorted by color, to learn new spells) and occasional puzzle dungeon gameplay (you r tests consist of being teleported into a literal dungeon and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles until you find a way to escape), and a bit of dating sim is in there, too. Each class you take, you randomly gain 1-3 points in the color of magic you're studying, and an equal amount of stress (bit of advice, your stress isn't worth worrying about until it's at least at 30, and resting just once drops it by no less than 20), and you usually learn a new spell every 5 points. There are a lot of spells, too many to learn them all in one playthrough, and not all of them are useful. The good news in that every dungeon has multiple ways to solve its puzzles, usually one for each school of magic, so as long as you know how to use what spells you have, you can probably escape the dungeon. Finding different ways to solve each puzzle is a good, viable way to prevent each playthrough from getting stale if you're trying to go for all the endings.\n\nThe writing is arguably the best part of the game. As I've said above, the game is heavily based around the idea that looks can be decieving. So, naturally, the game starts out trying to look very cliche'd and unoriginal. Every character's first impression is incredibly tropey and shows a clear archetype that, while not entirely false, is definitely just what each character is on the surface. [spoiler]The headstrong, sporty girl who hates studying has a weak constitution and knows a lot more about the history and culture of the magical world than most people you meet. The shy, submissive girl who passes all her tests with flying colors is disillusioned with the rules of the magical world and wants to treat spells like a science. The pretty badboy who seems so misunderstood is exactly as bad as everyone warned you he was, if not worse, though if you pursue him (which requires many sacrifices), his love for you is real. The grumpy Snape wannabe who shit-talks his class right to their face is the teacher most concerned for each student's welfare by far, and is also the most impressed with you when you find non-confrontational solutions to your problems.[/spoiler] The list goes on. Most named characters you meet have their own route, and you aren't likely to get much information on them if you don't pursue that route, which also adds to the replay value.\n\nThe game's weakest point is probably its presentation, mainly the art and music. The music isn't bad, but there aren't very many tracks, so you're going to get used to hearing a lot of the same songs. The star wipe screen transition is incredibly overused, even being used for characters appearing in a scene in place of them simply fading in. Hope you like stars a lot, this game sure does. And lastly, the art isn't impressive. I'm reluctant to call it bad, but it looks like it was done by a talented young artist; it shows potential, but looks immature. A lot of characters are also clearly made using the same character creator you use to make your Mary Sue, which is pretty noticeable. On the other hand, it's a good way to tell if someone is actually important or not; important characters have unique art.\n\nUltimately, Magical Diary is all about faking you out, making you expect one thing, then doing something else, without it feeling forced or un-foreshadowed.

Your options were plenty and it felt like, what you chose really made a difference.\nSadly, what I liked most also lacked the most  - the dungeons. They were always really short, and you either figured out how they worked really fast or you fail. This caused you to get demerits which ultimately lead to expulsion.

Like many similar dating simulations, what Magical Diary lacks in artistic substance it makes up for (for the most part) in character and story. \n\nThe game takes place in a setting quite similar to Hogwarts of the Harry Potter universe. You attend a school for the magically gifted where you make friends, learn spells, go to classes, and so on. Stat raising is crucial in this game, just as in many other dating sims, but here it's far less repetitive in comparison to others of this genre. Various events happen on a regular basis within the game, so instead of just doing class after class of monotonous repetition, the game gives you opportunities to interact with characters and make important choices.\n\nThe \"puzzles\" of this game are less than stellar. They tend to be either painfully simple or just plain frustrating, very rarely does the game find a middleground. As well it's easy to \"get stuck\" during the game, which is why I recommend using multiple save files. This is important becaue if you don't study the right magic to the right extent early on in the game, it's possible to be faced with puzzles that you simply lack the ability to solve. Again, this is very frustrating, but at the same time a necessary evil for a game of this variety.\n\nFinally, there's the characters. For anyone who wants an idea of what the different romanceable character routes are like, you can choose between romancing your professor (who as many people have pointed out, has striking similarities to a certain Harry Potter character), the generic mysterious bad boy, the school prankster, or either of your two best friends. The characters certainly aren't unlikeable for the most part, but I'd still definetelty recommend considering their personalities before deciding if this game is for you. The characters are one of the things that made this game enjoyable to me despite it's flaws, but if you don't find them as appealing it likely won't have the same effect.\n\nOverall Magic Diary is a decent game.

No matter what, this game I bought only because it was at an interesting discount during the Christmas sale... well, this game was a pretty good surprise, and I've enjoyed it tons.\n\nFirst: it doesn't take itself too seriously, which in my book tends to be a good thing. Of course it's inspired by stories like Harry Potter (one of the teachers is clearly reminiscent of Prof. Snape). Your character's default name is 'Mary Sue'. The other students you meet are often clich\u00e9 in their own ways: the funny troublemaker, the sporty girl, the somewhat shy roommate, the playboy with a dark past, and so on. But this is fun. If you enjoy toying with such tropes, it's fun. Also, some of the romance/friendship paths you can explore may turn in unexpected ways, darker than what the pastel colours and cute character let you think at first.\n\nThe game also embraces diversity without feeling compelled to point at it, which is good. Some students are not fully human (Pastel is half-fairy) and nobody cares (granted, some do about Damien, however it's often more about his behaviour than about his demon wings). Not only do the romance options offer same-sex paths, but these are also fairly balanced: 3 main het vs. 2 main same-sex possibilities\u2014no 10 vs. 1 imbalance here\u2014and, again, nobody will give your character sh*t because she wants to date another girl (one student even has two dads). You may even end up with a teacher, although to be fair, I'd have loved a Potsdam-path possibility (she's so cute and over the top at times ^^).\n\nThe exams are held in small dungeons, and you can solve their puzzles/challenges with more than just one spell, depending on the paths of magic you decided to follow. They were fun to tackle, even though I thought the magic wasn't exploited enough\u2014for instance, apart from these dungeons, I would've liked to be able to cast more spells during daily/romance/life situations in general.\n\nConclusion: Good replayability factor, enjoyable characters with their own little side stories to discover, and if you like boarding school settings, magic schools, and customising your character, this game is likely to be an appropriate choice.", "timestamp_created": 1483190399, "timestamp_updated": 1483749288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28858957": {"recommendationid": "28858957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070449751", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390738529}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd buy this for my friends if i thought they'd actually give it a chance and play it.", "timestamp_created": 1483168764, "timestamp_updated": 1483168764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28784372": {"recommendationid": "28784372", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124709345", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484367899}, "language": "english", "review": "OOOOMG..... its very addictive.... i fell in love with the characters fast. such good writing and art.

I stuck with Mary Sue because I thought it was hilarious) who discovers that she is a witch, and goes to a school of magic, and discovers a whole fantastical world that she didn't know about.

Although the size of the eyes still bugged me sometimes, but thats something you can easily forget about while playing the game - its written in a way that makes it rather easy to focus your attention on the plot. \nIts kind of sad there were almost no cgs, but i guess thats the price for being able to customize your character in a couple of ways. \nOh, and if youre not too much into this whole stat raising thing, there are cheats that you can use to swiftly progress through it by maxing all your stats instantly.

You can date a lot of unexpected characters as well. You can even date Big Steve or Professor Grabiner!

If you're not a fan of the genre but feel like giving one a try it also is, if you're not the type of person who'd be put off by it being a romantic comedy. It can be cliched at times, but it's one of those things that prove cliches aren't necessarily bad, here they make a fun sweet game full of likable characters. And sometimes those cliches get turned on their ears when you aren't expecting them.\n\nSo far as dating games go, Magical Diary is head and shoulders above many of them. All of the love interests you can choose from have a wide variety of scenes to see with them, many long before you're ever locked into their path, so you don't get get that \"We've met each other twice for two seconds, now let us date!\" feeling that lesser games can leave you with; by the time the main character's thoughts seriously turn to romance you've seen enough of the person she's chosen to understand why she wants to be with them. I also really appreciate that in almost all the routes you can aim for a friendship ending instead of a romantic one, so if you decide none of the characters appeal romantically you can still aim for an ending besides being all alone.\n\nMore importantly, you can get a good variety of scenes with characters you AREN'T chasing too. This isn't one of those games where you must constantly stay focused on the love interest you choose from the moment you start to get a good ending. And there are characters you can't date with plotlines spread through the game too, giving the world of the school a more fleshed-out feeling.\n\nThe dungeon sections are also great little puzzles. Periodically in the game you're tested on how you're doing in your studies by being stuck in a small dungeon and having to find your way out. The thing that makes these sections great is that there are many many ways to beat the puzzles each time, depending on what types of magic you've focused on. There's no set path of classes which you MUST take to make it, so long as you don't spend almost every day resting or hanging out in the gym you're almost certain (I won't say guaranteed, but you should have options) to have something in your spellbook that will see you through even if it isn't immediately obvious.", "timestamp_created": 1433293317, "timestamp_updated": 1433293317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16140630": {"recommendationid": "16140630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008007426", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414270971}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic story to waste some time with.

What in the..?\nNot enough variety in the endings.\nEnding is rather abrupt.\n\nWhat I did like:\nThe lack of pervy images. Too many games of this style rely on that.\nLots of potential for following on the story.\nThe dungeons are not complicated, but can be a challenge to succeed.\nWhat magic you learn affects the challenge dungeons and what solutions you can use.\nFive different romances (that I know of) along with several side stories means there is a surprising amount of replay value.\n\nOverall:\nVery refreshing to see a western-made game of this style that doesn't rely on pervy imagery. While there is some pervy stuff its handled subtly and in ways that doesn't feel like its there for the sake of it.

(You know, so long as you're a guy who is fine with playing a female character trying to get a date in a very LGBT-friendly setting.)  \n\nThe character creator is fun, if a bit limited.  The sheer fact that it has a character creator at all is a big advantage this game has, and I have no idea why it's not a more popular idea.  Most accessories, however, have to be purchased in-game, and have stats associated with them, so if you wanted to wear glasses, you can, but they cost money, and if you wore some stupid-looking giant star glasses, you might get more of the stats you want... Cat paws look dumb, but they give massive boosts to (nature-related) Green magic, so it's sometimes that old World of Warcraft \"killer clownsuit\" choice between aesthetics and effectiveness.\n\nChoices are very diverse, although some aspects of your past aren't up for your choosing.  Most of the time, however, your choices amount to which classes you go to, and which stats you therefore train, with the occasional tests that demand specific skills.\n\nThe dungeons are perhaps the best part of the game, and are presented in a Wizardry-style, but where your spells are tested as a puzzle.  Each school of magic gives different methods of solving a given puzzle, so practically any choice of magic schools will be correct if you just have enough of it to get a diverse enough set of spells.  \n\nThat said, there are some dissapointments.  It feels like the dungeon sections could have been expanded so much more, and the game would have been better for it.  The spells you collect are like puzzle pieces begging for some clever puzzle they can unlock, and the first few dungeons you go through feel like a warm-up for some truly challenging puzzle to come... and then the game says that you completed them all, and yay for your happy ending.

LLtQ is newer and probably a bit more polished, but MD is my favorite because of its superior depth and PC character customization options.\n\nThe premise is you're a female freshman student at a magical school in northeast USA.  The Harry Potter analogy is pretty close but I actually like this American/anime/fantasy influenced spin on it even more.  Most of the game is character interactions between PC character and her roommates, teachers, and other students with different story outcomes depending on your dialog choices.\n\nThere's also the character progression aspect that comes from managing which attributes to raise ('smart/strong/cute/weird' as well as 'white/black/red/green/blue' magics) with your limited class time while managing 'stress' meter levels.  Raising magical schools give you access to more spells which are used to pass period exams.  Raising 'cute'/'weird' alters how other characters react to you and unlocks new dialog options.\n\nThe periodic exams are essentially puzzle mini-games that are pretty fun/engaging and also provide a nice diversion psychological break that help keep the other game elements fresh for players.\n\nIf you make the right choices you can pursue romance path with one of several different characters, both male and female.  This was probably my single favorite aspect of the game, and the one that contributes most to its replay value, as the character interactions in the romances are very cute (I *was* a little sad that there seems to be no romance path for Pastel, however- Kappa).\n\nFrom HanakoGames company website 'We do not think of ourselves as just \"games for girls\", although we are definitely girl-friendly. Anyone who likes fantasy and adventure, anime games, or just cute stuff is more than welcome here.'\n\nI'm middle-aged male so I think they've succeeded in making their games have pretty broad appeal beyond just girls.  I have zero problems playing as a female PC character, which I know isn't the case for all males. \n\nMy only slight complaint about these games is that there can be a lot of trial and error involved to getting an outcome you're satisfied with (I knew right away which romance path I wanted to pursue) and in my opinion save/reloading or restarting when you mess up is not only unfun but also breaks the story immersion.\n\nI guess the idea is that a lot of the fun should come from this trial and error and letting the player try to guess/explore outcomes based on story clues.  For many players this is probably what happens, but personally it just ends up being more frustrating than fun.  \n\nFor me best experience came when playing along with [url=spikycaterpillar.com/magical_diary/guide.html]walkthrough from devs site[/url] which in addition to walkthrough gives some detailed explanations of game mechanics which are absent from in-game help.  This allowed me to steer the story exactly the way I wanted without the hassle of 'savescumming'.\n\nAny road, it's really good to know their are developers creating really innovative, high-quality experiences geared towards female gamers (and better still when their excellent design/writing gives them appeal beyond their primary audience such that I can enjoy them too).", "timestamp_created": 1426150197, "timestamp_updated": 1426230377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14803862": {"recommendationid": "14803862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165703124", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441567435}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the game but it would be better if we could go all the way through high school!", "timestamp_created": 1425871998, "timestamp_updated": 1425871998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469142", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14747538": {"recommendationid": "14747538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203581968", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499541688}, "language": "english", "review": "OHMIGOSH this game is so amazing, It's one of the best dating sims I have EVER played (Aside from Dandelion Wishes brought to you :p) -Spoiler coming up- also Aside from the fact that Damion tried to eat my soul,  I think you can also get good endings with him XD I ended up playing this game non stop for a week because yes, it's that good!

(I would not even wonder if this was planned as an actual Harry Potter fanfiction, just without Harry Potter or Hogwarts.)\n\n___________________________________________________\n++Story++\nYou live a peaceful life with your parents. One day, you recieve a letter where it says that you have magical powers and are invited to visit a magical academy for young wizards. You go there, meet new friends, study magic, and find secrets. The story has many many decisions and it changes drastically with every decision. For example if you choose to play along with the blue guy (I forgot his name), you will meet him almost all the time and plays a critical role in the story. If you do not choose to, he will never show up again in the story and something completely different happens.\n\n\n++Gameplay++\nThe gameplay is has almost RPG elements. You level your magical skill with the lessons that you choose every monday ingame. These magical skill are important when you have to take a test. At these tests, you will be thrown into the dungeon of the school and have to solve a riddle to get out of there. You can not die, but if you fail the test, you will get negative schoolpoints which can lead to you being suspended from the school and end your playthrough early. \nYou also have a lot of romance options, both straight and lesbian.\n\n\n++Grafics++\nThe screens are drawn very well, but sadly, the characters are all easily drawn on one pattern. You will see several hairstyles and faces more than once, just the colors are different. Nothing is really unique but the teachers. Do not expect to be amazed by variety.\n\n\n++Music++\nThe music is well chosen and played. Sadly, it gets repetive really fast.\n\n\n++Features++\nThe achievements are really hard to get because you will have to play through the game more than 5 times to get them all. At the end of a year, you upload a picture of your character on the page of the developer.\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe story is well, the gameplay is great.

Set in a school where magic users learn the art of spell casting, it is pretty clear to see that the title gets its inspiration from the popular Harry Potter books. Players simulate the life of a freshman going through their first year at the prestigious Iris Academy where you\u2019ll have to contend with strict teachers, managing your studies and attracting a date for the end of year prom. As a macho man, I\u2019m clearly not the target audience for this game, but I decided to give it a go after enjoying Hanako Games\u2019 2012 offering Long Live the Queen. If you are interested in trying out either title they can be purchased from Valve\u2019s Steam service or directly from Hanako\u2019s website.\n\nGameplay wise Magical Diary feels like the adventure books some of you may have played during your youth. You\u2019ll read some story until something noteworthy occurs. When a key event happens you\u2019ll be asked to choose what to do from a list of multiple-choice answers. What response you select has an impact on the plot making it branch off in a different narrative path, which certainly adds replay value for anyone curious enough to explore all of the game\u2019s content. Will you be a model student and ace your exams or will you skive classes and potentially risk expulsion? When it comes to dating will you try to court one of the school\u2019s bachelors or do as I did and break the heart of a blue skinned senior by pursuing a lesbian relationship with my bookish roommate instead?\n\nAs a student of Iris Academy you\u2019ll be expected to complete various exams, but these are nothing like the coursework or written tests you would find in a regular school. Examinations in Magical Diary consist of being teleported into a dungeon and using your spell-casting prowess to find a way out. In order to succeed you\u2019ll be expected to solve brainteasers using the enchantments you learn in class. In one dungeon for example you can escape by destroying a wall that is obstructing the exit with a well-placed fireball. Whether you know how to cast a fireball or not however depends on if you have completed enough lessons in red magic (I wonder if Ryu from Street Fighter attended those classes.)\n\nThis all means that planning out your curriculum plays a big part in Magical Diary. At the start of each week you have to decide what types of magic you wish to learn. Blue magic focuses on transformations, green magic allows users to manipulate nature, white magic is used for communicating with spirits whilst pink magic makes you appreciate musicals and say the word fabulous in a camp voice (okay I made that last one up.) Don\u2019t go overboard with the cramming though as stress can have a detrimental effect on your character. Thankfully it is possible to combat the effects of mental fatigue by unwinding at the mall on weekends.\n\nMuch like an examiner grading a student\u2019s homework, the time has come for me to rate this game. My final score is four stars out of five as I enjoyed Magical Diary a little more than Long Live the Queen (which I awarded a three.) Visually speaking Long Live the Queen is the more polished of the two, but I enjoyed replaying Magical Diary more as it has a more fleshed out cast of characters. I also liked how your decisions have a greater impact on the plot as opposed to Long Live the Queen\u2019s more linear storytelling. As far as visual novels go Magical Diary isn\u2019t top of the class, but it\u2019s a solid B student all the same. Strong writing, light romance elements and a story told through a girl\u2019s perspective make this an ideal purchase for female players who may be frustrated that there aren\u2019t enough games on the market catering to their tastes.\n\nOriginally published at http://theotakujudge.com/", "timestamp_created": 1422190475, "timestamp_updated": 1422190475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14153864": {"recommendationid": "14153864", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994041478", "num_games_owned": 714, "num_reviews": 117, "playtime_forever": 1016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461456481}, "language": "english", "review": "Acted like an insufferable wanker and barely passed my classes, but at least I got to date the shy girl.\n\nThe story of my life, how uncanny...", "timestamp_created": 1422149199, "timestamp_updated": 1422149199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14153836": {"recommendationid": "14153836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044669924", "num_games_owned": 651, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404246974}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why I got this.", "timestamp_created": 1422149040, "timestamp_updated": 1422149040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14153136": {"recommendationid": "14153136", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167870385", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515378434}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed this game, there are plenty of decisions that you can make, one fault with it is that some things have to happen in the game that irritate me (like the fact that you have to bump into the teacher on the first day).

However, this game is considerably more forgiving and it is much easier to complete the game. There is some replay value in that there are multiple mini-routes, often romantic, you can follow depending upon what conversation choices you make. Sadly, like LLTQ, once you have played through it once or twice having to go through the same dialogues early on just to get to the later ones that get you on different routes gets a little tiring. Unless of course you don't care about such things and are perfectly fine with one or two playthroughs.\n\nIn short, it is an easier Long Live the Queen that trades the brutal violence and murderous intrigue for a (mostly) benign school life experience with some romance possibilities.

Well that depends.\nYou can date a changeling (yes, date the changeling), A middle aged professor, either of your two female room mates, their family, or several other individuals I didn't have the time to explore yet.\nOr if you're that kind of person, you can date none of them. I spent the time to avoid getting close with anyone because  I'm more of a thing with wings kinda girl I guess (Date the changeling~)\n\nGo through several different tests throughout the year that force you to use the magic you learned in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: Teleporting others, teleporting others, teleporting others, and asking to kiss people. Aside from one specific spell that is a tad overpowered... there is multiple solutions to every single test, and assuming you think critically, you will not fail any test so long as you keep up on your studies.\n\nI give this game a solid seal of approval from me: Came for the cards, stayed for the teleport other.

much better. In general I don't like the anime look or wacky sense of humor but the progressiveness and impossible strangeness made this a very interesting experience.\nThe world is clearly based off of Harry Potter, with a sham Severus Snape and students group into houses (On a side note, I named my character Serpentina Hissmark and I laughed when she was glad not to be in the Snake house. But on one playthrough she was transferred- yay!). However, it's not a rip-off and has it's own unique feel. \n I would say the strict gameplay element is limited- there aren't enough chances to use magic, especially outside of exams. The exams, composed of using spells learned in class to escape dungeons, are great fun. There are five fields of magic based on colors, and the game would have been far more interesting if the outcomes were more based on which fields the player specialized in. \nInstead, the real interest in the came comes from the visual novel element, a feature that I usually enjoy less. It seems that this game focused less on the fantasy fulfilment of the perfect lover, or one of a 'type' of perfect lover, and actually made realistic characters with interesting storylines.  However while a few of the paths were fairly standard (oddly enough, these included the lesbian paths! I think a few of the non-human ladies would have made better romantic interests) two of the male characters offered very unique and at times surprisingly touching romance options. I was genuinely rooting for one of my couples during a play-through, though the relationship was far from traditional. All I need to say is that a possible sham marriage with your Severus Snape stand-in professor is NOT the most WTF relationship option. I appreciated the fluid sexualities of the characters, the character of Professor Potsdam and her very enlightened views on teen sexuality and transgenderism, and the presentation of a friend's realistic abusive relationship. The game allows you to enter an worse-than-Edward-Cullen manner abusive relationship yourself, but it's up to you to interpret whether it's a good or bad thing. \nI do find it slighty annoying how you were pushed so quickly into a relationship with the demon, and the others were more difficult. I had to look online to find most of the paths, and I think there should be more hints and opportunities to pursue characters.

So this equates to a fairly interesting game. \n\n 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1416806801, "timestamp_updated": 1416806801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13061070": {"recommendationid": "13061070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156398861", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413846523}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked parts of this game and disliked other parts.\n\nPros:\n- Different & unique romance options! I loved that I could go for one of my female roommates. :)\n- You get to customize your characters hair, eyes, and body type. This makes the protagonist feel more \"yours.\"\n- The characters get put in absolutely hilarious situations. \n- Your choices in the plot certainly have a big impact and can lead you to many different routes, so replay value is deifnitely there.\n- The \"magical school\" setting is unique compared to some other dating sims.\n\nCons:\n- I felt like the personality traits were worthless. I saw no point in getting points in the \"cute/weird/smart\" categories because they don't seem to affect anything.\n- The magical tests never seem to get interesting/complex.\n- Art was subpar. The characters all look similar in the face and their appearance doesn't change a whole lot. It starts to feel monotonous. \n- There are huuuuge chunks of dialogue/description with no pictures sometimes, which gets annoying. With such a cool, magical setting, I would expect to actually see some of the magic going on. Unfortunately, you never do. This is what makes this dating sim way less enjoyable than ones like Dandelion, which go above and beyond with scenery and drawing out pivotal scenes. The only time Magical Diary shows you a picture to go with a scene is if you kiss somebody, which for me, was only twice.\n\nOverall: If you tend to like visual novels or dating sims, this one is worth a try, especially if you value the choice to either date men or women. However, don't expect this game to knock your socks off.

After classes start up though, the game gets really fun. Learning new spells and finding applications for them is fun. Mostly you will use them to get out of dungeons, which function as exams, but you will also be able to use many of them to unlock unique options in random events, which is an awesome touch. Speaking of random events, there are enough things that happen each week to make the game interesting, and a surprising amount of variety in the situations you can find yourself in. I didn't do a second playthrough for a long time, but it's worth it for some different endings. None of the endings are really \"the good ending\". They're all a bit open-ended, and all have something about them that you'll have to leave behind. The story is enjoyable; definitely interesting and unique enough to keep you engaged. I like to think that this takes place in some female-oriented alternate dimension of harry potter, what with the whole magical wizard school and professor Grabineer*cough*snape*cough*. But it has enough of its own story elements to set it apart from the universe that it drew much of its inspiration from. The main character is a little bit generic, but you're given enough of your own choices to project your own character onto her. My only real gripe is that you're character alludes to parents and a backstory at several points, but her parents are mostly left blank. Although I do have this theory that the school directors hypnotized them with magic to think that you just went off to boarding school... I mean, it really makes sense, and feels like it's hinted at a couple of times. I digress. The game is great to play with a friend for shits and giggles, as well as for a couple of serious playthroughs alone.

What I am getting at here is that I really have nothing to compare this game to so my review may seem a bit to positive but oh well I think it deserves it. So this game is about a girl that was told that she was a witch and that she could, if she chose to, go to a magical school. She then goes to class meets people and lives her one year at the school in which the game ends with here dating someone or the other multiple endings.. or you might just screw up and get expelled before school finishes. The game did really well opening up the magical world to you without hammering you down with uneeded explanation at the start. You basically learn about the world as you go along. The relationships for the most part felt real and were not to over the top romantic which allows you to get much more involved with the characters I find. The game had a lot of story lines and a lot of your choices effected how that storyline would go. I have replayed this game many times and still havn't uncovered every storyline part. I know this because I still have not unlocked all the achievements yet. So the game can easily be replayed many times. The game is also pretty short so that also makes it easier to replay. \n\nUmm there not really any huge issues with the game, i guess after replaying the game a few times you will get a lot of scenes that you have seen before, especially at the start, but you can quickly skip over those if you want to. I remember reading some one elses review saying that the game was to short and that it was only one year of school. I dont know if this is an issue for me really because if the game was longer than I think the replay value would probably lower so good job developers with making the game short.

For one, there are only two teachers, so the school feels very empty in that regard. My biggest complaint is the ending or maybe just the lack of a central story. I was very entertained throughout the game, but when I got to the end, it didn't feel like I actually accomplished much. I got some good grades, I got a boyfriend, and I got some merits. But that was about it. I was hoping the merit system would lead to something, but it was barely used. When the school year ended, I was fully expecting to continue my skill learnging the next year and be able to do something great with them, but the game just ended. There just didn't seem to be much of a point to all I did that year. There is a sequel on the way, so maybe my complaints will be remedied when the story continues.

Every ending leaves you expecting something else to happen and you're left with little resolution. Which isn't a satisfying end for me.

You can avoid interactions you do not want, of course there are unskipable events in the game, but I never felt I was being forced on a specific path at any point while playing.

Also the items you can buy at the Mall will be visibaly seen on the character. For example if you buy her a star wand your avatar will hold a starwand if equiped. That also gives a nice variety of appearances.\n\nOne Walkthrough takes about 6-7 hours which is quite the medium length of a visual Novel. \nIf you are planing on getting all achievements it takes about 12 hours as much as i have playtime (probably a bit less if you are english native speaking or just a faster reader, i might as well was a few minutes of those afk)\nWith all the achievements you have NOT finished all the routes but only 2-3 from the huge amount of routes possible.\n\nExtra achievements for all routes like in most dating sim novels would have been nice.. (for example \"unlock the romantic ending of Ellen, Damien and so on) [in case a developer reads this: Could it be possible to create those achievements?    *holding a puppy next to the developers which looks with wide open and extremely cute eyes to the mod/dev*\n\n\nI realy enjoyed reading this Novel and do not regret getting it, although i got it in a humble bundle a while ago i would have payed full price for it if i hadn't already gotten it.

I think I am in love with him XD  There appear to be female options as well as male, so I will probably go this way on my second playthrough.

It took me about 4 hours to play through once.  This is easy to forgive though - the game features far more choices and branches than most visual novels.

Sp\u00e4testens ab dem Weihnachtsevent entwickelt sich in jedem Pfad ein ganz eigener Handlungsstrang, welcher ganz neue Informationen \u00fcber z.B. Ereignisse preis gibt, die man mit anderen Charakteren nie erfahren h\u00e4tte. So wechselt sich eine Szenerie von ganz normal und harmlos pl\u00f6tzlich zu komplett absurd und lebendsgef\u00e4hrtlich. Und all das durch ein paar unterschiedliche Entscheidungen des Spielers.\n\n\nAlles in allem kann ich dieses Spiel jedem empfehlen, wer nicht Wert auf ein actiongeladenes sondern auf ein sehr gut erz\u00e4hltes und nicht minder spannendes Abenteuer legt.

Don't get me wrong, your relationships will be a major plot point however you also need to manage your friendship with your two roommates as well as the role you play in school. You might be treasurer and have to help plan events, or be part of a club designed to seek revenge on others. \n\nOf course, your love interest still does play a point in the game. You can date either a male or female or even a Professor if you go down the right path. What makes this game great is how it developes the relationships. Your character is not swept off her feet instantly but the first cute face. Each relationship feels realistic and is built on many layers. You even get quite a bit of back story to each character you date (save for one bonus Steam added relationship which is a secret bonus one added to the Steam version of the game). But don't think you can't get dumped at any time by your SO. Pick the wrong options and it's back to the single life. \n\nOf course since there's magic in the game and you're going to school, you do take exams where you use a few spells and common sense to solve the problems in a dungeon that is a screen by screen styled place (aka it's not a free roaming thing but you move from one screen to the next like a hidden object game without the hidden objects).\n\nIt's really nice to have your own PC (playable character) have internal conflict as well with her family so you get some character developement as well.\n\nOverall, I've put over 10 hours into a graphic novel game and I read fast.

And there are so many problems with these exams that they are unenjoyable to play through.\n\n- You have to have certain magical skills or you can't complete them. This is not told by the game or what skills you need. \n- 98% of your spells are useless. This leads to the same problem I had with \u201dCthulu saves the world\u201d, where you have to constantly scroll through useless spells to find the ones you need. It also leads to a lot of frustration as the spells really give you no idea what to use instead.\n- Your magical points are extremely limited. I failed one of the dungeons because I missclicked where I wanted to place an object. Ugh. \n- Some dungeons I have quite frankly never been able to figure out what to do. They look too samey and there really isn't any indication of what they expect you to do. If you fail, the professor yells at you to study what the solution is. But you are never given the option to actually study it.\n\nIf it wasn't for these dungeons, I may have recommended the game, because the fastfoward option let's you play around with the story as much as you want. But instead you get stuck in these tedious dungeons. \n\n~ Abusive relationships ~\n\nI am not sure which age group this game is for, but this has a huge red warning flag about what message it sends to women and young girls. Any male-female romance you can persue in the game is always aimed towards \u201dIf I love him enough, then I can change him and he will love me back.\u201d and some of them are emotionally and psysically abusive. I see these kinds of stories a lot when the girl is forced into being \u201dsaved\u201d by the \u201dbad boy\u201d, which should make her eternally grateful to him, while he continues abusing her until her love makes him \u201dkind\u201d. \n\nTo give some examples of what kind of abuse the 16 year old girl has to take, some of them includes murder attempt (I am not kidding), being pushed and held against a wall, yelled at, blamed for things she didn't do, threatened, lied to, strung along, forced to give up her friends for him... the list goes on. 2 of the 3 possible male-female relationships are 90% abusive. What were they thinking? \nOne of these relationships you get forced into based on bizarre circumstances, where then the character literally owns you and will continously abuse you as he is unhappy with you. \n\nThere are also some girl-girl relationships, but the only reason I haven't tried them out is simply because I didn't find the female characters interesting. Maybe I will when I can force myself through the tedious dungeons again.", "timestamp_created": 1396948683, "timestamp_updated": 1396948683, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448119", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9760675": {"recommendationid": "9760675", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995481303", "num_games_owned": 668, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 1674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438598769}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438, \u0442\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u0421\u043d\u0435\u0433\u0433\u0435 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435!  \n\u041c\u043e\u0438 \u0448\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u044b \u0432\u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c *_*\n\n\u0410 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0437\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0439, \u0441 \u0445\u043f, \u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0439, \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0430\u0437\u043b\u044b. \u0418\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0431 \u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0443\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0431\u043e\u0440. \n\n\u0420\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u044f\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b \u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430 5 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432.", "timestamp_created": 1396945462, "timestamp_updated": 1396945462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455912", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9760099": {"recommendationid": "9760099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046013803", "num_games_owned": 475, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396769696}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah. This is a game called Magical Diary.\nIs there a diary in the game? Yes. Is there magic? Yes. Is the diary a Magical Diary? ...no, actually.

Maybe it writes itself or something, but it doesn't do anything special aside from that, if it is the case. It just tells you what you already know. It's useful to see what happened if you haven't played the game in a while, for sure.\nBut yeah, despite the incredibly generic title, the also somewhat generic art style (you know, the type of art that middle-school girls and boys draw when they want to draw manga characters (actually, the settings aren't bad, just the character portraits, but there's like 10 settings in total...)) the story is actually pretty unique.\nIt doesn't really pander, it isn't light, there are routes that simply don't have a good end, no matter how hard you try, just because that's how they SHOULD be. It doesn't indulge a teenage girl's fantasy of going to a magical school (well, to some extent. It isn't a perfect world.)\nYou would expect \"Magical Diary\" to be some wet fantasy like Twilight, but it has its moments where little choices have a bigger impact.\n\nAlso, this isn't just a straight up visual novel.

A nice cross between an RPG and a storybook.  Puzzles, romance, comedy, it's all there. I thoroughly recommend it.\n\nGameplay type: Stats based visual novel\nPremise: Hogwarts dating sim. Seriously. You are a \u2018wildseed\u2019 (basically a muggle, you\u2019re a witch that sprung up in the wild rather than being cultivated from a magical family), embarking on your first year at magic school. You meet a collection of interesting characters and can choose to romance them. Each week you have to choose which magic classes to go to (they\u2019re all taught by one of two teachers, who must have mastered the ability to be in two places at once\u2026) each class raises your stat in that magic type. Every so often you have to take exams which test your skills (basically you get put in a dungeon and have to use the various spells you\u2019ve unlocked to puzzle solve your way out). \nRepresentation: Lesbian romance options. \nReplayability: Fair. The different choices you make and different romances you choose make a difference in how the game unfold. Since all exams have multiple ways to solve, there is incentive to focus on different magic types to see how things play out. \nOther thoughts: You can marry Snape. (He\u2019s not called Snape, but that\u2019s who he is). You are 16 and you can wind up married to your teacher. This is treated as some wacky shenanigan, not something to be really concerned about.

You play as 'Mary Sue', a young wildseed (read: mudblood) witch who has entered a boarding school for magical folk to learn the craft. \n\nMy initial impression of Magical Diary is not favourable. On the upside the anime-style character is very customizable, some of the background artwork is nice, and there seem to be a number of different narrative paths that you may take through the game with hints at mysteries to uncover, making for good replay value. On the downside much of the character art is amateurish, and the game does little to hide its fanfiction roots. Because of this you wind up with a narrative that is chock-full of cliches, making the story very predictable. The strategic gameplay also feels overwhelmed at times by the sheer amount of narrative exposition there is to read. It took me almost 30 minutes to get through 2 weeks' worth of decisions, when it should have taken 5 minutes at most. \n\nBottom Line? This game will not appeal to everyone.

It might be good for younger audiences, but for those who enjoy the challenge of life simulators in a graphic novel RPG experience - this game just isn't going to cut it. \n\nI hope that the developer produces a second year sequel to this title and addresses these concerns. If so, I'll come back and edit this review with a qualified recommendation. Until then, play one of Magical Diary's superior competitors instead.", "timestamp_created": 1390422386, "timestamp_updated": 1390422480, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624484", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8726473": {"recommendationid": "8726473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053984243", "num_games_owned": 995, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476680036}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy the simulation genre, then I recommend picking this up. My feelings are mixed about the game, but you will probably get a good laugh out of it anyways. I've put a lot of hours into this game and replayed it a bunch and have enjoyed it each time. \n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n\n[*]  Variety of choices about spells, activities, which person you'd like to romance, etc. Many of the cut scenes and events also give you options. \n\n[*] Replayability. The game isn't very long, but becuase there are so many choices, you may find yourself wanting to play again.. just to see what it is that you could do differently. \n\n[*]  Light sense of humor, sort of funny, a little bit disturbing, and even a little bit romantic.\n\n[*]  You're not bound to date only boys. You can date women, or nobody at all. It doesn't define what relationships are right and wrong, and so that's sort of nice to see. Hell, you're not really pressured to have a relationship at all. \n\n[*] The font is easy to read. Which is good, because that's mostly what you'll be doing in this game. \n\n[*] You can basically marry Snape. So, there's that. \n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n\n[*]  The game IS short. If you don't find interest in the game and don't feel like replaying it, then it may not be worth your money for the few game play hours that you'll get out of it. \n\n[*]  You can only play as a female. Character customization is also very limited. \n\n[*] The artwork is pretty crude. The characters look like they've all been done in Paint. \n\n[*]  The music. This is probably one of the things I hated most about this game. There were only four (I think) different songs/tunes that play depending on the event or what you're doing, and they loop. There really wasn't a lot of creativity or anything put into that I feel, and it gets on your nerves after awhile. \n\n[*]  You'll need to play the game multiple times to unlock all of the different achievements, if that's your thing. So again, if you're not interested, that may suck if you're a completionist. There is also a pretty large room for error if you haven't researched/played the game before, so it can be frustrating if you're trying to reach a certain goal.  \n\n[*]  No voice overs. Nothing is voiced in this game, so you'll have to read everything. I mean, it is a point and click simulator so a lot of reading and clicking is expected, but voices may have helped give a little bit of life to the characters. \n\n[*]  No \"new game+\". It would be nice to be able to keep your money or some of your clothing items when you go to start a new game. It would help make things a bit easier, and speed up additional playthroughs.", "timestamp_created": 1389868455, "timestamp_updated": 1452896232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8709855": {"recommendationid": "8709855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048556126", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452729963}, "language": "german", "review": "Sehr knuffiger Life Sim, wenn man daf\u00fcr in Stimmung ist.", "timestamp_created": 1389740124, "timestamp_updated": 1389740124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8674316": {"recommendationid": "8674316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050721884", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499685790}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked this game up when it went to sale, it was a measly $5 off, but I was interested. The child in me adored the animae feel to it so I purchased it.\nAs much as i enjoy the games style. It gives you an option just about all games like this have. Choice. The power of choice in a game it strong, which I believe is why The Stanly Parable did so well, but I suppose thats off topic. While the game gives you choice, the slightest move in the begining might give you the exact same ending, even if what you do after is completely different. There are few endings that surround 4 characters in the story. That is a good amount but the game, being more of a story, is hard. You can aim for a specific character ending but chances are you will be kicked out ahead of time, or be with the person you didn't want. \nMy main complaint is the tests. The game throws tests at you, and the game itself doesn't teach you what you need to be taught and many people (like myself) will not read the lessons and skip through them. The game gives you \"Study Time\" but doesn't give you the ability to study. I have played the game, possible 10 times and have been kicked out 9 times. I finished once by using a website to ensure I get the Damien ending.\nThe demerits you recieve in the begining, which you CAN'T PREVENT is what slowly brings me down.

Magical Diary, unlike other games, contains bonus features including a chance to cast spells, use some point of strategy in dungeons, and with surprise events every other *game* week!\n\nAlthough the puzzles aren't very difficult, they grow in level and, in the end, have many more 'dead' ends and less 'good' ends. Five merits are for basic answers whilst ten for greater ones, driving you to complete it in as many ways possible! The numerous amount of save slots allows 'stop', 'replay, 'stop', 'replay.\n\nA downpoint in the game is that there are only female characters but this game is very loose in sexual orientation so you could be heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual. In fact, you can totally ignore the romance part of the game (though it's a gigantic, huge, overshadowing punch).\n\nThe art is beautiful and expressions are neat, character customization is limited but not non-existent (which, in many otome games, feature pre-generated avatars). The subplot is light but there and you could enjoy the ways the plot unravels.\n\nHowever, despite all its positive points, I have many negative rulings for this game too;\n-> Short (For a game so expensive, the game is entirely too short! Of course, you could spend hours characterizing, spam save, and decide who your beloved one would be, but most of it is useless informative events [which deepens the plot but doesn't really relate to anything in the story] and reading the dialogue.]\n\n-> Impossibilities {Anyone ever recorded has never won the title of 'President' because it simply isn't possible. The plot relies a bit on your treasurer or non-treasurer standing and, as of thus, you must be either one or the other. You have a good selection of characters but it's impossible if you do a simple slip-up!)\n\n-> Non-expansive Magic System (Personally, I think it would be much better if they include a broader and stronger magical interface into the system! It would be great to actually practice this rare function more and try a more....mystical setting. Heavily reliant on Harry Potter (if thinking of Professor Hiero...something and the 'Wildseeds'.)\n\n-----\n\nHacks -> Go to options.

On top of the usual choice-conciquence system, there is an rpg style leveling system for several magical spell groups, and a rudimentary equipment system that makes changes to your character's image frame.\n\nGraphically, the game is mostly what one expects from visual novels. Static backgrounds of middling quality, and somewhat more animated frames for characters. The main character can be customized, and you can go shopping for equipment that further affects the visuals. The anime style artwork is unpolished, but its easy enough to get over. The music and sounds are fine. Of course, in visual novels the most important part of design is the story. In Magical Diary, the story is okay. Its nothing exceptional, but there are several branches available allowing for at least several unique playthroughs.\n\nTechnically, the game is fine. The RPG elements work well for the environment its in, the menus do the trick, and overall the system is simple enough to handle easily.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty okay. Its nothing exceptional, but if you enjoy a storytelling experience with a higher degree of interactivity than the usual visual novel, you will probably like Magical Diary.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please have a look at [u][url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/essidus/recommended/]my other reviews.[/url][/u]", "timestamp_created": 1388712931, "timestamp_updated": 1388712931, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8513063": {"recommendationid": "8513063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007586412", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472030996}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer Long Live the Queen mag, sollte nen Blick riskiren. \n\nHier geht es drum, ein jahr auf einer Magie Akademie zu \u00fcberstehen, und seinen weiblichen Char (Was sonst?) zu entwickeln.\n\nEs ist sehr tiefschcihtig und hat neben ordentlichen Dungeons viele Dialoge und Wege wie man zum Ziel kommt.\n\nWer sich vom Look nicht abschreken l\u00e4sst, kann hier einigen Spass dran haben.", "timestamp_created": 1388682677, "timestamp_updated": 1388682677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8509915": {"recommendationid": "8509915", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994239917", "num_games_owned": 2982, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1374764398}, "language": "english", "review": "Magical Diary is part point-and-click, part adventure, part RPG.\n\nYou play as a girl in her first year at a magical school.

I found the characters to be mostly interesting, and was surprised at how much depth some of them have. I picked out the guy I wanted to get my magical paws on right away, and it took me the majority of the school year to break him down. Perseverance was key though, eventually I got that kiss!\n\nThe great thing about Magical Diary is the amount of possibilities I turned down in order to go down this route. This game has a lot of replayability as in the first two weeks of game time alone there are at least three distinctive massive plot-lines available if the right options are chosen.\n\nThe RPG elements come from learning the right subjects, and unlocking spells to use in dungeons. Dungeons are used as tests, and there are 5 or 6 of them in the game. They're not very impressive, but without them the lessons you learn and items you buy would be a pretty needless.\n\nOverall, Magical Diary is a game that shouldn't be taken to seriously. It's a fun experience which is more story-play than gameplay.\n\nBottom line: A great way to spend a couple of hours.

(Because I do think that.) There are plenty of things I COULD list, from being a fan of the maker, to the cute artwork, to the by turns adorable, dark, intense and thought-provoking stories told in the form of romantic paths, the the simple quality of the game. Oh, wait, I just listed them. Oh well.\n\nMy point was, what I really love, even after so many playthroughs, and so much more experience now of RPG and VisNovel games than I had when I first played it, is how it walks the line of complexity. Most VisNovels give you simple text, with choices that affect outcome. Simple, enjoyable, easy to figure out. Other games also incorporate a skill system that affects the outcome just as much, and can be fiendishly difficult to figure out - do you have enough charm to be with this character, and if you don't, do you have enough energy to build on it without your character burning out or starving? The combinations can be endless - or at least so numerous that it takes a true devout to get through them all.\nMagical Diary, to me, is a perfect crossover. Because the magic system is complex, but straight-forward and, most importantly, it's in the game as a BONUS. Talk about replayability - when you're done with the romance routes and want to replay them, you can play around with your class shedule and skill levels to unlock some bonus content. And there's even a direct payoff to your skill building with the fun dungeons. The dungeon exam at the end of the terms might not change between playthroughs, but you, like the characters themselves, can have a lot of fun keeping your character from learning the spell for the obvious solution and really trying to think outside the box.\n\nIn short, whether you're in this for a cute, fun, deep VN, or a skill-builder with the occasional secret bonus that won't eat up weeks of your life or require a walkthrough, Magical Diary is something you should try out.

After my first playthrough, it turns out there\u2019s also a solid second half of the game in the form of adventure game-esque dungeon exams. \n\nBasically, you\u2019re thrown into a small dungeon where you need to use the magic you\u2019ve learned so far to solve a puzzle and escape. Each puzzle seems to encourage multiple approaches because of the huge number of utility spells you\u2019ll have access to. Check the screenshot on the store page that has the spell list \u2013 the vast majority of them are more along the lines of \u201cdetect charm\u201d and \u201ctransform stone\u201d rather than fireball or lightning bolt, which usually means you can magical Mcgyver your way through each exam in multiple ways. This ends up being pretty important since how you develop your spell list is entirely up to you, and getting deep into one spell tree requires skimping on the others, so missing a key spell from a spell tree you\u2019ve been neglecting isn\u2019t a completely screwed situation if you can get creative with the other spells.\n\nI\u2019d like to give an example of one of my recent exams for how open-ended it can be, but I\u2019ll post it in the comments instead in case you don\u2019t want any of the dungeon puzzles spoiled.\n\nAs for the actual writing and story bits (which honestly make up the majority of the game, I\u2019m definitely always itching for more of the dungeons), while the dialogue isn\u2019t Portal levels of consistently good comedy, the characters are at least fleshed out enough to be memorable and I can safely say at least one event in game made me feel like a piece of shit for making a poor decision, so I found myself pretty invested in the setting.

It's American-made, but very Japanese in style. Most of the gameplay is interacting with characters and building your own story with short dungeon crawl segments to make use of the magic you learn.\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game. It's fairly short (~4hrs) but there are many paths to take, and you won't see most of the content in a single playthrough. The characters are interesting and believable. The game sadly lacks a plot, but you probably won't miss it too much. The dungeon segments are neat, but too short and shallow to add much. You get tons of neat spells; it's a shame that most go unused.\n\nIf you think you might like it, there's a lot of fun packed into this game. However, some will be turned off by the anime style and by the girliness of it. Check out the demo online if you're interested; saves carry over.\n\nUPDATE: In hindsight, I've come to realize that I enjoyed this game despite it really being objectively bad. It's a very fun kind of bad, though. For me, the general goofiness, overly dramatic story, and overused tropes and cliches made it enjoyable for me. It's the sort of game that you'd want to riff on, MST3K style.

There is special gear that I have no idea how to unlock yet, and there is armor that you can buy with the gold you find to provide you with different looks along with traits that can influence your playstyle.\n\nCombat is pretty good for VR, but still stands to improve, at least in the animation department. You're able to parry enemy attacks using weapons or a shield, and slaying enemies nets your character experience. Your character levels as you gain experience, which, once you unlock the ability to, you can distribute stat points into dexterity, strength and intelligence to improve your character.\n\nSo far it's enjoyable, but it might not be polished to the point that it's for everyone just yet.

be a part of it. I've only played 2 hours but i'm liking what I see. \n\nKeep in mind what you're walking into - a VR dungeon grind, similar to diablo or poe, but not nearly as developed. It's Early access after all. \n\nThe best part about it is the atmosphere, it achieves a darkness and \"dungeon\" feel that is really thrilling to play through. The enemies are fun as well, I enjoy finding them and having to react. I also really like the movement between rooms, the randomization, and the combat-parry system is very enjoyable, though not perfect.\n\nI think one thing would be nice is more of a HUD system. I know they're a bit immersion breaking but I think concessions toward gameplay are necessary.  Perhaps health, a minimap, skill display (see below), arrow/ammo count...\n\nI'd also like to see more customization of my character. The classes and 3-stats that I've seen are a good start, but the classes themselves feel a little bland. From what I can tell, they support your weapon/loadout selection but don't really change the gameplay much. I think a \"skill\" system that would really give each class a \"branch\" to be explored would be great. I haven't bought a class yet (I keep dying in stupid ways like water or the axes+light damage and collecting the money is tough!) so this could be unnecessary, I will update if so. \n\nI'd also like to see more in the way of \"loot\" and inventory. I think that there's some aversion to a more typical game inventory (slot or weight limited) given that we're in VR, but I'd like gameplay more than absolute dungeon-immersion. I know there's a blacksmith or something, though I haven't found him yet. Again, this might be unnecessary criticism. But along those lines, I'd love a \"collection\" of some sort that could be sold or built, and perhaps built into a crafting system. Again, I'm looking forward to the blacksmith and what that brings. \n\nWith that, enemies should drop items/loot right? It's why we're dungeon crawling after all! \n\nSo overall, I'm looking forward to progressing - unlocking more weapons, getting a class, getting the blacksmith and spending \"tokens,\" figuring out what the red-lantern does... I'm very excited to see this game evolve. I hope the online community grows too - right now I see it tends to hover around 5-10 people online in the evenings of eastern US. \n\nOne last thing... I don't like how my loadout is reset every time I die... It kinda kills me. \n\nThanks for the game BlackJard Softworks!\n\nEdit: Also, DESTRUCTIBLES!!!! The rooms feel so empty, and it's frustrating to explore for no reason - I feel like I should just take the first door I find. I'm not sure how that would impact performance, but I think it'd go well with the improved looting/collection/crafting system I suggested above :)", "timestamp_created": 1512449039, "timestamp_updated": 1512449408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38069943": {"recommendationid": "38069943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007701852", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 817, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512876640}, "language": "english", "review": "Addictive loot hunting dungeon crawler.

I would recommend it to anyone that has a VR headset.\n\nGood things:\n- Many different locomotion options (Normal trackpad controls, teleportation and arm swing. I prefer the normal trackpad controls as it allows for navigation whilst attacking, as arm swing controls make it quite hard to attack and walk at the same time)\n- Lots of different weaponry for different styles (Melee, ranged and magic. You can use multiple if you want too, and they are all fun to use)\n- Very atmospheric, it reminded me of a horror game the first time I played it, and it added a lot to the tension. Makes it very immersive too.\n- High replayability compared to lots of VR games (Randomly generated dungeon, blackmark tokens and chest upgrades. Co-op adds more to this too)\n- The way gold, EXP books and tokens are hidden makes it fun to search rooms.\n- At the time of writing this, you don't have to wait long for a co-op game (When playing with random people). I have also found it easy to add some people using the forums to do dungeons with too.\n- The developer is extremely active, and updates the game frequently. You can see him replying to lots of reviews and stuff in the forums quite regularly.\n- Very fun, and it feels like a proper game when most VR games feel like demos or not full games.\n\nThings that need improving:\n- You can teleport past traps and parkour parts of the dungeon (I am not sure how you would go about fixing this, as I assume the teleport option is there for those that get motion sick easily. Perhaps make a mode where you can enable teleportation, but you get 50% exp or something? So if you play with 100% exp you have to dodge the traps and do the parkour)\n- Magic AOE gets in the way of vision (If you are playing in co-op and one player uses the fire AOE spellbook, it is very hard to see the enemy that is in the fire, so if you are using melee then it is difficult to attack and defend)\n- Animations of the enemies in co-op (It is hard to tell when an enemy is blocking or attacking when multiple people are attacking an enemy at once, as the enemy displays the animation that shows it has got hit repeatedly. Makes melee quite difficult in teams, but when there is no co-op, it is a lot easier to tell what the enemy is doing)\n- Only 1 type of enemy in each room (I would like it if there were mixed enemies, so you would have to fight melee orcs while also dodging skeleton archer arrows)\n- Nightmare mode is too easy (I have seen a lot of people say the same, I have yet to lose in nightmare mode. It is still very fun though, but there isn't much risk of dying unless you are completely new to the game)\n- The arm swing navigation is default (I found it quite hard to navigate during the tutorial.

It is easily the most engaging, immersive, and simply downright fun VR game I have played as of yet. I have always been a fan of dungeon crawlers, and VR Dungeon Knight encapsulates that perfectly, from the terrifying (at first, at least) atmosphere right down to the rewarding sense of character progression given both by a system of leveling up and statting points towards your style of play, unlocking new armor-sets to fully support your style of play, and obviously the loot system, allowing you to unlock and upgrade new weapons. Now, lets get down to the pros and the cons :\n\nPros:\n\n*Incredibly atmospheric and immersive art style\n*An awesome and active developer who is constantly updating the game, with both gameplay and bug-fixes!\n*Performs very well, with barely any framerate inconsistencies (Especially given the new update as of Nov. 23rd)\n*Infinite replayablility, with procedurely generated dungeons with two difficulties (Normal for just a quick dungeon crawl \n     to blow a few minutes, nightmare for those seeking a truly thrilling and tense crawl)\n*A mind-boggling amount of environments, all of them beautifully built. Even though it may seem immersion-breaking to  \n     from one moment be in a dark, creepy castle to end up in archaic ruins, only to then find yourself in a snow-blanketed \n     forest, it honestly isn't. All it does is give variety to your experience, and ensure you never get bored of your \n     surroundings.\n*A large variety of different monsters for you to dissasemble on your adventures, all with great animations, sound effects, \n     and even, to some extent, fighting manuevers (Attempting to parry, attacking from different directions, etc)\n*The pure fear that comes in your first few dungeons as you slowly walk through the dark environments, and inevitably \n     run into your first baddie and have a couple heart attacks. This effect fades away after time after you learn which areas\n     can actually have baddies, how the baddies behave, etc.\n\nCons (There aren't many) :\n\n*Not many players! Dungeon crawling by myself is fun, but there is never anyone in the public lobbies to do some co-op \n     with. You have to pre-group with people from the forums or have friends IRL who also play it.\n*You cant save a load-out of gear, making you re-equip all your weapons and utility items after every dungeon.\n*Not enough variety with the bosses! The only mini-boss is the giant armored orc, and the only end-of-dungeon boss is \n     the necromancer dude - An exact, if smaller and weaker, replica of the final boss fight.\n\nAll in all, it is a fantastic game that I look forward to playing more and seeing more of what the developer has to offer for this game. I have never written a steam review before, but the entire journey from my first dungeon, with no armor set, a level 1 lantern in one hand and a short sword in the other, all the way to now at lvl 16 with my level 2 Marked Katana, Dungeon Knight and Ranger armor sets, and my trusty lvl 20 crossbow and lvl 18 bow has driven me to finally write one. \n\n(TL:DR -  Get the game.

Very immersive, you will find yourself slowly checking around every corner, climbing up and over pits, and even going prone to fit through some spots. Overall I have had loads of fun, especially for the low asking price. If you like D&D and have VR, give this a shot.\n\nDetails/specifics and feedback below:\n\nThe enemies are always threatening, as you can't take many hits, and with no healing (Minus some self regen from red to orange post fight), you regret taking damage. There are a decent number of types, although it is only 1 type per room currently. The rooms. My goodness, there are alot of them. You will eventually see them all, but from the giant open pillars, snowy mountain, open forest in addition to a whole host of dungeon rooms, you will be surprised at how long that it takes. Soom of the rooms are breaks from the action, with no enemies, giving a chance for you to explore and look for loot, or even the key to continue. You do eventually pick up on which rooms are like this, but it took a while, so even a transition room with no enemies can make you cautious.\n\nLoot system helps to keep the tension, as you only get upgrades/weapon unlocks IF you clear a dungeon. Decent weapon and playstyle variety, thanks to armor sets and levels. The current build for weapon holsters is great, 1 on the back, 3 at the waist. Feels great to pull arrows from a quiver on the back. Weight has an impact on locomotion, but I couldn't feel any difference with teleport. Give the arm motion running a try, feels very nice to charge up to an enemy and have them taste cold steel.... even if when you crouch or drop prone, it can look and feel funny.\n\nMagic is boring but practical, as you just hold trigger to charge up an attack, and sit there waiting for it to power up. Could really use some hand movements, perhaps to reduce the casting time. You can waggle your way to victory with swords, but common, immersive yourself damnit! Take some proper swings.  A lack of arrows (If not a ranger), or findable equipment mid run can hurt some weapon choices (Why take a crossbow with 4 shots over a spell book with unlimited casts?) Nit picky, but the short bow is extremely small looking in your hands. Really could use a long bow. Same for the katana, the handle is massive.\n\nCo-op is hilarious, as it is equal parts buggy as it can be fun, but as has been stated is a work in progress. I have had the game spawn us into the darkness outside of a room and trapped us (Had to restart game, as there is no exit dungeon or menu), enemies ignored me for agro (Including the final boss who spawned!) and accidently equipped my weapon onto my partner's belt... even though they had a sword there. Having a room to kill enemies while you wait for the game to find a buddy is a superb idea, although you are limited with what spawns in the room. Would be nice to keep what you equip into here. Or for that matter, when you die or finish a run.\n\nOnce a room is clear of baddies, the tension is lifted, as every enemy heads towards you when you agro one. It would make a huge difference if I had to slowly check each corner for some of these rooms. Some sort of agro radius that prevents all of them from coming would help that. There is a massive need for some traps to be added to some of the \"safe\" rooms to help this same problem. Some more mini-bosses would be a great addition (Think Diablo... standard mob but more health, randomized name above its head and bam, your golden). Throw-able weapons would be excellent as well.

I always felt less powerful than the enemy and felt that my health pool was way under what it should be but you can level weapons, put points in skills to raise health/damage and lower recharging.The armor also helps add upgrades as well. Takes work and patience to upgrade. 2. I wish the graphics of the mobs were more realistic not cartoony. The dungeons looked fine and were quite varied. Even with my minor complaints I still think the dev did a great job on the game. This is the kind of game I wanted in VR and the co-op makes it that much better.

I own it for oculus rift and played co-op with my friend for a short while.\nPros/Cons\n\n\nGraphics\nPros:\nDungeons feel mostly unique although some rooms are completely pointless.\nWeapons look alright\nEnemies are somewhat varied (In my 2 hours playing i've seen about 6 different enemy types)\nThere seems to be some funny graphical error when playing co-op where your friend has 4 hands instead of 2.\n\nIn-Game options\nPros:\nYou can swap from head-direction to hand direction movement\nShadows/Scaling options to make it look more realistic\nYou can turn off body images so you only see your inventory when looking down rather than a body/legs which can reduce motion sickness.\nCons:\nWish we had options to set if the user has oculus or vive. Certain gameplay elements like climbing are difficult when using snap turning and it makes you lose grip/fall in game (primarily for oculus due to sensor placement).\n\n\nWeapons: \nPros: Varied amounts like pistols, arrows, sword and shield, spear, magic spells, etc. (I think roughly 12 weapons currently)\nCons: 'leveling' the weapon feels good with the chest animations and sounds, but falls so short in terms of power and utility. My level 9 Lantern is the exact same as my level 1 was. I also read on the forums that getting higher level magic spells has ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT on its damage, it only increases the books weight.\n\nThis is a big one...\nFor Oculus Users, the magic spells you can cast from wielding a book are always misaligned with your hand.\nUsing magic forces you to angle your hand further down than the hand model moves in game, causing a lot of immersion breaking frustration.\n2 Handed weapons handle weirdly; Basically, if you grasp the weapon with your left hand and hold the trigger button, it'll enable 2 hand wielding, where your second hand grabs the higher part up on the weapon instead of the lower piece. This factor makes swinging 2h weapons awkward.\n\nClasses\nPros:\nThe current available list of classes feel impactful when used.\nCons\nsmall selection\nRanger feels near impossible to enjoy without the class outfit as you are constantly running out of arrows.\n\nStat distribution\nPros:\ndescriptive so when utilized you know what each stat improves.\nCons:\nHaving character levels should be a more focused point. Lazily strolling through a dungeon, leveling, throwing a few points into a slot doesn't feel super rewarding without actually EARNING something, (IE. A skill or cosmetic change).\n\nInventory\nPros 4 total slots seems like plenty\neasy access locations\nIn co-op you can share your weapons with your ally. He got a level 3 iron shield and you're stuck with a level 1 wooden shield? he can pick his off the wall and throw it your way to use!\n\nCombat\nPros: you can shield bash, peak around corners and shoot ranged weapons and dual wield multiple swords and daggers.\nCons: Initial impact with enemies may involve glitching out. The enemy will stutter back and forth taking damage and spewing copious amounts of blood until they fall over and explode\nThe health 'meter' you have is located on your belt so if you don't look down at your crotch you wont know how healthy you are; and even if you do check there is not a very accurate way for the game to tell you how much health you have in numbers. The health meter simply says things like \"Very healthy\" or \"Wounded- Heavy\"\nI feel that a number or percentage visual located in a more convenient place without cluttering your view would be ideal. Maybe something like checking your pulse in game can reveal how much damage you've suffered.\n\nExploration\nPros: This blows my mind. Turning sideways to slide through crevices or going prone to crawl through some caverns. This game ALWAYS has you moving, but doesnt make you feel like you've ran a marathon.\nIts action packed or can be played as a complete rogue-lite experience and you can sneak around every dungeon and enemy and get bonus points for doing it!\nCons: Although there are tons of new areas to discover i have also experienced many bugs playing this. One bug was entering a room with absolutely no exit door or any door that would open (no enemies or monster locks or key guarded doors in the vicinity) and another bug was entering a completely pitch black room; Both of those rooms only occurred during co-op sessions forcing us to restart the game.\n\nOverall i really enjoy this game and would recommend trying it out with a friend for some engaging co-op\nIts very true this game is getting regular updates from the wonderful One Person Dev Team. So, if this review isnt helping to sway your opinion, keep an open mind for the future because VR Dungeon Knight does show promise as a leading rogue-lite rpg for VR.\n", "timestamp_created": 1509875177, "timestamp_updated": 1509875177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36286508": {"recommendationid": "36286508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079667904", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511438274}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s franchement sympa : explorez des donjons g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s al\u00e9atoirement, pr\u00e9parez-vous \u00e0 mourir souvent, am\u00e9liorez votre \u00e9quipement...

At times you will have to crawl on your hands and knees to navigate the world. You will have to carry a torch through dimly lit rooms, and climb vines (like in legend of zelda, or any RPG)\n-If you get treasure chests, the loot is kept in your private weapon vault, and you can level up weapons and find new gear by completing challenges in dungeons. \n-The gold you find in dungeons is used to buy classes or amor, which you can unlock and switch between before entering dungeons.\n-The \"feel\" of the different weapons are all unique and each feel as though they require some skill to master.\n-You CAN NOT just swing your sword around and kill units, you must time your hits, block attacks, and dodge out of the way -- to successful outskill the enemy units.\n-There are a ton of different locomotion options available to players.\n- The game has magic, melee, and ranged weapons. All of these are a lot of fun to play around with.\n- Minibosses and dungeon bosses are a real kick when they show up. \n- You really can tailor your experience to be however you see fit in RPGS. You can run in and hack and slash, or you can use spells to lay traps for your opponents, or you can snipe orcs with bows from range. \n- If playing in multiplayer, you really have to communicate with your partners. \n-There are updates occuring often and the dev seems really invested in this game.\n\nCons\n- Only 2 player Coop is available at this time. It is a shame because I have several friends and we would all like to play in the same session. \n- The music is alright ( most of the time I find myself listening to adventuring music through spotify)\n- The player animations in Coop are wonky, almost elastic looking\n- You will get some jump scares (could be a good thing, but up to personal preference)\n- Some weapons feel more polished than others", "timestamp_created": 1509378319, "timestamp_updated": 1512436792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36063576": {"recommendationid": "36063576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009876564", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 65, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508899759}, "language": "english", "review": "terrifying!

A game like this really shines with variety, and that is something that still needs a little more time to grow, as currently you'll often be fighting orcs (in two color varieties!) or searching for that key on the bookshelf again.\n\nStill, I'm excited to discover what the future brings for this game, and even in its current state it is one of the best (and most fun) VR Dungeon crawling experiences you'll find.

It presents an atmosphere I can get into and has dungeons that actually have some atmosphere and some amount of variety.\n\nThat said, I'd like to lay out the things I found very frustrating.\n\nThere need to be more options for locomotion. Specifically I want controller-based movement (point controller to the \"forward\" direction), which was promised a long time ago. It's painful to have to move my thumb around the touch pad just to maintain course while turning my head. This is compounded during a fight. Very immersion breaking. :( I might as well use my uber teleportation powers that would consistently get me where I want to go without having to look\nSpeaking of which:\n[Personal pet peeve] IMHO teleportation is not immersive, no matter how many people play the \"no motion sickness\" card. I think if the player can teleport, that should be a natural thing the character can do and should be explained somehow. I have nothing against being able to teleport! I have lots of things against offering it as the primary mode of movement in a game about a lowly knight that can not only barely wield a sword, but barely knows magic, if at all! Yet you're somehow a teleportation wizard! And THEN you're ALSO given the option of literally gimping yourself and NOT teleporting [/PPP]\nYou're not the only one that does this, but just wanted to put that out there. ;) Maybe your character could have some kind of teleportation pacifier that they pick up from the config room ;P Lol, that'd be awesome\n\nI also would like to use the bow, but I've been spoiled by better implementations (no offense). The bow in this game has such a tiny draw length that I feel like I'm using a cheap sucker dart bow from a dollar store. I understand the need to keep things functional for smaller audience members, but perhaps things like this can be auto-scaled based on player height?\nSecond weapon gripe: How use two hands for two hand sword? I tried gripping (which swaps hands), triggering, menuing, swiping/pressing touchpad, etc. Could not figure out. Will not use. Damage bonus aside, I'm here for immersion. :P Maybe change name to \"Long Sword\" and encourage pairing with empty hand?\n\nPlease keep that in mind... especially since the tech is not yet mainstream. People have less and less patience for poorly implemented VR mechanics. I've noticed this way more in my VR mates than in myself. One of them made it through your intro stage, and immediately quit because he was convinced solely from that that the controls were bad, the configuration options were bad, and the story telling, graphics, sounds, music, atmosphere (things that other POS VR publications on the store don't even offer) didn't help to hold it up... because mechanics make a game and without them the game wasn't worth playing.\nYou can hardly blame them though. I mean, you can only tolerate so many cheap VR games that are truly bad and somehow make it to the store because \"forget quality, we NEED VR games\" before you start getting use to dropping a game early because it's \"probably bad\".  :/\n\nThe atmosphere of the dungeons was very well done! Was super creeped out when I went into one for the first time ... and was heckled for having brought no weapons to the party. Kudos for that little easter egg! Bad kudos for not telling me ahead of time and not allowing me to confirm my poor life choice. :P Continuing from this experience, it was also made apparent to me (or maybe not) that you cannot LEAVE a dungeon you've entered... unless you kill the game. :(\n\nAll in all, this is definitely Early Access, but you're making a very promising game here! I wanted more from Vanishing Realms... but as the name suggested, it vanished. Hope yours goes above and beyond!

I am going to make a list of \"bug, likes, dislikes, want to see\" from my personal prospective of the game, I do highly recommend this game. \n\nLikes:  \n\n1. The music at times will make your heart skip a beat as if you are being chased or hiding from jason voorhees himself, especially in nightmare dungeons.\n2. It is great that you are able to choose the way you  move around in the game rather it be teleport or arm swing or both. \n3. The developer is updating the game and listening to peoples comments.\n4. There are different classes, A good variety of weapons and a level system for weapons and character stats.\n5. Some of the levels are well made and make you really want to look around, The developer has made exploration of the bigger maps very satisfying visually with things like alters or well placed statues or broken doors. It makes you want to look around instead of just run to the next room like some of the simpler levels.\n6. combat is very satisfying and keeps you guessing where to block, you really need to watch your opponents. \n\nDislikes: - everything i write here is just miner things I have seen, Also it is not to say that these will not be fixed as the game is still in early access mode-\n\n1. The levels that have the night sky are good levels but the night sky needs work as it is very grainy.\n2. There is a certain room that is obnoxiously huge with pillers everywhere and almost always has enemys, the problem is that you are stuck in that large (barely visable room) for a set amount of time trying to find a door and there is nothing to visually satisfy you at all, It is just pillers, walls, floor, ceiling.\n3. So far there is no fall damage implimented in the game, I see many people just speed climb everywhere and loot rooms but when they are done they just fall because they know it will not hurt, I believe falling from 13 or more feet might cause a little damage and help with the immersion in the game.  -honestly i would laugh till i was red in the face if my coop partner fell from the top of the inverted level to his death.-\n4. There is no gender selection.\n\nbugs: - A list of things I have found \n\n1. grabing weapons and putting them on your belt or trading weapons with a friend in coop will glitch your belt and make certain belt slots unuseable.\n2. dropping weapons will sometimes glitch back to your belt and make slot on belt un useable. \n3. In waiting for coop mode your character slowly slides forward without you touching your controlers, this can be seen by watching the floor. \n4. When a player dies in coop sometimes they are never revived on the next level.\n5. black screen of death *game crash* (rare) when changing doors to next level  -this can happen to both players in coop or just 1 player, if player is lucky they will return from black screen of death at the next level-.\n\nWANT TO SEE!!: - This is a list of things I would love to see in this game and some of them I also believe the game really needs, also a couple of ideas!-\n\n1. Uniform Dungeons -  while the dungeon rooms are randomly generated you will eventually end up outside, Instead of it being day time then nighttime then snowy, Id love to see duengons keep consistency of weather and day and night. \n2. More statues and pictures on walls, book cases. - things to add to atmosphere. \n3. Puzzles!! \n4. booby traps!  examples: weak floor that gives out and you fall onto spikes, exploding symbols on floors or walls, rooms where the walls shrink and eventually squish you, rooms that fill with water untill you are submerged and die.\n5. At least 5 more enemy types -not just recolors-\n6. Differnt types of mini bosses and bosses - not just the way they look but the attacks as well, it would be awesome to fight a boss or miniboss that have different classes.\n7. elemental weapons.\n8. more spells.\n9.  more staffs to use.\n10. throwing weapons.\n11. when your partner dies his body stays there until the next room -seeing his dead body just adds laughs-\n12.  being able to select your gender.\n13. Fall damage.\n14. more classes\\armor\n\nweapon/armor Ideas:::::: brain storm::::\n\n1. Phantasm Staff : spawns blue phantasms, when fully leveled you can charge the staff to spawn a stationary green projectile phantasm.\n2. Book of ice : shoots shards/spikes of ice, when charged it can freeze up to 3 enemys with a blast. \n3. book of the necromancer: (levels 1-5) summons small troll for 10 seconds, 2 at a time only (levels 6-11) summons skeletons/non archer for 10 seconds, 2 at a time only. (levels 12-15) summons green orc for 10 seconds, 2 at a time only. (levels 16-19)  summons red orc or skeleton archer for 10 seconds, 2 at a time only. (level 20) summons skeleton orc for 10 seconds, 2 at a time only.\n4. Book of steel: shoots a phantasmal sword, when charged it shoots 3 swords.\n5. Book of Defense : deploys a shield for 6 seconds, when charged can enchant you or partner to negate a hit.\n6. two handed axe\n7. scythe (two handed)\n8. mirror shield - sends back energy projectiles \n9. Sorcerer robe - boosts on books\n10. wizard robe - boosts on staffs\n11. cleric armor - boosts on healing or support  - read the update about possible healing potions and such-\n12. battle mage armor - boosts on one handed and magic. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507595556, "timestamp_updated": 1507595556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35587349": {"recommendationid": "35587349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963344069", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509389826}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best and most immersive early access dungeon games Ive found.

Love the classes, love the equipment, love the skill points.  The randomization of each dungeon is so cool and I can't wait to see what kind of new rooms and things are added into the game.  I've been playing for 5 hours and from time to time will encounter a room I've never seen.  I want to say that you are doing an amazing job Blackjard and the game is already amazing without my following suggestions and ideas, but I am enjoying what you've made so much that if I can inspire you in any way with some ideas I would be honored.\n\nMy Suggestions and Ideas:\n\n- The last room in each dungeon that has the core you need to destroy feels like it needs some kind of encounter like there is no boss at the end of the dungeon.  I mean I understand the Necromancer is basically the boss of the game and all, but just feels like the last room with the core in it needs some kind of fight, even if it's just a bunch of hard enemies or something.\n\n- A way to heal like finding a health pot somewhere in the dungeon would be cool.  Maybe make it so that if you die, there is a little more of a harsh punishment than just respawning in the very next room, and balance it by adding rare health pots sometimes.\n\n- Maybe some way to make the classes work together like a mage can add a fire spell to a warrior's sword and it gets a small damage buff for a short time.\n\n- Ultimate abilities that you can unlock for Mage, Warrior, and Thief.  They would cost you a tonnnn of gold or a ton of skill pointsto unlock, and maybe only useable once per dungeon or something.  (short invulnerability for warrior, massive AOE damage spell like a meteor or something for mage, and short time of invisibility for thief or something like that).\n\n- A feature where I can have separate save files so that I can have different characters at different levels.  I would be able to enjoy playing all the classes without completely resetting the skill points every time.  Also would allow me to play with friends who just got the game and are starting at level 1 without it feeling like I'm overpowered compared to them.  I guess would be similar to having different characters on WoW of each class.\n\n- One of my favorite parts so far was a long corridor where you entered and the door you came through was on the floor beneath your feet, and you had to climb to the top where the next door was on the ceiling.  More of this kind of thing would be cool.  Rooms that are twisted and trippy with doors in interesting places.\n\n\nI know that was a lot of suggestions, but this game really gets my mind thinking.

There is plenty of content for VR that focuses on gun combat, so this really stands out as a sword & sorcery experience. This game is scarier than you'd think. The cartton style would make you think that you won't be nervous playing it, but peeking around dark corners listening for that skeleton that you know will end you is truly an experience. Being able to climb certain surfaces adds to the sense of adventure, too. \n\nThere are still some immersion breaking features. You can still just flail your arms in what I call the \"blender on a stick\" strategy, and the enemy's AI is pretty simple. Once one spots you, every baddy in the room comes down on you. It turns into a cycle of getting seen, and holding your ground for five minutes while everything runs into your spazzy spear. \n\nPlus the game generates arms and a body for you as opposed to just floating hands, which is very nice. \n\nOverall, this game feels like a very fleshed-out demo for something amazing.

It's like a bunch of the other games combined into a dungeon crawler. The only game I have that makes me feel like I actually travel somewhere, instead of just taking elevators or standing in a roomscale area. \n\nRanged combat: Bow, crossbows, pistols. Each has its own style but all are fun to use.\n\nMelee combat: One handed, two handed, shield, dual wield. Pick your poison and get up close and personal.\n\nMagic combat: Staff or spellbooks. These are fun but you need to use them wisely.\n\nExploration: This one was the wildcard I didn't expect. Climb ivy up the walls and onto ceilings to find hidden gold or xp books. Find gold under tables and benches, behind bookcases and up on rafters. Use these to get a better position in a fight or avoid fights.\n\nStealth: Also unexpected. It was so intuitive, just crouch and suddenly you're harder to spot. Sneak up on or sneak around enemies. Warning: crouching through an entire dungeon can be exhausting.\n\nContinued Support: I thought I was late to the party on this game, and yet as I opened the door to the next room I was shocked to find myself in a village instead of a dark corridor. Suddenly there was plenty of room for enemies to try and flank me, for me to sneak around patrols and for me to sprint from one enemy to the next, hacking away. Updates are still coming and they are pretty significant. The developer listens to the community and does great work. \n\nConclusion: I think this game is well worth the money. I think this game is the standard others should be held up to. There is great use of the VR gear and there's a lot of stuff to keep you coming back for more.

It's still a little rough around the edges, but I didn't feel like I was paying a big VR tax for what I got (20$ at the time of writing).\n\nI played this on Oculus Touch, entirely with teleportation locomotion and extensive use of snap-turning since I am not really set up for or comfortable with roomscale or smooth motion, but I still had a lot of immersive experiences. Trodding through a dark dungeon, looking out for loot and ambushing enemies, clambering up and around hanging vines (this type of motion didn't bother me), crouching  or (very rarely) going prone so I could transport through tight spaces, it gives a strong feeling of exploration.\n\nSome caveats is I would say people with mobility issues could have trouble exploring every nook and cranny of the game or to just sneak around (the dev has stated they are looking to implement crouch-height adjustment options), but mere lack of fitness is no obstacle. I'm in terrible shape, and though I struggled a bit with an optional sub-dungeon where going fully prone was necessary (made all the more difficult by my less-than-perfect sensor coverage near the floor) I was able to make it through nonetheless, and the regular procedurally-generated dungeons have never required anything more difficult than crouching.\n\nThe difficulty curve can also be a little unpredictable. Some of the traps and terrain would be very difficult to traverse with 'arm swinger' or other smooth locomotion, but relatively easy with careful use of teleportation. Melee enemies are generally very easy except for one particularly stealthy / quick type, while ranged enemies are very deadly especially for the unprepared.\n\nI haven't made time to play any VR games in a few weeks so I haven't tried the latest build that came out Sept 15th (I don't make much time to game at all these days), but VR Dungeon Knight is one of the titles I'd like to make more time for. They've added more rooms to explore and more gear to unlock, both things I would consider to be valuable content. Variety is already a strongpoint for this game compared to other VR titles.\n\nI notice a lot in a lot of VR games, people have quite short hours played, and I'm definitely part of that trend. Sometimes it is due to a lack of longevity in gameplay, but I think with this game it's a factor of how the VR experience is processed. Something about it being a bit new, and also a bit strenuous, is that short play sessions feel longer and more satisfying than the kind of games I'm used to. I can hit the 5 hour mark in a traditional CRPG easily even if I'm not enjoying it, I can hit the double digits with no sweat in a strategy game I don't care for, but somehow with a VR title I love I'll play maybe an hour a day and feel that's quite sufficient. It also feels like a bigger commitment of energy and enthusiasm just getting in the mindset of booting up an active VR experience, which is probably why I've spent so little time in Robo Recall, Star Trek: Bridge Crew, H3VR, etc, even though my experience in those games and this one are definitely positive.

The weapons work well and the spell casting system is easy to use.  You have tons of melee and ranged options from carrying two pirate pistols to crossbows, bow and arrow, swords, maces, shields etc.  While at the beggining the Warrior class and meele seems like the easiest way to complete a dugeon, I personally prefer the ranger and the bow works great and causes a whole lot of damage.  \nPros: \nEver changing and challenging dungeons to explore\nThe climbing system to get over obstacles is extremely well done\nGraphics \nSound quality and voice over \nAmbiance \nChoice of Locomotion \u2013 onward format, arm swinging, teleport \nWeapon placement has been improved and not clunky any more \n\nCons/suggestions:\nIn the multiplayer room, allowing one to keep the pre-configured weapons while waiting and practicing on the spawns.  \nThe grip for the shoulder if the area that counts as one grabbing (for example an arrow) could be widened it would be great.  In the heat of battle it is hard sometimes to accurately grad one.", "timestamp_created": 1505175488, "timestamp_updated": 1505517307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34891934": {"recommendationid": "34891934", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972915600", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505779707}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: This game is looking like a hidden gem and I would love to see more players.\n\nI have only played this game a short time and crashed after about 80 minutes; however, that is about the only con so far.

(I generally prefer locomotion over teleportation) \n\nThe combat is lacking in fluidity, but its obvious that the combat will be great in the future due to the parry and dodge features. The difference in weapon selection really makes the combat dynamic and feel like a real adventure.  The weapon belt is a little intrusive, though it works quite well with the quiver since you can grab an arrow without even looking down.\n\nAlthough the rooms and hallways are somewhat limited, you enter from different places and for the first few hours its hardly even noticable. Another thing that I am sure will be expanded.\n\nThe low variances in enemies was expected, but what I think the game could ultimately see as a striving endeavor is a stronger difference in enemy models, behaviors, and attacks.\n\nOverall the game is great and well worth the money any day.

There are AAA games with terrible music but this game has some great tunes.\n\nThings I didn't like\n-The weapons felt a little small to me, still functional.\n-The 2-handed on the heavy sword was akward and hard to swing.

I setup the game to use the teleport method (Which is a huge one up in my book as I am not a fan of the locomotion).\n\nBug:\nWas perpendicular to the ground after passing through a door and I could not correct it. I had to exit the game via the oculus home screen. I was using a fire magic book and had the trigger pulled to max (Right hand). I then used my left hand to grab the door (The one with the book). When I passed in I was standing on the door. It would let me teleport on and around the door, but I could not correct my angle. So the hallway I would normally walk down appeared above my head as if I was at the bottom of a well.\n\nGameplay issues:\nI found the enemies to be too fast moving for the weapon mechanics. There seems to be a delay in the sword swings and a big delay in the fire casting. But the enemies seem to be really fast at attacking. My only option seemed to be to hide behind a wall and try to poke out to attack. My biggest gripe is just that it seems like the enemies are too fast and also too powerful. I seemed to die after just 2-3 hits. Maybe spread out the difficulty a little more and have like a beginner mode or be more lenient at the lower levels until the mechanics can be fully realized before making it so hard.\n\nI could not figure out how to heal. I was wounded and near death, but I had no healing ability or potions I could use. Or at least none that I could find.\n\nI had to grab my weapons each time I died. This for me was extremely annoying as I was dying over and over trying to understand the mechanics. This was also the same for setting the difficulty of the dungeon. I understand being teleported back to the beginning again, but it felt tedious and un-necessary to have to \"Reset\" all of the options before I could go back into the dungeon again.\n\nThe constant blood over the eyes when \"Near death\" was horrible. I could hardly see and it was frustrating. Please find some other mechanic that is not so intrusive when you are low health. Or make this a temporary effect, since (and again, at least no way I could find) there seems to be no way to heal. But to have it permanently on and no way to remove it was infuriating, not to mention is strained the eyes.\n\nThe equipping of weapons is very clunky. Forget about being able to swap weapons in a fight. There should be an ability to hot swap, or re-design the \"Tool belt\" idea. The tool belt mechanic seems to be clunky and holding back the gameplay. I understand that it is supposed to generate immersion, but it is doing so at the cost of smooth mechanics. With as fast as the enemies seem to move, I don\u2019t think I would ever be able to grab any other weapon on the belt. I also hate having to look down to see what I am grabbing. Then try to grab it, which I found I often would grab the wrong thing or simply drop the weapon I was holding. The belt idea might work better if it only carried two things and each trigger on the controller allowed you to grab them. Even though you could not hold as many items, it works really well in Robo Recall that way. Also Robo Recall utilizes the ability to grab something on your back. This would work great for a shield and sword for the back (Left and right shoulder) and then two items on the hips. That seemed to have a very fluid and less clunky fell to it. It also allowed you to quickly grab things as the locations of the items were very distinct, and you don\u2019t have to look at anything, but when you put your hands to the side or shoulders you knew what weapon you were grabbing.\n\nI know the game is early access, and I am a programmer myself, so I know the value of feedback. But these are my two cents. I think working on improving these features would have a great benefit to the game.\n\nP.S. As far as I can tell I don't see any functionality tied to the buttons on the controller (Unless I am missing something. I am using an Oculus btw) those buttons seem like a great place to use some kind of weapon switching or inventory system to get rid of the belt.\nAlso, (On the Oculus Rift at least) the hands seemed to be pointing perpendicular to my own when I held the remote. When I would hold my had out in front of me with my fingers pointing forward, the in-game hands fingers seemed to be pointing up towards the wall. This is not a huge deal, but I figured it was worth mentioning.\n\nIf these issues were worked on, then I feel like this game has the potential to be great. I feel like \u201cNot Recommended\u201d Is a little harsh, but since I only have a choice between \u201cNot Recommended\u201d and \u201cRecommended\u201d I would have to side with the \u201cNot Recommended just slightly more as of 9/2/17. I will be sure to update this if the experience improves. Like I said, it really does have some true potential, but, in my opinion, these things are holding it back.

Struggle through the tutorial with arm swinger and you can open up Onward style trackpad locomotion. I love that we're given several options here I just wish it could be accessed sooner. I can definitely see people getting in, seeing arm swinger and teleport and asking for a refund. It's a very extremist subject.\n\nFull body avatars with decent IK! No more floating in space... It's not perfect but we haven't seen a perfect full body implementation yet so I don't hold that against them. At least they tried and they did a decent job.\n\nLoot! Looks like we'll be finding weapons in chests that we get from clearing dungeons and we'll be finding gold that we can use to unlock armor with very class specific bonuses such as improved sneaking or damage resist.\n\nProceduraly generated dungeons keep each dive new and interesting. We also have dungeon difficulties; Normal and Nightmare. According to the bonus tracker at the end of the mission each floor has a sub boss to find and kill so exploration is rewarded.\n\nOne of the things I've seen while playing after the initial gameplay video was that some of the randomly generated rooms are vertical. You'll walk into a room and will only be able to climb up to a hatch at the top of the room periodically needing to stop climbing and walk across a beam to start climbing on the other side. It was a nice rare experience.\n\nSome of my issues with the game:\n\nAs I mentioned above. Being forced into arm swinger at the start of the game isn't the best idea IMO. Give us the option at the start of the game.\n\nSpeaking of the start of the game, don't just dump us into a cinematic as soon as the game starts. Wait for some interaction on our part. This one is more a pet peeve for me as I think most people start the game with the HMD on already but still...\n\nWhile reviewing the footage, the music seems a little too Mad Hatter, bright and happy in the beginning that doesn't seem to mesh with the surroundings in some areas. I didn't really notice i in game though.\n\nWhile we're on audio... Some of the sound effects are much louder than they should be. Mostly around magic which I ended up not using much of in this video.\n\nIt's going to be a bit grindy. You'll need to bring a friend to stave off some of that repetitious feeling. No friends? You better love the crawl as you'll find no story here to distract from the grind.\n\nMost importantly, there are some game breaking bugs. At the end of the video I fall off the bridge and needed to exit the game and restart the game. While in one of the dungeons I fell through the floor and nearly got stuck. These need to get fixed sooner rather than later.\n\nNo quit button!\n\nUltimately I'm somewhat neutral on the game but leaning towards a thumbs up in spite of some of its faults because I did enjoy myself in the end. I think the game will be more enjoyable with a friend but if you like dungeon crawling this should scratch that VR itch.\n\nI would love it if we could create our own dungeons and populate it with monsters we've defeated and have others play through our work.

I was so impressed I'm writing a review.  I never write reviews.  \n\nAs far as VR games go, this is a great one.  One of the only VR games that has me daydreaming about playing it while I'm at work.  \n\nSpooky dungeons, good ambient sounds and combat music, A STEALTH MECHANIC (rad!), and a relatively fun loot system.  The monsters look cool, too.  Seeing an orc's glowing eyes and hearing the heavy footsteps in in the pitch black dark of the dungeon as he shambles towards me gives me a thrill every time.\n\nWeapon System - You have to load yourself out in the weapon room before every dungeon.  This is to avoid multiplayer bugs, but I actually LIKE having to arm myself before each run.  Adds a little immersion.  I believe an automatic loudout system is planned for the future.   Various ranged, melee and magic weapons are available to unlock.  All fun to use, imho.  VR Lantern Knight ftw\n\nLoot System - You can find gold in the dungeons, which you can purchase new armor with.  The armor looks cool when you wear it and gives you bonuses based on stealth, magic, archery, and damage reduction. At the end of each dungeon you get a set amount of treasure chests (with possibility of a bonus) that give you weapons as well as level upgrades for those weapons.  Overall pretty rewarding, but it would be cool to be able to find treasure chests on the ground in dungeons as well.\n\nFighting System - Pretty good fighting, but things can get a little weird in close quarters.  Sometimes if I was too close to a monster, my swings wouldn't register until I backed up a bit.  Nothing gamebreaking at all, you just gotta get used to the optimal fighting distance at first.   Fun sword/shield combat.   The monsters don't seem to swing their weapons the same way every time.  I don't know if this is good coding or what, but if I just hold my shield in one general place, they eventually swing around it and hit me.   Cool.   At first, I thought monsters only attacked you one at a time, but if they can come down another hallway and flank you, you'll be takin it from both sides.  But lets be honest, you're used to that.\n\nClimbing Mechanic - This is cool!  You can clammer up vines found peppered throughout the dungeons that lead to loot, keys to unlock the next room, alternate exits, or just a sneaky archer/thief/caster spot.   It's one of my favorite features.   \n\nStealth System - Crouch to go into stealth mode, your screen turns blue and your movement slows a bit.  Enemies take a bit longer to detect you.  Seems to be effected by the ambient lighting, which is cool, but unconfirmed.  Sometimes the bastards just see me.  Stealth kills seem to work with every weapon (spells?

I'll just do it in list style otherwise I'm going to write a book.\n\n1. The multiplayer is amazing. You're at the top of the stairs with a sword and board. Your mage partner is behind you. Arrows flying at you both from the skeleton archers below but you're pro status and blocking that shit with your buckler. You got an orc coming up the stairs and your partner says move right. You do, you see a flash of magic fly past your head with a booming sound. That skeleton archer is dust. The orc swings but you catch it with your sword for a parry. You throw some swings in and move again while your mage turns them into plasma. That fight's over, but you hear footsteps in the distance..\n\n2. Minor boss spoiler. [spoiler] If you've played the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time and remember the Shadow Ganon fight where you swing your sword at a magic orb and knock it back and forth until it hits him? It's better in VR. [/spoiler]\n\n3. Good variety of weapons and play styles. Stealth? Yes. Magic? Yes. Tank? Yes. \n\n4. This hallway is impassible because of this huge hole in the ground. Oh wait, there's some vines on the walls, I wonder if I can climb them...\n\nFor the multiplayer alone this game is absolutely solid. If there are negatives I would say these are them.\n\n1. Can't fight on stairs. You hit the floor trying to block enemies that start swinging at your feet coming up the stairs. \n\n2. The larger enemies can clip into you sometimes, and their swings clip through walls. You need a clear face to face path to fight effectively. \n\n3. Multiple archer fights require a bit of balance for melee fighters. You move close to one archer and he draws his dagger, you parry his swing only to get shot in the face by an archer almost every single time, leaving you no room to really deal with this situation. Only shields currently are bucklers which are very small and hard to block fast moving arrows with. \n\n4. Some significant bugs. I died in the middle of a fight with four archers (refrencing the above point.) My 'ghost' or whatever could still move around and could body block all of the arrows coming at my partner. It allowed us to complete the room but clearly it's an issue. \n\n5. Need some way to heal our team mates. So far if you die, you're dead until your teammate opens a door to progress the dungeon. \n\n\nEven with these flaws, this game is a winning bet. The price point is good. The game is fantastic on your own. It's  a must have with the multiplayer.

No VR Tax here. Double the content of most VR titles at half the price. And it keeps getting better.\n\n--------\nI've tried to start this review half a dozen times, and none of those times did it feel like I was doing it due justice. \n\nFirst, I was going to talk about how, despite being in early access, there is more meat to this game then any number of completed, even \"AAA\" titles. And more is added all the time. \n\nThen, I was going to talk about how, despite obviously being a one man show, the developer is one of if not THE most responsive folks I've ever seen on Steam. When he says he wants to know what YOU want in a game, he isn't lying. I don't think there's a single thread in the discussions that he hasn't commented on or replied to, from support to suggestions. This game has every type of locomotion I was aware of, and some I had never seen before, and almost all because someone was like \"Hey man, could you add x type of movement?\". The dev would say \"I'll look into it\", and sure enough, next patch, it'd be in there. \n\nThen I tried to talk about the craftsmanship of this title, and how every corner of this world is oozing with flavor and attention to detail. Is it super high rez 8x Anti-alias'd ray shaded bleeding edge textures and malarky like that? No, far from, but it isn't slapped together either. It's obvious the developer takes the time to do the absolute best he can with every asset before it winds up in the game, and the whole thing just looks great.\n\nTHEN I tried to start with the depth of this thing, and how such a simple concept turns into such a deep well of gameplay. Weapon options, class choices, play-styles, procedural generation....this thing has it all in spades.\n\nAnd there is so much more here than advertised. I got through my first map (an absolutely delightful experience that had me ducking, crawling, shooting, thowing lightning, climbing walls, walking a balance beam and more, so you'll obviously want to have access to room scale for this) and I turned around in the completion review room to see that I had missed a whole host of challenges and apparently an entire bonus mini-boss....[i]stuff I had no idea this game even had![/i]\n\nEspecially now that this has Occulus support, there's no reason not to grab this game. And as great as it is now, it's only going to get better. Early access done right, VR done right, and just a great damn game that knows what it's trying to be and is doing that right too. \n\nFor 20 bucks, this game is a steal. No VR tax here, boys and girls.

It was a funny distraction but could quickly become annoying, especially if you're playing with randoms.\n\nThe locomotion options were varied and well implemented and the multiplayer worked flawlessly for us. The only real criticism I have aside from the being able to take your companions' gear from them is how dark the dungeons are by default. You can only see a few yards in front of you without a lantern, which I assume (haven't tested it) increases your view distance pretty significantly. I get that it's supposed to feel claustrophobic and the atmosphere definitely did add some tension when you saw the glowing eyes of enemies in the darkness, but it's still a bit shortsighted for me.

For instance, going through a door doesn't always have you facing away from the door when you enter the next room, and it can be a little disorenting.

It's not perfect mind you, the angle of the point of light on the floor vs where you aim the controller (with your real hand in the real world) seems slightly off.  But with that said, I was able to play my first game of this without getting motion sick. I also saw some cool new level areas I've never seen before... so I like that. Because of this I'm going to change my review to a positive one now.\n\nBear in mind that this game is still in early access and has lots of bugs, but the developer has certainly earned a positive rating by being so responsive to the community and continuing to actually add content and improve the gameplay. It's worth the price now. :)\n\n\nUpdated as of August 12, 2017:\nThe new update did not provide a simple and easy to use teleport mechanic. The existing teleport mechanic remains very awkward and difficult to aim and control with any accuracy. So unfortunately I still cannot recommmend this game.\n\n\nUpdated Due to Developer Response:\nThe developer Blackjard has responded to my negative review and will add an arc teleport option in one of the next updates. If it works well, I will be delighted to change my review to a positive one. Time will tell... but they defintely get bonus points for being responsive and taking care of thier player community.

Some of the doors that I went through when I got to the other side I was still facing the door (as if I went through and turned around to go back). It is repetitive. No much variety.  Not much challenge. Pretty graphics and some emersion. Early Access. \n\nYou have 3 choices. Normal dungeon, Nightmare and the Necromance dungeon (The Boss). In the NORMAL dungeons I didn't encounter an enemy. I just had to explore dark hallways to find the dungeon heart and destroy it. And when you do find it there is NO opposition. You just walk up and hit it till it explodes and then you win that level. Ho hum.\nThe Nightmare dungeons weren\u2019t but they were fun. Combat has spongy looking enemies and it's somewhat easy. \n\nI liked climbing. You can climb the vines and get to places and find gold and keys. In the tutorial beginning you learn about climbing. Use it.\n\nI like games where I can explore and that is in this game. However, like I said, it gets repetitive fast. BUT I can see how that could get better. \n\nVRDK has potential. And soooo many of us have been waiting for a game like Vanishing Realms. This .... well... not yet. \n\nI like that This is NOT a WAVE game. You know, endless onslaughts of monsters from all directions and you have to kill them. No point. Just kill or be killed. Boring for me. DK is NOT a WAVE game. Good! \n\nI\u2019m impressed that ONE person is the developer. Nice work so far. If I could rate this game from 1 to 5 it would be a 3 for now. \n\nMy view may differ from yours.

Imagine playing Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, mid game, where things are still cute but eerie and there is a sense to explore every crevice. \n\n[u]VR[/u]\nIt does a pretty good job with implementing VR the way it meant to, there are multiple options for movement (Slide, Tele and Arm Swing) and though the scaling isn't 100% I feel it attributes to the art style. Any time you see vines, climb those fuckers, more likely than not there is something to find. A small note to add, I really enjoyed that for some of the crawl spaces I had to literally crawl. The Sword and shield isn't something to write home about, it's there and it still feels cool but it's more of a damage->blood effect->block->repeat. Even though that simple I still get jumpy when facing off with a monster (not trying to spoil it)\n\n[u]GENERATED DUNGEON[/u]\nSo yes, it won't be long until you realize a room pattern is familiar. The traps and monsters are changed up quite well so I'm more worried about what is around the corner than finding a new secret crawl space/vine to a secret room. The design of the dungeons themselves are quite dark and lonely and I think the dev did a great job of creating an atmosphere. You will be in dungeon instances and every door is a short transition to another dungeon system, not as smooth as I'd like, but there aren't any loading screens after getting in the game so I'll take the bad with the good. Lastly for people that are jump there is a way to change the intensity of the dungeon right before it spawns so that's nice.\n\nI haven't had the guts to fight the boss yet, scarry sounds man, scarry sounds.\n\n[u]PLAYER CHARACTER[/u]\nYou have a body and arms... it's weird how this is something to rave about but this isn't implemented enough in VR (I bet that shit is hard). You unlock new weapons at the end of dungeons and it seems random. Any duplicate is a stat increase for that weapon so it doesn't feel like a waste. Apparently since the last update (happened a day after I bought it) you can get stats to change how your player operates and there are spell books. I'm not going to go into it though because I haven't experienced this yet.\n\n[u]There is co-op[/u]\nBut there is no match making, convince a friend to buy it until there is match making.\n\n\n\nMy verdict - For $15 this game is a great value, that's what I have paid for lame experiences. This game really surprised me with it's level of detail and the lack of short cuts the one man developer took.

I will highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good dungeon crawler in vr. Hopefully we can look forward to things such as random loot hidden in the levels not just at the end room. I love how some of the crawl spaces are so well hidden and you have to basically get on your stomach to traverse them, this immerses you completely going through a tight small tunnel to find this hidden key. I can wait for hopefully some cave levels to go through these hidden pathways. All in all the gameplay is definitely there and with some more content will easily be the best VR game out there right now. \n\nBugs I have found so far:\nThere are a couple of bugs I found that hopefully the dev will notice this review and fix. \n\n1. I found that you can equip the dagger in the right hand and still shoot the bow in the left, this kind of defeats the whole thing and makes you almost invinicible. \n\n2. I had a couple of times when I went through a door and would end up in the next room except outside the level and was unable to go inside the room, the only way to fix this was to go to the correct door and reach my hand through the level and pull the door handle.\n\n3. Not really a bug but an issue I had was the accuracy of the bow seems very off. I will shoot at something and it doesn't seem to go the right direction for me. Every time I try and suggest how to make a bow feel and shoot I always point people towards the game QuiVR because he has done it perfectly spot on.\n\nSo far those are the issues I have come across and will update as they are fixed/find more.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nHopefully this will be fixed in the future but the AI seems to be very dumb. I can full well shoot at someone in the head from about 10 feet away and they will not turn around or even recognize that they now have an arrow going through their head.\n\nAlso that you don't have to only invite friends for co-op i'm sure this is just for the moment while you work out the kinks of co-op but just bringing it up in case you weren't planning on adding this.

The combat is a little slow (which is good, because I don't want to lose my mind in VR), and the very first encounter I had was glitching right into some dude. AND my \"body\" was really, really low. I am 6'4\" so it looked like I had a super long neck... But, the mechanics are surprisingly great. I love that you get a heads up when there are enemies nearby, and I love the mysterious blur of things in the distance. I think this will be a go-to for my much needed VR adventuring.\nThe moving mechanics are really great. I wish other games implemented these kinds of ideas. I can move, while keeping my arms occupied, and still look around. AND I CAN WALK BACKWARDS WHILE AIMING! (Games like Island 359 don't let you do this, which means you always move TOWARDS your attackers). Anyway, I am really looking forward to where this will be going. Right now, the half hour I played, I can tell that this is going to be pretty special.\nUPDATE: I keep coming back to this game, and even daydream about it. It is the best version of locomotion out there in my opinion. Keep up the good work.\n\nUPDATE: Something changed in a recent update....or I have completely lost my mind. But the control isn't as precise as it used to be. Now, it seems the direction you move has more to do with the orientation of your head. So, the older control scheme seemed like you could have your body move in one direction, and your head could look all around.

It should come with a warning though because this game nails the creepy factor. Imgaine walking through dimly lit dungeon hallways where anything can be lurking in the shadows.  This isn't one of those poorly lit hard to see games either. The lighting and atmosphere is perfectly executed and its ounds like the audio has been expertly done as well because there is all kinds of creepy abience that basically just puts you on edge the entire time.\n\nThere are a couple things that need improvement like storig weapons butthe developer has communicated that that is all coming shortly in the next update.  The combat isn't easy either especially if you choose the higher difficulty setting.

So much better than teleporting!\n+ Nice weapons and accurate aiming with the bow for example.\n+ The belt/holster can hold plenty of weapons, shield + oil lamp\n+ Randomly generated dungeons/levels - gives good replay-value\n+ Collectable chests with weapon upgrades and more\n+ Short but lovely tutorial in the beginning\n+ Room-scale works great, easy to sneak on opponents\n+ This game is made by ONE developer - truly impressive!\n+ Many updates are in the works, so I have big hopes for this game!\n+ Not bad price at all. Worth every penny even in this first release already!\n+ Nice performance, runs great on my PC\n+ Private online co-op multiplayer already available!\n\nCons - and stuff I would like to see in future:\n- Music volume is sometimes too loud in some rooms, especially in the weapon-chamber\n- Still needs some updates for skills and armor ability (but that's apparently out soon)\n- More collectable items in the dungeons would be great\n- No Mixed Reality-support even though its Unity engine \n- The Passive dungeons seems kind of pointless, as only the Evil dungeons has enemies/monsters. Maybe I have missed something about this?\n\nAll in all, a beautiful game with huge potential, and I really look forward to play it more and test out future updates.

This is an early access game, so expect some rough edges.\n\nDisclaimer: not tested yet: final dungeon and online coop mode\n(Conclusion/TL;DR at the bottom of the review)\n\n[b] Early Access: Feedback and Updates[/b]\n\nOne of the most important thing for me personally in any early access game is how much involved the developer is. Already early on the developer has been responding to feedback and actually has pushed an update to fix a few bugs + changed some stuff after some feedback within LESS than 24 hours after release. This is a very good sign and how early access should be done.\n\n[b] Visuals [/b]\n\nThis game has quite nice graphics for a one-man show. The environments look good, the dungeons are very atmospheric. The dungeons are dark and require you to carry a lantern with you which makes you anticipate threats waiting in the dark for you. One of the better looking VR indie games out there.\n\n[b] Sound [/b]\n\nFantastic sound, finally a game with some background music. The ambient SFX in the dungeons create a creepy atmosphere which helps to keep up the tension. On the other hand, when you get rewarded with chests at the end of each dungeon you get welcomed by cheery music that makes you feel like you deserved that loot.\n\nThere is also some voice over which is done professionally with good audio quality. Something rarely seen in those 1-man developer games.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nThe game currently uses arm-swinger locomotion, however, the developer has already stated that he is going to implement other forms of locomotion as well, including teleportation and trackpad locomotion.\n\nYou can equip several weapons and other items into your belt before delving into a dungeon. Right now there is a dagger, a sword, a shield, a lanterna and a bow available, with more weapons planned to get added in future updates. The game hints at a future armor and skill system as well.\n\nRight now there are 2 dungeon difficulty to choose from: passive and deadly. I recommend to start out with the deadly dungeons right away, as the passive dungeons seemingly lack enemies.\n\nCombat is pretty standard, similarly as seen in other non-physics based combat systems (think Karnage Chronicles, Swordmaster VR, Vanishing Realms and the ilk). Right now the combat isn't too exciting, however, the developer has already promised an overhaul.\n\nChests are rewarded for each successful playthrough a dungeon and those upgrade your existing weapons or add a new one if you don't own an item already.\n\nThere is a boss dungeon that you should only tackle once you're well equipped, though I haven't mustered myself to go into that one yet.\n\n[b] Comparison to similar games [/b]\n\nLet's compare it to other games in the same genre:\n\n- Karnage Chronicles: while that game has fancier graphics, the combat system is equally in need of an overhaul which the developers of Karnage Chronicles are not that willing to do from reading their posts. Karnage Chronicles is also much more linear and limited in the amount of levels it has. If you like more impressive visuals, though, Karnage Chronicles may be a better choice. Otherwise Dungeon Knight VR seems to offer more replayability and longevity than Karnage Chronicles.\n- Vanishing Realms: THE best dungeon crawler for VR out there right now. This game doesn't beat it, though Vanishing Realm's biggest disadvantage is the short duration due to the handcrafted level. If you don't own Vanishing Realms yet, buy it. In the future with the promised combat Overhaul, Dungeon Knight VR may be able to win over Vanishing Realms.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nWhile it has some aspects that definitely need improvement (e.g. the combat system), the existing framework looks good, feels polished and makes me excited for what comes next. It isn't winning over some other games in a similar genre, but can keep up with plenty of current releases.\n\nI recommend this game for anyone interested in fantasy games, dungeon crawlers and who are willing to support an early access game in its early stage. This is the phase where YOU can help to shape the game how you want it to be together with the developer.\n\nIf anyone has question about the games I've missed to address in this review, please leave a comment!", "timestamp_created": 1493120569, "timestamp_updated": 1493120624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31349549": {"recommendationid": "31349549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327027862", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500610587}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5783\u573e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6e38\u620f\u6ca1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c31\u4e0a\u67b6\u4e86\uff1f\u6211\u7528\u7684VIVE\u8fdb\u53bb\u6839\u672c\u6ca1\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6309\u4efb\u4f55\u6309\u952e\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u89c6\u89d2\u8fd8\u7279\u522b\u5947\u602a\uff0c\u4f60\u662f\u6f02\u6d6e\u5728\u7a7a\u4e2d\u7684\u4ec0\u4e48\u9b3c\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u5c31\u662f\u4e2aBUG\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1493087118, "timestamp_updated": 1493087118, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.351198", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31348853": {"recommendationid": "31348853", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965040685", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506884258}, "language": "english", "review": "Just played about 4 dungeon runs on deadly.\n\nThe look of the dungeons is awesome. I love how dark the hallways are  but as you walk down them, they illuminate so you aren't just wondering in complete darkness\n\nAtmosphere is awesome.\n\nMusic is awesome. So many EA games do no even think about music but I found this music to set the tone nicely \n\nThe game definitely delivers on randomized dungeons. You never know what will be behind the next door and I think when you add in traps, each room will be even more fun to explore.\n\nContrary to others, I am digging arm swinger in this game. Its funny to try to back up in a fight and have to turn around and swing your arms furiously to get away. I definitely seem touch locomotion being something you will need to add in the future though. \n\nI don't understand the point of passive difficulty. Why would we want a dungeon we just walk through except maybe for testing purposes?\n\nI hope you add in a longer dungeon modifier. The current dungeons are too short. \n\nWhat does the blue effect mean when fighting a mob? Is that a successful block?\n\nDo I  need to be holding trigger with the sheild hand also? \n\nCombat needs work. Right now, the monsters (only seen melee orcs so far) just walk towards me and practically get inside my body. Meanwhile, I am just swinging as fast as a can trying to hit what I can't see (because they are no longer in front of me) and I just keep swinging until everything disappears. Try checking out Trickster. That dev has spent a lot of time trying to get melee combat right for his dungeon game. The mobs need to stay about 3 feet infront of the user at all times. Also, I find that melee combat in VR needs to be less about spaz swinging your controller and more about timed blocks with counters. Its ok for monsters to take swings slowly and telegraph what they are doing as it gives  the player time judge the situation and react. It is more fun when you beat an opponent that takes a level of skill above swinging your controller, especially when your game is based around killing enemies. \n\nAll in all, lots of promise.

I'm a sucker for dungeon crawlers that are procedurally generated and this one gets the pass for me. It's also got pretty awesome multiplayer so if you have a friend who likes these then you're good to go. \n\nI don't get motion sick from VR so this game didn't affect me.

Most of my VR games rarely reach a play time of at least 5 hours, and then there's Dungeon Knight, with nearly a full day's worth of my accumulated play time. I return to it frequently, and for a good number of reasons. If you're looking for a new game to add to your VR library, definitely give this one a go!\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[b][u]Super Replayable:[/u][/b] Every time you walk through a door, you'll always be anxious to discover what's on the other side. Certain sound cues may ruin the surprise, but quickly learning what's in your environment can be crucial to your survival.\n\n[b][u]Playstyle Variety:[/u][/b] The main reason why I have so much time put into this game is because I love experimenting with the many possible loadout combinations. Of course, you could go as your generic warrior, rogue, mage, or ranger, but perhaps you'd like to mix it up a bit and try something new. My personal favorite combinations are: Ninja (daggers on all slots, belt slots are for throwing, back is for close combat), Spellsword (one spellbook and one sword or dagger), and The Dishonored Assassin (pistol in left hand, dagger in right, teleporting frequently) \n\n[b][u]Enemy Variety:[/u][/b] Though they tend to have similarities to each other, there's a good-sized variety of enemies that you will encounter (some more frequently than others). These include the plentiful Orclings, the beefy Orcs, the sharp-eyed Skeleton Archers, and the wrathful Dead. Where one enemy type has a strength in one aspect, other types may not fare so well in that field, but they make up for it with a strength of their own, and it would be wise to learn from each one of them.\n\n[b][u]Locomotion:[/u][/b] Though not the default locomotion setting, the Armswinger locomotion is absolutely beautiful! No game I've seen so far has come close to developing a more comfortable and natural locomotion method. Simply place your thumb on the trackpad relative to the direction you want to go, and swing your arms casually. The speed at which you swing your arms affects the speed at which you walk (or run).\n\n[b][u]Room Variety/Exploration:[/u][/b] All rooms are different. Some are merely transition rooms, while plenty others hold treasures and secrets, as well as traps and hostiles. Some rooms will even go the extra mile to make sure you're experiencing the full extent of VR, such as climbing a wall or sliding through a crack. [Fun fact: if you're in roomscale mode, and you have plenty of moving space, actually running to the other side of the room alongside your locomotion (Armswinger especially) will allow you to cross gaps that normally require precise and careful movements. Be sure your equipment isn't weighing you down before you try!]\n\n[b][u]Multiplayer:[/u][/b] Unfortunately, it's not quite perfect yet, but the fact of its existance makes the game immensely more enjoyable. The game is played in short bursts, great for when you just want to have a good time with a buddy. Most of my best memories of this game involve how VR has changed the way gaming looks, works, and feels (My favorite example: witnessing my friend slowly peek around the corner before he quickly raised his hands and jerked backwards as an arrow flew from behind the corner and struck the wall next to him xD)\n\n[b][u]Performance:[/u][/b] I am running all of my VR games on [b]the absolute minimum[/b] required specs, and this one still manages to run quite smoothly, if not the smoothest. Sadly, I was still forced to turn off the amazing shadow effects, but it remains at a constantly high framerate while it's turned off. Perfect for those wishing to experience VR without worrying too much about a headache-inducing framerate.\n\nUpdate: Uh oh, the new graphics have been slowing me down a bit. This probably won't affect anyone running on a proper VR ready computer, but if your on a budget PC, you've been warned o-O.\n\n[b][u]Music:[/u][/b] It's beautiful and I love it. It fits the theme of every situation very well, the reward room music makes me do a cheerful little dance, and that delightfully bouncy clarinet is the best; it's the true reason I brave such a dangerous dungeon \u266b \u2665 \u266b\n\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\n[b][u]The Sword:[/u][/b] For those of you wishing to start by just bashing things with good ol' steel, your sword will be the starting weapon. When I first played this game, I was very concerned about the collision detection, since the sword seems to struggle when attempting to strike or parry. Even if you manage to make it work, it's not a very good weapon in terms of stats either. It's easily outshined by other weapons at equal level, such as the Axe or Katana. It's a shame really, swords are my favorite melee weapon, but even the Dagger feels more effective in close combat.\n\n[b][u]Throwing Equipment:[/u][/b] I'm not suggesting that this should be changed, and I currently do not have a problem with it, but it works in a very unique way that took me hours to understand, and I'm sure others will be very confused. When a melee weapon is swung, the damage is relative to the length of the swing. A weak swing results in less damage, while a moderate, strong swing will have the best effect. Thrown weapons will always deal 100% of the weapon's maximum damage (equivalent of a good swing), since a thrown weapon has no swing to gauge. Instead, [i]it is the distance of a thrown weapon[/i] that is determined by the length of the swing before releasing. I assume this is for balancing reasons, but it feels very unatural (the laws of momentum suggest that the [i]speed[/i] of the swing affects distance, not length), and this will frustrate many users trying to learn to throw.\n\n[b][u]Mildy Frightening:[/u][/b] It is not a very calming experience. During my first playthrough, my heart pounded when I heard an enemy nearby, without knowing where they actually were. Though I'm not as anxious anymore, it still gets me on edge when I hear rushing footsteps coming in from behind. However, [b]I am legitimately terrified of the Ghosts[/b] and I try to avoid them as frequently as possible. They are very hard to see, especially in environments with mixed lighting styles, and they attack by rushing up to you and grabbing hold before exploding into painful spiritual energy. Imagine being unaware that something was charging straight at you, but you had hadn't the slightest idea until they are [b]less than two feet from your face.[/b] Definitely not for those hoping to avoid a heart attack or two.\n\n{Update: Happened right after I wrote this review: Used my old \"warning\" spell (charge level 2 Storm spell checking around corners) on a T-intersection hallway that I wasn't too familiar with.

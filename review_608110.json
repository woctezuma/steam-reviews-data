From the bright neon colours and polygonal look to its soundtrack gives off the 80's feel perfectly.\n-Slightly challenging and pretty quick to finish, not offering all that much in terms of content but it has a great replay value to it in my experience\n-The small rogue-lite elements such as upgrades and power-ups add a nice little touch to the game\n-It's free\n\nCons:\n-Slightly rage inducing at times due to my own error (and the obvious keyboard-mouse combo I used to play it)\n\nOverall this is a solid little game, definitely worth your time\n8/10\n\n[code][h1]Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nFree Games?

It's like Asteroids got a makeover and it's so boring. You basically move around in a room shooting stuff. There is a number on each room telling you how many waves you must survive to get out. E.g. 3 = 3 waves of enemies. The enemies are odd shapes that will shoot at you with different abilities like exploding bombs or teleporting attacks but it's all about move around and dodging them while attacking.\n\nGameplay-wise, this is a controller game. You move your triangle with the left controller stick and aim-shoot with the right controller stick. Kill all enemies to complete a zone. You have lives and if you get hit an enemy, you lose a life. If you lose all your lives, it's game over. You can collect crystals and trade them in to heal any damage you receive and vice versa. You can also use the crystals to buy ships parts, upgrade ship parts, permanently weld them to the ship, find secret locations, etc.\n\nConclusion, skip this game. It's like Asteroids in a room with the ability to move and shoot. Sure there are walls and different enemies but the core of the game is moving around and avoiding objects. \n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. Simple to Understand\nMove around and shoot.

I want to know exactly what ship parts I already have, Why not just give this basic information?\n2. a description of items would be nice. What do nanobots do, for example? Retro games generally had instruction manuals, as this doesn't it should pick up the shortfall with a little description (granted this is redundant for most items thus far).\n3. the points system is obsolete. Noone has cared about points in games for the last 30+ years, if they ever did, and its not clear even how points are gained. The game should be more clear about user performance, giving the user a clearer idea of what they can improve. I know that contradicts the arcade motif, but in my opinion in recreations of older products,  one should ideally extract only whats good, and be mindful of sensible modern improvements. This may make for a marginally less authentic product, but a higher quality one.\n\nFinally, this feels like a game targetting a hardcore audience, but isn't really that difficult. I hadn't even mastered the controls (I was constantly getting my wires crossed between moving the ship and shooting, and mostly only kept to 4 directions instead of 8), and still beat the game quite comfortably, just by upgrading the right way (basically stacking up attacks and slaughtering everything on screen).\n\nObviously game length is not a current strong point, though with permadeath there is an inherent soft limit.\n\nFinally controller support is a must.", "timestamp_created": 1514127799, "timestamp_updated": 1514128396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38622783": {"recommendationid": "38622783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295715436", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513648054}, "language": "english", "review": "game is really good but too short. this only i'm have say.", "timestamp_created": 1514123034, "timestamp_updated": 1514123034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38603013": {"recommendationid": "38603013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393240723", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 109, "last_played": 1516146365}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Obra de arte brooo", "timestamp_created": 1514080509, "timestamp_updated": 1514080509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38552564": {"recommendationid": "38552564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401923005", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513982219}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty cool retro arcade game.

A very much retro-styled twinstick shooter in which your ship and weapon can be upgraded with various stacking power-ups. Like in many retro games, the task you're given is simple: survive six randomly generated floors and, if you get far enough, fight against the boss at the end. Or go down in a blaze of glory.\n\nEven in its relatively barebones and early access state (which, at the moment is currently at the crazy price of nothing!), Null Vector does precisely what the blurb on the Steam store page says it does; give you a rogue-lite experience that, reminiscent of the arcades, lends itself quite nicely to being one of those \"pick up and play\" experiences that you can play in short bursts without having to tax yourself. \n\nOther than dodging bullets (and the enemies firing them!), there isn't too much focus needed. And, sometimes, that's what you want in a gaming experience. Don't feel up to shaving down your lap times in a sim-racer or countering the opposing team's strategies in an FPS? That's what twinsticks are for. Blast little polygonal enemies into bits: The Game.\n\nSure, right now, I've got a shade over two hours of accumulated game time but, in those a hundred and twenty-odd minutes, I must've chalked up a dozen attempts and only managed to kill the boss once. If you make it that far, it really doesn't take that long to get to the end; a really condensed and fun experience, if that's what you're into.\n\nOne last thing: Is there any better weapon combo than Piercing Ricochet Rockets? :P", "timestamp_created": 1511147180, "timestamp_updated": 1511147180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36596990": {"recommendationid": "36596990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133143200", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1515561632}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little rogue-lite shaping up to be a solid game.

GET IT NOW AND PLAY IT!\n\nPros:\n-can customize your ship to match your playstyle (some upgrades better than others imo)\n-difficult but very satisfying to play \n-music is bomb + retro arcade style creates such a cool vibe\n\nThe game is fairly short but not easy; it's addicting and keeps you coming back. All the combinations for your ship, the music, and the experience of dodging bullets and emerging victorious are exciting! It's fun trying out different equips for your ship imo.. had 4 bots with me at one point and hid behind a wall as they took care of some waves haha.\n\nSome things I noticed that may help you:\n-rockets seem to be easier to use than lasers in my experience. You need to be more precise with lasers because they shoot instantaneously and are thin, while rockets have that slight traveling distance and what feels like a bigger hit box. \n-do not get multi shot with lasers if you suck at the above^ IT'S WORSE.\n-upgrading damage also increases your weapon size (bigger rockets/bigger lasers)\n-there seems to be a cap/limit on fire rate at a certain point ? (equipping two slots of fire rate) not sure but there probably is one for all enhancements. \n-It's one or the other with lasers/rockets. Be careful on what you permanently keep because you can't change it afterwards.\n-lasers + ricochet? not such a good idea unless you're good at aiming at angles. Lasers + ricochet + multi shot is better.\n-if using the keyboard to play, you can not only move diagonally (holding down two buttons simultaneously) but can also shoot diagonally (same thing)\n\nMy tips on beating the boss:\n-rockets\n-HIGH fire rate\n-damage/pierce\n\nMy first failed attempt was with lasers, ricochet, and multi shot (possibly also high-ish fire rate). Other than that epic disco look and the feel of firing a laser, Lasers < Rocket imo. I had some laser and rocket bots with me, which was helpful but unecessary. Shields are always great. Got those for safety so I could take some hits and still win, but if you're good at dodging shots, it's not necessary. The times I won were when I had those listed above and ricochet, which was DEVASTATING. Wiped the boss pretty easily. Ricochet is awesome, but I think what's key are those above.\n\nOops, long review.

In Null Vector, you traverse procedurally generated, grid-layered rooms fighting off opposing geometries. \n\nWhile gliding across these random battles, the triangular protagonist can apply various, yet limited upgrades to its ship \u2013 often coming across wielding stations that permanently attach these improvements, allocating space for newer items.\n\nAt face value, the game\u2019s fast-paced, reactive environment makes for a re-playable title; dying just short of completing a floor when you\u2019ve completely upgraded your ship fuels motivation to beat the game in one fell swoop. \n\nHowever, this is also part of a larger problem: the game is too damn short now. Other than its difficulty, there\u2019s a lacking incentive to replay the game once you\u2019ve beaten it. \n\nThough, this shortcoming shouldn\u2019t be rapped on too much; what is clearly a F2P title has much room to grow and expand its level.

There is more than one room type and multiple ways to get to the next room you need to go to in order to advance.\n[*][b]Variety of enemies[/b] is something this game does really well. Between the guys shooting at you, the diamonds that bounce around, until destroyed when they explode into multiple projectiles, the squares that shoot mines, the drills that try to ram you, and even more types you'll find you have a lot to handle.\n[*]There is a lot of [b]customization options[/b] for your ship and it really lets you choose the upgrades you want. I won't fully go into how this works, so you can see it for yourself, but you start off with three ship part slots and will come across parts as you play. These are random so counterbalnced to the power of customization you get is the fact that you have to make do with what you get. I myself do not like, for example, ricochet or laser as much as the helper bots, shield, or damage/fire rate boosts, but when ricochet or laser are the only choices you have you have to pick one. This also forces you to adapt to the particular situation. This system is more complex then what I've described but, like I say, I'll let you see for yourself.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]I dunno..., the fact that I can't buy the sountrack I guess...?\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI could have mabye listed other things in the pros but I think what I wrote will suffice. The game has really cool 80's design. The levels are well laid out. It's simple but the postion of the obstacles will chance the room significatly. Since this game is free and so well designed, there is no reason not to pick it up. Also, as it is (currently) in early access I assume we can except some imporvements (not that I can imagine what could be improved anyhow).", "timestamp_created": 1506186286, "timestamp_updated": 1506186286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35128515": {"recommendationid": "35128515", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403895495", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 31, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509121719}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "o jogo \u00e9 otimo...\n\n\u00e9 s\u00f3 isso msm", "timestamp_created": 1506088877, "timestamp_updated": 1506088877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35120288": {"recommendationid": "35120288", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999508742", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506914373}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely recommend this game!

It's a great arcade shooter with very dynamic gameplay and building your arsenal of items from shooting lasers, having little rocket bots and guarding your terrible mistakes with a shield just adds to the fun of this game. The gameplay in my eyes doesn't get repetitive due to the fact that the stages are randomized, your tools and weapons you come across are jumbled about and you even have to choose between perks and weapons to build a powerful arsenal that is tailored to your tastes.\n\n Null Vector is a great experience to partake in. I highly recommend this game if you just want a game to mess around in, Challenge yourself or just burn some of your time.\n\n[spoiler]The Laser II, Shield II and Ricochet are the best perks.

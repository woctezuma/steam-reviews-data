It takes no time at all to complete the first few tutorial challenges and quickly educates you as to the game mechanics.  Its very simple actualy, you move a dot from one location to another using various modules that each have their own task.  You are given a limited number of these modules and you have to think creatively to solve the more advanced puzzles.  The music is very relaxing and does not distract your thought process.  My only complaint about this game is the sound made when a module moves something, its a bit of a screech sound almost iritating like scratching fingers on a chalk board but not nearly that bad.  You get used to it and eventualy learn to ignore it, its only a personal preference.  Others may find the sounds soothing.\n\nPros:\n\nEasy to exit (esc) gets me out in a second, no fiddling with menus making it easy for those who have other daily life duties that  strike at any moment (right now things)\n\nEasy to learn how to play, very short yet well made tutorial that quickly gets to the point and gets you in the game.\n\nSoothing music that is easy to relax to, gives you room for thought.\n\nPrice is very reasonable (currently just under $3 cdn)\n\nCons:\nSomewhat iritating screech noise made by modules moving stuff\n\nPossibly short (has not been confirmed, Im on my 28th puzzle, does not look like too many left, is that the end of it or is there more past this point?  I bought this yesterday but didnt expect me to have completed so much of this at this stage.  Keep in mind, ive not finished the game so there verywell could be alot more to be done.  \n\nId recomend this game for someone who enjoys problem solving and creative thinking and wants a game they can use to exercise their brain, but is quick to put back in the drawer (exit) and continue doing other life stuff.\n\nJust noticed this is available on android so I will be supporting the developer by purchasing for that platform as well.  Would not have known about this game if I had not come across it searching for games on steam.  Glad I did.\n\nRegrets? None.

Very programming-like.\n\nContent: The modules cover all of the bases: moving in a line, rotating, turning on and off, changing directions... I wouldn't be surprised if this was a complete enough language to simulate a computer given enough modules and a big enough playing field.\n\nInterface Design: It's a little cumbersome to drag things into place, then click on them to configure them, then click on buttons to rotate or change the polarity. I also found a bug where if you press Esc during a simulation and come back to the level, the level stays as it was during the simulation instead of resetting to how you placed them. I also found there wasn't enough difference between the three simulation speeds.\n\nSounds: Pretty simple atmospheric music and subtle, not too tiring SFX.\n\nVisuals: Nice clean minimalistic look, the module symbols are pretty good at visually representing what they do.\n\nStyle: What I love about this game is that it teaches you to use modules in a \"dirty hack\" kind of way, creating delays in order to make everything work together in synchronicity. There are also times when you have to use synergy between two modules placed a certain way. Made me have quite a few \"Ah-ha!\" moments and I felt pretty clever!\n\nAnnoyances: All the things I mentionned in Interface Design, probably a syndrome of being a mobile port. Nothing deal-breaking though.\n\nValue: Very fairly priced game, though there's a limit to the premade puzzles it's a very well put together programmy puzzler!\n\nReplayability: A little bit with the Sandbox mode but it's a fairly short game (I'm halfway through as of writing this)... unless you get stuck I suppose, which could still happen to me!", "timestamp_created": 1496411575, "timestamp_updated": 1496411575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30495573": {"recommendationid": "30495573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064706754", "num_games_owned": 1291, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489431970}, "language": "english", "review": "[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th][h1] Review\t[/h1][/th]\n        [th][h1] Score/Notes\t[/h1][/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]Simple direct[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphic[/td]\n        [td]Well design[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Music[/td]\n        [td]Nice[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Control[/td]\n        [td]Clicky2[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]No story[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Comment[/td]\n        [td]Spacechem-like[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Purchase?[/td]\n        [td]Sure/Bundle[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1489432184, "timestamp_updated": 1489432205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585427", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30295237": {"recommendationid": "30295237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019848791", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488549938}, "language": "english", "review": "FINALLY!

This game is a great classic, and replaying it again in it's remastered form presents no disappointments! There are some remastered games that I've played and realized that it no longer seems as fun as it did back then-but Voodoo Vince still has not lost it's spark. \n\nIt's got a unique gameplay due to the aspects of openly looking to want to hurt yourself to cause chaos to enemies around you. That's voodoo for you! The cast of characters in this game also make the gameplay quite fun to play. Especially when listening to Vince's snarky remarks, haha. And although each boss fight does include Vince finding a way to hurt himself to cause pain to the boss, each fight is unique and never feels overly repetitive!\nIn account: I've lived in New Orleans, Louisiana all of my life-yet as a child, I never really understood the scenario of this game. Back then, I didn't really explore places in the city-now that I'm older, I understand a lot of these cool references regarding my hometown and it really is quite fascinating. \n\n\n\nOverall, I do recommend this on the PC. Not many people know how to get the ports just right and the configuration for these old console games to PC can get frustrating and may include having to download third party support drivers, yet they've done it right with this one. I decided to try playing this game using keyboard and mouse and it seems perfectly fluid to me. I honestly have not noticed any bugs in the game. \nAs for new players, all I can say is that when I introduced this game to others-they really enjoyed the aspect of the game. It's different, which is hard to find in most games now-a-days. \n\nThumbs up from me!

If you were anything like me when I first played it as a wee little fetus who had barely escaped the clutches of my mothers loins and you enjoyed it then and even had good memories with it then just buy it again and get hit with that same brick that hit me and (I hope) many others. \n\nHowever, if you haven't played the game I'm not sure if you'll enjoy yourself. Although its an amazing game with a great overall theme (the whole, almost suicidal doll, Jazz music and style), it isn't without its problems that certainly come up today. \n\nThe enchanced graphical improvements really make the remaster something for older players returning to the game it's still nice if you're jumping in for the first time. Now, on to the outstanding problems I have with the game. \n\n- Firstly, the game itself when compared to other platformers out there it doesn't do anything new as far as platformers go. You've got the standard normal punch attack, followed along by the legendary helicopter attack that completely eliminates the purpose of the punch attack. \n\n- Secondly, the boss fights in the game are rather easy and tedious at times, because I only found myself dying by my own hands. Whether I press a wrong key and tumble to my demise or stop paying attention and run into the boss on accident with little to no health.\n\n- At times the camera feels... Unnatural and has to be fought with every now and again just to get out of Vince's velvety asshole so you can finally identify those growling noises you've been hearing for the passed 2.5 milliseconds. \n\n- Some levels/sections can become tedious *cough* I'M LOOKING AT YOU SECTION WHERE YOU HAVE TO BUILD THAT FUCKING HOT AIR BALLOON *cough*. This may be due to me remembering as soon as I saw the loading screen for that section and thinking: \"Oh fuck I remember this bullshit.\" And then procceded to wade through that bullshit to move on.\n\n- You basically have an infinite amount of hearts (which are things you find scattered throughout a level to obtain more lives) ( also I'm pretty sure this was in the older version too). Because whenever you boot the game up you can travel back to a previous location and the hearts will all respawn in the same locations. I don't know if this was on purpose or not but it somewhat takes away from the sense of danger the game has. Even if you never use it you always know you can just \"go back\" if you're left on a single heart.\n\nAll in all if you like a well-grounded, interesting and amusing at times platformer (and can of course excuse the faults) then by all means pick it up.

Voodoo Vince is a 3D platformer of the original xbox, but what makes it special is the unique tone, environments and approach to level design. The wacky soundtrack and unusual settings feel fresh and inspired. Unlike the traditional sand, ice or fire levels seen in other games you will be exploring warped towns, twisted crypts and more. \n\nBut besides the setting; Gameplay in Voodoo Vince is unique as well. Many of the puzzles and ways of defeating enemies are spun on their head as you try to find ways to hurt yourself and activate your voodoo powers. There is still traditional combat but it takes a backseat to these puzzle elements. Levels are at their strongest when they revolve around trying to find creative ways to tackle a problem, such as lighting yourself on fire to blow up some angry gas canisters. The first area is the best example of this, every problem is so unique and the characters are charming. However some later levels that focus solely on platforming or combat feel mediocore.\n\nMany platformers struggle to maintain player interest in collecting all of it's item's but luckily Vince handles this in a perfect way. All collectables that you find have a direct impact on gameplay. Collecting the zombie dust grants you an extra health bar for every 100. The voodoo idols give you different animations for when you use your voodoo powers and the skulls allow you to use these voodoo powers more often. Collectables are also not overbearing. Besides a few exceptions levels are small and well focused. You'll rarely feel like collecting everything is becoming a chore.\n\nBut as with all games it does have it's flaws. When you run into one of these mediocore levels the cracks start to show dramatically. Odd ledge detection, massive hitboxes (on just about everything), and strange depth perception can ruin the pace. Voodoo Vince does much better as an exploration based game than it ever could with it's platforming. this might turn off the hardcore fans of other more well known games in the genre. But all in all it's a good game oozing with style and originality.

This game can be enjoyed by the old players, like me, who have loved this game since the prehistoric times of the original Xbox and for the new players who want to give Vince a try for the first time. \n\nThe only thing I wish the developers had done was adding some sort of extra content. Although the game is great fun, it is quite short and the \"remaster\" refers only to the graphics and (at least at the date this review was written) no new content has been given to Voodoo Vince. Other remastered games like Age of Empires II gave us some new content here on Steam and I really do wish these guys are able to do just that. \n\nAs the final note, I'd like to add that, the soundtrack to this game is one of the best videogame soundtracks ever written.

Vince, with his voodoo magic, must track down Cosmo and rescue Charmaine while meeting and beating a vast crew of comical characters through several levels of puzzle-platforming action.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay for Voodoo Vince is relatively simple yet deviously entertaining.[list]\n[*]Vince has several moves in addition to the basic run, jump and punch.\n[*]He can use a spin attack to damage enemies, knocking them back, while also providing as an extension of your jumps.\n[*]While in the air, Vince can hover to descend slowly, covering more distance while in the air.\n[*]Vince can also use a head slam attack while mid-air which is more effective on specific enemies.\n[*]Eventually in the game, Vince will find a special pin which can be used to grapple from targets placed within levels.\n[/list]\nDamaging and killing enemies will cause them to drop beads, filling a meter that, when full, allows Vince to use a Voodoo Power, hurting himself in various comical ways which will gratuitously yield the same painful death to all enemies close enough to Vince.\n\nThroughout most levels are several bags of Zombie Dust, which can increase your health with every 100 bags collected.\nSome levels contain Skull Pages which, when all are collected in an area, will conjure a Power Skull, which Vince can chase down and collect to expand the count of Voodoo Powers he can hold at once.\n\n[h1]Minor downsides which may be fixed[/h1][list]\n[*]There is currently a bug causing a loud sound to play when pausing and unpausing as well as when HUD elements disappear\n[*]The key for hovering and first person view are currently the same, and cannot be bound differently, this can cause annoying toggles to first person view when holding hover as you land\n[*]There is a sequence in the final levels in which you are flying a plane. Rotating the plane's axis counter-clockwise and firing the plane's guns are currently mapped to the same key and cannot be bound differently. You will have to spin while shooting.\n\nOverall, this game is a masterpiece, even now after its original release 14 years ago.

That said where a game like this makes it or breaks it is on the strength of it's platforming and puzzling. Fortunately Voodoo Vince succeeds at both. While the camera is not 100% perfect, it's not bad and the controls feel spot-on -- not a common thing in platformers from the early 2000's.  Graphics are nice and crisp and I like the soundtrack quite a bit. If you have a low end PC there are settings to scale things down a bit and obviously any gaming PC will run it nicely.

The villians are pretty goofy and it has an all round fun story.\n\nThe combat isn't bad, although flying enemies are a huge pain, it has a fun use of the voodoo doll letting you use voodoo spells to kill multiple enemies. Being a port from consol to pc, the controls are pretty clean, I haven't really had any troubles so far.\n\nIm going to mark down what I like and don't like (P.S i have played this on consol when i was younger, so I will probably be a lot less harsher than 'actual' critics, this game gives me so much nostalgia that I can't truly hate it)\n\nWhat I like:\nThe character - Hes funny and very different which makes him more loveable.\nThe villans - The villans are super goofy and fun to play againts.\nThe combat - The voodoo spells are really cool and its not a bad combat system, although its very basic, its still kind of entertaining.\nThe maps - The areas are so intresting, its odd shapes and interesting uses of pipes from the ground makes it all the more fun to explore\nThe narrator - The narrator has such a nice voice and fits really well the theme of 'voodoo'. Its great to have a nice clear woman narrator instead of a generic deep male voice narrator\n\nWhat I dislike:\nThe sometimes frustraiting camera angles - Sometimes its very annoying to have a camera not cooperating with you and it happens quite often, although you can have a 360 view by pressing ctrl (for keyboared) it still shifts back it to right afterwards which isn't fun at all.Not being able to choose a voodoo power - You collect various voodoo powers in the game, and some are more cool and or interesting to use than others, and it really sucks that it chooses which one at random, although it doesn't make any actual difference and the animations are purely for variety, it would be fun to choose some that you want to use, but again, in the end it all has the same affect, to kill a bunch of enemies in a area.\n\nNo new voiceovers: Although I understand why It probably didn't happen, I would have enjoyed it if the voiceover for the Narrator would have changed for players using the keyboared (I.e isteand of saying 'Press the Y button' it would say 'Press the __ Key'. Although this is irrelevent if you play this on a controler ;P\n\nFinal thoughts: This game was defenitly worth the money and Im not even close to the end! I had a little more, you could say, encouragement to buy this game since it was a cherished childhood memory to play it on the first xbox. But I truly think that even if you've never seen or heard of this game before, you should buy it and enjoy it! Its fun and goofy with a decent storyline, it have some familiar elements that you see in a lot of games, but it adds its own twists! \n\nFinal Rating, 8.5/10 -Great fun!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492562232, "timestamp_updated": 1492562232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503043", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31227553": {"recommendationid": "31227553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026248480", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492652266}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games got the remaster it deserved.", "timestamp_created": 1492556542, "timestamp_updated": 1492556542, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31227508": {"recommendationid": "31227508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047736323", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493087426}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just as I remember it, I love it so much!

[/h1]\n\nTLDR: Great game from launch little to no bugs and a great platformer worth the price!\n\n\nSo heres my opinion, the game looks great smooth frames little to no problems and nostolgia factor is through the roof! I owned this game as a kid on Xbox but never got super far, I'm so glad to see its return in its beautiful remaster! I've played for a few hours since launch and have had only one problem and that is [u]when you unplug a listening device and try to use the sound from your speakers the sound with not work even if you were to plug the listening device back in.[/u] I dont know if thats a hardware problem or a game problem but its a very insignificant problem and the only bump in the road.\n\n[h1] For Any Newcomers to The Game [/h1]\n\nHonestly it's a good platformer from an era that did not shove everything down your throat and force you to play a tutorial. Almost everything in the game is trial and error and almost always self explanitory my only suggestion would be to play through to a save on a new stage if you were to stop playing.

I remember feeling somewhat excited and cautious as the cursory glance and study at the box art didn't convey a lot of what the game was to be like (look I was like 5 or 6). I quickly arrived home, sat down in front of the TV and loaded up the game.\nThe rest was history. \n\nLet me just be point blank and say that this is one of my favorite games ever, and allow me to try to explain why. While Voodoo Vince doesn't have the depth and complexity that Super Mario 64 has in it's movement (or Mario's amazingly effective star power) or the memorable characters and noteworthy music that Sonic Adventure or the charm and appeal that the Sly, Rachet and Clank and Jak and Daxter all had - what Voodoo Vince DOES have is a cajun flavored Soundtrack (and holds one of my favorite pieces of music from any game ever, sadly, removed and replaced in this remaster that being the tune of Earth Water and Wood) a truly one-of-a-kind world and tons of memorable environments and it can be beaten in a weekend at the most. \n\nI will be frank though, and speaking through my \"rose-tintedness\" I would recommend that those not looking for a nostalgia fix may want to wait for a sale due to the shortness and admittedly simple game design, as any seasoned platformer fan will find Voodoo Vince falling flat (on his face).\nIf you ARE Nostalgically inclined, you probably have bought the game anyway, but to those that hadn't yet the game is ported over in 60FPS and has a 1080 makeover and plays amazingly. I was able to complete the game, 100% achievements and all with the standard Keyboard and Mouse layout with little issue, although you may be inclinded to use a Gamepad and honestly this can do nothing but benefit the experience for you.  Don't take my experience as law, as I have seen on the forums that some have found the game to be buggy, glitchy or more than a little crash prone, so buyer beware regardless. \n\nI can absolutely recommend Voodoo Vince to those who wish to replay it, or to those wishing to play it maybe for the first time, under the guise of a sale. \nNow if only we could get Voodoo Vince 2.", "timestamp_created": 1515825460, "timestamp_updated": 1515825460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39546209": {"recommendationid": "39546209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113834873", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 401, "last_played": 1516665649}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de mis primeros juegos ,sencillito y muy corto.

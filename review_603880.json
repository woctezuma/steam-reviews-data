Ta historia wci\u0105ga, bo jest to przyjemna historia mi\u0142osna. I to, jako najwa\u017cniejsza rzecz w visual novelach, wysz\u0142o \u015bwietnie!\n \nDobrze, to teraz przejd\u017amy do oprawy audiowizualnej. Zacznijmy od grafiki: bardzo podoba mi si\u0119 sprite Ceri, wyszed\u0142 bardzo \u0142adnie i z pocz\u0105tku my\u015bla\u0142em, \u017ce nie b\u0119d\u0119 m\u00f3g\u0142 si\u0119 do niego przyzwyczai\u0107, ale na szcz\u0119\u015bcie to szybko min\u0119\u0142o. T\u0142a s\u0105 \u0142adne i dosy\u0107 szczeg\u00f3\u0142owe. Jedyn\u0105 rzecz\u0105 do jakiej mog\u0119 si\u0119 przyczepi\u0107 s\u0105 niekt\u00f3re scenki.

Gdyby sam sprite Ceri by\u0142by w chocia\u017c zbli\u017conej stylistyce to nie czepia\u0142 bym si\u0119, ale s\u0142abo jest widzie\u0107 obrazki, kt\u00f3re s\u0105 w sumie tak\u0105 nagrod\u0105, kt\u00f3re tak mocno odbiegaj\u0105 stylem, \u017ce przyzwyczajeni ju\u017c widz\u0105c ten uwa\u017camy go za o wiele gorszy. Co do muzyki, to zazwyczaj nie zwracam na ten aspekt zbyt du\u017cej uwagi.

Jednak jak to cz\u0119sto bywa sama \u015bcie\u017cka d\u017awi\u0119kowa jest dosy\u0107 bezp\u0142ciowa i nie zapada w pami\u0119\u0107. \n \nOstatni\u0105 rzecz\u0105, kt\u00f3r\u0105 chc\u0119 podkre\u015bli\u0107 jest \u015bwietny voice acting Amber Barile, kt\u00f3ry sprawia, \u017ce posta\u0107 Ceri nie jest tylko dobrze napisana, ale r\u00f3wnie\u017c dobrze zagrana.

Es ist eine Liebesgeschichte mit 3 Endings. Es gibt auch eine offizielle Anleitung des Weges, wobei er beim lesen klar erkennbar ist, was nun zum Bad Ending f\u00fchrt oder nicht. Man wird sehr gut ins Spiel eingebunden, wenn man seinen Namen eingeben kann und sp\u00e4ter auch seinen Geburtstag. Damit wird man halt auch direkt angesprochen.

I played through the game and got all 3 endings. One happy ending, one neutral (bittersweet) ending, and one bad ending. The bad ending was very cruel... I only got it as a completionist. I felt like an absolute scumbag for even getting it, especially after completing the true ending.\n\nI found the story to be very relatable (outside of the fact that the protagonist is half japanese lol). But the way the two main characters were written, it was absolutely believable. A loner meets an introvert in highschool. Through interacting with each other they begin developing a friendship, and possibly even find romance together.\n\nCeri is definitely a grade A waifu. Her voice actress, Amber Barile, definitely did a great job at portraying Ceri's introverted personality. Although I found that her volume was a little too low for the game. I had to turn the game's music quite low in order to her Ceri's voice lines. In any case, it's nice to see more visual novels with english voice overs. I hope to hear more from her, as well as many other voice actor for VNs!\n\nBut overall, I highly recommend this game to all visual novel and anime lovers. It's a little cheesy and stuff, but it's very cute. Those looking for a romance VN with a cute waifu, you don't have to look far! I even recommend this to anyone who is considering getting into visual novels.

Since at one point you're just rushing through to get to the main character and Ceri's conversations. The VA for Ceri is lovely, but I do wish they had not written her character to be so timid all the time. It feels very stereotype. Then again, it is an anime visual novel and is also free, but it did rub me the wrong way a bit sometimes; it makes you question how you can fall in love with someone when you so barely get to know them. More expressions for Ceri would have been nice as well, since she didn't change very much, and when she did it was mostly between shy smiling to fearful/upset shock. Even a change of clothes for the one time occasion outside of school would have given her more personality. \n\nI would also like to mention that the still images of Ceri that are used in key moments are all a bit off in scale which makes the photos a bit odd after seeing a well proportioned image of her most of the game. I would recommend them making them all more consistent for the future. \n\nMy only other complaint is that after investing all the time in this game to get to the end, I had hoped it would be longer and end with them farther along in their relationship.

The main strength it has comes from the relationship and the fact that the chemistry between the player character and Ceri is genuinly believable.  It does a good job of putting you in the characters headspace as the loner highschool student and gets you to sympathize with this lonely introverted girl who's hiding emotional stress.  You get truly invested in getting close with her and helpping her through her troubled situation and seeing her through to a happy end.\n\n     I can't give anything more than a light recommendation however, because while the relationship is a big strength, it is the novel's only strength.  Which isn't to say that everything else is bad, rather that everything else is there to serve its given purpous and nothing more.  The family isn't given much characterization beyond a few basic traits and don't play a very large role in the story other than to give arbitrary advice and at one point a contrived plot device.  (The father runs a publishing firm that just so happens to run with your girlfriend's favorite author)  I don't think the mother had any reason to be in the story at all, and as for characters outside the player's family they're all pretty much forgetable, only there to point the player from point A to B without much characterization given.\n\n     The plot itself is also becomes predicitable by the end.  We start off with some mystery airing around Ceri and the issues that trouble her, but around the last third of the story things unwind in a way in which even I as a new comer to the gener could accurately predict what was going to happen.  This was not helpped at all by the fact that there are several late game dialouges that outright tell you what is going to happen, thereby sapping what little stakes were left in the story out completely.  There was real opportunity to drop something unexpected into the mix, a detail or plot development that would've changed things and increased the stakes a bit, but unfortunatly it was an opportunity that sorely missed.\n\n     Since this is free however I still recommend the novel for its compeling romance and main characters, just don't go in expecting anything spectacular.",

The story does feel rather short however, almost to sudden with certain aspects pertaining to the romance and other story aspects, but hey, its a slice-of-life feel good visual novel with a cute character and even cuter relationship. And real relationships can be just as random and unexpected.\n\nOne thing that surprised me in a good way was that despite how the story could've gone, and how the main character is styled, it never went raunchy or oversexualized anything. It was cute and safe all the way through, so big respects for that.\n\nNow, my major complaint would have to be a few scenes with how Ceri was drawn. As an artist, I completely undertand how difficult it can be to draw certain proportions of a character, but there was 2 scenes (Not going to Spoil) that really threw me off from the game. Different parts of the character is drawn really disproportionatly, which is a bit distracting. However, this isn't to much a bother, as everything else is super cute no matter what. And the overall artstyle is just really cute.\n\n\nDespite that. Cute Game. Cute Story.

(but i do enjoy story driven games).\nand coming from a background, that is so different, to the cultures that this game is set on, there are many things that are unnacceptable.\n\nbut, i must say, regardless of that, the game, and story was actually good enough, to keep someone like me, despite these 2 issues, engaged enough in it, to actually do all three endings (it might not show on my play time of the game, because i was playing it in offline mode, so, only few minutes were regiestered). \n\nas somehow, despite this major difference, i was still able to project myself and see myself into the player character, through his choices, words and other moments into the game. which is a major Win in the writing area of the game.\n\nthe writing was amazing, everything simply blended well togather. i loved the branching, and branches in it. \nthe music and the voice acting was spot on too. (if yo lower the music a bit). \n\nlast words{before the part that contains spoilers}, do i recommend this game? absolutely, a very well done, well written, well made, coherant visual novel. \nthat, even people who don't play visual novels, may find something in it. {even if they're from a vastly different culture, where a lot of things would be totally unacceptable, and would never happen/be done}.\nwas a nice game, and a nice fantasy, great job for the developers. \n\nthe game could, and can be much more, but, looking at how, it is an extremely low budget visual novel, and how it is literally a free game, i can let that pass. so im more than forgiving for the music, and the fact that, there is one character sprite and other low budget things.\ni can see, that, during development, the developers probably had much more to offer, but for it being a very low budget project {i can totally see that in the game}, i can understand, and feel like, that , they had to chip away, at a LOT of things, including writing, and story parts.\n\n\n*spoiler alert*\n[spoiler] after completing all three branches, i must say, the good ending really is good, it is satisfying, but i can't help but feel some minor changes would make it a lot better, but other than that, the ending, really is good, and is just, very satisfying. and heart warming. (i loved the plays on the name of the game honestly, how it changes through the endings).\n\nnext for the bad ending route, i must say, it is not really bad, its just, the player character being totally and absolutely, socially awkward to high amounts, which happens to some people that is for sure, i wouldn't really call it a bad ending, it is just that, the player choices make him so awkward, that the story literally gets forced into an ending. \n\nfinally, for the  ending that i found actually to be the worst(story/player character actions/reactions wise), and far more painful, than the bad ending, this route, is just, plain half heartedness, which is something i really dislike, that is the first point, but out side of what i like and hate, the choices that the player character seems to do, based on your decisions while on this route, are just, not spot on, and not satisfying at all, even to a point where they feel and make me say \"no i know i did these decisions to end up here, but i feel that, there is still much more that can be done\" but instead what happens is that, he sits in his place for 4-5 days, and then, in its epilouge, they call each other, and the ending was just the worst, absolute half heartedness, he realized his feelings, and made them seem like such a big deal, and like \"very in love\" but then treating these emotions as medicore, through self defeating dialouges and just generally negative thoughts the player is forced to read, that can very well be replaced with things way better, it was honestly, just halfheartedness, plain cowardance, and waiting for \"fate\" to solve itself for you, instead of you solving it. \nleaving you at the end of the story asking \"what was the point?\"\n\nof course, not to say, that, this route doesn't have its place in the game, some people maybe able to find these reactions that the player make when in this route, to be reasonable, but as i said, they just don't sit well with me, and almost feel like, they are illogical, and just plain teenage cowardance of facing reality path, i do realize they're teenagers, but, i'm a teenager myself, and just watching such things, is honestly, not fun at all. {excluding the fact again, that, this ending, is even more painful than the bad ending, for other reasons, over all, this is the most painful route, and the worst route in writing.}  [/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1496225628, "timestamp_updated": 1496226537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524598", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32058484": {"recommendationid": "32058484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104448148", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496133009}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though it was short than i anticipated.

There you meet fellow student Ceridwan \"Ceri\" Erwood, a very shy girl and an avid reader. You become curious about her and start spending more time around her as a friendship begins to develop.\n\nThis game is a visual novel, a type of video game entirely story-driven. Most of the game is reading the story, though there are a few decision points along the way that ultimately decide the course of the story. There are three different endings to achieve.\n\nOverall, I felt this game was weak in several regards. Starting with the art, there is only one character sprite in the game, that of Ceri. Despite the presence of a few other important characters, such as the protagonist's parents and Ceri's father, no one else makes an actual physical appearance. Ceri also gets a voice actor in this game, in English, which is a bit different for a visual novel. However, I felt the acting often came off as very wooden and stilted.\n\nThe main problem of this visual novel is the writing. What we have here is a very shallow romance plot. Even though I clocked-in around two-and-a-half hours in this game, it felt like almost nothing happened. There was hardly any conflict or interesting or memorable points in the story. It just felt like some dialogue scenes with barely a plot to speak of. The pacing of the story is also poor. The entire story takes place over less than two weeks which makes the events seem ridiculously rushed. There was never much of a chance to develop the characters very much and I never cared about any of them. I must also especially fault the Ceri character. She is as clich\u00e9 as they come being written as a standard cute, but shy, girl (complete with large breasts) that has trouble making friends for vague reasons and it is up to you, the player, to act as her white knight. It all just struck me as a terribly unoriginal story that was never interesting.\n\nI find myself not recommending this visual novel. The writing and characterization is shallow, boring, and unoriginal.

This story makes you thinking about your life but I think that depends about yourself, what person you are, what have you seen and memory about events that makes you, You.\n\nI'm sure I will check other two but I was always a little into the feeling stuff. I'm really easy to be depressed, sad and thinking about what can happen if... Stories like this make me think, I like them but they make me really sad and happy in one moment. It can be weird, impossible some people can tell but no.\n\nPhilosophy is about thinking. A humans are different to the animals, even if WE are animals as well, differences are that we Thinking. We feel, we are all same and different in one simple way. Stories like this should wake up our mind and heart. Help us remember about others. Help us remember that we are not alone. Help some of us maybe try luck in life. Heck, this story is taken from true life! A history like this makes me think, how many times in world, our true real world we live, story like this happen? Or could happen? Or how many of us want to make story like this our own?\n\nAnd all of this I mean by see good ending. In bad ending I guess it will be just that we haven't do anything, like many of us should do, when our time comes. We live alone, we end alone. How many people there are alone just because they afraid our own race? Hatred, greed, anger and many more feelings are feeling humans hearts. Why? We should really try our best to live our life in good way with others. There are in us so beautiful feelings that are more powerful than some anger stuff? Love? Friendship? Heck, I don't want to just go on street and start hugging people. It's not abut that. It's about what we do against people we know for example or not know but are in close range to us? Classmates? Neighbor?\n\nBut yes, I'm telling a some bullshat and nothing else. Because who the hell cares about others? The most important thing for a human is ME.\n\nGraphic in game is great, artists make awesome work. Music is so beautiful and splendid that you can listen it and listen.

While this is only a visual novel you are given some choice throughout your gameplay, not too much but enough to affect the entire ending of the game. To give info on how easy the choices are, I, without knowing the outcome of my choices, recieved the best ending based on logic of relationships. So as long if you have basic psychology skills and pure common sense you should be fine getting through these decisions.\n\nGetting into depth with the story, here's a quick review. I was pretty neutral about the start of the story, as it seemed to start off like a typical \"Girl drops something, guy helps, Girl becomes flushed in appearance\" sort of way. a bit after the start of the story (roughly 15 minutes in) choices become really logical as stated before and your character's decisions and dialogue stay rational. The story stays like this for sometime, with numerous yet slight differentials in story mechanics. However, the novel really starts to become riveting at the climax.\n\n* I'm going to spoil some of the story here so DON'T put your cursor near the review while reading this *\n\n[spoiler] As you are up in Ceri's room she explains her life in the past 2 years. while she talks she informs the player about her being bullied by people due to self confidence issues, divorce between her Mother and Father, and being taken out of school because of her being bullied in school. She also goes on to explain how the player gave her a chance at being social again and both Ceri and the player are important they are in each other's lives.\n\nThis event of solace and commending is short lived because soon after the player notified by the father that Ceri's mother, who lives with her ex in Wales, is trying to regain custody of Ceri. [/spoiler]\n\nI honestly thought the overall story was adorable, while it could use a bit of patching up in some places. For some reason Ceri's own life and decisions reminded me of my own life somehow, most likely because I had to move twice (from around the Southfield area to Kalamazoo and then back in the span of 2 years) and I would fake my own illness to stop going to school to prevent me from seeing this one group of people than would always tantalize me throughout elementary and the start of middle school. I would also fake illness to prevent going places where there were a lot of people. This was basically the borderline of social anxiety that I had thoughout my early life, \t[spoiler] along with bipolar disorder...\t (I had a rough childhood [although video games, drawing, and music mainly helped] ) [/spoiler].\n\nIn the end, your reading a great visual novel and getting (basic) social advice by readin this, so you should probably get this visual novel before it becomes a pay2read.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe (True) Bad ending was messed up though", "timestamp_created": 1491186501, "timestamp_updated": 1503350757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30895743": {"recommendationid": "30895743", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993676094", "num_games_owned": 1642, "num_reviews": 430, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491121417}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but nice VN, it also comes with voice acting ^^ 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1491121454, "timestamp_updated": 1491121454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30872518": {"recommendationid": "30872518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146797829", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491566953}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, People in relationships like me can easily relate to the story.

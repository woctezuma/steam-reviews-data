It's a graphics-intensive point and click strategy game focused on capturing stuff and purchasing powerups.\n\n\"Levels\" consist of an interconnected network of nodes which you have to strategically capture. The network surrounds you and although I don't have VR, I can imagine how impressive this would be viewed from a headset. There are different types and sizes of nodes. Some are 'Sentinels' that have extra firewall protection which you have to remove using special 'Hydra' tools which have to be purchased and have a single use. You can also purchase 'Exploits' which allow you to auto-capture an area, and later on Worms once you've unlocked them (I don't know what they do yet!) There is always a time limit for the level, and if you're too slow then you don't get paid and you lose some skill rating points, so the Exploits help to speed things up in order to beat the deadline.\n\nThe main objective of the level is to capture the big central 'Root' node. The reward for doing so is a set number of BTC, the main currency of the game, which allows you to purchase permanent powerups and unlocks to enable you to tackle more difficult nodes.\n\nWhen you enter a node to capture it you see a 2D network with glowing virus points dotted around. You have to use your purple Viruses to infect certain nodes which then infect some of the surrounding network. There's a big yellow node in the centre of the network that you have to capture, but since you only have a limited number of Viruses it's usually necessary to make several attempts at it, or give up and try a different node. If you're successful you're rewarded with currency which you can use to purchase extra Viruses (these are multi-use and are the main tool) or single-use Hydras and Exploits. As you gain more and more Viruses this allows you to tackle the larger, more difficult nodes which give you more profit, more spending power and eventually get you closer to capturing the Root node.\n\n90% of the time you spend capturing nodes (2D networks) and it becomes a tranquil, zen, repetitive experience - well for a while anyway, until the time limits of the more advanced levels start kicking in. I'm still not entirely sure if the virus spread is 100% logical or if there's a random element to it. I suspect the latter because I haven't been able to work out a specific rule about it, and viruses often spread further or less than expected. Generally speaking though, you do get a gut instinct about it after a while. I wouldn't call it a logical puzzle game, it's more about gradually gaining power and always trying to push the envelope.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find a storyline of sorts depicted via reports on the main menu. It's a tale of corporate espionage and skulduggery, a nice distraction in between the main business of hacking nodes.\n\nOverall organisation of the game is one of the most elegant I've ever seen. You use left-click to \"zoom\" into sub-networks and right-click to zoom out again to the main galaxy and settings/purchase menus. It's all wonderfully intuitive and smooth, and zapping through wormholes to your destination is pretty cool.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nI have a GTX 1050Ti. The game runs smoothly with no lag, and my fans blow at what I would consider to be medium pace. GTX 970 is the minimum and I would advise you to heed this if you intend to buy. The optimisation is pretty good but you do need a decent card.\n\n[h1]Linux[/h1]\n\nI usually frown on Unity games without native Linux support, but Darknet works flawlessly in wine so I'll turn a blind eye on this occasion. Still, why not port it, it's only a button click for the dev. I asked about it on their forum a month ago but no response at all.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\nIt was released a few weeks ago but still has no Steam features at all, which seems quite unusual. Never mind, it's not a deal-breaker in my opinion.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nOnce again I'm extremely impressed with the way difficulty is handled. You go to the main 'cloud' of planets and incrementally increase or decrease the difficulty. Each time you do so a different system of worlds zooms up towards you. The higher the difficulty, the higher the BTC rewards. The difficulty of each world is represented as a percentage ranging from < 1% up to 50% and the BTC rewards match accordingly, from 1 BTC to 300! It shows you the percentages of what you 'stand to lose' and 'stand to gain' for your skill rating, although I'm not entirely sure how your skill rating fits into the picture at the moment.\n\nAnyway, the point is that anyone can play this game, from a 10 year old child to a hardened puzzle/strategy expert and you can be very specific about how much challenge you want, depending on your mood at the time.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nAlthough the scope/diversity of the game could be regarded as somewhat limited, the amount of content can't be faulted, there are tons of levels to keep you busy. There will inevitably be a lot of replay value as well, because once you get to the more difficult levels it's going to take multiple attempts to gain the BTC currency to increase your arsenal in order to tackle advanced levels.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nIt's a game I'm likely to play often but in short doses. The 2D network capture can become repetitive after a while but the overall powerup system and progression makes it a game that will feed your lust for power over the long term, while at the same time keeping your adrenaline levels at zero in a relaxing atmosphere.\n\n[quote]More reviews at SaveOrQuit.com[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1504510995, "timestamp_updated": 1504510995, "voted_up": true,

sa promesse de compatibilit\u00e9 VR et son look de jeu \u00e0 clics mais objectivement, Darknet est une bonne surprise. Dans la peau d\u2019un pirate, vous allez devoir collecter des n\u0153uds d\u2019informations dans plusieurs r\u00e9seaux pour atteindre des sommes vertigineuses.  Vous devrez, via un petit jeu de puzzle tr\u00e8s intelligent, acheter des virus et tenter de contaminer des points en esp\u00e9rant les voir atteindre le noyau du bloc d\u2019info pirat\u00e9 avant d\u2019\u00eatre contr\u00e9 par un anti-virus alentours. Il faut alors \u00eatre plus malin que le jeu et condamner quelques-uns de ces virus pour faire diversion.\n\nLe jeu se rebelle rapidement avec des boucliers et autres fioritures : d\u2019autres types d\u2019objets \u00e0 utiliser vous permettront de diminuer la force d\u2019un n\u0153ud, de collecter tous les n\u0153uds non-d\u00e9fendus aux alentours et autres bonus bienvenus. Rapidement, ce petit puzzle-game est tr\u00e8s addictif.\n\nDarknet n\u2019a pas de fin, pas vraiment de sc\u00e9nario (m\u00eame si quelques petites histoires sont propos\u00e9es \u00e0 la lecture) et se contente surtout d\u2019\u00eatre calme, tranquille, facile d\u2019acc\u00e8s et relaxant. Enti\u00e8rement traduit en fran\u00e7ais, voix comprises, il se permet donc une accessibilit\u00e9 pour tous vraiment salutaire. A chaque fin de partie, vous collecterez des points que vous pourrez d\u00e9penser dans des am\u00e9liorations : davantage d\u2019argent au d\u00e9but d\u2019un piratage par exemple, histoire de rendre votre prochaine partie encore plus amusante.\n\nOn s\u2019en lasse vite, mais Darknet fait tr\u00e8s bien son boulot : amuser. On vous le conseille !\"\n\nD'autres tests : http://www.gamesidestory.com/2017/07/31/rapide-critique-juillet-2017/", "timestamp_created": 1502140841, "timestamp_updated": 1502140841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33988670": {"recommendationid": "33988670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163247665", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 45, "last_played": 1515663689}, "language": "english", "review": "super fun game", "timestamp_created": 1501752901, "timestamp_updated": 1501752901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33953493": {"recommendationid": "33953493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079897359", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513717558}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really good VR puzzle game. It seems quite complicated at first, but thanks to a very good tutorial, you'll find yourself hacking like a pro in no time. It is essentially puzzles within puzzles - you have one bigger web where your overall objective is to hack the central node, but in order to get to it, you'll have to take over other nodes around it. And each node is in itself a little puzzle to solve, where you're trying to place viruses to spread to the centre before the enemy defenses spread and wipe you out. While I think the game would work on a flat screen, the VR still feels quite nice and gives you that Hackerman/I'M IN THE INTERNET feel, especially with the dark backgrounds and the bright colours that really pop in VR. Overall, a really good game to play, with just the right amount of challenge, and a nice way to while away the time.

Let me explain.  Darknet is extemely fun.  It's unlike any other VR game that I've seen to date and I've seen A LOT.  The gameplay is fun.  The graphics are very low res and cyber punk but they add so much to the game this way.  There really is no story line to follow or campaign to do but that doesn't matter.  The reason I say that it's not worth the $15 price tag is that it's a really old VR game (in VR terms) and the way the market is right now, you can get so much more VR bang for your buck.  I totally without a doubt think this game is worth buying but wait for it to go on sale.  If you ever see this game for 50% off then you need to jump on it!\n\nI also love the added bonus that this game comes as a bundle.  You get both the VR & NON-VR versions for the same price.

There is an initial tutorial hack and as you progress in the game you have to steal the data before your signal gets traced and this is reflected in hacks with a time limit. There are therefore different difficulty levels, with hacking getting progressively difficult throughout the game. The game also offers you the option to save and continue a hack later. The design is simple but is perfect for this game giving you the immersed feeling of being inside the net, the game has a lot of depth and therefore appeals to those who enjoy puzzles or strategic gameplay.

Darknet was essentially made by a team of 1 person, so it's pretty limited in scope. I chose to focus on providing really deep gameplay, which worked great for some people, but if the gameplay just doesn't click, it just doesn't work. \n\nIf you ever feel like trying again, I recommend picking a much more difficult level (you should have the option to do really difficult levels from the start; most people want a gentler ramp-up, but you might enjoy the extra challenge). If you're put off by the time limit, you can ignore it. The game won't reward your win, but if you pick a difficult level, it won't penalize you if you lose.

Once those nodes are used up you can place any other viruses you have in the remaining ones, allowing for some very good strategic thinking. Your goal is to infect the core.\n \n[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT[/b] \nThe environments are by design basic, but they are also done very well, i love the feeling of having your head in the node and this is pretty much how i imagine cyberspace to be.\n \n[b]GRAPHICS[/b] \nAgain somewhat minimalistic by design but they all fit perfectly and the animations are cool, i have no complaints here at all.\n \n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \nThe only issue i had was very very rarely the playspace rotated, this may of been down to me? But other than that no issues at all\n \n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nYou get a tutorial that is very well done and it is not long before you are playing it as though you have played it your whole life. Very cleverly done in game.\nThe menus can feel a bit overwhelming though, there is a panel for advanced users that is not explained (easter egg?) and ingame  if you look behind you in a node you see a keypad...i have yet to figure out what it is for beyond there is clearly a code\n \n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Amazingly addictive.\n[*] Way more fun than it has any right to be.\n[*] Great atmosphere (from a Lawnmower man / tron image of cyberspace...may be showing my age)\n[*] Plenty of replayability and permanent unlocks to be bought with your digital spoils.\n[*] For those unfortunate enough to not have a vr headset it does work on the standard mouse monitor system.\n[/list]\n \n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] I can not really think of any.\n[/list]\n \n[b]The first try video:[/b]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3OiyJKtLM\n \n[b]VERDICT[/b] \nThis is a very very good game, if you like strategy games it really is a no brainer. You will certainly get your money's worth here!\nIt is one of those games that if you own VR you should also own this.\n", "timestamp_created": 1496961595, "timestamp_updated": 1496961595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520093", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32273494": {"recommendationid": "32273494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024241089", "num_games_owned": 461, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511044060}, "language": "english", "review": "My son loves this game and is smiling all the time while playing it which is 5 hearts in my book. :)", "timestamp_created": 1496950168, "timestamp_updated": 1496950168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502564", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 62, "total_negative": 2, "total_reviews": 64}}

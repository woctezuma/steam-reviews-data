The rules are simple and every step is dicated by logic - no guessing required. It starts out gentle but ramps-up the difficulty very quickly, which is exactly what I look for as a seasoned veteran of puzzle games. The difficulty and size varied quite a bit, but it didn't bother me, as usually after a very tough huge puzzle I needed a small quick palette cleanser anyway.\nMechanics-wise the game is quite a bit simpler compared to other titles by the same developer as there are only a mere three: Groupings, Totals and Connected Tiles. That seems a bit lackluster, but it actually never felt boring and the mechanic about the Connected Tiles turns out to be quite smart and innovative (never seen it anywhere else). I had a fear this game would have been made redundant by the equally awesome Pictopix, but SquareCells turns out to still be very interesting and doing its own thing. Definitely worth playing if you enjoyed the other.\nThe \"requirement\" (only for an achievment) to perfect all levels without any mistakes is a bit silly, but I actually liked how it added a bit of tension.\n\nThe UI and looks are great and while minimalist appear very polished. I loved the includsion of a dark mode, which I haven't seen in any other title by the same developer. I liked that every group of levels has its own colour theme, just to spice up the very basic appearance. If anything the more recent CrossCells by the same developer actually looks a lot worse for some reason, so this might be the visual pinnacle.\n\nI actually can't say anything negative about this game. It's a solid logic puzzler that doesn't mess around in terms of difficulty. I really enjoyed myself for the roughly 5 hours of unique content and I can totally see myself going back in a few years.

Much like his trio of Hexcells games, you navigate a range of puzzles by using logic to reveal the patterns with certain rules. Is it as good as Hexcells? This is what I think of SquareCells.\n\nI'd like to start by saying how well made this is. It's yet another well crafted puzzle game that changes the formula slightly from the Hexcell games. It's also quite a bit harder, in my opinion. In the first few levels I was left baffled by the new rules and I confess I didn't like it much. I persevered with it though and it grew on me. To a point. The levels are very well designed and relaxing ambient music is as always great. \n\n I didn't really enjoy playing it though. I have no doubt this is a fine puzzle game and a must play for puzzle aficionados but it just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the new rules you use to reveal the pattern and it just felt too frustrating to me. I much prefer the somewhat simpler methods in Hexcells. Also with 36 puzzles it was a little on the short side, much like the other games.  By the end I resorted to using a guide to finish up as I wasn't having much fun but wanted to see it to the end. If nothing else It was satisfying revealing the patterns this way without pulling my hair out. \n\nIn conclusion, this is a fine puzzle game that just didn't click with me. I didn't enjoy it as much as Hexcells and it was much harder, especially towards the end.

(Also, on at least one occaision I lost a star and had no idea why.) Whats more, when you see how easy it is to solve any issue on the grid I could feel my frustration rise knowing I could cheat it at any time rather than go through the possibilities.*\n\nSecond, the rules are hazy. Take the final level, which is fresh in my mind, and also shows that even by the time I finished the game I still wasnt clear on this. You can draw the I in FIN one square higher and shunt the bottom square to one side. This fulfills all the given rules, so why does it fail? Well the column you are shunted to has no numbers indicating any blocks should be in them, but there are already blocks present so that cant be it, unless its only the on grid numbers that can override that? I honestly cant say for sure. \n\nThis level is easy comparatively speaking because it obviously spells a word so you know where the I should be, but when this kind of confusion over the rules happens in more complicated levels you are left wondering if youve some logic to solve or if you are just missing some nuance in the rules.\n\nThis isnt exactly game breaking, it didnt become a huge deal for me until the last row of puzzles, and I can still recommend the game, and preferably the whole pack, but it just doesnt feel as good, nor as satisfying as the other games and would be last on my list to get.\n\n\n*A quick thought on this. Im not sure why the game doesnt just let you make mistakes and only finish up when you have a completed grid, much like all the nonogram puzzles Ive played do. There maybe some problem Im missing that stops the mixture of mechanics working if it was made like that, but it would remove this problem and the need for stars entirely.", "timestamp_created": 1508702699, "timestamp_updated": 1508702699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35895293": {"recommendationid": "35895293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159585437", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508601498}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great puzzle game from Matthew Brown.

These tell you how many squares are connected but they can be in any order. So a lot of puzzles involve you placing down a square, and seeing if it\u2019s valid.

But each time I made a mistake, I learned from it, reset the puzzle, and started over - and eventually solved them, no guessing or using guides.\n\nOnly downsides are:\n1. It would be nice to have a \"maybe\" flag, similar to Minesweeper, for use in testing \"what if it's this square\" theories, without having to keep track of it all in your head.\n2. There's not a lot of replay value. All the puzzles are pre-made, so once you've beaten them, you know them. But I got 9 hours of distraction out of an $0.89 investment so I'm still feeling I got my money's worth!\n\nFully recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1501381485, "timestamp_updated": 1501386937,

It makes you think more and more as the levels progress. Sadly, there is no level generator so after you do the 36 pre-designed levels that's it. This makes brute force approach the quickest one, unfortunately. But for people who like at least some challenge (like me) just go slowly and enjoy it. It's from the same creator as the HexCells trilogy (which I'd say are better games) and CrossCells. However, the price tag is okay and the game gets nicely discounted too. Due to all of this I can recommend it for people who like HexCells or logic/puzzle games in general.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this review you can find more on the [/b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28638055-Subjective-Reviews-Corner/][u]Curator page[/u][/url][b] or in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1498493169, "timestamp_updated": 1499029558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32816174": {"recommendationid": "32816174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309594725", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498483166}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u56e0\u70baHexcells\u800c\u767c\u73fe\u9019\u6b3e\u904a\u6232\uff08\u8d81\u590f\u7279\u5165\u624b\uff01\uff09\n\u904a\u6232\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u9ede\u50cf\"Paint it back\"\u9019\u6b3e\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u4f46\u53c8\u591a\u4e86\u9ede\u8b8a\u5316\n\u9664\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e00\u884c\u3001\u6bcf\u4e00\u5217\u7684\u6578\u5b57\u63d0\u793a\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u683c\u5b50\u4e2d\u4e5f\u542b\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u5143\u7d20\n\u8b93\u73a9\u6cd5\u66f4\u52a0\u7684\u591a\u5143\u548c\u6709\u8da3\n\n\u904a\u6232\u65b9\u5f0f\u6c92\u6709Hexcells\u90a3\u9ebc\u76f4\u89c0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e00\u9ede\u7684\u5168\u5c40\uff08\uff1f\uff09\u601d\u8003\n\u6574\u9ad4\u4f86\u8b1b\u6bd4Hexcells\u9084\u8981\u96e3\u4e00\u9ede\u9ede\u9ede\uff0c\u89ba\u5f97\u66f4\u6709\u6311\u6230\u6027:3\n\n\u671f\u5f85\u672a\u4f86\u80fd\u51fa\u7121\u9650\u95dc\u5361:D\n", "timestamp_created": 1498486123, "timestamp_updated": 1498486123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32807859": {"recommendationid": "32807859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148487699", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498469564}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6bd4\u8d77Hexcell\u96be\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5173\u5361\u7a81\u7834\u53e3\u5f88\u5c11\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u7ed9\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u5173\u5361\u68cb\u76d8\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6709\u4e9b\u7d2f\uff0c30\u5173\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u7ea2\u8272\u65b9\u5757\u4e5f\u5341\u5206\u8fa3\u773c\u775b\u3002\n\n\u8981\u8f7b\u677e\u4f11\u95f2\u7684\u8bdd\u8fd8\u662f\u63a8\u8350Hexcell\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1498470055, "timestamp_updated": 1498470055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32752868": {"recommendationid": "32752868", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281858555", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498357782}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9002\u5408\u559c\u6b22\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f3a\u8feb\u75c7\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002\n\n10 OUT 10!", "timestamp_created": 1498359095, "timestamp_updated": 1498359095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32744814": {"recommendationid": "32744814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098616747", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498557890}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Sudoku gibi d\u00fc\u015f\u00fcnd\u00fcren bulmacalar\u0131 seviyorsan\u0131z kesinlikle indirimdeyken al\u0131n.

As well as having a very attractive first name, he makes the best minimilistic puzzlers out there. \n\nPart of the hexcells series (more like a spin-off, hopefully a spin-off series), whilst tragically short, will give you around 3 hours of puzzling goodness. If you played his hexcells series, this is more of the same but with 4 sided shapes, known as squares... hence the aptly titled \"square cells\".\n\nThe puzzles are also very similar to picross, so if you enjoyed that, this is like that but a little more condensed and in my opinion, more intelligent.

Your only help in this task is a bunch of numbers both on, around and below the matrix. These numbers give you just enough info to figure out the rest on your own. They may inform you how many connected squares there are in a row, or column. Or of how many connected squares an area within the matrix consists. Or how many squares in general still need to go. You will have to pay attention to all of these, and then it will be possible to solve each puzzle entirely with brain power. Guessing is never necessary.\nThe game starts off easy and gets pretty hard towards the end. In the later levels, sometimes you're expected to think a few steps ahead. In case that got too taxing, I found it helpful to take a screenshot and draw \"what if\" scenarios on them (this might just help if you can't wrap your head around a solution, hint, hint).\nThis game may make you feel stupid sometimes but it's rewarding when you finally figure it out.

I mean, it's okay, but it's very similar to Hexcells in terms of the thinking involved, but also not as good? That's arguably, because of the way some of the puzzles here are solved, but I'll write about it in a bit.\n\nIf you've played Hexcells, you know more or less what you're getting. What I was expecting, though, was a bit of variety in the pictures formed (probably because of Picross). It would be a nice addition and departure from Hexcells, having a more visual component to the puzzles. The game isn't really designed as so, which is very clear when you finish a level, by getting a dark gray screen over the picture, making it much less of a focus.\n\nThis was just my own expectation, though, having very little to do with the game.\n\nWhy don't I think this is as good as Hexcells?\n\nWell, Hexcells always relied on a single move (although there were several possible, at times) that you discovered after a bit of thinking. Mostly by having many constraints and finding just the right combination to put them together and find a new move. Then you could have a few quick moves in succession because of the new insight, until you get stumped again and are in need to a new \"aha!\" moment.\nThis is mostly because every move in Hexcells is a commitment, of sorts. Whether you \"reveal\" or \"hide\" a piece, you're making a final decision. If it's wrong, the game complains and you are penalized on the final score. This is good!\n\nSquareCells has some of that, but toned down. Only \"hide\" moves are a final commitment. \"Reveal\"s are not. This seems a very small change, but it seemed to influence the puzzles as well: instead of being able to rely on the \"aha!\" moment every time, you sometimes had to try a couple of paths. You would \"Reveal\" certain pieces, and execute the successive new moves hoping to find a contradiction in the rules -- if you did, you simply undo those moves and try another option.\n\nThis is a small change in the puzzles' logic, but it seemed to be very important, to me. And I didn't enjoy this kind of longer trains of thought.\n\nI guess the \"aha!\" moments are simply trains of thought of the same kind, but shorter trains. As a result, you can do them quickly in your head, almost unconsciously, and get a kick from it.\nWhen you have to explicitly try out different paths, it gets messy.\n\nI hope this didn't get too pseudo-scientific... Perhaps other people will have a greater capacity for this kind of logical thought and find HexCells and SquareCells exactly the same? \n\nEither way, SquareCells is still a very solid game!

Do you like logic puzzles? If yes, then Mathew Brown, the developer of SquareCells and HexCells, is your best friend. Tip him the cup of coffee this game costs, you can't go wrong.\n\nThis is a simple, short, no nonsense puzzle game in a minimalist package. You can call it a cross between picross and minesweeper if you want, but the important thing here is: it's neither. With just a couple of tiny changes in the mechanics, SquareCells actually forces even veteran puzzle solvers to step out of their comfort zone and start thinking for a couple of hours. \n\nThe game is deviously smart in its simplicity and, as always with this dev's puzzles, absolutely logical at all points. If you can't find a solution, think harder, it is staring you right in the face. (Or get a tip by listening to the explanations in Innocentive's [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=578471051]video guides[/url] - they will help you figure out that one logical step you're missing. Cause puzzle 35 is mean I tell you!) There are only 36 puzzles to solve, with none of them being throw-away easy, even at the beginning. In fact most of them are just difficult enough to make you scratch your head for a few minutes before you start feeling smug about how smart you are for solving them.

Cells are connected only in vertical or horizontal directions.\n* The number at the bottom shows how many uncovered cells are yet to be removed from the puzzle.\n\nThis is a very enjoyable game, together with the Hexcells family of games (all of these from the same developer). All of the puzzles can be solved using pure logic.\n\nAs a bonus, you can also toggle the graphics between light or dark style.", "timestamp_created": 1462630980, "timestamp_updated": 1462630980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22842633": {"recommendationid": "22842633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180276166", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462621705}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Net weer een stapje moeilijker dan de japanse puzzels :D", "timestamp_created": 1462621767, "timestamp_updated": 1462621767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22834513": {"recommendationid": "22834513", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998752229", "num_games_owned": 841, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462575198}, "language": "english", "review": "A really nice followup to the Hexcells series.

If you have not played all the Hexcells games, get those and play them. They are decidedly better. If you have exhaused those and all the user-designed levels on Reddit (as I have), get this.\n\nWhy is it is weaker than Hexcells? Well, you know, sophomore slump, regression toward the mean, whatever. Hexcells is brilliant. It feels like the perfect puzzle game. With this one, Mr. Brown found a good mechanic, but just not that good. I have not worked out all the theory, but basically there is just not as much he could do with it. There are only so many ways to create a logical constraint here, fewer than Hexcells and not as clever feeling. And many of them involve a lot of counting, which gets really tedious. I cannot put my finger on exactly why, but it is just not as fun.\n\nI finished it in two sittings. Only a few of the levels really felt as satisfying as a decent Hexcells level feels (let alone the brilliant ones). Maybe Mr. Brown has some other mechanics up his sleeve, along with some new levels, as with the Hexcells series. As is, however, this is merely a solidly good puzzle game.

From the developer of the Hexcells series (easily my favorite puzzle series - think of Minesweeper but better) comes SquareCells. It is very similar to Hexcells with the exception that your units are composed of squares. You will have similar column, row, group/broken group and adjacent group hints that propel you through the 36 puzzles. The game will last about 5-8 hours depending how strong of a puzzle solver you are.\n\nCompared to Hexcells Infinite, you no longer have the ability to infinitely generate puzzles, so 36 is all you will get. The complexity is not quite on the same level either, but the last world of SC was fairly difficult for me, taking about 30-40 min per puzzle. Although the hints are similar, the strategies for solving some of the sections are rather new. One consistent aspect is that you will never have to guess on a unit, nor will you be left with any 50/50 choices like in Fine Sweeper or other Minesweeper clones.\n\n[h1]Score[/h1]\nFor fans of the Hexcells series that want a little bit of style change, I definitely recommend getting this game.

This makes for some neat logic puzzles, particularly if you're aiming for a perfect solution (each error loses you a star). It can be a bit frustrating on the longer puzzles to make a silly mistake near the end and have to start over (assuming you want a perfect score, as if we wouldn't).

HexCells series, I was interested in this game to see if this idea would work in a classic 4-directional format (like Minesweeper).\n\nI'm not sure whether it was the puzzles created, or the concept as a square set-up, but I didn't enjoy this game as much as I did HexCells. There is an adjustment for people who have the diagonal HexCells mindset, but after acclimating to squares, it just didn't have the same spark. The complexity in what you have to account for is traded in for sometimes harder logic, making SquareCells seem less rewarding when solving a puzzle, compared to HexCells.\n\nOne thing that threw me through a loop initially was that the representations of numbers changes between HexCells and SquareCells: Numbers in brackets such as [3] now represent scattered numbers, where in HexCells, that representation would be number of square in a row. The focus also changes from ignoring the \"mines\" to marking them in the style of Minesweeper. Additionally, several of the mechanics that made HexCells fairly unique (such as revealed tiles giving clues to surrounding tiles), were not included here, presumably due to the inability to logically introduce them.\n\nIt's not a bad game in itself, but it doesn't meet par with what puzzle games like this should meet. I would argue HexCells is not only a more unique concept, but works much better in the style that the developer created, compared to having to throw away a lot of the charm to fit the Minesweeper mould.", "timestamp_created": 1454745559, "timestamp_updated": 1454745583, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589097", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20983130": {"recommendationid": "20983130", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968572375", "num_games_owned": 719, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454719571}, "language": "english", "review": "Another pure logic (no guesses necessary) puzzler, by the same developer as the superb Hexcells series.\n\nA slightly different puzzle mechanic, but just as satisfying to solve.

When I saw he had made a new game similar to the hexcells series I just had to pick it up. \n\nAt first sights squarecells seems like a massive step back from hexcells. It has lost it's main gimmick, being the hexagons cells. But at the core it is still the same old game that we know and love. You still have to find the squares using different techniques. \n\nFor some reason squarecells seems to be lacking many different systems of showing where the squares are. Hexcells had many different ways of indicating which places had hexes in them but squarecells seems to stick with only using a few. It introduces each of them very early on and doesn't evolve on them. For me this is very disapointing and led to a fairly lackluster experience. \n\nThe difficulty is still there in squarecells. It is a very difficult game and will take a lot of thought to solve each level without mistakes. \n\nDon't get me wrong, dispite my complaints I did still really enjoy squarecells. However I don't think it's anywhere as good as it's predecessors. I think the developer feels that after the release of infinite he had drew the hexcells series dry, but I don't believe this is the case. I would love to see more handcrafted levels for hexcells instead of more levels for squarecells. \n\nIf you haven't yet played any game from the hexcells series I would recommend picking up all of them games and playing them first because they are definitely better. But if you have played all of the hexcells series this is definitely a game worth picking up while you wait for more content.

I can't put into words how much I love this game, and how much I love the Hexcells trilogy, and how much I love Matthew Brown...okay, is that too weird? Sorry.\n\nAnyways, there are three main \"rules\" to this game. 1: Squares do not connect diagonally. 2: Numbers without brackets indicate the order blocks that are part of the pattern are in. 3: Numbers with brackets indicate only the number of blocks in the row, not the order they are in. 4: Numbers on blocks indicate that that block is a part of a group of blocks the size of the number shown. \n\nI guess that was four rules...so yeah. Seems simple, right? WRONG! These puzzles are delightfully challenging, especially the second half. The thing is, there's no guesswork involved. You just have to use pure logic to solve them. And logic is similar to common sense, of which I have none, so I'm not the greatest at the game. But I'm okay with that, I still love it to death.\n\nI can't wait for a sequel or two of this series, hence my question at the beginning.

I love both of those and SquareCells cancels the main problem nonograms have out. Nonograms tend to get easier the closer you get to their solution. SquareCells doesn't do that.\n\nSo how does it work?\nAt the beginning of each puzzle, you see a grid with coloured square blocks. In each column and line there is a set amount of blocks that need to be marked while the rest needs to be removed. Nonograms work the same way but they normally give you the exact number of blocks that need to be marked in each column and line and even tell you how they are connected. But as you can see on the screenshots, SquareCells doesn't do that all the time. Instead it gives you other hints like a number directly on the blocks themselves. That means a set number of marked blocks are connected to the one with the number on it. Or maybe there is a number in brackets next to a line, which means that in this line there are x number of blocks to be marked, but their connection to each other is not clear. Later in the game even the counter below the puzzle, which tells how many blocks still need to be removed, is to be considered.\n\nThe game does a very good job of introducing the player to its rules and it gets progressively harder. It's hard for me to tell, whether the difficulty of the last puzzles of SquareCells is on par with the difficulty of the last ones in Hexcells Infinite but they are definitely not easy.\n\nBut SquareCells also has one or two things, that might be a problem for you.\nHexcells Infinite had a random puzzle generator which SquareCells doesn't have. Personally, I don't care about that, because the randomly generated puzzles in Hexcells weren't as challenging as the rest of the game and I found them boring most of the time.\nAnother thing is the colour scheme of the game. In my opinion the marked blocks don't distinct themselves very well from the not marked ones. After staring at a puzzle for a few minutes, it almost gives me a headache distinguishing the marked blocks from the normal ones. Mr. Matthew Brown patched a dark colour scheme option into the game recently and this helps a little bit with that issue but more contrast between marked and not marked blocks would still be nice.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed SquareCells and I hope there will be another one.

If you already played [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/]Hexcells[/url], [i]SquareCells[/i] is rather similar although a couple of particular differences arise. If you liked Hexcells, you'll likely like SquareCells as well. For the rest of you that's just total gibberish, so let's get some details on the table. What kind of puzzles are these exactly?\n\n[h1]The Same: The First Law of [i]SquareCells[/i][/h1]\n\n[i]SquareCells[/i] is an abstract puzzle game. Each level is a square of [b]n[/b] times [b]n[/b] cells, [b]n[/b] getting progressively larger as you get further into the game. Your job as the mastermind is to remove the unworthy cells and fill the ones that fit the pattern. Pattern is perfectly defined by two rules.\n\nThe first rule is that every column and row has a bunch of numbers (sometimes none). These dictate how many cells are filled in sequence in that particular row or column, and if there are several numbers, there has to be an empty square in-between the groups. This is actually the exact same rule as used in [i]Hanjie[/i] puzzles.\n\nTo stir the rule a bit, some columns and rows just report having a set number of filled squares but no rule about their sequence.\n\n[h1]But different: The Second Law of [i]SquareCells[/i][/h1]\n\nThe second rule is that when a cell has a number in it, that number dictates how many cells are filled and connected into that cell. A chain rule if you will.\n\nThat's it really. Both rules are then used in all levels to create increasingly challenging puzzles.\n\nAside from the second rule the game is very similar to [i]Hexcells[/i]. However, while in [i]Hexcells[/i] you could not solve the puzzles by pen & paper because of the minesweeper mechanics, [i]SquareCells[/i] puzzles are totally self-consistent and contain no hidden information. In principle, they could appear in a newspaper! Of course, the rules are more complicated than traditional pen & paper puzzles somewhat justifying the digital medium.\n\n[h1]Casual but fun[/h1]\n\nLike [i]Hexcells[/i], the game is polished with a very nice interface, though the white screen might be inconvenient when playing in a dark room (UPDATE: game now offers a dark contrast option averting this issue). Game has 36 levels, distributed in chunks of 6 that have to be completed before proceeding (you can always skip one though). Conveniently, the game is automatically saved when you quit a level.\n\nThe first 24 or so levels took me mere 2 hours to complete and at that point I was feeling it was too short. Then I blew 5 hours more for the last 12 puzzles, so I'm taking that back. The last 12 levels were indeed refreshingly difficult and it felt satisfying to complete them without guesses. A couple of times I was convinced that a particular puzzle was unsolvable without guesswork but was proved pleasantly wrong in all such occasions.\n\nI think 7 hours and 36 puzzles for a 3 $/\u20ac game is pretty swell, so I'm totally recommending it even at full price, especially for abstract puzzle game fans.", "timestamp_created": 1450571263, "timestamp_updated": 1450710995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571699", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19766961": {"recommendationid": "19766961", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971188985", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472313714}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a simple review here.

If you enjoy either of those, or other types of logic puzzles such as sudoku, you'll definitely also find this game enjoyable (along with the HexCells games, if you haven't already played them).\n\nEach puzzle is made up of a grid of square cells, with the goal being to remove all the squares that aren't part of the solution. A few different types of clues are provided, and can be used in combination with each other to logically determine which cells are safe to remove. Of particular note is a type of clue that I've only ever seen in this game - numbers written on the squares themselves that indicate what size of a group of squares (connected horizontally or vertically) they are a part of. No guessing is ever required for any of the puzzles, there is always enough information present to be able to progress through the puzzle, though it's often not immediately obvious how to do so (which is where the challenge comes from).\n\nFor people that have played the HexCells games, there are some noticeable (but fairly minor) improvements to the interface in this game. For example, the number hints on rows/columns now automatically gray out when satisfied, so you don't need to manually mark the hints as completed any more, and there are some nice small indicators showing which row and column your mouse cursor is currently in so that you can find the relevant hints more easily.\n\nHowever, there are also a few odd interface choices that make things a little more difficult than they need to be. Primarily, when you mark a square as being part of the solution (so it should definitely not be removed), it only adds some subtle indicators, instead of doing something more obvious like changing its color. This makes it a little hard to see quickly which squares you've fully decided to keep. It also feels a little strange that the previously-mentioned squares with \"part of a group of x\" hints aren't automatically marked as \"keep\", since there's never a case where they should be removed.\n\nOne other thing that feels like a small step back from the HexCells games is that you are no longer allowed any mistakes at all if you want to get the full 3 stars from a level. HexCells always gave you one \"free\" mistake, in that you could go on to finish a level after making a single mistake and still receive the maximum rating, but SquareCells is less forgiving. In some of the larger/longer puzzles, it was nice to be able to continue on if I made an error in my thinking, and it can be frustrating here to need to start over in that case.\n\nI know this is a difficult problem for the developer to solve, since there definitely needs to be a punishment to prevent people from just guessing wildly whenever they get stuck, but this type of game is completely trivial to cheat on, so in the end you really just need to trust that the player wants to do it \"properly\". Giving a bit of leeway was nice, because when I've spent a long time working my way through a puzzle and make a mistake due to a miscalculation (or even a misclick), my inclination is just to take a screenshot of where I am, restart the puzzle and fill it back in to that point again. I don't want to think through everything from scratch again just to get back to the same state as before.\n\nDespite these minor complaints though, I do still highly recommend this game, especially at such a low price. And I hope that the developer intends to keep expanding on the concepts here similar to what he did with the HexCells series, I'll definitely be looking forward to any follow-ups.\n\n(Note: edited to remove a section related to the lack of a sfx-only option at launch, since that was added in the 1.1 patch)", "timestamp_created": 1449818762, "timestamp_updated": 1450915008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19609119": {"recommendationid": "19609119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014389178", "num_games_owned": 1064, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450560736}, "language": "english", "review": "SquareCells is similar in style to developer Matthew Brown's popular Hexcells trilogy, and is another great buy for fans of Japanese style logic puzzles.\n\nThe game starts out as a nonogram puzzle, where you have groups of numbers along the top and left side indicating groups of consecutive marked cells in the columns and rows next to them. It's up to the player to deduce where these marked cells might be, using the available information, and unlike games like Minesweeper, guesswork is never needed. Each puzzle has a counter displaying how many numbers to remove, and though you don't always need this information to solve a puzzle, you should keep it in mind for when you do.\n\nThis isn't just another nonogram though, and the complexity is quickly taken up a notch when a new puzzle element resembling kuromasu is introduced into the game. These clues consist of numbers on the puzzle grid itself, denoting how many cells to connect with marks by branching off in horizontal and vertical directions. Diagonals do not touch, but any surplus cells have to be removed to not exceed the indicated number. This while still abiding by the nonogram clues, which will now be absent from several rows and columns to leave you with just enough information to solve the puzzles.\n\nThe final puzzle mechanic is an old acquaintance from the Hexcells games; namely the bracket enclosed total hint. This is an alternative to the nonogram clues, but unlike those, it only indicates how many cells to mark in a row or column, and says nothing about how marked cells are distributed. Puzzles will now utilize all of these mechanics, making for some really difficult challenges by the time you get through the game.\n\nA feature I really like in SquareCells is that you can exit any level and come back to it later. There's no limit to how many levels you can suspend either, so if you have to go do something else or want to tackle a few other puzzles in the meantime, you can.\n\nThe Linux version isn't without issues though, and the game would initially [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/416770/discussions/0/492379439687359165/]crash on launch[/url]. That problem has been resolved, but many Linux users are still unable to unlock Steam achievements. This isn't the first Unity 5 game to have Linux specific issues, but hopefully these quirks will get ironed out soon.\n\nIt took me about 5 hours to get through the whole game, and considering the low price of the game and the high quality of the puzzles, that's a great value for money if you like games like this one. I wholeheartedly recommend it, and I hope it turns into another trilogy.\n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] This review was originally posted on [url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/squarecells-a-new-puzzle-game-from-the-developer-of-hexcells-has-been-released-on-steam.6352/]GamingOnLinux[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1449783522, "timestamp_updated": 1449783656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641452", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19608056": {"recommendationid": "19608056", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964734519", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 973, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450191659}, "language": "english", "review": "Moar.

I absolutely adore puzzle games, and HexCells (another series by this same dev) was the game I had been wanting since the 90s: A Minesweeper-esque game without the craptastic guessing. I loved the whole HexCells series (original, Plus, and Infinite), and bought/played/mastered them all right away. Each one was better than the last, and Infinite was as close to perfection as a Minesweeper-type game could possibly be. I think HexCells Infinite is the only game to dethrone Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons in my rating system.\n\nSo when I saw another Cells game in the Steam new release section, I picked it up right away, installed it while working, and spent my lunch break zipping through the early levels. It was fantastic fun. I was expecting Hexcells-in-a-grid, but ended up getting a mix of Hexcells and Picross, and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nAfter getting home in the evening, though, some of the shine started to wear off. I thought HexCells nailed the gradual progression really well, and introduced new mechanics after you got comfortable with the old ones. Squarecells, on the other hand, gives you the mechanics right up front and then just increases the trickiness. It's similar to Sudoku, in that the difficulty is not in introducing new mechanics, but rather in how well-hidden the next clue is and how much brainpower it takes to figure out.\n\nDon't get me wrong, HexCells wasn't an easy game in the later levels, and to be fair, you can use the information SquareCells gives you to draw the same conclusions that you could in HexCells (with the exception of the radius thing), but the whole thing is WAY more cerebral and feels quite a bit slower. In the later levels of SquareCells, it really felt like I was just staring at my screen for 5-minute stretches at a time, trying to find what I was missing. If I'd been on my phone, I would have been fighting to keep the screen awake. In the last few levels (which took easily 1/4 my entire play time), most of my time was spent thinking of \"ok, if this is a cell, this and this would have to be cells, but THIS one couldn't be...\" until I'd built up half the board as possibilities in my mind.\n\nAnd then it's over.\n\nHexCells Infinite really spoiled me, I guess. The original HexCells and Plus were both fairly short games, but since Infinite came along (with its random level generation), I really feel the brevity of the campaign here. There's only 36 levels, and you'll be halfway through within an hour (time to beat each level increases drastically as you go). There's no replayability, either, once you've done the levels with no mistakes. I'm hoping more SquareCells games are coming, but this one only lasted me about 3.5 hours of active time, which was a little disappointing. HexCells and HexCells Plus didn't take much longer, but again, Infinite must have spoiled me.\n\nI'm glad I spent my few dollars on this game, and I'll definitely be picking up future ones, but I can't say this takes over as my go-to casual puzzle game. Puzzle fans should definitely give it a look, but pick up the HexCells series first (Infinite, if you can only have one).", "timestamp_created": 1449716165, "timestamp_updated": 1449716283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509585", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19593230": {"recommendationid": "19593230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019064906", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449712492}, "language": "english", "review": "Shallower than Hexcells (fewer mechanics) but still a pleasant game.\nHas a built-in save game but it only works if you exit correctly (pressing Exit in the screen).\n\nEdit: late night English mistakes.", "timestamp_created": 1449712562, "timestamp_updated": 1449714760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19591642": {"recommendationid": "19591642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010378698", "num_games_owned": 603, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458861112}, "language": "english", "review": "I was able to solve all the puzzles in 3 hours.

Like its predecessors, it presents you with information from which you can deduce the answer without ever having to resort to induction or guessing. Because you have to posit the \"move\" that you feel will best account for the information at hand, it can seem to new players that there is creative leeway, but there is none, and the joy of the game is knowing in advance that you are right, much like seeing a forced mate combination in chess. It took roughly a dozen cups of coffee to finish it, and as with the three Hexcell games last winter, I was left wanting more. Matthew Brown doesn't even need to improve on the formula, in my opinion - he just needs to charge more for his games and start working overtime. Level generators are no substitute - the beauty of these puzzles is in their hand crafted nature. \n\nThough I'd give it a perfect score even at double the price, there are some cons. Like in Hexcells, making a mistake means you start over, to get a perfect score. But since the square that you missclicked will have been revealed to you, it is no longer deduction but a solution from memory. The drawback is then that we have to police ourselves, for instance by postponing the second attempt until the mistake is forgotten. It is more decisive here than in hexcells, since the maps are smaller. And like other people have mentioned, the game screen is small even on big monitors. \n\nMore please.", "timestamp_created": 1449681871, "timestamp_updated": 1449681871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19585616": {"recommendationid": "19585616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089734007", "num_games_owned": 511, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449601801}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u7206\u5f3e\u3092\u6b8b\u3057\u3066\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u7834\u58ca\u3057\u3066\u3044\u304f\u70b9\u3067\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30d1\u306b\u4f3c\u3066\u3044\u308b.\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30d1\u597d\u304d\u306a\u3089\u30cf\u30de\u308c\u308b\u306f\u305a.\n\n\u305f\u3060\u3057\u7206\u5f3e\u306e\u63a8\u5b9a\u306e\u4ed5\u65b9\u304c\u7570\u306a\u308b.\n\u30de\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30d1\u306e\u7206\u5f3e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u306e\u63a8\u5b9a\u306f, \n\u30fb\u96a3\u63a5\u3059\u308b\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6570\u304b\u3089\u63a8\u5b9a\n\u30fb\u6b8b\u308a\u306e\u7834\u58ca\u53ef\u80fd\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u304b\u3089\u63a8\u5b9a\n\u306e2\u3064\u306e\u8981\u7d20\u3060\u3063\u305f\u306e\u306b\u5bfe\u3057\u3066, \n\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306f\n\u30fb\u5168\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u5916\u5468\u306e\u6570\u5b57\u304b\u3089\u305d\u306e\u884c(\u5217)\u306e\u7dcf\u7206\u5f3e\u6570\u3092\u898b\u308c\u308b\u306e\u3067, \u305d\u3053\u304b\u3089\u63a8\u5b9a\u3059\u308b.

And definitely recommended for puzzle lovers in general.\n\nThis game adds some very interesting new elements to the traditional nonogram formula, but retains the same simpleness in the way the rules work. Several levels in I was starting to feel that familiar sense where the tricks to making the most out of each clue start to click!\n\nI was a little afraid that 36 puzzles wouldn't be enough, but the more challenging ones can sometimes take a while to figure out. I'm about 2/3 through with the game and definitely feel like I got my money's worth!\n\nIt's very beautifully presented and the sound effects are very charming, although I wish the music and sound effects options were separate.\n\nMy only real gripe about the game is that I wish the puzzle solutions made pictures instead of just random jumbles of pixels. There were a small handful that made nice geometric patterns, but the majority of them were just pixelated noise.\n\nIt's also a minor inconvenience that one misclear of a tile that shouldn't be cleared will cost you a 3-star rating. Personally, I prefer not being told I messed up immediately and just letting me know when I get the correct solution.\n\nPros:\n- Adds to the nonogram style puzzle in a creative, but in a easy to understand way\n- Looks and sounds great\n- Challenging puzzles\n\nCons:\n- Have to exit all the way to the main menu to toggle sound or left vs right click controls\n- Veteran nonogram solvers may be disappointed by the lack of solutions that make pictures.\n- Easy to accidentally click the wrong button and lose a 3-star rating\n\nEdit now that I've finished the game:\nI'm not sure if I'm just not good enough or if it's really true, but I'm pretty sure that the later levels require a little bit of guesswork (not a lot, I only had to guess on maybe 3 or 4 of them). I like nonograms/picross because you can make educated guesses based on what the picture might turn out to be but since the patterns here are mostly random it's kind of just a shot in the dark.\n\nThis wouldn't be so much of a problem if we could mark cells as possible fills/empties, or if the game didn't immediately disqualify you for a 3-star rating for making one mistake.", "timestamp_created": 1449558079, "timestamp_updated": 1451037176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19560997": {"recommendationid": "19560997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059683164", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449713490}, "language": "english", "review": "5 Stars.\n\nThis game blends everything I like about Sudoku with everything I like about Minesweeper and presents it beautifully. After downloading it, I immediately lost myself for two hours and I intend to play even more. \n\nThe Mechanics-- Very inuitive and succint. All the necessary information is presented accessibly. Making a mistake in this game is a little more forgiving than in Minesweeper. Rather than forcing you to restart the whole puzzle, the game simply removes one of the stars (out of three) from your score and corrects your mistake.\n\nThe Presentation-- This game definitely shines in this category. The game is nice to look at. Beautiful, actually. It has a minimalistic design and a calm color palette. The game also has a fun musical aspect to it. Ambient background music is constantly playing and adding to the wonderful mellow mood of the game, and with every click you make, a note plays that complments the background music.

Of course, any fan of Hexcells would also appreciate this.  The puzzles are well made and good a good test of logic, so no need for guessing.\n\nThe UI is nice and clean and everything plays smoothly.  \n\nEdit:  Looks like there is a way to change mouse buttons.  It was small in the lower left corner of the menu screen.  A mouse with a toggle to switch.  Didn't notice my first time playing, but wanted to point that out.\n\nI hope the developer decides to come back to SquareCells to add interesting new mechanics to ramp up the difficulty even more, much like Hexcells Plus did.  Or add a generator like Hexcells Infinite.  Both would be welcome additions.\n\nThere isn't much need for more of a review.

You know this game is for you already.\nDo you like Hexcells? You know this game is for you already.\nDo you enjoy reasonably tough logic puzzle games with a supremely calming aesthetic? This game is for you. \n\nSqaureCells comes from the developer of Hexcells, a series of amazingly well designed logic puzzle games that are reminiscent of Minesweeper with shades of Picross, Nintendo's series of logic puzzle games. I'd highly suggest you check those games out before this one, if only because they're fantastic and can be had cheaply during sales.\n\nSquareCells is much more of a direct take on Picross. For those that don't know, Picross is a puzzle game where you're given a square or rectangle and tasked to remove blocks, guided by numbers indicating how many blocks are in each row or column. You'll generally be rewarded with an image of some kind. SquareCells is very much that, though the images are more abstract.\n\nThere's a unique mechanic that Brown has added to the mix, a number on a square that indicates how many squares it is directly connected to. It's one of those concepts that really changes the way you think about Picross puzzles, and allows him to get away with presenting less information while still creating fair puzzles. The logical possibilities that arise from this provide the unique spin on the Picross formula that this game needs to stand out.\n\nI've finished the game with three stars on every puzzle, and while it starts out fairly simple to introduce people new to Picross it eventually gets quite tricky, especially in the last tier of puzzles. I never had to make logical leaps or even educated guesses, which is always a plus. Took me 5 hours to 100% the game, which I find to be a decent price/content ratio, even without it being on sale.\n\nIt's $3 currently, absolutely worth it for a well-made relaxing puzzle game.

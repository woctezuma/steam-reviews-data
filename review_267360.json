I do think it a decent story of someone finding her a way to redeem herself. \n\nGameplay:\n\nStraight forward run and shoot gameplay. Just jump and shoot and it works well.  I never figured out how to switch weapons but there a good to use with my favourites being rapid fire and the homing fire blast. Enemies are colour coded from green to grey so you know how dangerous they are. They even have a flash effect when they\u2019re about to attack so you have time to dodge.\n\nThe levels and episodes are both pretty short which is good cause this game has no save system. The bosses are decent with a good but silly final boss but one thing I found odd is that mini bosses appear in the last level before a main boss. There aren\u2019t too hard and you usually get a reward for beating them, it just seems like on odd place to put a mini boss.\n\nPresentation:\n\nThe first Duke Nukem game was my main thought when I seen this art style. Everything has that early DOS feel with it\u2019s backgrounds, pictures and sound effects.

But after a few minutes of play you'll find yourself mowing through surprisingly quickly with very solid controls, an extremely powerful standard jump that makes exploring fun and easy, lots of powerful weapons you can use as often as you'd like and will almost definitely never completely run out of them all, balanced and fun enemies to face that can be challenging but aren't too tough to handle on a first run, cool bosses... it hits all the marks for a good old fashioned shooter/platformer.\n\nSo, set it to smooth scrolling, turn on some classic video game tunes of your choice and zip through the four episodes in an hour or two.

The Challenge of Muri comes from its unforgiving combat and sheer number of enemies. I don't particularly care for that aspect of the game so I played on an easier difficulty and just enjoyed the nostalgic gameplay. \n\nWhere Muri wins majorly is its secrets, it has TONS of hidden areas and secret items throughout the levels which  allow you access to special weapons at the boss fights. If you enjoy finding secrets and racking up a  high score this  is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1453698594, "timestamp_updated": 1453698594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531413", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20719476": {"recommendationid": "20719476", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997715950", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499586361}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game. reminded me of playing Commander King!\nWell worth the purchase and I enjoyed every aspect of my playtime from the UI to the music and sound to the rythem that comes when this style is faithfully recreated.", "timestamp_created": 1453620887, "timestamp_updated": 1453620887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20656425": {"recommendationid": "20656425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043456075", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453360533}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc800\ub294 \uc5b4\uc9f8\uc11c \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc774\uc81c\uc57c \uc811\ud558\uac8c \ub41c \uac83\uc77c\uae4c\uc694?\n\uc800\ub294 \uc774\uc81c \uc81c \uc778\uc0dd \uc808\ubc18\uc744 \ub418\ucc3e\uc558\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc5ec\ud55c\uc774 \uc5c6\ub124\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1453363616, "timestamp_updated": 1453395753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531365", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20550672": {"recommendationid": "20550672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198244784088", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450784007}, "language": "schinese", "review": "MURI,\u4ece\u753b\u9762\u5c31\u80fd\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u4e0d\u96be\u3002\u63a8\u8350\u5165\u624b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1452905403, "timestamp_updated": 1452905403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20482044": {"recommendationid": "20482044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043346855", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 343, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506916478}, "language": "english", "review": "A perfect synthesis of old DOS platformering and graphics with modern level design.

The sound also simulates what early games sounded on the built-in PC speaker (there was no sound card in the early days).\n\nThe levels are also very well designed and have some secrets, although they are not too difficult to find if you spend some time exploring all areas. The secrets usually have some hints indicating there is a hidden passage or there is some puzzle-ish element (such as destroying some blocks). That way, they never feel \"cheap\" nor frustrating. In fact, they are quite straightforward.\n\nJoystick is supported, but I had trouble configuring the D-pad in-game. Instead, I just used Xpadder (or Joy2Key) to emulate keypresses.\n\nThe gameplay itself has a brilliant touch: you can either play in 16fps, which really simulates the movement of early PC games such as \"Duke Nukum\" (the first Duke Nukem game). Alternatively, you can also play the game with smooth movement in 32fps, which feels more responsive and more modern.

Instead of NES, though, this one tributes the DOS-side, citing  Duke Nukum as the biggest influence.\n\nWhile the game does very little to innovate, it's a very accessible game, especially for people unfamiliar with the difficulty of older games. If you are looking for that challenge, however, there are modes to make that happen!\n\nIt's a very [i]by the book[/i] game, in my opinion, but I think it's well done.\n\n\n[b][u]Presentation[/u][/b] \nI'm not sure if it's worth this, but the game [b]looks[/b] like it's from the 80s, as intended! Low-res, limited color-scheme, 16fps -- it's all there! (Although there's a 32fps version, which feels much better to play)\nWhat you see in the screenshots is what you get. It seems very faithful to the era it's celebrating.\nIt also features color-coded enemies, each color representing a difficulty-tier.\nEverything is well delineated, and there's never any confusion between what's an enemy, background and foreground.\n\nThe [b]sound-effects[/b] follow the same route. If you like playing your own music while playing game, those can certainly be very annoying, but you should know what you're getting into. \nThere's one big issue, though, in the fact that there's no [b]music[/b]! I'm not familiar with the DOS era, so I'm not sure if it was common practice for games not to have music. In NES games, though, music was one of its strong points! And it's very unfortunate that MURI does not have any. There's a very short and looping track in the menu, but on its own, it does nothing to standout.\n\nYou could always listen to a podcast or something while playing it, though, without hurting the experience.\n\n[b][u]Struture[/u][/b]\nThere are 4 [b]episodes[/b] in MURI. Each episode is self-contained, and has 5 stages, one of which is a boss fight. \nThere are [b]no saves[/b], as expected. However, every difficulty mode and episode is unlocked from the start. Your only worry is to play one episode at once.\nYou can probably be done with the episodes in 20 minutes, even less if you don't bother with exploration.\n\nThere are 4 (acceptable) difficulties available - Easy, Normal, Hard and MURI. I can't say for sure if the enemies actually change between these modes, but what I can say, is that they change the Health and Lives Pick-ups in the levels, depending on the chosen difficulty. Each of them has a Score Multiplier associated with it.\n\nI've played it on [b]Normal[/b], and then gave it a spin on [b]MURI[/b], just to see how it was. Normal mode should cause major problems to anyone. If you take the time to explore, you'll have more than enough lives and health pick-ups to carry you through. I didn't get any game-over in this mode. Hard will most likely be the most suitable for any more or less experienced player.\nMURI, on the other hand, is more of a real challenge! There are not health pick ups nor lives anywhere. You'll have 3 lives for each episode, and that's it. This was certainly not the kind of experience I was looking for when I started playing MURI, but it's good to know it's there! (I have yet to play Volgarr the Viking)\nYour health is restored between each stage, in all modes, which is very handy! It's also a small reward on the harder modes, to be able to take damage in moderation without it being an issue.\n\n\nOn every stage there are tons of secrets, in the form of fake and destroyable walls, hidden platforms, etc. for you to uncover, getting score pick-ups and lives as well as ammunition for the more powerful weapons. Your score is increased by picking things up and killing enemies -- a very welcome aspect is how the game tells you when you reach 100% Score for that specific stage! I think it's very fair. It doesn't tell you too much, but you can be sure to leave the stage without leaving anything behind, if you so want.\n\nThere are also hidden Cells. These will unlock the more powerful weapons for the Boss stage, but are also more challenging to get.\n\nIf you lose all of your lives, you'll get a game over screen, and \"back to the menu with you\"! Again, it should not be a problem in Normal Mode, at least.\n\n\n[b][u]Mechanics & Level Design[/u][/b]\nI've covered part of this on the previous section. No worries, there's still a bit to talk about.\n\nI've mentioned several weapons. These include your basic, infinite, slow shot. Then, there's Rapid Shot, MKV (Scatter gun), Laser gun, Explosive-shot gun, and a Crazy Barrage of Large Bouncy Shots gun. You'll be able to get ammo hidden through the stages. You always keep what you collect when you finish a stage -- except, of course, between episodes -- so exploration is highly encouraged.\nYour active weapon is [i]always[/i] the most powerful one for which you have ammo. I dislike this quite a lot. I don't see a reason for not allowing the player to switch between weapons, but I couldn't find one. This leads to you wasting very valuable ammo on the weakest enemies, and then having an hard time with the tougher ones -- note that this only made a difference in MURI mode, but still.\n\n\n[b][i]How the level-design encourages exploration[/i][/b] \nFirst off, the game constantly teases you by showing you pick-ups inside the walls. You know you [i]can[/i] get there; all that's left is figuring out how!\nThe game doesn't try to hide many things. It's mostly very fair in that regard, as it gives you glimpses of possible secrets and fake walls every time.\nAnother way that I highly respect is that they [b]never[/b] close a door behind you -- figuratively speaking.\nThere are no pits from which you can't get back, doors that close or anything of the sort. If you've left something behind, as long as you don't leave the stage, you can always go back to find it. This also goes hand in hand with the fact that they tell you when you reach 100% score. If they didn't tell you when you're near the exit, you've missed something -- Feel free to go back and explore some more!\n\n[b][i]Enemy Variety and Difficulty[/i][/b]\nThere are lots of different enemies, each with their movement pattern, health, directional shots, etc. For its low length and amount of episodes, Muri compensates with the very varied enemies and levels in general. It'll never feel repetitive during the first playthrough! And if you're actively looking for this kind of game, I'm sure you can play through it at least twice without it feeling boring at all.\nFor each type of enemy, there are also different tiers, identified by their color. Green are the easiest, then Blue, Red and Grey, with these being the harder.\n\nThe enemies are well placed, and the game is never unfair. You can always see shots coming before getting hit. Enemies outside the screen still shoot at you and take damage, so you'll have to be careful.\n\nOne of the aspects characteristic of these old games is how methodical they are to play, and MURI is no different. If you rush, you'll probably get hit often, and end up losing a bunch of lives. If you play it slow, and be aware of the enemies' patterns, though, you'll be able to succeed with conviction. \nIf you've played NES or DOS games, you'll know whether this is for you.\n\n\nThe Boss Fights were also pretty fun, with multiple phases, as is classic. They also change depending on the difficulty you're playing on, which is always good to see!\n\n[b][i]No saves[/i][/b]\nI've seen some people unhappy with the lack of lives. I'd generally agree, especially in the easier difficulties, as it's very frustrating to lose a whole level of progress. \nHowever, I don't think you have anything to worry about, in this game. MURI mode is there for the more hardcore players. If you're not one of them, exploration will reward you with plenty of lives. It's old-school design, but made more accessible. I do not think it poses an issue.\n\n\nThis one comes from [b]Ludosity[/b], who are yet to disappoint me.

It's an excellently executed game from the creator of games like Garden Gnome Carnage and Iji.\n\nPros:\n+ Authentically emulates the sights and sounds of DOS-era platformers.\n\n+ Simple, but slick controls. I always felt like I had my character flawlessly jumping and shooting enemies. Shooting while moonwalking is a welcome addition.\n\n+ Great level design. Each level feels distinct, has multiple pathways and is filled with clever secrets. \n\n+ Tons upon tons of secrets for each level. MURI encourages exploration and completion for each level, showing when you have achieved 100% for each one. The secrets are well-hidden but gives enough of a hint to uncover them.\n\n+ Fantastic pacing. MURI always knows when and where to throw enemies at you while giving you just the right amount of firepower and health to do so.\n\n+ An interesting attempt at a complex story that juxtaposes well with the era it tries to emulate.\n\n+ A female protagonist who's also a mother. You can never have enough good female leads.\n\n+ Great boss battles. Each one tests the limits of your skills and make excellent climaxes.\n\n+ Great value for about 2 to 3 dollars.\n\nMixed:\n\n/ Inability to switch between weapons removes some choice, but it also keeps you from hoarding them, forcing you to adapt to any new weapon you get.\n\n/ MURI makes an admirable attempt at a story that juxtaposes well with the DOS aesthetic, but unfortunately it ends up as difficult to follow.\n\n/ The game takes about 2 to 3 hours to finish, but those 2 to 3 hours are so fun that you won't regret enjoying it. \n\nCons:\n- Lack of 60 FPS. The max you can have is 32, but this doesn't detract from the gameplay at all.\n- Somewhat short. It can be finished in about a few hours, but those few hours are very well-spent.\n- Deserves a level editor.\n\nVerdict: If you loved DOS games like Duke Nukem, Halloween Harry or Commander Keen, or you just love action platformers, MURI is right up your alley.", "timestamp_created": 1420145898, "timestamp_updated": 1420145898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13751141": {"recommendationid": "13751141", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996550048", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 94, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420259900}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but sweet shooter-platformer.

However, this game is almost painfully easy, rarely a challenge in it at all.  Nothing to overcome.  Lots of invisible exploration passages, some over-powered weapons, the final chapter even lets you have an unlimited version of the most powerful weapon if you spent some time in the previous levels exploring.  The story is... insane.  Not well thought through.  I'm giving it a 'no', because the game just felt too hollow.  Here, after one and a quarter hours, I have completed the whole thing.  The story wasn't engaging, the gameplay was light, there just isn't enough meat on this bone to make me able to recommend it.\n\nHOWEVER, if you're alright with a platformer on the easy side, with a half-baked story, and just want to kill a few hours, this game is perfect for it.  If they make a sequel, I probably will look into it.  I just hope there's more to it than this one.\n\nEdit: There is also no way to rebind the keyboard controls.  That's inexcusable for a PC game anymore, even one attempting to be a throwback like this.  On top of that, there is a problem where the game does not exit properly.", "timestamp_created": 1419723311, "timestamp_updated": 1419723866, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0,

It's short, simple, and to the point. 2D platforming and shooting. This game replicates old DOS games. I never really played anything on DOS when I was younger, but I've played NES games and retroactively played a few select DOS titles. So as long as you're into retro style games, you'll probably enjoy this.\n\nThis game controls pretty well. You only have a few functions, but it's pretty easy and smooth... and I even played on the choppy authentic settings. You jump, duck, and shoot your way through the levels collecting items for points. The game is even nice enough to tell you once you've got all the items in an area, so you'll know for sure if you found all the secret spots or not. Also, it's worh mentioning that your jump is actually responsive to how long you hold the jump button and the rate of ascent and descent is the same. It might not sound like much, but it makes the game very easy to control compared to some stiffer titles of the past. Also, you can get a small variet of cool weapons, each one stronger than the last. There are four episodes and five levels per episode, making the game 20 levels long. It took me about two hours to beat the whole thing 100% the first time I played. \n\nThe retro style is done very well in this game. Where some games blend different retro references for nostalgia, MURI really sticks to a fully classic experience. Gameplay, music, sounds, visuals... the works. It's all done in a way that makes you believe it really could be an old DOS game. I love it. The classic feel AND mentality are in tact. \n\nAs much as I enjoyed the game, there are a few issues, as with every game. One of them is that... well... it's short. The content that's there is good so I can't complain too much, but a lot of people will be offput by the brevity. The next two things I'm lumping together and you'll see why. No saving and no switching weapons. Both of these things would be very easy to put in. The thing is... they are a choice. Obviouly a game that came out in 2013 COULD have a button for saving and a button to change weapons, but it doesn't. These choices were made to give meaning to the extra lives and weapons you find. Sure, saving after every level would be convenient, but it would defeat the purpose of getting extra lives by reloading every level if you mess up. Plus, the episodes are pretty short, only took me roughly 30 minutes each and it was my first time playing... got 100% score on them all... you'll have plenty of time to beat an episode and each episode starts you with nothing anyway so it's the same as having a save between episodes really. Switching weapons would make you stock up on ammo to beat tough bosses and enemies rather than conserve your ammo and take careful shots with the guns you acquire. These choices are not only for a retro feel, but they also make sense for the game's difficulty. They're design choices... so I can't be too upset about them.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty fun little game akin to the first two Duke Nukem games. If you like retro style games of the 2D platformer shooter genre, check it out. Is it worth the $6 asking price? $4 isn't too bad. It could be a little cheaper, and you can always wait for a sale, but if you're up for trying out the difficulties and replaying it a few times after you've bought it rather than making it just a one time deal, then it's a fair price.

As I have no prior experance with DoS shooters (my childhood was spent with Wing Commander, and Lemmings) I also have no nostalgia for the genre but after only a few minutes of playing MURI I found that it was one of the most enjoyable gaming experances I have ever spent less then a dollar on (Thank you steam sales). Although I'm sure having played games like Commander Keen and Duke Nukem 1 would add the nostalgia factor to a title like this it is very enjoyable with no prior experiance with such games.

Played a lot of Commander Keen, Biomenace, Duke Nukem (the first two) and all sorts of other twodimensional platformers? Or at least you're hip and nerdy enough to honestly appreciate those kind of games?\n\n\nWell, here's your chance to relive that particular place in time and space with a new adventure! Play MURI for ten seconds and you'll be thrown back immediately (actually you don't even need those ten seconds - just look at the intro screen and listen to the theme music), and ever now and then you get surprised by some more modern contraptions.  \n\nThe controls are fine and work perfectly. Don't be put off by the lack of save game or map options, the levels aren't that big and the game isn't that long. You'll manage. The only thing I thing that should have been included is the option for the player to choose their own weapon type instead of automatic assignment. Not exactly sure why the devs choose to do otherwise, but oh well. \n\nThe level design is fun and does the one thing right that so many games do wrong nowadays: you can fully backtrack every part of the level at your own pace and leisure to get all those hidden secrets and goodies. \n\nThe enemies are the most interesting part of this short little hommage to the oldschool platforming era. They're quite original in design and behaviour and they fit the weird SciFi storyline perfectly imho.

Does it succed in capturing those feelings? Yes it does! The HUD looks just like it was ripped from a DOS-Jump'n'Run. The sound is just like in the DOS-era.

Yes.\n\nMURI is a delightfully DOS-era inspired action platformer. The games play much like the original Duke Nukems.

I recommend a minimum of Hard difficulty to any reasonably seasoned player, though Normal is fine if you're just clearing your backlog...you may not loose any of you live.\n\nMURI gets the old school feel perfectl right down the the graphical style, sound effects, lack of in game music (only the menu....and maybe cutscenes have music, and if you so desire, you can play the game in a reduced frame rate much like the games of the time.\n\nYou start with an unlimted ammo single shot blaster, and you can gradually get better weapons with limited ammo like rapid fire, spread shot (MRV), laser, or heat-seeking flares. Occasionally, you can pick up infinite versions of weapons which last the rest of the episode, or at least the level. The goal of the game is to get to the end of the level and you can attempt to get all the point pick-ups and secrets if you desire (and you can actually turn around and get them if you missed them! Take that modern game design!). Each episode ends with a boss.\n\nAt the end of the day, MURI doesn't necessarily do anything remarkable - tons of old games have done something like this and games have advanced well beyond the DOS era.

Even though I don't think that'll be an issue for this game, I feel compelled to point that out anyways. Besides, it's worked fine so far.\n\nGameplay: If you've never played a DOS-style shooter before, think something like the original Contra but with more maze-y levels. If you have played a DOS-style shooter, this is pretty much par for the course. The stages are labyrinthean with plenty of secrets; some of which are pretty easy to spot while others require you to dig deeper into the level for something like a switch that activates something at the beginning of the level. I got an average of 95% of the points for each of the levels, with the exception of the boss levels, but that's just because of how the game scores points. There's four episodes which consist of five levels a piece; four stages and a boss stage. Hidden somewhere in the first four stages of each episode are items called cells which allow you to get some extra powerups before the boss of that stage. They're not essential, but they certainly do help.\n\nBosses in this game are actually really good; certainly a lot better than some of the bosses you'd see in the Commander Keen series. I only played through the game on Normal, but even on that difficulty they were a bit of a handful. The final boss was just plain excellent and a great way to end the game. As for the weapons, you have your standard pea shooter, a rapid shot, a five-way spread, a laser that splits and bounces off of walls, a homing explosive shot, and Chaos which just does things and kills enemies sometimes. \n\nApart from that, that's pretty much your lot for this game. It took me just over an hour and a half to beat the game on normal with a fair bit of exploration of the stages, but that's a pretty good length for a DOS-style game. It definitely has replay value, especially with higher difficulties and 100% playthroughs, so if you're into that kind of thing, this game will certainly be worth the $4. It's simple and compact, and there really isn't a thing Id change about it. 10/10.\n\nStory: Unlike a lot of DOS-shooters, this game actually has a pretty good story. It's a bit hard to follow, but it's a fairly high-level Sci-FI storyline about the creation of life. Surprisingly interesting and a not half bad delivery of what could be perceived as a dramatic ending. 8/10.\n\nGraphics: Fortunately, the game doesn't launch in CGA resolution; that would be annoying. Rather, it fullscreened to my native resolution of 1080p without a hassle, so that's all good. As for the art direction, it's quite good, even if the MURI suits look a bit like Robo-Bunnies. Apart from that, the world designs are good, the enemy designs can be absolutely fantastic, with the boss of Stage 3 being the big standout. I can't quite speak for whether or not it rigidly conforms to the EGA palette or not, but it looks DOS-y and it looks good. 5/5.\n\nSound: This is something that I don't think I've done in the year or so since I started reviewing games (three months since I started publishing Steam reviews): I'm not gonna rate sound. I really can't, since the game itself goes for yet another factor of the DOS design in that there is no music - save for the title track - and all of the sounds are blips. So yeah, it feels a bit weird to do that, but that's what's happening.\n\nOverall scores are: 10/8/5/0; 9.2/10. A very solid little shooter that's well worth the money.

Non vi \u00e8 dubbio, infatti, che vi siano correnti che tirano pi\u00f9 di altre e che negli anni recenti hanno influenzato numerose nuove uscite dal feel vintage: in Europa ci sono stati tributi soprattutto al Commodore 64, negli Stati Uniti c\u2019\u00e8 stato pi\u00f9 amore verso il NES, un po\u2019 ovunque si \u00e8 pensato al Super Nintendo in caso di RPG. Il PC ha sempre avuto una vita meno facile, perch\u00e9 i suoi vecchi giochi sentono pi\u00f9 di altri il peso degli anni, perch\u00e9 non c\u2019\u00e8 stata mai una potenza commerciale a sostenerne la missione videoludica, ma via via sono stati riconosciuti grossi meriti a DOS e Windows. Gli arcade, per\u00f2, sono stati spesso territorio di brutte figure: per certe cose il PC non era tagliato, basti pensare ad alcune terrificanti conversioni di coin-op, ma quando gente con sale in zucca ha provato ad esibirsi in questo stesso campo si sono viste cose apprezzabili, come i Duke Nukem bidimensionali o i Commander Keen.\n\nMURI della Remar Games per Ludosity parte proprio da questi esempi e non solo per la struttura da action game, ma addirittura per caratteristiche tecniche al netto di qualche paradosso. I giochi citati giravano alla grande su processori 286 e 386, 16 MHz probabilmente erano anche troppi mentre MURI necessita pur sempre di un Pentium 4, ma almeno il download ricorda veramente i vecchi tempi: soli 3 megabyte, una misura verosimile per quei giochi serviti su floppy disk. \n\nI PCisti dell\u2019epoca noteranno al boot del gioco subito una cosa riguardante la grafica: \u00e8 in EGA! L\u2019EGA era l\u2019acronimo di Enhanced Graphic Adapter ed era una delle ragioni dei punzecchiamenti degli amighisti al tempo: la risoluzione video dei giochi era sempre 320x200 pixel, e questo non era un problema, a differenza della palette che mostrava 16 colori da un totale di 64, che non erano tutti selezionabili ma disponibili solo a luminosit\u00e0 diversa. Alla fine, ci si trovava sempre con combinazioni acide, magari utili per lavoro ma orribili per i videogiochi, con dei magenta e verde chiaro che si fissavano in maniera indelebile nelle retine degli utenti. E poi c\u2019era lo scrolling, memorabile per la sua scattosit\u00e0. Tutto questo \u00e8 presente in MURI, nel bene e nel male.\n\nIl menu iniziale ci presenta una schermata di presentazione con poche scelte, ma \u00e8 significativa l\u2019opzione per modificare la fluidit\u00e0 del gioco: disattivandola, lo schermo si muover\u00e0 a scatti proprio come accadeva sui PC di fine anni Ottanta, con un effetto che oggi richiede diversi minuti per abituarsi; attivandola, invece, l\u2019impatto sar\u00e0 meno traumatico pur non ottenendo, volutamente, uno scorrimento perfetto.\n\nCome da tradizione del tempo, all\u2019inizio della partita \u00e8 possibile scegliere l\u2019episodio da affrontare. Chi ricorda Wolfenstein 3D o Doom capir\u00e0, \u00e8 un retaggio del mercato shareware, dove veniva distribuita gratuitamente una parte di gioco abbastanza consistente, molto pi\u00f9 di una demo di oggi, e spesso si trattava appunto di un intero episodio del gioco, mentre gli altri erano disponibili solo per chi comprava il gioco. Ovviamente internet non c\u2019era e le cose funzionavano un po\u2019 diversamente, ma \u00e8 un\u2019altra storia.\nOgni episodio \u00e8 diviso in cinque livelli, al termine dei quali non manca neppure un boss da abbattere. MURI inquadra la protagonista omonima lateralmente, proprio come vuole la tradizione dei platform, ed i vari stage presentano un\u2019estensione discreta che si sviluppa in senso verticale ed orizzontale. Al giocatore non vengono mosse richieste particolari: bisogna semplicemente arrivare all\u2019uscita sani e salvi. Lo scenario, per\u00f2, \u00e8 ricolmo di oggetti utili per lo score ed alla fine del livello potremo scoprire la nostra percentuale di raccolta.

Finally, the controls don't feel nearly as solid as good ol' Duke: jumping is very weird and takes some getting used to, since you have to hold the key to reach maximum height.

From this, we've gotten countless NES\u2014er, \"8-bit\" style games, whether they were created to honestly bring back the feel of an \"8-bit\" game or just to have an \"excuse\" to give for horrible artwork. Yet, very few designers have ever done the same with other consoles\u2014or old computers. Daniel Remar (the creator of Iji) adds to this niche with MURI, a side-scrolling platformer which takes after the first Duke Nukem from the DOS shareware era of 1991 but adds and fine-tunes many features to make it its own game. Everything here feels authentic, from the PC speaker sounds to the choppy scrolling (which can be changed to be smooth from the Options menu if you feel like it) to the EGA palette (nothing in the game uses any more than the EGA card's standard 16 colors).\n\nBut it's a fun game, too, with movement that feels more fluid than you'd think it'd be and a difficulty balance that feels about right. The levels are of the exploratory kind instead of a linear sort, and it feels great when you find the way to an item that seems just out of reach. It's a rather short game, though, with five levels for each of the four episodes (a touch of the shareware era), even if they get longer as you progress.\n\nOverall, it's a successful return to early 90s DOS and good way to spend ~2 hours of free time.

Specifically, it looks and plays a lot like the original Duke Nukem from 1991, but it has a lot of cool features of its own.If you haven't played the original Duke, you're given about 16 decently sized levels you're free to wander around and explore in, grabbing stuff for points, getting better firepower, and looking around for secrets. \n\nThe game's pretty short, but each episode comes with a boss fight that gets tougher and more interesting the harder the difficulty you play it on.

Nothing in the game uses 16 colors, and even the sound effects come right out of the PC speaker. For some people, it might be a little tough to look at, but for somebody who grew up with DOS, it's a lot of extra effort that I feel makes the game really special.

The main difference with Duke Nukem is the addition of weapons, but other than that, the engine is almost identical (it could almost be a sequel to Duke Nukem, although that already exists). If you take Duke Nukem, mix in some Metroid style, and lowered your character's gravity so you can jump really high, that's this game.\n\nThe design is excellent: the weapons are varied, and you can't select them freely so you never feel like relying on any one weapon. On Normal mode, I felt that just as my health was getting low, a health pack would appear, so the levels have been designed well there. I also like the secret rooms to find, and a challenge to get 100% on the level. The addition of cells that open doors to power-ups on the boss level is a nice touch: you can ignore them, but the final battle will be harder, so it keeps you searching.\n\nThere are only a couple of negatives I can think of: there is no save function, which is odd for a game like this, but since each episode is done in around 20 minutes, it doesn't really bother me much. Second, I know the graphics and sound are supposed to be like an EGA game with PC speaker, but the music is just a rather dull theme song, then nothing. And the final negative? Not enough levels!

It's a fun platformer, but it's so short. I like how a game wouldn't want to over stay it's welcome or anything, but it can be beaten in under an hour. The game feels like Duke Nukem 1 (A 2D platformer) with less flaws. The problem is, is that it sticks too close to the same type of gameplay the whole game. You are never really surprised the whole game. It always plays it safe and never really deviates from the base structure. The game has some level design, but it's all a bit generic. If you are a fan of 90's PC games like Duke Nukem 1 or even Commander Keen and Duke Nukem 2, you should buy this. The games biggest flaw is that it feels too much like a 90's game, you could tell someone it's \"The lost Apogee game\" and they would believe it, there isn't much replay value (aside from tougher difficulties), and there isn't much variety. There aren't many modern features, I mean, there isn't any coop or anything. The graphics are alright, it looks like I could be running an old DOS game, and is pretty nice by those standards.\nWell, overall, I may of sounded a bit disparaging on this, and I may of spent a lot of text talking about MURI's flaws, but it is a fun game which I really enjoyed while it lasted. I'm sure I'll buy the next game the dev makes, the dev has some talent. MURI is not the perfect game, but if you are a platformer fan who has three bucks to spare... Why not give it a shot?

This game on the other hand looks and plays like a old dos era EGA platformer, most notably Duke Nukem 1 so much so I half expected to see the Apogee logo and a shareware registration page which sadly it doesn't have but it does have a quit to DOS option(no seriously, but sadly no Simulated DOS prompt pops up when exiting) and it even uses old PC speaker style sound and music(title screen), so when I say looks and feels like I do mean it, the scrolling is a bit chunky since back in the day smooth scrolling effects were done on the PC through moving 8x8 blocks to simulated smooth movement like arcade and NES games had. \n\nOnly downside it's a bit short since each episode is only 5 levels long and they could tweak the controlls a bit since if your shooting and then push back you don't turn but rather just move back unlike other games from the era it's emulating where you will always face the direction you press shooting or not. Prehapes this is intentional but it's still feels weird at least to me also there are no saves but since each episoded(4 in total) are only 5 levels long it's not a big deal. \n\nSo if you have fond memories of old shareware EGA side-scrollers from the 90's like Duke Nukem, Commander Keen, Bio Menece, Dangerous Dave and the haunted mansion and others then by all means give this a go. \n", "timestamp_created": 1386530380, "timestamp_updated": 1386530380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7972508": {"recommendationid": "7972508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083443383", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466517982}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought MURI on a complete whim, going into the game not expecting much. Man, was I wrong. Remar has created something special here and I was nothing to short of being blown away. MURI is a side scrolling run and gun in the guise of an MS DOS aesthetic (seriously, as soon as I saw that DOS style HUD, I knew I was in for a treat) with plenty of things to shoot, plenty of power ups, plenty of levels, a ton of secrets and a phenomenal storyline. MURI is divided into four chapters and does a brilliant job of combining Sci-Fi elements into it's own unique telling, it's simply not enough to explain it here, I alone can do this game no justice. MURI is a special game, that does everything right, the MS DOS feel and aesthetic is beyond perfect, the story is original, the sound effects and what little music there is, is spot on. The game starts off easy, but it really does start getting brutal as it goes on... And theres a hard mode option, if you're feeling brave enough.\n\nMURI gets zero complaints from me, it's an outstanding game that caught me completely off guard, and it's an experience I would happily share with anyone who is interested.

Because I played the DOS games I am quite used to the choppy scrolling, thus I haven't tried the smooth mode yet. Maybe I'll try it for the second playthrough.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is quite easy on Normal, though on later stages I died several times, in most cases out of carelessness. I imagine the harder difficulty levels are proper challenges. Finding all bonus items in a level provides some motivation to explore the entire level before moving on and later on there are some cleverly placed secrets. The first few stages felt a bit short, but they get more expansive in the later episodes. None of the ones I've played so far have reached the complexity of many Duke Nukem levels, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nSummary\nIf you liked Duke Nukem and similar DOS platformer, chances are high you'll love this game as well.

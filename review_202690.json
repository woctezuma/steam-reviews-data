No me perdono considerarme un buen jugador de wargames, de estrat\u00e9gicos, y no ten\u00eda ni repajolera idea de que exist\u00eda este diamante -en bruto-, y realmente me averguenza en mi \"categor\u00eda\" de player de wargames. Lo siento, estar\u00e9 m\u00e1s pendiente...\n\nY me lanc\u00e9 casualmente sobre este Hegemony dando de lado al m\u00e1s reciente III. Nada en particular, y seguramente sea un enorme juego, quiz\u00e1s hasta mejor, pero es la tem\u00e1tica de la H\u00e9lade, la que andaba buscando, hu\u00e9rfano de ese periodo. Lo que no era \"mitol\u00f3gico\" era raro. Hegemony Gold es simplemente lo que andaba buscando. Aqu\u00ed tengo en serio, lo que el Total War Alexander me ofrec\u00eda infantilmente en forma de mod. Es Grecia, griegos, y sus l\u00edos. \n\nEl juego me parece soberano, de darte a mucho pensar, de exigirte tomarlo en serio. Es un wargame en tiempo real, con connotaciones econ\u00f3micas, religiosas, raciales. Todo compactado en un formato delicioso de mapa estrat\u00e9gico, mapa de fichas, y unidades correteando por bosques y llanuras, murallas y templos, con la simple acci\u00f3n de la rueda del rat\u00f3n, que te pasa de tu visi\u00f3n Zeus, a la de un triste peltasta humano y temporal. \n\nEntras al juego y te ofrece una extra\u00f1a sensaci\u00f3n. Ves la interfaz de carga y dices... Aficionados. Entras al men\u00fa y dices, Aficionados. Empiezas a jugar y dices.... Bravo!!! Se nota que el estudio no debe ser Ubisoft, pero tambi\u00e9n notas conocimiento, amor por la historia, amor por los juegos, amor por el trabajo. Y eso es muy importante. El juego adem\u00e1s de las \"campa\u00f1as\", ofrece un sensacional y complicado \"Sandbox\", que a su vez lo veo como la se\u00f1al distintiva de este juego a otros. Aqu\u00ed te montas t\u00fa pel\u00edcula de la Grecia cl\u00e1sica, sin que se te desmorone el rigor con ello... \n\nCon sencillez de colocar ficha aqu\u00ed y all\u00ed, sin m\u00e1s, tienes, rutas comerciales, bloqueos, saqueos, pillaje, emboscadas, batallas campales, econom\u00eda, util uso de la teogon\u00eda griega, en definitiva \"sandbox\" inagotable de amplio universo. Deciros que empec\u00e9 partida con Mesenia. En la realidad viles subyugados a la belicosa Sparta que lucharon por su libertad mientras eran pisoteados por el \"estado militar\". Pues bien, la partida es realmente \u00e9pica. Ah\u00ed me dedico a sobrevivir a los intentos de subyugaci\u00f3n espartana con las armas propias de un esclavo. No sab\u00e9is el placer que me causa llegada la \"temporada del ganado\", lanzar mis jabalineros r\u00e1pidos y robarle a la temible lacedemonia sus carnes apreciadas. Un verdadero placer contemplar a la hopliteria de Sparta salir en lentitud a tratar de evitar el robo de sus reses, mientras yo los sorteo como un arcaico Curro Jim\u00e9nez. \n\nEvidentemente Sparta es un estado fuerte y belicoso, y me manda campa\u00f1as anuales de castigo, incendiando mis campos de cebada, y es cuando se produce mi m\u00e1xima aspiraci\u00f3n; combatir a campo abierto m\u00e1s por honor que por sensatez... \u00bfOs parece poco? Probar con Atenas, y dir\u00e9is... Por Poseid\u00f3n, que superioridad de medios hegem\u00f3nicos, soy intratable... j\u00e1. El juego est\u00e1 muy bien equilibrado para que debas usar la l\u00f3gica y no te lances a modo \"command conquer\". Ser Atenas puede parecer.... pero no es. \n\nCon todo, tenga cuidado con esta bien llevada simpleza y acierto. El juego est\u00e1 bien dise\u00f1ado para manejar mucho de forma f\u00e1cil, pero debes tener el inter\u00e9s y la paciencia de querer aprenderlo. Si eres un jugador estrat\u00e9gico casual, mantente en Total War Rome o Alexander. Son muy divertidos. Esto es divertido si te gusta la estrategia, dar la pausa, pensar, y decidir golpear como puedas, y no como quisieras. Si eres de aprender, te gusta la historia, la estrategia y eres paciente, te llevar\u00e1s la misma sorpresa que yo. \n\nUn Saludo!!", "timestamp_created": 1499121455, "timestamp_updated": 1499121455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32779851": {"recommendationid": "32779851", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035902812", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513176884}, "language": "english", "review": "A game that has few peers, the closest that most people interested in this genre of gaming could compare it to would be a Total War game - you manage armies and resources to take cities and project your power.\n\nTo stop at this point is a disservice to how unique Hegemony is as a game. A major component this game tries to focus on is the complexity of waging war beyond simply marching a larger army to where your enemy is and beating them around the head a few times. You need to think about your supplies, the seasons, the number of recruits you have waiting to be called up, and the time it will take to defeat the enemy. You'll be frustrated as a planned lightning assault gets bogged down by a stubborn city resisting you, and then gobsmacked when a relief force arrives and you realise you need to pull back or lose your army because you ran out of food.\n\nAt this point there are many players who would be turned off by the complexity of this. \"Why is the game punishing me for such small mistakes?\". For me the most satisfying moment was learning from those mistakes and realising that the AI is as much at the mercy of these factors as I was. Starve out that impregnable mountain fortress, or build your own fortress on the route the relief force has to take to bide you the time you need. Along with the immense care taken by the developers in making the map the challenges you face each time are unique and interesting.\n\nWith that said I want to recommend this first game against the latter two; Hegemony Rome and Hegemony III. The former is a transition between the two, and the latter is a great game in it's own right that however doesn't capture the immense care and individuality of this first game.\n\nIt is well worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1498409844, "timestamp_updated": 1498409844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32513977": {"recommendationid": "32513977", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992434335", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500316727}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent strategy game!

Yes, its food really, explained through farms and/or sheep each supplying a certian amount of food to the nearby city(s). You can really get the feel for seasonal raiding between two city-states each simply trying to carry off food or harm the production of the other. A lack of quick/residual manpower in each city also vastly depicts the relative low loss of life in battles of the period, as you'll find yourself or your opponent often afraid to make too costly an attack, which means garrisons do largely help deter invaders in the game.

(Bitte von der Spielzeit in Steam nicht t\u00e4uschen lassen, diese wird nur gez\u00e4hlt wenn man nach Spielstart raustabt und den Launcher neu \u00f6ffnet und Ihn so stehen l\u00e4sst...) Ich habe das Spiel schon mehrere 100 Stunden ohne steam gespielt.\n\nWichtig ist in diesem Fall die Gold Version zu kaufen, da dadurch diplomatische Optionen in das Spiel eingef\u00fcgt werden, die die politischen Veh\u00e4ltnisse dieses Abschnitts der griechischen Antike noch besser abbilden. Ebenso erh\u00e4lt man zwei weitere Scenarios und einen Sandboxmodus, in dem man jede! wirklich jede! Nation spielen kann.\n\nDiese Epoche der griechischen Antike, die Zeit zwischen dem Hegemonieverlust Spartas bei Leuktra 379 v. Chr. und der Hegemonie Makedoniens bei Charoneia 338 v. Chr. ist eine der abwechslungsreichsten und spannensten, was Milit\u00e4rtechnik, Diplomatische Wechselspiele und Hegemoniestreben der Polis angeht. Dieses Spiel spiegelt dies sehr gut wieder.\n\nMein Lieblingsstart ist aber der Standardstart mit Philipp.\nIn einer dynamischen Kampagne kann man den Aufstieg Philipps II. von Makedonien begleiten, gespickt mit einer Vielzahl an Sequenzen und Orten, die man langsam einnimmt bzw. entdeckt. Dabei steht einem die Vorgehensweise komplett offen. Zu Beginn muss man sich von der Hauptstadt Agai aus behaupten und kann (muss nicht!) den Missionszielen folgen. Dabei schlie\u00dfen sich einem historische Anf\u00fchrer an oder stellen sich dem Spieler entgegen. Besonders reizvoll ist die M\u00f6glichkeit Frieden zu vereinbaren, um benachbarte Staatenb\u00fcnde oder St\u00e4mme daran zu hindern in Makedonien einzufallen.\nIhr wollt Makedonien erst nach Persien ausbreiten und vielleicht sp\u00e4ter erst nach Illyrien gehen? Kein Problem.\n\nMit der Leertaste pausiert man das Spiel. Dies entpuppt sich schnell als bester Freund, da die Map dynamisch weiterl\u00e4uft. Alles findet in Echtzeit statt, so das man schonmal  besch\u00e4ftigt ist, wenn das eigene Gebiet von 3 Seiten angegriffen wird... Aber das ist zu verkraften, wenn man sich \u00fcberlegt ausbreitet und B\u00fcndnisse schlie\u00dft an Fronten, wo man keine Truppen haben will bzw, mehr leisten kann. Dieser Aspekt gef\u00e4llt mir auch sehr gut. Die Wirtschaft (Goldeinkommen / Asugaben) werden durch St\u00e4dte und Minen geleistet. Nahrung f\u00fcr die Armee bekommt man durch H\u00f6fe. Schafherden sind eine mobile Nahrungsquelle f\u00fcr die Armee. Zuviele Truppen sind nicht m\u00f6glich wenn das Goldeinkommen fehlt.\n\nDie stufenlos zoombare, riesige Karte und die Atmosph\u00e4re machen dieses Spiel zu einem Leckerbissen f\u00fcr Antike bzw. historisch gut umgesetzte Spiele Fans!\n\nPro:\n\n-Atmosph\u00e4re\n-starkes Szenario\n-gro\u00dfe Karte\n-freie Vorgehensweise\n-abwechslungsreiche Einheiten\n-ein sehr verzweigtes Versorgungsnetz im sp\u00e4teren Spiel\n-Pausenfunktion mit Leertaste\n-stufenlos zoombar\n-stimmungsvolle Musik\n-tolle Videosequenzen und Missionen bzw.

It's pretty similar to Total War in a lot of ways, except that everything happens on the world map. All the action is in real time, but the player can pause the game and issue orders at will. This becomes very important as your empire expands, because the map is very large and past a certain point you'll likely be fighting multiple battles at any given time. Overall, it's a much slower-paced and deliberate kind of game than AoE or Starcraft that depends more on careful planning than actions-per-minute, but still much faster than turn-based strategy. It's also a rather low-stakes game, since no particular battle field defeat is likely to be fatal to your empire, and you can pretty much always recover with some time and effort. Outright losing a campaign would essentially require intentional self-sabotage.\n\nIn terms of production values, the game clearly shows its creators' lack of resources. The unit models lack fidelity, the map is somewhat plain (aesthetically, that is, in mechanical terms there are a wide variety of environments), the sound effects are functional but get repetitive quickly, and the less said about the (thankfully rare) voice acting, the better. Still, none of these issues impact the gameplay itself.\n\nLike Total War, units are created as groups rather than as individual guys, and fight in formation. There are only a few broad unit categories, and most of the factions (especially in Greece proper) are pretty much the same, but most factions have at least one unique unit, and some of these really do alter strategies quite a bit. Basic tactics revolve around a battle line of heavy infantry, and an unskilled player could probably get through the game eventually just by swamping the enemy under as many hoplites as possible, but a mixed army with ranged support, light infantry for flanking, and cavalry for fighting the enemy light units will perform much better if used properly. Units have a morale stat, and the goal of most battles is to break the enemy's will rather than fight to the death. Broken units drop their weapons and attempt to flee at top speed to the nearest friendly city, at which point they return to their home town and join the reassembling unit there. If they are captured, they can either be executed or enslaved, without moral judgement. Units recruited from the player's native faction gain experience with each victory, which the player can invest in a few different stats (speed, morale, rate of food consumption, and siege skill).\n\nThere is also naval combat, though the trireme (with Athenian and Persian variants) is the only ship available. it's a little bit finicky, to be honest, since how much damage you do is determined largely by the angle and speed at which the ships collide and they maneuver like, well, ships. It's usually just about who brought a larger fleet, or being lucky. Fortunately it isn't very important unless you're conducting amphibious invasions or raiding naval trade routes.\n\nA lot of the strategy in the game revolves around supply lines. Trade routes are constructed by the player, but in most cases it's pretty clear where they're supposed to go and it's mainly just a matter of connecting the dots. These routes produce a bit of gold, but their main purpose is transfering food. All land combat units consume food, and if they run out their morale will quickly drop to zero. Since demoralized units are pretty much useless, keeping an eye on your food supplies and ensuring that the far-reaches of your empire don't starve is in many ways more important to victory than the actual fighting. Harrassing an enemy's trade routes and pillaging their farms to starve a city's defenders can be a very effective strategy that the AI practices routinely. Since food production varies by season throughout the in-game year, the timing of a campaign can be very important. Do you want to move during harvest time so your armies can forage off the land while they slowly overcome the well-fed defenders, or in the middle of winter to more easily starve the enemy but at the risk of your units collapsing from hunger? There's no one \"correct\" strategy, but your tactics will have to reflect the specific conditions you're marching into.\n\nThere's no base building in Hegemony, which ordinarily I would be disappointed by, but here it works for me. All structures have fixed, pre-placed positions on the map to reflect the actual geography of Ancient Greece. In addition to cities, there are forts, mines, watchtowers, farms, and shrines. The first three can be deconstructed, and are often found ruined, but the site can always be rebuilt. Forts and watchtowers are pretty self-explanatory, mines can be filled with either paid workers or slaves to provide gold, which acts as a population limit, and different types of shrines (heroic, logistics, and healing) provide different benefits to the units of the faction that controls them.\n\nThere are three campaigns in the game and a sandbox mode. The campaigns are a bit more structured than Total War since the player is given specific objectives throughout, and the rewards for completing them are often substantial, but there aren't any time limits and once you complete the tutorial section of the beginner's campaign the map is completely open. I spent about 60 hours conquering the entire map in my first playthrough of the Macedonian campaign, even though I had technically finished all the objectives much earlier than that. As a history student, I personally really appreciate the Civilopedia-style background information on pretty much everything in the game, and the developers make it clear that they've done their homework.\n\nThere are a number of different factions in the game, and a diplomacy system, but it's very simplistic. Other factions have a fixed hostility level to yours, based on the historical relations between them, and a variable intimidation statistic that depends on your relative strength and how close they are. These factors affect the frequency of attacks, and how much it costs the player to establish a truce or an alliance. The most important effects of the faction system are on the main gameplay. A faction's hostility determines the size of the garrison required to supress the inevitable rebellions, while allies fall under the player's control immediately and don't require a garrsion at all. Allied units are also slightly superior to the mercenaries recruited from most conquered cities, though they still have weaker morale than the player's native units, and don't gain experience. As I mentioned earlier, each faction also has unique units which can only be produced from their native cities. I often choose my targets specifically to gain access to a particular unit I like.\n\nIn conclusion, Hegemony is an extremely innovative game which makes up for low production values with simple but deep mechanics.

Its a simple concept (raise troops, pay them, feed them, attack your neighbors) but finding the right balence makes it much more complex than you might think. Definitely a different spin than any of the other strategy games you might also be playing, EUIV, Total War, CKII. \n\n[*]Supply Lines/Logistics- Your cities each have a predetermined number of trade routes based on the economic power of that city. Some have 2, some have 16. These can connect to farms (which produce food, with varying amounts for each season), mines (which produce gold when worked by workers or slaves captured in battle), and they connect to other cities. Food moves along these routes with different capacities based on how long it is. Some routes that are very close (like a city to the farm next to it) can carry up to 100 a week and longer routes usually start at a base level of 15 per week, but can be upgraded by paying gold. Your units replentish their losses only if they are on one of these supply lines. \n\n[*]Finances- You don't have a treasury like in other games, only an income. Your finances are viewed as a weekly income/cost. Mines produce up to 80 gold a week whereas upgraded roads can cost up to 90 as well as your troops having a weekly upkeep. So at any point your spending overtakes your income, units don't get paid and their moral starts to drop. The same will happen with food, but you don't have a kingdom production/expenditure because food can only get to your troops and cities if you have sufficient supply lines.\n\n[*]Battles- Your troops fight in real time on the campaign map like Paradox games but you can deploy and position them like in Total War with bonuses if your cavalry charges a unit or if you flank an enemy. A unit's moral drops a little for each soldier that dies and it will rout if the moral drops to 0. Cities act in a similar way but with a number assigned to its seige strength. When you are sieging a city, its constatly dropping, with larger hits if you use catapaults, and when it gets to 0, it becomes yours. If a city or fort has a garrison, it will shoot back at you. When a unit routes, it will regroup at its home city and replentish its losses. This will always happen, unit don't get destroyed, even if every troop dies.\n\n[*]Cities- When you retake a city that is part of your culture or basiaclly within your historical territory, it becomes part of your empire. You can recruit native units, the same you can recruit at your capital, and they can change their home city to any with the same culture. If you have every unit with its home set as your capital, they will only replentish its number from that city so it's best to try to spead them out. For example, if your capital is in the middle of your empire and your troops take losses on the edge, manpower will be taken from its home and move along supply lines to that unit. Cities recouperate manpower slowly and when it's at 0, your troops won't fill their ranks unless you change their home city and they recruit from there.\n\n[*]Culture- When you expand and take a neighboring city that is not native, they will remain hostile to your occupation. This manifests as needing a garrison to prevent it from rebelling and joining its original nation. You can station your own troops from native cities, hire allied troops if that city is friendly/allied to you, or hire mercinaries from that city at an increased cost. They will have a specific culture and can have their home city assigned to any city with a shared culture.\n\n[*]Final thoughts- There are still other aspects, generals, naval combat, objectives/rewards, population and migrants, stockpiling food, etc. but the tutorial covers these aspects. The tutorial is only educational for the first hour or so, like I said, simple concept. The difficulty comes with taking these basic rules and balencing the food and gold across your empire, your troops to attack enemies and your garrisons to counter raids and supress uprisings. The introductory capmaign starts you as Phillip of Macedon as it guides your expansion. After a bit though, you have learned the game enough that you don't need a tutorial and just need some practice. I easily sunk 40 hours into that capmaign just taking my time, finding the most efficient way to set up supply lines and cheapest ways to maintain garrison without depleating my manpower reserves.\n\nThat being said, I highly reccomend this game. The intro campaign lasts long enough to justify the price and it has plenty of replayability because you can go a different direction because the map is enormous. There are also other campaigns with the Peloponnesian War being very complex as well as a sandbox mode- play as any faction with no rules or time limits.", "timestamp_created": 1468127970, "timestamp_updated": 1468127995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23233068": {"recommendationid": "23233068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306259559", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515006437}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the logistics and deep strategy this game offers, you can tell the developers put a lot of effort into this hidden gem.

Und die ganze Geschichte um K\u00f6nig Philipp von Macedonien (dem Vater vom Alexander dem Gro\u00dfen) ist echt mit Liebe zum Detail gemacht. \n\nFans der Antike sollten unbedingt zugreifen. Den Schwierigkeitsgrad erstmal lieber auf Casual einstellen, oft pausieren und regelm\u00e4ssig speichern. Das Teil ist was f\u00fcr richtige Strategen.\n\nP.S.Bin bei Steam auch als Kurator unterwegs und freue mich \u00fcber jeden Follower: \n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/2370797-7IDGaming.de/?appid=275290", "timestamp_created": 1462738396, "timestamp_updated": 1473422375, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22566892": {"recommendationid": "22566892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063892568", "num_games_owned": 415, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503819012}, "language": "english", "review": "Hegemony Gold: Wars of Ancient Greece is a very intelligent game, both immediate and deep. I would define it as an \"operational grand strategy game\". \n\nThe emphasis is obviously on logistics: the real trick to success is keeping your troops well supplied and in good shape, and that can be hard, especially during sieges and winters. Sieges in particular are rather well represented in a fun way, as you'll need to block enemy supply routes, both on land and on sea, while keeping your own open. \n\nStrategical maneuvering is also very important, and delaying the movement of an army might mean the collapse of your empire. Your state is almost like a house of cards: lose a key region for your supply network and your income, and you'll find yourself in big trouble. The AI itself is very skilled at exploiting those weaknesses in your grand strategy, and you'll find yourself often at war on multiple fronts. Unlike many strategy games, as you grow there won't be any kind of avalanche effect: you will have more resources and more troops but your borders will also be longer, and you'll find out that you can't deploy that many troops in a specific campaign anyway: small and mid-sized kingdom still pose a very tangible threat even when  you're the biggest empire on the map.\n\nThe tactical part is simplistic: it's an RTS at that, but the mechanics are a bit lacking. Also, proper tactical maneuvering is still very important but most of the time you'll find that there isn't a lot of room for maneuvering.\n\nOther than that, this game has a huge plus: the immersion value. It recreates the era pretty well, and to this day I've never seen a more detailed recreation of Ancient Greece in a videogame, with many historical kingdoms and city-states making their appearance in Hegemony and so many missions you have to complete to establish your dominion over Greece. You'll never get bored as you'll always have things to do, and the historical grand campaign lasts many, many hours.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend the game. It's a very original and innovative title, and if you like historical immersion and strategy go for it: you won't be disappointed.\n", "timestamp_created": 1461330363, "timestamp_updated": 1461330363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501103", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21323884": {"recommendationid": "21323884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012214018", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457200022}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic !

I dont like that the recruiting is 1.9 or .5 a wk depending on settler size of city, now it maybe historically correct but discounting the national unity and the drive at which philp gave to drive out any invading army is also abismal at best.

I mean you get the locations of mines, but not the products of the mine or the actual costs for the materials. That would make the game more interesting instead of capping mines at 40 slaves to make 80 coins a turn and there is no budget really other than income vs expense so no way to really do anything beyond yearly reports.\n\nI know I am probably being alot more critical of the games than most people but honestly I have done research, quite alot recently, and found that most games dont really want to go into how economies or military actions, etc actually affect the population nor how it affects international diplomacy.

The game truly captures the feeling of ancient warfare by altering accepted gameplay; For example, building town walls makes occupied cities more likely to rebell and thus requires larger garrissons (why shouldn't they feel more secure and independant behind walls?). They have also shifted the scope of the warfare, from the genre's standard province by province conquest, we now have a methodical, strategic border creep, city by city. \n\nThis game gave me some amazing moments. The most recent from when I first started the Spartan campaign. I felt resonably confident and thus cranked up the difficulty all the way. It started off well, I controlled a single island-city on the Ionian coast, which is perfect for figuring out your surroundings. Yet, I had sufficent numbers of spartan recruits and a large subsidy from home to be comfident. Then I made my biggest mistake, by building more ships and an extra brigade. I was dangerously overstretched and thoughtlessly attacked the closest city on the Athenian-held coast with my hoplites. Unexpectedly, the city was reinforced, my spartans lost and I deep in desperation. I felt just like the Athenians after Sicily.\n\nMy army was rebuilding, yet my manpower was used up by either replacing ships killed when I was't looking or still under construction from my earlier expansion. So, I used my single remaining ship to transport a starting spearman brigade to the south (spearmen are this game\u00b4s equivalent of WW2 France). There lay a tiny island city basicly undefended and even my spearman brigade could capture it. It had neither farms nor mines. It didn't matter, I only wanted it's manpower. I thus used it as a naval base, freeing up my spartans for infantry. That is beacause captured cities can only produce mercenaries, which means expensive, second-rate troops. They can still produce ships at the same price and quality - wood is wood and ships are ships.\n\n My main base was still short on manpower and for the remainder of the year, I had to cower behind my walls as the Athenians burnt my fields. I knew I would take my revenge upon them, yet all I could do was send my spearmen to do the same to them. I knew I would later take that city, fisting my hands.

Steam folder on your computer directly.  It works then.\n\nThis is a great game that is simple in it's concept but difficult to master.  It is \"smaller\" in scope than the Total War games but has one thing they don't.  When fighting a tactical battle in Hegemony you are actually picking the terrain you will be on.  Unlike Total War where you are picking one of several pre-made tactical layouts.

Die Regionen sind viel kleiner und detaillierter als in TW. Die griechischen Stadtstaaten und Anrainerv\u00f6lker wie Perser oder Illyrer bieten massig Abwechslung, speziell der Spielmodus \"Sandbox\" ist zu empfehlen, mit einem kleinen Stadtstaat ist die Schwierigkeit brutal. Denn man mu\u00df stets die Logistik und begrenzten Goldreserven im Auge haben. Zwingt auf Dauer zum Nachdenken, aber ist auch nicht so, dass man sich nur damit befassen mu\u00df. Es bleibt also genug Zeit f\u00fcr die Eroberung.\n\nEinfach mal einen starken Nachbarn anzugreifen ist auch nicht einfach m\u00f6glich, man mu\u00df bei Hegemony die Feldz\u00fcge gut planen, auch mit Blick auf die Jahreszeiten (Essen bunkern, Schafsherden etc.)\n\nDie KI ist zwar berechenbar, aber knallhart. Man steht grunds\u00e4tzlich mit allen im Krieg.\n\nBesonderheiten sind au\u00dfer der Logistik noch das Spielen in Echtzeit, die Schlachten finden auf der Kampagnenkarte statt. Die Leertaste erm\u00f6glicht aber jederzeit Verschnaufpausen, oft wird es hektisch und man steht fast immer unter Strom, durch regelm\u00e4ssige \u00dcberf\u00e4lle von Au\u00dfen (von Land und von See).\n\nMinuspunkte f\u00fcr die primitive Diplomatie und die Tatsache, dass die KI sich nicht untereinander bekriegt, die Grenzen der anderen bleiben also immer statisch.\n\nFazit:\nWer TW mag wird sehr wahrscheinlich auch Hegemony sehr m\u00f6gen. Mal was anderes durch die Echtzeit, es hat nicht die Tiefe von Rome TW2, aber ist unterm Strich nicht schlechter. Ist schnell runtergeladen.

You are Phillip conquering the city states of Greece to create your Hegemony. It is certainly a game that shows the trouble of directly maintaining a large empire. In the beginning, you only control a few cities which means it is easy to micromanage your troops. The map is very large, consisting of hundreds of cities, that you most likely need to capture to win. \n\n The big issue in this game is logistics. Troops need food, cities need supply lines with other cities and farms for food. You need supply lines to mines to secure income. There is no way to conquer the map with just one army. Troops need to resupply and replenish. Philip starts out surrounded by enemies around him. Expanding too fast in one direction will leave you overstretched. \n\nSome cities are very bothersome to invade. No farmland to sustain your armies means you need to either bring workers or sheep to resupply food. When you get there, they seem to have an army far too large for their food to accomodate, and you better hope that you win otherwise you have to assemble the troops again and march all the way across the map to try again. \n\nYou also need to watch that cities don't starve. If you conquered a city and they have no food, they will start to rebel. Ignore it too long, and you have to march troops to reconquer the city. Repeat that a couple dozen times and include a couple Greek powerhouses like Thebes and Athens that will constantly raid your cities. \n\nAnd then there is the whole land of Persia which seems to take up half the map. I haven't reached there yet, so I can't see how hard it will be. It will be a huge pain to muster troops from halfway across Greece to invade though.\n\nBuy this game if you like real time strategy games that start simple and become logistical nightmares as you progress.", "timestamp_created": 1387510013, "timestamp_updated": 1387510013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8049040": {"recommendationid": "8049040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062456518", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507477935}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is soooo much better than what i had expected.

Combina tactica y estrategia en tiempo real y sin cargas. Tiene 3 pausas automaticas por alertas: escasez de alimentos, enemigos cercanos y combates. sistema de de red de suministros muy completa hasta el extremo de tener que planificar las campa\u00f1as teniendo en cuenta tama\u00f1o de ejercito, estacion y lugar (pueden forrajear y acampar). Las unidades al combatir acumulan experiencia que puedes distribuir en 4 campos: asedios, autonomia de suministros, iniciativa (aguantan mas tiempo corriendo y/o cargando, asi como aumentan el campo de vision) y moral. Asi por ejemplo puedes especializar tropas para las escaramuzas o para la primera linea de combate y que aguanten mas castigo. Tiene un monton de misiones no lineales, muchas interrelacionadas entre si. Ademas muchas misiones tienen varios objetivos. las estaciones del a\u00f1o son muy importante para el inicio de campa\u00f1a. No se pueden llevar ejercitos masivos sin planificar la ubicacion. He tenido batallas donde los ejercitos se han ido posicionando y y ha habido escaramuzas previas a la batalla principal. Se le puede cortar la retirada a los ejercitos enemigos que huyen. La IA entra en tu territorio con unidades moviles a quemar cosechas y derribat tus torres de vigilancia con el fin de cegarte y poder moverse a traves de tu s dominios y que no le veas el grueso de las tropas. Los esclavos pueden y deben recoger comida para acompa\u00f1ar a los ejercitos a las campa\u00f1as. Aqui no funciona el \"todos a la vez \"  a la hora de atacar ya que existe el \"overcrowded\" que consiste en una penalizacion por acumulacion en el mismo sitio de soldados. Se puede defender con pocos guerreros un enclave, por ejemplo un paso al estilo de la peli 300. He llegado a aguantar con una falange y dos unidades de javalineros a mas de 4 falanges enemigas aprovechando el terreno y el overcrowd del enemigo. Es el unico juego donde he apreciado el hostigamiento a los ejercitos asi como las escaramuzas. El paso del mapa estrategico al terreno es continuo y sin carga.

In it you must expand your starting kingdom through war and diplomacy. There is also historical campains which start in certain senarios, however I have not played these and therefore will not comment on them.\n\nPros:\n- In this game you have to plan your campains wisely, each season will directly impact food production, which is central to gameplay. The impact of feeding your troops (logistics) really deepens the campain over other strategy games such as total war.\n- The camera can be scrolled in and out to see the larger picture or into great detail. It reminds me of the supreme commander camera.\n- Aestheticly this game has an interesting \"board gamey\" style, with units lookng like peices on the board. I enjoy this art style as it is unique from other games.\n- The map is huge, and gives players vast areas to conquer.\n- There are small histroy notes scattered throughout the map which help immerse you (and are interesting to history buffs like me).\n- The music is simple but also helps immersion into the ancient greek world.\n\nCons:\n- The diplomacy in this game is very shallow, and boils down to paying your enemies enough so they will stop invading you so you can focus on eating another nation.\n- You will constantly be raided by Athens throughout the entire game, as Athens has naval island bases scattered throughout the greek world. This is not really a con as it gives a difficulty boost to the game, but it can be annoying.\n- The unit diversity is not very high. All the greeks have the same hopilites, barbarians have the same medium cav, thrace has the same peltasts. However, some of the greek factions have hopilites which are stronger in combat, some are stronger at seiges. Thracian petalst are vastly different to greek peltast. Persians have elite heavy cav. You will find the unit diversity to be simple, yet effective.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a very enjoying strategy game which is great for strategy gamers and history gamers. Given that this was developed by a small team, it is remarkable how polished, complete, and high quality it is. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1340951443, "timestamp_updated": 1439001836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2880693": {"recommendationid": "2880693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014003652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1339138800}, "language": "english", "review": "Hegemony: Philip of Macedon was a brilliant but flawed game.

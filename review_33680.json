The game has a checkpoint system and an infinite amount of lives so there's no pentalty for starting over, but it takes a ton of time to memorize the level design and master the timing to pull a lot of the jumps off.

Fortunately, checkpoints exist and are decently spread out so that you won't have to repeat too much, and the main game is still easy enough to not have too many issues with it.\n\nAll in all, while I'm not sure five dollars is the best price point, I'd say the game is absolutely worth a look, and if it's on sale, you should definitely pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1498538442, "timestamp_updated": 1498538442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32727928": {"recommendationid": "32727928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034466785", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498312824}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but interesting puzzle game, not bad for $2-5 and a few hours.

It clearly aspired to parallel the puzzle platformer prowess set by [b]Braid[/b], even to the point of dropping references to it (see the Achievement named \"Metaphor for the atomic bomb\"). It does however, fall a little short. Granted, Braid is an ambitious benchmark, being - at least for me personally - the greatest puzzle platformer of all time.\n\nEversion's core mechanic was not immediately obvious, and the emphasis on learning simultaneously with game progression is a design choice I have an affinity for.

This became frustrating to no end; I've played numerous precision platformers in my time, and yet, due to Eversion's hitboxes, I found myself dying repeatedly on seemingly straightforward sections.

Or at least second oldest. This game is actually the reason I decided to finally get a steam account, after playing the original a year before. Me and a few friends were talking about this game recently, and I wanted to revisit my review as a lot has changed over 6 years.\n\nEversion is a sidescroller platformer/puzzle/horror game in which you are a little flower named Zee Tee and your goal is to make it to the end of the game to save the princess.\n\nWoah, did you just spoil the fact that it was a horror game? Yes. But don't worry, the trailer does it for me. And every other joke review. And the title screen that says \"Not for children or those with a nervous disposition\". But I do think that this game could be important to a few people who are considering playing it, so I will say a short review before I spoil any more:\n\n[h1]Before Spoiler TL;DR[/h1]: Eversion is a game with frustrating platforming, too-tight/perfection needed jump physics, and \"where the hell do I go\" puzzle elements. The gimmick of the game doesn't save it. However, if you are interested in the concept, you can check out the free version. The HD version has better music and graphics though, along with more endings.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI first played eversion when I was browsing vgcats and Scott posted a blog post saying \"I don't want to say anything more, just play this game\". I think the fact that I was browsing vgcats shows how old I was/my mindset at the time. Anyways, I played it and was absolutely blown away. I loved it, and it was my first foray into horror games as I previously had been too chicken to bother getting into them before then (also I was like, 12).\n\nNow I look back on it with fond memories, but absolutely dislike almost everything about it. I feel like Eversion was [i]extremely[/i] formative in my taste in horror, rather what I [b]don't[/b] like in horror at all now-a-days. I feel like it's really easy to say that it's \"edgy\" or \"tryhard\" in it's horror- and while that may be partially true, I feel like those are both subjective terms. Like what is tryhard to you? What does edgy mean to you? So to put it in more objective terms, Eversion has no subtlety at all. It beats you over the head with it's horror like a brick. Every psychological horror game trope is in this game, and it's presented straight-faced rather than a homage or a tribute. You've got the distorted music, jump scare hands flying up from the bottom of the screen, messages saying \"BEHIND YOU\" and \"I SEE YOU\", fountains of blood pouring out of enemies as you stomp on them, the list goes on. Hell, to put a cherry on top the game automatically closes after you beat it. While these were all new to me when I was 12 and first experiencing horror games, now it just comes off as tired. It's not even like these were innovations in 2008, you can play many games like Eternal Darkness, Silent Hill, Yume Nikki, and F.E.A.R. years before and get some extremely similar elements in those games.\n\nBut ok, I can't with good conscience write a game off completely just because I don't like it's atmosphere. But the horror gimmick of Eversion isn't even the problem with Eversion at all, it's the gameplay. The platforming is too tight, as in there is no leeway for the player at all and the physics are stacked against you. If you try and jump from a block directly below you to one directly above you, you don't slide up the side of the one above you if you're a bit off like in mario. The enemy killboxes are extremely punishing if you are trying to make a huge fast leap on their heads to pass through a section. The hell hands that come up from the ground later in the game come up too slow sometimes, so even if you know where they are you can still get hit by them if you're trying to pass under. Even the graphics get in your way sometimes, like when you jump on an enemy and blood flies out everywhere (which are just giant red spheres) which temporarily can block your vision of where you're landing. This is all accented by horrible level design, which requires you to do all of the above I just mentioned. It actually requires you to do it constantly by the 4th or so level. It wouldn't be so bad if these aspects of the platforming were more forgiving towards the player, but tough luck, they aren't. Also, don't even get me started on the autoscroller advancing wall of death sections. It gets even worse when sperm hands start flying at you.\n\nThe puzzle element isn't much better. Initially you can mash the evert button to see where the eversion points are, but after a certain point you have to find them yourself. This results in the frustration of looking all over the map for the one eversion point that will allow you to collect all the gems or beat the level. But this gets easier once you realize that the eversion points are only placed in the most annoying, inconvenient spots possible. This is where the frustrating level design comes in. But on top of that, to get all the gems (required to play the last level and get the true ending) you constantly have to backtrack back and forth through the level multiple times. It's just not fun.\n\nThe reason I brought up the horror gimmick is because I feel like if done better this could have been the game's saving grace. The game is well enough made from a graphical and programming perspective, it's the actual game design where it all falls apart immensely. If the game was more tounge in cheek with it's theme and knowing that it's just a silly cute horror game, or more subtle and drawn out with it's scares leading to a more oppressive atmosphere, I could excuse the bad platforming and still call it a good experience regardless. \n\nAll in all, Eversion is kind of like a really bad haunted house that's down your street. It's not scary, is trying REALLY hard to be, and it kind of sucks, but you can't really get mad at it because it tried real hard and put a lot of effort in. I love the graphics of Eversion, and I love the soundtrack when it's not trying to be scary by tempo shifting a previous song or replacing it with just a heartbeat.\n\nEversion starts with the line \"not intended for children or those of a nervous disposition\", but that's exactly who I recommend it for. I'm not even saying this as a quick last jab at the game for not being scary, I'm being dead serious. It's a horror game that, if you haven't experienced many horror tropes yet, is a good introduction to them. It's also not that scary if you're new to the horror genre. It's a good first step into what otherwise is a rather inaccessible type of game/movie without getting your pants scared off.", "timestamp_created": 1487617510, "timestamp_updated": 1487617614, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29965937": {"recommendationid": "29965937", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 1166, "num_reviews": 421, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486970675}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Eversion\" is defined as the process of turning something inside-out. I'm going to attempt to spoil as little as possible here but I'll say up front that it's a terribly appropriate name, and figuring out why for yourself is one of the little pleasures to be found here. Working out the mechanics and the strangely twisting road to the end is a big part of the appeal, so I'll say this: If you're a fan of things that start pleasant and turn sinister, stop reading here and get eversion for yourself. I very much doubt you'll be disappointed.\n\nThere's a princess and she's kidnapped and your little flower dude gotta save her from button-mushroom-looking guys, as if you couldn't tell the Mario pastiche from looking at it. Mister flower here can move and jump, enough to stomp enemies and bump boxes for gems. He can also evert, which changes things in ways I'm not going to expand upon. The challenge appears straight-forward at first but everting means every level has a lot more layers to it than it appears. Add on top of that a few hundred gems to collect if you're up to it and a few well-hidden secrets, and you've got a tight little game to challenge your reasoning and reflexes.\n\nIt shouldn't take you more than an hour to beat the game, but the gems let you access an additional level and a different ending. Scoring them all will take some puzzling and that last level builds on what you've done up to that point in a really clever way. There's not much point in me continuing to be vague so trust me when I say eversion is a smart gimmick done right. It's small in scope, challenging in the right ways, and looks the part with its simple, colorful graphics. The secrets and surprises in store for you are well worth taking a chance on this one.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

But, like all those others, it is a game that deserves to be played.", "timestamp_created": 1484715246, "timestamp_updated": 1484715246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29071711": {"recommendationid": "29071711", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059440865", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483760607}, "language": "english", "review": "ayyyyyy lmao", "timestamp_created": 1483740657, "timestamp_updated": 1483740657, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498339", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29070191": {"recommendationid": "29070191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026805278", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483735376}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's get this out of the way right now: I'm not that great at platformers, but I'm very patient. If I do something enough, I'll eventually get it. With that being said, that is exactly how this game went for me. I had to be very patient, because I died A LOT. \n\nI've owned this game for quite a long time, but just got around to finishing it today and getting 100% acheivements on it. The reason I put it off so long? Couldn't quite get one of the jumps in the 4th world, and subsequently lost interest. This game is very specific, and punishes even the smallest errors once you've made it to world two or three. I would advise against playing this game if you're frustrated easily, or if you think it'll be a walk in the park. That being said, I'm sure there's a lot of people out there better at this kind of thing than me. \n\nWhen you get down to it, the game itself is both interesting and boring in different ways. There's no greater message to this game, no huge meaning to it. There's just a basic story to follow that becomes more and more \"horrifying\" the more you play and read into it. I say that in quotes because I don't find it scary at all. It is at its core, kind of unnerving at best, but never crosses further than that. The different endings you get, as well as the progresssion of the worlds and the achievements in a few cases really do add to the atmosphere of the game, which I can appreciate. Its greatest strength lies in keeping the player interested and invested in going to find out what happens at the end of it, despite the trials it takes to get there. I think in that regard, it had me hooked from beginning to end.\n\nEversion is a very weird game. It's simple, but refined. It follows a pattern, but punishes even the smallest mistakes. It's a fun platformer, but it doesn't push the envelope much, despite coming out over six years ago. Would I recommend it? Sure. But only to people with a lot of determination.

Obviously, people who buy this game aren't buying it because they want their fix of fun platforming (which is below average in this game). The real reason people are interested in Eversion is because of the \"turn,\" where the player expects (and wants) the game to creep them out. This is the main basis on which I am judging this game, the \"turn,\" and it simply isn't enough.\n\nSeeing how the gameplay remains the same, all that's left to contribute to the \"turn\" is the art and music, which I found boring, generic, and lazily done before AND after the \"turn.\" You can see art before the \"turn\" from the store page and obviously, it looks like any other amateur's first go at a cutesy platforming game. Of course, this is to be expected, as it's supposed to juxtapose with the art and music after the \"turn.\" However, even after the \"turn,\" nothing is creepy (which is what I want), and it still remains boring. I mean, come on, look at this: [url=http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXQ5Y.png] url=http://i.stack.imgur.com/ZXQ5Y.png [/url]. This is literally one of the last levels of the game, which should be the creepiest, but LOOK AT IT. Does this make you feel creeped out at all? \n\nThis is why I can't recommend this game at $5, A) [b] because I feel like very little effort was put into creating a creepy atmosphere [/b], and, only cause I feel like being honest B) I bought this during the steam summer sale, where incredible games were being sold for less than $5.

You try to save the princess and that's pretty much it, but after the first few stages the game takes a massive detour and goes from cute to straight up terrifying.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same stuff like in SMB. You can jump on enemies and break blocks, but the game has a twist. There are Eversion points which turn the world into something more sinister. It also helps you pass through bushes which rot with each eversion. The controls however are kind of rough so it get's quite tough to finish some of the stages.\n\nThe art style is great, and really helps build tension which each eversion you enter as the game progressively get's more creepy as the levels go on. \n\nBut the soundtrack is my main gripe with the game. It ruins everything and not to mention the later levels are kinda of tough so the soundtrack get's tiresome.\n\nThe game took me 40 minutes to finish, but there are multiple endings to get so that extends the replay value.\n\nOverall I though Eversion was interesting, but not full price interesting. Even though it's cheap, I think waiting for a sale is a better choice.\n\nPros:\n+Creepy atmosphere\n+Great Art Style\n+Multiple Endings\n\nCons:\n-Terrible soundtrack\n-Rough Controls\n\nFinal Rating:\n7/10\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n", "timestamp_created": 1463314637, "timestamp_updated": 1463314637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585734", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22920612": {"recommendationid": "22920612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037429842", "num_games_owned": 2499, "num_reviews": 140, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463383309}, "language": "german", "review": "Keine Ahnung warum es hier so einen hype gibt. \nExtrem langweiliger Platformer, und es gibt auch keinen \"gruseligen twist\" von dem hier alle in den Reviews reden.. \nWow, ab und zu wird die Welt dunkler und es gibt \"gruseligere\" H\u00e4nde die nach einem greifen, but that's it. \nAbsolut nicht gut, sorry.\n\nEDIT: \nIch hab das 240/240 Ending gespielt und das Bonuslevel beendet...\nDie Hoffnung dass es wirklich etwas krasses am Ende geben w\u00fcrde ist damit auch weg. \nNice.", "timestamp_created": 1463019414, "timestamp_updated": 1463027554, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.650509", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22887477": {"recommendationid": "22887477", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035963274", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484026630}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite expensive for the content within, but it's a fun platformer with a delightfully sinister twist and a bunch of secrets.

The horror elements are very, very well done, although I might appreciate them more if I were familiar with the works of Lovecraft. The core mechanic is fun to play around with for a while - it starts to lose its appeal eventually, but by that point the game is almost over. The leaderboard feels a bit half-baked - the controls are awkward, and you can't scroll the list - but it gets the job done. It's also one of those games where you think you've just paid for a 2 hour game, but then you realise there's a whole lot more. It is for this reason that I recommend trying to get all the achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1461932923, "timestamp_updated": 1461932923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22252952": {"recommendationid": "22252952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137861752", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502901434}, "language": "english", "review": "Eversion is a special type of game, it takes a cheery platformer in the style of Mario [spoiler]and makes it more sinister the further you progress.[/spoiler]\n\nYour character, an orange flower named Zee Tee, is sent on a quest to save Princess Nehema, the Princess of the Flower Kingdom. There's a twist to his quest, which comes within his special power; to swap between realities via certain points in the world, this is referred to as \"everting\". However, the more layers you evert to, the deeper [spoiler]and more disturbing[/spoiler] the environments get. \n\nThe main source of praise from me is the game's concept, it takes something cute and cheery [spoiler]and shows its dark, evil side[/spoiler] which is something I haven't seen before (games like Dreaming Mary or Irisu Syndrome! do not count). \n\nMore praise goes to the artwork, the backgrounds look amazing and the way the environments and enemies [spoiler]change and become more deranged as you go through the layers[/spoiler] is fantastic. \n\nUnfortunately, Eversion is not without its faults. The main problem is the fact that the game is literally a high definition, priced version of the original freeware game. There's only slight changes in the levels and not much else other than to collect a bunch of letters which don't do much. \n\nWhat was excusable with the freeware game is the total opposite here, the game is too short for its rather \"high\" price (which is around 5.19 dollars not counting sales) and fact that there's nothing new when it comes to the levels which are 90% like the original freeware version ([spoiler]the secret eight level is different from the original freeware version pre-1.7.3[/spoiler]) despite the few changes.\n\nIf I were to nitpick, another problem I have with the game (adding on to its short length) is the lack of layers, [spoiler]there are only eight layers in the game, the last one being accessable in the seventh level by collecting all 240 of the gems[/spoiler] which is sort of disappointing on my end. However, this doesn't affect the game as a whole.\n\nDespite these problems, Eversion is still (at least) an enjoyable game which deserves more attention. But the game is honestly just a HD reskin of the original freeware version, I best recommend that you play that version instead. Or wait until the game goes on sale. \n\n7.5/10\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1459865707, "timestamp_updated": 1498847527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21997202": {"recommendationid": "21997202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083553516", "num_games_owned": 454, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458745949}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bdd\u6211\u7ed9\u9ad8\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u79f0\u5f97\u4e0a\u662f\u827a\u672f\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u86cb\u75bc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u90fd\u8ba9\u6211\u72b9\u8c6b\u662f\u5426\u6253\u5dee\u8bc4\u4e86\u3002\nP.S.: \u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u6570\u77ed\u7684tag\u662f\u4e00\u56de\u4e8b\u513f\uff0c\u62535\u5c0f\u65f6CS\u548c\u62845\u5c0f\u65f6\u5355\u8bcd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u611f\u53d7\u4e48\u2026\u2026\n\n===\n\n\u4ee5\u9632\u4e07\u4e00\uff0c\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u662f\u4e24\u7801\u4e8b\u513f\uff0c\u672c\u8eab\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u64cd\u4f5c\u624b\u611f\u65e0\u53ef\u6bd4\u62df\u5730\u86cb\u75bc\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bd4\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\u8981\u6076\u5fc3\u7684\u591a\u2026\u2026\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u5efa\u8baeB\u7ad9\u901a\u5173\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1458716989, "timestamp_updated": 1458729500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21974918": {"recommendationid": "21974918", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108001330", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479682258}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't look at these reviews, just purchase it.

It is not really a spoiler to say that this is not the whole story.

This is down to the juxtaposition of cute 16 bit style and the more darker images as the game progresses .It does not hold your hand in explaining anything.\n\nRegardless if you are familiar with the source material or not this is ambiguous enough for you to draw your own personal theories.

It's important to note some things before coming in. First of all, this version of Eversion is 16 bit, unlike the original 8 bit version you can download for free on the internet. This version also has some bonus content, and extra unlockables, but; I'll cover them as we go.\n\nEversion for what it is, is a very short game; it's got 7 stages, and a secret unlockable 8th stage. In order to unlock the 8th stage, you have to collect 240 jewels scattered among the stages. Why are you doing this? Because the main character needs to rescue a princess. Yeah, Eversion's not one for story; and it doesn't need it at all. But it is interesting to note; that Eversion is based off the writings of H.P. Lovecraft.\n\nThat of course means, that the game is scary.. But not \"Jumpscare in your face\" scary like so many games attempt. Eversion is scary because the entire tone of the game is dictated by the signature ability; Eversion. When you use it, the world around you changes; and that's the key gameplay element. There are 8 layers of Eversion that you cycle through as the game progresses, and each layer has it's own rules; so the majority of the game is learning how each layer affects your platforming. Aside from this feature; the game plays as a Mario style collectathon with you gathering 240 jewels.\n\nThere are 3 Unlockable endings, and after unlocking the \"True\" ending, you unlock Time Attack which allows you to race the scoreboard to see who can beat the game the fastest. The Time Attack mode also includes the original Stages 4 and 8, as the HD remake made new versions of those stages to replace the old ones. There's also hidden letters that spell out \"EVERSION\" for a hidden Achievement for those who like to 100% games.\n\nHowever, one thing I will warn players of, is Eversion gets hard later on. Now, difficulty in games is a good thing, and a game should gradually get harder; but the issue is, Eversion starts off too easy. The first 3 stages are pushovers, with the only challenging part being figuring out how to collect the jewels in them. Once you hit stage 4 however; the game pulls no punchs from here onward. The rest of the game can be a spiraling rage cycle of pure frustration.\n\n-- The Good --\n+ Eversion is a unique gameplay mechanic.\n+ The music and atmosphere are terrific.\n+ The graphics range from bright and colorful, to grim and terrifying.\n+ Based on H.P. Lovecraft\n+ Easy to 100%.\n\n-- The Bad --\n- Huge Difficulty spike midway through the game.\n- Little to no replay value once finished.\n- Extremely short.

People are likely to see the game differently. Part of why it's such a curious concept.\n\nIt isn't appropriate for children, though not so much for the darker or more disturbing elements but because children would probably find it boring or lame or miss the subtle stuff.

Because his reviews are awesome.\n\nForeword, Eversion is a quick Mario-style platformer and also a Lovecraftian game meaning the game starts out cute and bright, but as you progress through, it gets darker and darker. It also has achievements and trading card content to go with it! Eversion started out as a free online game, then implemented to Steam with HD graphics and new updated features.\n\nTHE STORY\nZee Tee, the cute protagonist of the game, looking like an orange star-shaped creature with legs, has to go out in the land and save the princess Nehema. Zee Tee is able to \"Everse\" to different layers of the world. Which get darker and scarier as he gets lower and lower in the layers. The other entities get dangerous and horrid as he gets lower. The game has three different endings based on what you do in the last few levels.\n\nTHE PRESENTATION\nThe game begins in the top layer, where everything is bright, colorful, and cute, just like the first few levels of a Mario game! There are flowers and blue skies. Once you cross to the first eversion layer, which is right below the top one (Not the one you started at), the first layer shows a lower saturation of visuals, and you can see several things have slowly deteriorated. In fact, if you get down into lower eversion layers, they deteriorate even more and the other creatures get more monstrous. Also blood. It's a rather disturbing game. That's why you should acknowledge the fine print at the start of the game: \"not intended for children or those of a nervous disposition\".\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY\nThe game has seven levels before the main ending. Each level is short and quick. Use the arrow keys to control your character, and press the Space bar to locate Eversion portals and flip through layers when at one. However in deeper layers, you won't be able to locate them, but you'll know when you're at them when the background partially changes. There are also gems in each level to collect and they are required for a secret eighth level and secret ending for 100%. The best part about the gems is they are ALL persistant meaning they remain collected when you die or quit the level. No need having to collect them again! Of course flipping through eversion layers is crucial for going through most levels and collecting gems. There is also a Time Attack mode after the secret ending and you can run through any level in the shortest about of time. It has worldwide leaderboards. I'm working on some good times now. I'm top 40 in the first level, but that's only the first level. Finally, the game has controller support, so grab your Xbox 360 controller if you have one!\n\nTHE FINAL LEVEL (SPOILERS!)\nI'll actually talk about not only the seventh level but the secret eighth level also. The seventh level is one of the few that goes through ALL the layers. You start at a deep layer where the background is red with demonic hands in the background, and no music. Collecting all the gems is tricky work as you have to go back and fourth through the level to find the eversion portals. You don't need to shift to any layer to beat the level, but when you do. You see the ending with the princess becoming a MONSTER. Game over, then the game crashes. So if you want a better ending, you must beat the secret level. At the start of the seventh level, there is a gem count. If you get ALL the gems in the game, you're able to shift to the FINAL layer where it's the DARKEST ever, with enemies regenerating over time. Beating the level with the final layer takes you to the eighth, which is the same deal, except you need to solve puzzles, locate portals, and get to the end to get the good ending. It's similar to the endless castles in SMB. You start at the lowest layer, and work your way up to the top layer to the end of the level. Then the secret ending, it was much more screwed up, as not only has the princess became a monster again, but ZEE TEE as well. WHAT A TWIST.\n\nSo that was Eversion. It's a quick game that turns cute to HORRIFYING quick. It can really unsettle you if you're not prepared. Yesterday I started playing this game, beaten the game, got all gems, got the secret ending, and got ALL achievements. It's THAT quick. However it's $5 for a game you could play for free, but you have extra features. I suggest buying it when it's on sale. Like I did! To conclude, Eversion is a fun game with a really interesting gameplay mechanic. I find it have a nice replay value with the graphics and everything. If you're not like me, it's a game to mess around with for a short time until you go tired of it, or a game you can play to waste time on. I recommend this game.

You have to go to your speaker settings to reduce the volume of the game.\n\nYou can play this in fullscreen or window mode, It's either super small window or super zoomed view.\nYou can play this game with a xbox controller. No Rumble effect.\n\n[h1]About the game[/h1]\n\nThe game is based for kids, however the game contains alot of flashing. (Switching the layer screen will cause the flash.) Layer screen is changing the gameplay, Sometimes this is required to complete the level or for obtaining gems. You play as some sort of a Flower. Let me guess you have to rescue the flower princess or a Florist?  The difficulty is based on the \"layer screen\", some of these layers makes it very easy to move on and others makes it difficult. (Some of the background is able to hurt you while others will let you to pass through them). You will launch higher on an enemy if you time your jump.\n\nThe music changes on the current \"Layer screen\".\nIt has Retro music, (music could give you a headache after awhile).\nIt has Retro graphics. \nThe game is short but has different endings.\nHidden checkpoints.\nHas Level selection with a gem counter. There are 240 gems.\nYou have unlimited Lives and there is no timer.\nGems will be saved no matter what. So even if you quit/die/restart the gems will not be lost.\nGems are not required to finish the game but they will reveal a secret level for an atlernative ending.\n\n\n[h1] Other things[/h1]\n\nThe game reminds me a little bit too much from Mario, The \"Goomba\" thingy and layout in the first level. It has a Mario Finish flag, Goomba looking enemies. and in ending aswell.. Even some achievements...\n\nThe Game Closes itself in the end After you have completed it.  TWICE (like a Crash).\n\nSometimes it is better to kill yourself after you have obtained some Gems which was required to switch some Layer Screens. Just to save your self some \"travel\" time (This is mainly useful for the gems that you had to obtain in the beginning of the level and was forced to switch layers\"\n\n\n-----------\n\nI will give this a 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1449429945, "timestamp_updated": 1490445481, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19429149": {"recommendationid": "19429149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040919135", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 177, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449192691}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting concept, has a few too many annoying pitfalls but thats normal for platform games really.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1449027329, "timestamp_updated": 1449027329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498640", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19381245": {"recommendationid": "19381245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048488627", "num_games_owned": 662, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388777655}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great platformer!

A sua miss\u00e3o aqui \u00e9 resgatar a princesa Nehema, recolhendo pedras ao longo do caminho. A semelhan\u00e7a com os jogos do Mario \u00e9 ineg\u00e1vel, inclusive por seu enredo inicial simples. Contudo, as semelhan\u00e7as em termos de enredo terminam aqui: quando menos se espera, o jogo lhe surpreende. Todos os finais do jogo s\u00e3o surpreendentes e imprevis\u00edveis. Apesar de n\u00e3o existir cute-cenes, a hist\u00f3ria progride de forma linear e satisfat\u00f3ria. Apesar do final imprevis\u00edvel, isso n\u00e3o esconde o fato que a premissa do jogo \u00e9 simples, antiga e j\u00e1 muito batida por outros jogos; sendo que desta forma, \u00e9 um dos principais pontos negativos do jogo.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nA jogatina \u00e9 divertida e prende bastante a ate\u00e7\u00e3o. Os est\u00e1gios s\u00e3o f\u00e1cies de serem terminados, mas mesmo assim, um certa intimidade com o jogo \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria. Em alguns poucos momentos, \u00e9 requerido do jogador um pouco de racioc\u00ednio l\u00f3gico, mas nada muito complicado. Entretanto, o grande diferencial de Eversion, aquilo que torna o jogo \u00fanico, \u00e9 \"Evers\u00e3o\": durante a sua jogatina existir\u00e3o pontos onde \u00e9 poss\u00edvel adentrar numa esp\u00e9cie de dimens\u00e3o alternativa e cada uma possui suas peculiaridades. Em alguns momentos \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio adentrar-se em uma dimens\u00e3o especifica para que se tenha acesso a alguma \u00e1rea de anteriormente n\u00e3o estava dispon\u00edvel.\nO jogo em si \u00e9 bastante f\u00e1cil e n\u00e3o possui power-ups. Apesar de toda facilidade, em alguns momentos em especifico, o jogo requer alguma habilidade de quem est\u00e1 jogando. O jogo em si \u00e9 muito curto, e facilmente pode-se termin\u00e1-lo em menos de 3 horas.\n\n[h1]Jogabilidade[/h1]\n\nEversion \u00e9 um t\u00edpico jogo de plataforma nos moldes antigos: existe o bot\u00e3o de pulo e outro, que serve para mudar a dimens\u00e3o (bot\u00e3o de Evers\u00e3o). A jogabilidade \u00e9 simples, precisa e r\u00e1pida, assim como deve ser. Os comandos podem ser configurados em um controlador ou em um teclado. Quem est\u00e1 acostumado com os antigos jogos de plataforma se sentir\u00e1 em casa ao jogar Eversion, onde mesmo os momentos que exigem a precis\u00e3o milim\u00e9trica s\u00e3o feitos de forma f\u00e1cil e prazerosa.\n\n[h1]Trilha Sonora[/h1]\n\nA Trilha \u00e9 ao mesmo tempo fascinante e nost\u00e1lgica. Todos os acordes s\u00e3o feitos baseados em m\u00fasicas 8-bits. A m\u00fasica durante uma dimens\u00e3o \u00e9 a mesma e pode enjoar um pouco rapidamente, devido principalmente ao padr\u00e3o 8-bits. Os efeitos sonoros s\u00e3o simples e poderiam ser melhorados, mas nada que atrapalhe a jogatina.\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos[/h1]\n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos tentam lembrar um pouco os jogos 8-bits. O jogo, primeiramente, n\u00e3o roda em WideScreen, apenas em LetterBox. Assim, se voc\u00ea possui um monitor em Wide, acostume-se as duas barra laterais pretas no decorrer do jogo. Al\u00e9m disso, apesar da melhoria not\u00e1vel nos gr\u00e1ficos, elas poderiam ser muito melhores, principalmente por que o jogo custa um pre\u00e7o razo\u00e1vel e a vers\u00e3o com gr\u00e1ficos mais simples \u00e9 gratuita!\n\n[h1]Veredito Final[/h1]\n\nEversion \u00e9 praticamente um jogo obrigat\u00f3rio para quem curte o jogo plataforma. Apesar do jogo ser bem curto, propicia uma boa divers\u00e3o durante sua jogatina. O sistema de v\u00e1rias dimens\u00f5es \u00e9 algo simples, por\u00e9m muito inovador.\n\n[b]Nota:[/b] [spoiler]7/10[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1447596839, "timestamp_updated": 1464990780, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19079444": {"recommendationid": "19079444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116250323", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 371, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451155057}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved this game, it was so great. the problem is, once you beat it, theres nothing really to do with it. i hope a sequel comes soon with the same amount of happiness and -spookiness-", "timestamp_created": 1447532781, "timestamp_updated": 1447532781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19044178": {"recommendationid": "19044178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079874681", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447382795}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was thirty minutes long.

The gimmick for this game is the ability to \u201cevert,\u201d which can only be done at certain points of a level. Everting is activated simply by clicking the key assigned to do so at an evert point. When you evert you change the world around you to an alternate reality. There are 7 different realities in use (plus an 8th hidden one), though most levels only use a small number.\n\nYou need to find eversion points to change the world so that you can progress though out the stage, as it will change small things about the world that let you progress. It\u2019s not rocket science figuring out how to use eversion to advance, as it\u2019s all pretty straight forward.\n\nWhen you begin the game the world starts out very happy and cheery, bright colours and all that. As you descend into the later stages of eversion, the world gradually shifts darker and darker.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn\u2019t really anything fancy. In the early levels you\u2019ll notice it draws influence from the original [i]Super Mario Bros.[/i] This is most notable in the first stage, as it bears a striking resemblance in how the beginning of the level looks.\n\nThe gems scattered throughout the game for you to collect don\u2019t serve any purpose, except to unlock a secret level at the end of the game. I didn\u2019t take the time to unlock the secret level, and after pulling it up on youtube to have a look at it, I don\u2019t plan to either, as it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s worth the time.\n\nSo is it worth buying? Eh, only if you want a short little platformer to kill an hour (if that). There\u2019s a free version available on the developer\u2019s (Zaratustra Productions), though the Steam version features some minor graphical and audio updates. It\u2019s normally $5, though it\u2019s really not worth that price, so I\u2019d wait for it to go on sale. I wish I could give this game a neutral rating, as it\u2019s not good enough to really recommend, nor is it bad enough to advise against purchasing.

Auf der anderen Seite kann man durch den verdorrten Baum laufen, w\u00e4hrend der normale Baum den Weg versperrt.\n\nNach 38 Minuten hab ich die Endsequenz gesehen. Und ich spiele selten Plattformspiele...\nDas Spiel ist trotzdem ziemlich schwer, gerade das [spoiler]Bonuslevel. Bei dem hab ich das Handtuch geschmissen, weil man da an einer Stelle einen Abschnitt zwei Mal machen muss. Wenn man den beim ersten Mal nicht \"richtig\" macht, muss man ihn noch zwei Mal machen...und nat\u00fcrlich die Spr\u00fcnge inklusive. Ich sa\u00df dann zudem fest und konnte nirgends sterben, musste also Escape dr\u00fccken. Und das resettet das ganze Level. Macht nicht wirklich Lust darauf, es nochmals zu probieren[/spoiler]. Viele Spr\u00fcnge m\u00fcssen genau getimet werden. \n\nDie Steuerung ist dabei etwas gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig. Die Spielfigur springt n\u00e4mlich nicht immer genau dann, wenn man es will. Und die Musik nervt...\nFair ist hingegen, dass man unendlich Leben hat. Im Level selbst gibt es auch einen Speicherpunkt.\n\nAlles in allem ist Eversion ein ziemlich durchschnittlicher Plattformer.

Finished it in one sitting, tempted to go back and get all completionist on it. It's a cute game with a very effective atmosphere. As others have said it's one of those better played than explained situations.\n\nI am recommending this game but I'm reluctant to because of some things that I feel should have been fixable.\n\n<CRITICISM>\n\nFirst criticism: As far as I could find there was no native controller support. Sure I could Joy2Key it or something and if I were to go back to 100% it I most certainly would do that but if you're going to charge money for a platformer in this day and age you should support at least the bare minimum of controllers.\n\nSecond criticism: If you AREN'T going to support controllers (or even if you do really) either make sure your mechanics are really smooth and satisfying or don't rely on cheap tricks like long jumps you have to make with a block above you while enemies loom ready to intercept you. That's just one example and in the greater scheme I'm saying either get creative with how you create challenge or tone it down a bit. This game was surprisingly unforgiving and frustrating and it really took away from the atmosphere after a while.\n\nIn a way it felt like it couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a Mario/Super Meat Boy style experience or whether it wanted to be a Braid style experience. I feel like it would have been a better game if it had chosen Puzzles and Atmosphere or Unforgiving Platformer and spent more time polishing whichever one they chose.\n\n</CRITICISM>\n\nWith all that said, the game wasn't long enough to get extremely mad at and was cheap enough that that didn't bother me. The atmosphere and scenery made up for the lackluster mechanics and overall it was a great way to spend a bit of time. I do recommend you pick this title up, especially if you catch it on a sale.

It plays and looks very much like Mario; you bounce around collecting things whilst killing monsters by landing on their heads. Get to the end of the game and rescue the princess. It\u2019s all very basic stuff \u2013 or so one would think.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is that the main character has the ability to manipulate the world around him. When that happens, certain objects in the game change. Clouds solidify, making them safe to walk on. Trees become withered, allowing you to walk through them. Monsters stop moving, plants turn hazardous, rocks turn into rock monsters, and so on and so forth. There are seven different stages of world alteration, and not only does it change the graphics and objects, but also the music soundtrack as well.\n\nAs you traverse each level (there are eight in total), you experience\u2026 well\u2026 let\u2019s just say you experience. Sorry to cut this review rather short, but saying anything else might result in unintentional spoilers.\n\nI\u2019ll round it off by saying this; Eversion is no Spelunky. It\u2019s no Shovel Knight, and it\u2019s certainly no game that will last you several weeks or months. That\u2019s Eversion\u2019s one big drawback; it doesn\u2019t last very long. I\u2019ve played it for two hours, and virtually uncovered everything the game had to offer. \n\nHaving said that, I recommend Eversion to anyone mature, who want to discover something a little out of the ordinary.\n\nScore: 73/100", "timestamp_created": 1437592180, "timestamp_updated": 1437592456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17141489": {"recommendationid": "17141489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131534074", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483850132}, "language": "english", "review": "6/6\nWould Evert again.", "timestamp_created": 1437405023, "timestamp_updated": 1437405023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17093669": {"recommendationid": "17093669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046270418", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439079329}, "language": "english", "review": "MOTHER\nBEHIND YOU\nSTOP.

Don't read too much into that.\nIt's a (mostly) solid platformer, comparable (sort of) to the first Super Mario Bros., except the jumping gets a bit awkward at times.  My level of irritation at some of the level design, though, often ended up outweighing my level of intrigue, which is unfortunate, because it doesn't propel me to find all the collectables.  So, in that respect, as a platformer, it's pretty \"meh,\" maybe on the \"no\" side of the review spectrum.  Same with sound.  It irritated me.\nIt's the rest of the game, however, that pushes me to suggest this game with a \"yes\" review.\nEvery review of this game that you've probably read that says it's scarier than it looks is (mostly) right.  It's definitely an offputting, nervous game, and, as the developer states, not for those of \"nervous disposition\" or something.  And he's right.  This game'll make you think twice about playing it at night.  But, all told, I didn't find it THAT bad.  While it did catch me off guard multiple times, I don't think it's the kind of game that's going to give you nightmares.  Unless you're a prepubescent, then it very well might.  \nSo, it's a short, okay platformer with a twist that's worth seeing (though maybe only on sale, or the free version online, of which I hear there is one).\nOh, and some final notes: the graphics, while being pixelated, are pretty tight and often unsettling, as the game promises, but the gameplay is standard platformer with interspersed segments of dimension shifting, which may have been original in 2010, but is no longer terribly novel.\nLet's sum it up: Buy it on sale.

Eversion is the perfect length for a game like this- it doesn't drag itself on with needless repetition; it doesn't bog you down with a bunch of throwaway mechanics you only use once; it doesn't try to make itself overly complicated. \nWhat Eversion DOES do is use it's game mechanics flawlessly- you'll use every resource on the level to get the full completion, and then you can move to the next level. The level design is great, the art really makes you feel like you're a part of this decaying fa\u00e7ade of a world, and the music sets the tone of each \"world\" perfectly.\n\nThis is a perfect game for someone who enjoys horror games, but is tired of the same old jumpscares that startled them last year.", "timestamp_created": 1428111525, "timestamp_updated": 1428111525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15120287": {"recommendationid": "15120287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014445897", "num_games_owned": 4787, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442354346}, "language": "english", "review": "9/10\n\nIt's hard to explain why this game is good without spoiling it, but I'll try.\n\nFirst, the game's premise - it delivers perfectly on it. When you play it, you'll understand.\n\nMechanics works perfectly too.

What I got was a rather advanced platformer with a macabre theme. \n\nI'm not very good at platformers, so I am not the best judge about their difficulty. But there are some things in this game that make it difficult. In addition to some other techniques, this game requires timed jumping, timed levels, and jumping off of enemies. All of these are well known techniques, but they are still difficult. There are no new mechanics to add difficulty, so it is just the difficulty of basic platforming raised to a rather high level. \n\nI was also interested in the game because it had the 'Lovecraftian' tag. I was expecting some story between the different levels. There was no story. Instead of being Lovecraftian, I would call it just macabre until possibly the very end. Even then it is more of a reference than it is a story. \n\nI would only recommend this game if you really need to play a different platformer. \n\n-no interesting mechanics (There is the eversion mechanism, but it is not new and doesn't introduce much.)\n-no story\n-difficulty is rather high just to play the game\n", "timestamp_created": 1424626854, "timestamp_updated": 1424626854, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14589393": {"recommendationid": "14589393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023952903", "num_games_owned": 2975, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424550727}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] Ready!\n[spoiler] To die [/spoiler] [/h1] \u2013 \u041d\u0430\u0434\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0437\u043a\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043a\u043f\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430.\nEversion, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044c \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440, \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0443\u044e \u0441\u0443\u0449\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043c\u0440\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438 \u043f\u0443\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0443\u044e. \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0440\u044f \u0432 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u044b \u0445\u043e\u0440\u0440\u043e\u0440 \u0432\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430!

Auf jeden fall ist sind die Welten in Stufe 1 recht leicht w\u00e4hrend sie in Stufe 4 Normal und Stufe 7 Schwer sind nat\u00fcrlich muss man zwischen den Stufen wechseln damit man alles einsammeln kann und 100 Prozent haben will. Es gibt auch verschiedene Endings aber die meisten sind alle gleich bis auf 3. Das Game hat man relativ sehr schnell durch weil es nicht viel Level gibt und es gibt auch keinen Endboss man muss eine Prinzessin retten wie bei Mario. H\u00e4tte das Spiel mehr Level gehabt w\u00e4re es intresant und spannend gewesen aber so muss ich leider sagen das es nur sehr kurz Spass macht. Da es bei Steam keinen Mittel Buttom gibt sondern nur nicht Empfehlen oder doch muss ich euch sagen ich empfehle euch das Spiel nicht aus dem Grund das man es viel zu schnell durch hat.

The graphics are simple and the reveals are subtle. Eversion is very clever at \"show, don't tell\" and does so in a succinct fashion.\n\n[b]CONS: [/b] Available endings may leave you feeling a little unfulfilled. Difficulty curve spikes near the end, which may be frustrating to some.\n\n[b]WORTH: [/b]This game almost never goes on sale, which is a disappointment since it's old yet has aged pretty well. Has the developer forgot about it? Since it has a freeware alternative and is going on 7 years old, I don't see the point in buying it at a full $5.00, especially since it doesn't have 5 hours of gameplay. (My hours were obtained by completionist + guidemaking play)\n\n[b][u]OVERALL: [/u][/b]Eversion is cute and funny!

In a good way.\n\nCollecting all of the gems is ridiculously difficult; be prepared to die many, many times!\n\nI regret reading almost anything about this game before buying it, but realistically I probably would not have bought it if I wasn't aware that it's not what it seems. It didn't end up being as spooky or disturbing as I was anticipating, especially with the \"NOT FOR CHILDREN\" disclaimer, but the ability to evert to different worlds was interesting and reminded me of Braid.\n\nI really like how Mario-esque the design and controls were, although I royally screwed myself with being unable to time certain jumps when they were actually quite easy. It was very fluid and fast which helped when you were re-doing levels over and over and over that required you to do several things in succession to progress. The music was excellent and the appearance differences between worlds was very fun.\n\nOne thing I'm not a fan of is the length of the game paired with the price. It's only 8 levels long, and there's nothing passed that even when you do get all of the gems. That really disappointed me. I guess I anticipated several maps and worlds like Super Mario. There wasn't very much explanation for what goes on in the game, which is acceptable and I suppose added an eerie element to the story. \n\nVery challenging but very cool.

Depending on how skilled you are with platformers, this game should take 1-2 hours to finish. There are 3 achievable endings, from which 1 of them is tricky to get.\n\nThe concept of the game is that you are moving between different layers while you are collectiong gems and finish the stages. The higher the layer count, the more the scenery and the atmosphere decays. Without telling too much beforehand I can ensure you, the cute scenery you see in layer 1, will soon be turned upside down.\n\nThe switch between the layers occurs at different points in the stages where you can evert to the next or the previous layer by pressing the eversion key. Every layer gives you a special advantage which you need to collect certain gems or finish the stage. The game can be a bit tricky sometimes, but overall it is neither too easy nor too hard. If you are a platformer maniac, this will probably be really boring for you, though.\n\nThe BGM of the game is really nice and is different for each layer. Don't forget to increase the volume, because sound will play an important role with your gameplay experience!\n\nThe game comes with a total of 14 achievements and 5 trading cards. I personally think the achievement count is pretty low and there could be more achievements added. It was rather easy to get 13 out of the 14 achievements. The thing which really bothered me was the last achievement. Because I am kind of an impatient person I looked it up and damn, this is something noone would think of.\n\nBut overall, I can say that this game is really fun even though it is short.

The aesthetics follow through on the premise as much as is feasible given the style and budget.\n\nThat's the good stuff, and it's good enough for the game to deserve a look, especially considering it's cheap and short.\n\nThere are however two problems, and they can be pretty big ones depending on how you approach the game - first, the platforming physics are... less than perfect, with unintuitive hitboxes, relatively low jump precision and limited air control. The issue is exacerbated by the level design, which requires high jump precision in tricky hitbox situations in several places, and the second problem, which is bad checkpointing. The player gets unlimited lives and resumes at checkpoints, which is a good decision, but the checkpoints are relatively sparse, and worse - they are usually placed at the beginnings and middles of levels, not after most difficult parts, which means that you can fail a difficult section due to poor mechanics (at least that's what it feels like) and then have to go back and redo the better part of the level, which is always frustrating.\n\nIt's worth noting that this only becomes a real problem if you're trying for the secret endings, all gems, or 100% completion, etc. - a regular playthrough should be fun, moderately challenging and mostly frustration-free for most players, so if you're playing for the experience the game will accommodate you and you'll get plenty out of it.\n\nDefinitely worth a look!", "timestamp_created": 1419481313, "timestamp_updated": 1419481664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13561321": {"recommendationid": "13561321", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962820885", "num_games_owned": 1026, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1313910000}, "language": "english", "review": "Eversion is a rather simple, lukewarm 45 minute platformer if you're going to blow through it and get the bad ending.

The only twist being that you have the ability to shift environments (eversions). You can shift from six different eversions: deception, erosion, desolation, apprehension, confusion and commotion. Every shift will change colors and backgrounds. The shifts will also turn bushes from leafy, to dead so you can pass through them and into deadly thorn bushes. Some enemies into stone and brick platforms into crumbling blocks. You cannot just shift on a whim, you need to find the invisible area you're supposed to stand in and then shift eversions. When you press the eversion button, if you're close enough to the correct invisible spot, you'll see a ring around it for a brief time. If you're stuck, that usually means you need to backtrack and find the invisible spot.\n\nThe gameplay is simple. Like Mario you can destroy bricks by jumping into them and make a gem appear out of blocks by jumping into special ones. Eventually, you will get to see this magical kingdom for what it is. Horrifying, dark and grim. At some point, enemies will spurt bright red blood partially obscuring the screen. Although some might boast this as a horror game, there's nothing really horrific. I was too busy laughing at the giant hands that comically shoot up from death pits. Its too bright and simple of an art style to really be horrific.\n\nThere are no power ups. Every hit is instant death, but that's okay because there are no lives. You just respawn at the start of the level or the last checkpoint. The game boasts 8 worlds, but really these worlds are just 8 levels. A world to me feels like it should be more than a level. I was able to breeze through the game in half an hour and that's even looking for invisible eversion points. At the end of each level you hop on a ground flag. There are no bosses, in fact there really only seems to be three enemy types in the game. Monkey claw, goomba and some sort of stone beetle.\n\nUpon completing the game, it just crashed back to the desktop. The only replay value is going back to collect all 240 gems to get better endings that reference better properties. Once you get a gem, it the game considers collected, even if you die on the same run, that gem will not be there. Not having any consequence of death makes things way too easy.

You play as Zee-Tee the Astrik (*), who is on a quest to save Princess Nehema, who has been captured by things that look a lot like Goombas. Along the way, Zee-Tee can evert to different \"layers\" of the world by pressing SPACE in certain areas, Things are quite different in each eversion layer, so everting is often required to progress.\n\nAlong the way, Zee-Tee can challenge himself by trying to collect all 240 gems, which will often require backtracking at certain eversion layers. Thankfully, your gems save even if you quit the level or die within, which is great for some of the harder levels.\n\nThe only real complaint I have about this game is how short it is. The game can easily be 100%ed in an hour, but if it is your first time playing, it'll probably take 2 hours or so to collect all of the gems and rescue the Princess.\n\nAll in all, Eversion is a very interesting platformer that is worth taking a look at.

I'm gonna do a longer review on a video later on, but I feel like it deserves a review on Steam as well.\n\nSo, what is Eversion?\n\nIt's a platorm game, a bit similar in the basic mechanics as the classic Super Mario: Running arround to finish a level while destroying blocks to get [strike] coins[/strike] gems, while jumping arround on enemies....With a twist. In some places, you can change how the world works. In every stage up until the 7\u00ba one, there's a new kind of world. And here is where things get messed up.\n\nYou see, the first worls are happy as f#ck. Even the enemies you're annihilating smile! And then...Well, things get dark. I won't say more, I don't want to spoil you the fun. All I will say, is that I wasn't expecting such a happy game to turn like that.\n\nThe soundtrack and graphics of the game are quite good, it feels like I'm playing a good NES game (seriously, that console had a TON of shitty games), the controls are fluid (I used a keyboard, I don't know if using a controller is better or not), And even though there's not much story, what there is, is...Well, you'll see.\n\nThe best part about this, is that you can download the free version of the game, if you want, instead of playing the steam one and supporting the devs. Of course, playing the Free version makes you an #sshole, SPECIALLY WHEN THE GAME IS THIS CHEAP, but hey, there's all kinds of people out there.\n\nJust be aware: You might need to have some balls to finish the game. It has some difficulty spikes, and some parts can be a bit disturbing, to say the least.\n\nOh, and the video review might take a while. It will be on Spanish, though.\n\nJust remember, the Princess is in another castle.", "timestamp_created": 1412178639, "timestamp_updated": 1412179253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501807", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12292371": {"recommendationid": "12292371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087049774", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488216006}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is Nintendo hard in all the right ways.

watch the trailer you already know what's going on here.  Eversion is at its core a puzzle platformer, and a clever one too.  You control the flower-faced hero named Zee Tee and rescue the princess, so if you've played any NES game before you already know what to do.\n\nGameplay is basically platforming but with a dimension-warping mechanic where you jump through alternate worlds.  You may have to change something in one world in order to affect the other world and then you can get to where you couldn't before.  It sounds hard at first but with a bit of practice you will eventually understand what to do.  There are collectables throughout the stages to give some replay value, though I wasn't too interested.  Things do get shaken up later with different enemies and slightly different ways to play the stage, though generally things remains the same throughout.  Of course, the other dimensions might just maybe chinge things up a bit.  I will warn you, it will get stressful.\n\nAll I can say is don't watch videos of it or look up other reviews because the main thing here which I didn't discuss will be totally spoiled.

You'll get a lot more playtime out of it if you go for every gem, but the worth is for you to decide in that regard.

Instead, I freaked out when strange monsters appeared in the sky during the eversions, which is actually the process of turning inside out.

I have learned a bit more about the game, and will requalify my review.\n\nHonestly, I was wrong to think this game was hard. It's actually not challenging, just inconsistent in executing jumps at least on keyboard. Disabling the Steam Overlay helps to reduce input lag, but the game is still not tight like Super Meat Boy. Movement is fast and slippery, which makes precision more cumbersome, but it can be done. The gameplay is really basic, simple platforming with minor dimensional differences.\n\nI feel the big problem is that the game does little unique. In truth, you are paying for a minor graphical update, since the game is free online at lower graphical fidelity. For the price, this graphics package is quite underwhelming. There are several palette swaps, but the animations are only a few frames. Music is repetitive, and starts over every time you die. It all feels cheaply put together, more rusty than retro.\n\nThe game is short, dimension shifting is more for the brooding plot than for gameplay, and the ending could be reached in a few minutes. As for the plot, despite \"inspiration\" from Lovecraft and any kind of written material, the plot is laughable. I understand platformers are not known for story, but Braid and VVVVVV did a heck of a lot more in story along with gameplay. For a game that sells itself on \"the twist\", that twist just made me think that someone needs to stop playing in MS Paint. It feels antiquated, and reminds me of the shoddy romhack creepypasta stuff of Mario online. Those elements probably had a larger influence on this game than Lovecraft ever did.\n\nSo the story, gameplay, and graphics are all mediocre, doing little new. VVVVVV just seems to do everything better. Saira is a great puzzle-platformer option with probably 3 times the content, better graphics and music, and is fully free forever on Steam right now. Eversion fails to impress anymore, and feels more like a joke. The developer never bothered to capitalize letters in the few announcements made for the game, so maybe the whole thing really is a joke.

The gameplay is frustrating to say the least and is not \"fluid\" or \"tight\" as some might say.

Maybe not even bad. In my opinion, it is just not worth the money.\n\nEversion is an Indie platformer which makes me scratch my head when comparing it to the original Super Mario, but only with a flower as protagonist. Of course, this game is a stand alone title, so it has some mechanics on it's own. The most recognizable one is Dimension Shifting. Like it says, you switch between different dimensions which gives the same level a different layout and enemies. With each layer, the level gets more difficult.\n\nDon't get scared though, as this game is hilariously easy. You don't have any lives, so if you were to fall in a bottomless pit or get hit by an enemy, you start at a certain checkpoint. You could compare it to Rayman Origins, but simplified. Besides, it only took me 2 hours to get all achievements, endings and collectables. And I even took my time. But this is of course personal preference as some people prefer short games, which I can clearly understand.\n\nDimension Shifting itself is a fun mechanic at first, but it gets boring really fast. And that's a shame because it is the main gimmick of the game. If you're interested in puzzles, you might see some light here.\n\nThe game only has 8 worlds, which can be completed in a laughably short time. Well, most of them anyways. By doing that you will miss all the collectibles but it still shouldn't be ignored.\n\nThe story is ignorable, the music forgetable and the graphics are, while fitting this game, just average. Remember, this is not a bad game but it's just not worth the money. If you are however able to get it on sale or in any other way, give it a go!

You play as a little flower character, Zee Tee. You make your way through levels consisting of a set of parallel realities featuring different hazards and soundtracks to match the atmosphere. Eversion is only possible within certain points within each level. Very sharp and simple controls, easy gameplay (difficulty does gradually increase). Not really any story to the game, but you will definitely have a confused look on your face and most likely be on edge of your seat as you discover what each stage of Eversion really is. Although I found myself really enjoying the game (ignoring the fact I had an upset, confused look on my face the entire time), I dont think $4.99 is worth the price; though I was lucky to get a coupon discount for this game. I beat the game in less than 30 minutes with nearly every achievement earned. But after completing the game, there is absolutely no replay value left, as you have literally just made it through the whole game. But let it be noted, there is a secret ending to work for.\n\n+ Deranged illustration change of each stage of Eversion, keeps you interested wanting to adventure further. You dont know what to expect next.\n+ Sharp, simple controls\n+ Simple achievements and trading cards\n\n- Price not worth what you get\n- Very short game featuring only 8 levels, can be beaten in less than 10-15 minutes if rushed\n- Absolutely no replay value, other than working for last achievements (if you're interested at that point)\n- No story (not exactly a flaw to me, but may be to others)\n\nI definitely do recommend this game, only for the random and unpredictable twists. Entertainment value increases when playing at night. I would love to see reactions from other players when they start getting into the Eversion; but for $4.99, the price is not worth it. Unless you're willing to drop a quick five bucks, I would say to only get the game if you have a discount coupon.", "timestamp_created": 1396864020, "timestamp_updated": 1396864020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9745102": {"recommendationid": "9745102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042946505", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396789539}, "language": "english", "review": "Super mario bros creepypasta's version.

But this game is far more than a clone. I also highly advise you take the warning on the title screen seriously.\n\nThe story of Eversion starts off very simple with the save-the-princess trope, our little flower hero Zee Tee is tasked with the job of rummaging through the lands to reunite with the Princess. Along the way you'll fight goomba-like enemies that are barely threatening. The main selling point of this game is the Eversion feature, in each level there are points where the background changes along with the music slightly, if you press the evert button in these areas the stage will evert, this changes objects in the stages. For example, if you evert in one stage you can walk on the clouds. This makes way for very creative puzzles that test your platforming skills. But this isn't the main reason the game is infamous, as you evert the stages they start to degenerate, I don't want to ruin the experience but as you start to evert the layers in the later levels you'll realize this game has combined 3 genres. Platforming, puzzle, and horror. As far as music goes, the game has some very delightful chip-tune tracks, which then slowly start to change as you evert. The last track is just a plain heartbeat. \n\nAll in all, the game has little over 1 hour of playtime, it's a fun time waster with VERY good plot twists indeed.

The gameplay is akin to the classic Super Mario games, and while it's mostly straightforward, the \"eversion\" game mechanic allows you to change the environment slightly at certain points in each level, which gives each stage more depth as it allows for some intricate puzzles and level design. Eversion's difficulty starts out quite low but rapidly accelerates into a challenging game as your progress.\n\nThe game does suffer from a couple of minor flaws. It's short - 7 levels short. However, there is a time attack mode with online highscores (with alternate versions of a couple levels), which gives the game a bit more replay value. There are also a couple areas where the hitboxes on the player make it difficult to maneuver through one-block gaps, but this only happens in a couple of areas.\n\nOverall, Eversion is a cheerful and unique experience; it's something you and everyone you know should definitely play.

I imagine anyone buying it just wanted it because it was cheap and looked cute. \n\nHow wrong you are.  \n\nStory\nSomething about the princess being taken is written on the store page. You won't really see much story once in the game, except for the ending. \n\nPresentation\nCute graphics here, they are what drew me in to purchasing this game. Little did I know that would soon change to a nightmarish landscape rather quickly. While they are rather basic and obviously inspired by classic games, they still look nice.\n\nThe isn't a lot of music in the game, but it fits the setting. Simple sound effects that do the job as well. Not really much to say about them. \n\nControls\nAs the controls are rather simple, they work well on keyboard, but gamepads also have support if you prefer those. Movement, jumping, the Eversion ability (which shall be detailed below) and a pause button. You could play this with a NES clone controller if you own one. \n\nGameplay\nRun, jump, bounce off enemy heads, collect the gems and reach the end of the level.  Sounds like any NES era platformer game, right? Well, since the game opens up with a Lovecraft quote, there is obviously going to be something creepy lurking in the shadows. And that is where the Eversion ability comes in. In each level, there are locations where the walls between realities are weak. If you can find them, you can shift to another reality, often darker than the one you were already in. This will have an effect on both the landscape and enemies. That bush will wither and die, only to be replaced by deadly vines. Enemies may lose the will to live, just standing there for you to end its life, or it may get faster and more dangerous. Switching realities is needed to get all the gems through the levels, and sometimes even to progress forward through what would otherwise block movement. \n\nLifespan\nThis game is short. Including the final level which requires you to find all the gems, you are unlikely to spend more than an hour or two doing the main game, including the different endings. Once you have seen the true ending, you do unlock a time attack mode with leader boards, which can add to the time spent on the game. There is also a level editor available, though I haven't played around with any of the community content myself. \n\nWhile not a bad game, the short game length alone is a good enough reason to only get on sale or with a Steam discount coupon.\n\n6 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1393973335, "timestamp_updated": 1393973335, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457491", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9342873": {"recommendationid": "9342873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037044572", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446210088}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "An interesting twist on the \"Super Mario clone\" that saturates the platformer market, whoose weaknessess are its small longevity and (a bit) waste of potential of the happy-go-disturbing.", "timestamp_created": 1393951347, "timestamp_updated": 1393951347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9338860": {"recommendationid": "9338860", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971680023", "num_games_owned": 1001, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 128, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393916381}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not be fooled, this isn't a cute littel kid platformer.

Good job Miroslav Malesevic, you have inspired me!\nFor me, this game is like a hommage to, yet a parody of the Super Mario Bros series. The theme of 'a hero beats numerous monsters and finally saved his heroine' is embodied in this game. However, don't you think this theme is somehow old-fashioned? Wait, after finishing the whole game, you will find out the reason why this game deviates from that hackneyed theme, and why I said this game is a parody.\nThis is a great game with fantastic BGM and unusual atmospheres and endings.

Using this skill is necessary to beat the different stages, and abusing it is the only way to actually gather all the hidden gems. Makes for some interesting puzzles, though there is a fair amount of running back and forth. Also as the layers shift there is a visible degradation in the overall mood - starting at happy-go-lucky with layer one and ending at disturbed and insane. Naturally, the BGM changes along with the layers, and the different variations do reflect the mood of each layer nicely. \n\nThe game's short so there's not much I can say about the \"story\" without spoiling the fun, though here's a nice little something to pique your interest (potential spoiler) -- Braid references (and not the insignificant kind)!

Hit once you die but it doesn\u2019t really matter since you have unlimited lives and checkpoints through each level to help you along. While going through each level you are trying to collect a certain amount of jewels that will help you discover a secret in the end.\n\nControls are pretty fluid and easy since you only move side to side and jump. There\u2019s also a little gameplay element called evert which will change up the level design when done. This is needed to find every jewel you need and to get to the end of the levels. Doing this will also sometimes add more of a challenge as the environment seems to become more violent.\n\nEversion can be beaten in say an hour or less depending on your platforming skills and frustration levels. I spent 3 hours in the game just to find every jewel and try to complete the secret stage which I couldn\u2019t beat.

La m\u00e9canique de base \u00e9tant de pouvoir \"switch\" de dimension \u00e0 certains endroits. Il y a en tout 8 dimensions diff\u00e9rentes mais toutes ne sont pas disponibles dans chaque niveau. Le but du jeu, outre finir les 8 mondes (j'ai fait les 7 standards conduisant \u00e0 la fin en 40 minutes), est aussi de r\u00e9colter toutes les gemmes du jeu (j'ai d\u00fb rajouter 20/30 minutes). Le monde 7 pour ces gemmes est le meilleur et le plus long puisque vous allez devoir traverser les 7 dimensions et 2 fois. Dans un ordre puis dans l'ordre en n'oubliant pas les actions \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser sans quoi l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une ou plusieurs gemmes ne sera pas ou plus possible.\n\nReste encore 2 fins alternatives \u00e0 voir, et il est aussi possible de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les lettres du jeu qui sont apparemment cach\u00e9es dans chaque niveau. Mais par \"cach\u00e9es\" il faut comprendre invisibles et r\u00e9cup\u00e9rables uniquement en \u00e9tant \u00e0 un endroit pr\u00e9cis (en sautant ou autre). Si vous \u00eates patient, hf pour rechercher \u00e7a. Sinon il y a un guide bien foutu sur Steam entre autres. Je m'en suis servi pour finir le jeu \u00e0 100% (en ~2h).\nQuand vous finissez le jeu avec la bonne fin, vous d\u00e9bloquez le mode \"Time Attack\", vous permattant de vous mesurer \u00e0 vos amis et/ou \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente sur Steam. J'y ai aussi un peu jou\u00e9 mais mes scores ne sont pas glorieux :(. Juste une 13\u00e8me place sur le monde 3.\n\nBref, sympa, mais pas vraiment dur et ultra court. En m\u00eame temps il \u00e9tait gratuit ce jeu \u00e0 la base, puis ils ont fait cette version \"HD\" en vente sur Steam pour 4\u20ac avec quelques ajouts.\n\n[url=http://forum.canardpc.com/threads/82667-Les-jeux-que-vous-viendez-de-finir-V2?p=7460474&viewfull=1#post7460474][i]Message d'origine[/i][/url].", "timestamp_created": 1391112964,

well made and everything fit perfectly together for a complete game.\n\nMaybe not worth the price they ask but with a discount, go for it :)", "timestamp_created": 1390815192, "timestamp_updated":

In specific, small, invisible \u201chotspots\u201d in the game (that you can reach) you can switch to another sort-of parallel reality, where some rules might be different. For example, clouds can be walked on in some realities, and in others, shrubs become trees that block your path.\n\nThe game\u2019s called \u201cEversion\u201d for a reason: as you progress through the game, it starts \u201cturning inside out\u201d, revealing the hell inside this beautiful, peaceful world. You start off in a cute dreamy land, collecting gems and passing by (or stomping) happy, innocent \u201cenemies\u201d that skip around. Soon enough, these enemies turn worse and your surroundings change. At some point, the game even starts lying to the player and occasionally tries to discourage the player from continuing, while at the same time breaking the fourth wall.\n\nEversion is rather short (less than an hour, possibly more to max it out), but it\u2019s a great experience that anyone should play.

The gimmick does end up leading to the game's horror element, which isn't all that bad. One of the few redeeming factors of the game is the music. It gets better the farther you go into the eversion states.\n\nI give eversion a 5/10, it's an average platformer that isn't really all that special and honestly you can just play the free

"Eversion is not what you think. The unassuming and colorful visuals are intended not to delight, but to give you a false sense of security; to draw you in before transporting you to the nightmarish world of its reality. It's intentionally unsettling, and unique in how it manages to get under your skin while never assuming anything is wrong, which is what I find so remarkable about it.\n\nThe hook to Eversion is everting the world, similar to swapping dimensions, which causes the environment to change properties or even disappear. It's a simple mechanic that allows for some clever lever designs, but it is also where the game becomes very, very creepy. The deeper you go through the layers of everting, the more twisted the backgrounds become and the more deranged the music gets. The disclaimer at the start should tell you all you need to know: \"this game is not suitable for children or those with a nervous demeanor.\"\n\nAlthough it lacks the nuance of something like Braid, Eversion similarly uses video game cliches as the foundation of the experience, relying on your expectations to carry the premise as it warps the familiar into something all its own. In this developer Zaratustra Productions is mostly successful, with my only complaint being I wish there was more here. With the exception of a few odd secrets, you can complete and collect everything in around two hours (those disinclined to gather all the gems should expect half or less than that). Even with its low base price, it feels a little too much for what you get.\n\nAside from the price, Eversion is something I think is worth your time. It completely surprised me in its execution, leaving me chilled and a little disturbed, but impressed nonetheless. If you are looking for something off the beaten path, Eversion is one game that will absolutely deliver. It doesn't last long, but this strange journey is undoubtedly one worth taking, provided you are prepared for the potentially terrifying.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2013/12/02/eversion-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1386024374, "timestamp_updated": 1426139802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833367", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7886669": {"recommendationid": "7886669", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993406990", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1515727083}, "language": "english", "review": "Great puzzle platformer.

You have enemies and an end of a level to reach, but in order to do so you must overcome obstacles. This could be a plant in your way or objects that need to be made solid. You do this by finding the Eversion, a dimensional changing point that warps everything on the level. That plant will become a weed that you can walk through, etc. Finding the correct order and where they're located is the main challenge of the game. But the deeper into the Eversions you go, the harder enemies become and the more environmental challenges you must face. It's quite fun!\n\nThe game can be completely beaten with 100% achievements in a couple of hours. That includes bonus levels. While it was originally freeware (that version is still available I think) and bundled, I don't think that devalues this game in the slightest. The game also supports a level editor which has to be downloaded separately.\n\nIn summary, it's a short, simple, fun game that has a charming presentation and solid gameplay mechanics.

It just seemed such an innocuous and cute little platformer in the beginning that reminded me of Mario on LSD with the bright and colourful atmosphere. Deceivingly easy too. However, that quickly changed as I progressed through the levels which got surprisingly harder with every new layer of dimension being added to my game. Not only does the theme change to a more darker and threatening ambience, but it also modifies the environment and the difficulty with it. Clouds materialise then disappear, enemies become slower, then faster, and even your innocent little flower from layer 1 will soon become a thorny bush that will make you blow up by touching it.\n\nI found the themes to be really creepy. I think that is what made the biggest impression on me, the music that gradually became more chaotic, the darker colour palettes, the vast amounts of hemoglobin, the hands, etc... Level 6 just gets your adrenaline going, though after the 10th death you kinda start getting used to it. I'm not that good at platformers, yet I wanted to 100% this one. So it did take me a couple hours to get everything, and it was indeed a nice challenge without being SMB-\"suicidal\", as Monukai (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/recommended/33680/) put it.\n\nThe only thing I'd criticise this game for would be its short length (that's what she said). Also, I felt that the first few dimensions were a bit underrepresented in the later levels. Basically what I'm saying is, eversion certainly has a LOT of potential. I could imagine trickier and more complex levels being made with a bit of creativity which I unfortunately don't have.\n\nAnyhow, I fully endorse the thought that eversion is well worth the few quid (though mine was a bundle buy #cheapskate).

(to the point that the game files call the enemies \"goombas\", and an achievement makes reference to the first SMB). On the subject of Achievements, those, leaderboards for a \"time attack\" mode, and graphical improvements are what you're actually paying for in this Steam release; the developer, Zaratustra Productions, also has a freeware version available at their site, zarat.us/tra.\n\n According to the manual (available from the game's Steam Store page), you are Zee Tee, a brave -a-s-t-e-r-i-s-k- warrior, out to save the Flower Kingdom's Princess -N-e-h-e-m-a-, -k-i-d-n-a-p-p-e-d- by the Ghuliba forces of the north. Aside from that, there's not much explicit story to be had. However, as per the game's title, there are many layers to this quaint little story, just as there are layers to the world itself. Along with the jumping around, jumping on enemies, jumping to headbutt blocks established with SMB and its kin, the eversion mechanic allows you to evert at certain places on the stages, changing how the stage behaves. The physics will always stay the same, but stage elements and enemies will shift with the peeling layers of reality.\n\n And you'll need to evert, too, to get everything there is. There are 240 gems to collect, and nabbing all these buggers will push your reflexes and understanding of the game's mechanics to get yourself to where they are. There tend to be at least a couple ways to accomplish these feats, though, which opens it up a bit for experimentation.\n\n I definitely like the graphics boost this version has over the freeware. The added detail really brings out what you're seeing, and keeps it from becoming \"just a bunch of sprite tiles\". The only sacrifice is one if you prefer simplicity, especially during the endings (oh, yes, there's more than one ending to find), but I don't think the little flourishes diminish the effect the game gives. The music helps with the effect, though it may get on your nerves if you end up in a stage too long. However, until that point, they're pretty catchy, with a technical level that matches the retro aesthetic the game's made with. And both will help you find the eversion points, as these nexuses will blend the sounds and colors of the layers they lead to.\n\n As for the challenge, I think you'd have to know if you're compatible with platformers to play this one. If you're cool with the run-&-jump, you should be able to get through to an ending with enough effort, though to truly delve into everything, you may end up offput, but not enough to drive you away from the game permanently. The levels, aside from the first, have checkpoints midway through the stage, though if you quit the stage, you'll have to begin from the top. Some stages require precise jumping (with one calling for vertical block-scaling, jumping from one block to one directly above it) or races against time, and compiled with the other stage dangers, you can end up falling to your quick death many times (each time resetting the music, to boot). The game's not too terribly long, though, at less than ten stages (with a couple as part of the Time Attack mode), so if you're especially good at platformers, you may end up breezing through. And for any skill level, have some solace that your gems (and hidden 'items'; one per stage) are saved as soon as you grab them, so if you die, you don't lose your loot.\n\n Despite how much time you get out of it, at five dollars, it's not a bank-buster, and I like what the game does to recommend it to anyone willing, whether they go with the freeware or Steam release (though if you're letting a friend play on your account, you may want to move your .sav file somewhere else and let them have a fresh start). It won't warp your brain, but it can make you uncomfortable/insecure in the game's world, and for whatever frustrations it gives, I did have a smile on when calling out on the game's ridiculous \"bullcrap\" moments.\n\n Just, just keep in mind: this is \"not suitable for children or those of a nervous disposition.\" *wink*\n\n NOTE: My Steam profile reads me as having 11 hours on this game, but some amount of that time was just goofing around or showing it to my folks (because, really, it's that neat).\n\n----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- -----\n[October 16th, 2010]\nBasically Super Mario Bros. with a welcome thematic twist.

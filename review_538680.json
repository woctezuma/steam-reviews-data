The cliffhanger ending isn't quite as good as the first Trails in the Sky game, but it makes me super hype for the sequel to come out on steam.

This worked fine, the only lines that are missing translation are the battle voices  (including the very short dialog from the bosses as you beat them up). Unfortunately I also had some performance issues that seemed to be related to the fact that running the game in fullscreen puts it in borderless fullscreen. I've had this issue in other games where running in window mode kinda messes up the framerate, which is why I run games in exclusive fullscreen. Turns out the only way to run this game in exclusive fullscreen is to edit the xml file directly, and when you do that it doesn't have any alt-tab support or the game crashes.

Overall, this game has it all.  It delivers on a decent soundtrack, gameplay is amazing for the classical JRPG feel, and the story is amazing too.

This game is a PC port of the original game launched back in 2013. \n\nWhen i initially saw this game on steam in August 2017, I was interested. The second the game release  I brought it, and never regretted it. This is my second foray into JRPG, my first being my aborted attempted at one of the Tales Of series, that had real time battle sequences, apart from the turn based the majority of JRPG's use. \n\nI personally, now after completing my first run through of this game 70 hours in, prefer the turn base. \n\nThe story commences, and you are immeditately hit with a large group that will evantually grow into your team. Each, yes, it could be said with its \"torpe\" characters, and some sequences which basically almost ever anime has used at least once :) \n\nBut, for someone coming into \"The Legend of Heroes\" series, this game is a great introduction, though technically in the teamline it is in the latter part of the universe. The visuals, yeah are not excellent 3D hyper resourced required models, but that doesnt take away from the beauty of the game, its sequences, action scenes, and the universe you start to explore. \n\nThe music is beautiful, especially in the later part of the game where there are some truly majestic boss pieces that play in the background as you face some truly formiable foes. Also, during the quieter periods, the soft music that plays in the background could easy be used for a nice relaxing day in the real world. \n\nAs i said, the charaters do have their torpes, but each is unique as you explore and learn more about them. The story unfolds slowly, which might annoy some people who want every question answered straight away. But the slow unfolding story allows you to take in what is occurring, and what might occur. \n\nThe PC Port has been brillantly done and created, so much so you wouldnt even realize once you are ingame, that it was created for consoles. Additionally, the settings and options you can configure, will make it easy for many PC gamers to configure the game and tweak it to your hearts content. \n\nWith this being the first game of four games for this story, there are still many unanswered questions, and the ending of this game has left me pumped for the next game to be released ported to PC in early 2018. \n\nWhile this game might not be flashy, its storyline, characters, music, universe, scenes and those little moments are something you rarely find packaged within a single game. If you are looking for a great JRPG, that has a expanding story and universe that will keep you exploring for hundreds of hours, I truly recommend you give \"The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel\" a go", "timestamp_created": 1514372034, "timestamp_updated": 1514372034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38728904": {"recommendationid": "38728904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379527001", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5157, "last_played": 1514834350}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u60f3\u5feb\u70b9\u73a9\u52302\u548c3; \n\nFan in China:\n\nWish to play 2&3 steam edition soon!

The game is also pretty forgiving if you lose a battle. The characters and story are one of the best parts of the game. The characters really grew on me and I found myself wanting to do all the little side missions just to find out more about them. This game also has a few plot twist moments that will leave you speechless. The voice acting is pretty impressive as well. \n\nSome of the cons for the game though would be that the music didn't really blow me away. There are some tracks that stand out more than others but sometimes I found the music to just be lacking. The story also ends on a massive cliffhanger; there is a sequel on Ps3 that is coming to PC in 2018 but with no exact date yet it's hard to wait patiently.

Nihon Falcom strikes again with a killer, memorable, original, and thoroughly polished RPG!\n\nFirst star goes to the original storyline. Rather, the deft handling of the storyline. One can spot a mile a way the many tropes that Falcom used to convey the story. As with most Falcom fans, the attention is given to the characters and how they react to the story. Nihon Falcom really takes to heart the writer's adage of \"a simple story about complex characters\". Once again, these NPCs are the most stand out characters in RPG history. The English voice acting is fun to hear. In my mind's eye (in addition to being predisposed), the actors sound exactly how I envision the characters to sound. I couldn't escape from hearing their specific voices in my mind when I was reading the silent dialogue.\n\nOne of the main complaints about Falcom's games is that they tend to have a slow beginning. I completely agree. The beginning ten hours are a labor of love when I play each game and I kinda doubt the game will go anywhere. By about the 12th hour, everything is set up so brilliantly and convincingly, that you must see things through as a play to the very end, even if that end is yet another 60 hours down the line. \n\nWith that in mind, make sure you play this game during a month off of responsibilities; because it will eat up about 60 hours of your life. You'll be very content after that. Not an hour of those 60 wasted!\n\nNext star goes to the killer soundtrack! The Falcom sound team outdoes itself with the best ambience, fight, boss, cinematic music ever! If you do not buy this game, at least purchase the soundtrack or listen to it online in order to get a taste of how epic the music is. Every city, character, sentiment is given a specific music piece, which means that when that music plays out of the blue, you know exactly what will happen. That's a great narrative technique. Nihon Falcom has had over umpteen games to perfect this winning formula.\nI'd highly recommend playing the first Trails in the Sky games before playing the Cold Steel, because not only do some characters make a triumphant return, but also the combat system is the same from the Sky trilogy only refined and polished further. I admit it took about three Sky games to really perfect that combat system, and to pick up the small adjustments in this series for me as a veteran player went swimmingly. The next star goes to the game's polished mechanics. When I thought this series could not become more original or polished, out comes Cold Steel.\nThe graphics one could say is a bit dated even for when this game came out originally, back in 2013 I believe. But again, to play this game is not about the graphics; it's about immersing oneself into Falcom's world. The character models are a bit simple. But the simple designs lend themselves to doing nuanced actions. Characters blush, flirt, cry, dance, shutter, glare, and really convince you that they come alive with their actions. These NPCs again are much more alive than other games from this same era with more complicated graphics.\nThe final star goes to how the previous factors came together, which was a brilliant result. \n\n5/5 Stars. One of my favorites. Seriously, other corporations need to figure out what Nihon Falcom has been doing for the past coupla decades and crank out games like them. Each one is a serious hit in Japan and in the US. I hope our fanbase grows by the day!

ending), so if you're using a guide or searching the internet for information be careful of massive spoilers.\n\nThis is the first game of the Trails of Cold Steel Trilogy, which is part of the larger The Legend of Heroes series. All the games of the The Legend of Heroes series take place in the same world/universe. You can start with this one without worrying about the other trilogies too much (although I recommend checking out the Trails in the Sky trilogy too).\n\nIf you like JRPGs check this out. It's a turn-based RPG like most Final Fantasy games, but with it's own unique characteristics. The battle system is fun, in fact, my only real complaint about this game is that there are not enough battle quests.\n\nP.S.

for speeding through animations you've seen before and wringing every last piece of dialogue out of npcs\nAutosaves - comes in 1, 5, and 15 minute varieties\nButton prompts for both Xbox and Dualshock controllers\n\nPC enhancements include, but not limited to:\nGraphical options including unlimited draw distance, (high quality) depth of field options, 60 fps and unlocked frame rate,\n       \"High\" preset graphic options set runs great on older pcs.\nKB/M control (I play exclusively with controllers, but the option is there for those who want it)\n\nThe game itself is fun to play, but recommended for those who enjoy long stretches of story segments interspersed with combat/exploration segments. The story has a nice, positive tone with the occasional moments of melodrama that really makes you root for the protagonists. Cast list is full of varied and quirky characters, and that includes the npcs as well. NPCs often have little side stories that makes the game world feel more alive than the average rpg. Talk to everyone (twice)!\n\nCombat is fast paced and regular usage of special abilites and magic is expected. The paradigm is focused on taking immediate control of battles and keeping control - doing everything right tends to make combat feel a little too easy, but screw up and even random encounters can wipe you out. As the game goes on the lethality of random encounters is reduced (due to having more options in battle and equipment), but bosses will always happily take control of battle from you should you give them a chance. I played on Hard, those who are experienced with rpg combat may want to play NIghtmare.\n\nA fine game and an excellent pc port.", "timestamp_created": 1512739902, "timestamp_updated": 1512990311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38146492": {"recommendationid": "38146492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109382988", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507155129}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u95ea2\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u80fd\u79fb\u690d\u5462", "timestamp_created": 1512715027, "timestamp_updated": 1512715027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38143292": {"recommendationid": "38143292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065966790", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512700073}, "language": "english", "review": "After having finished the game, I can fully recommend this to anyone who likes a good jrpg story.", "timestamp_created": 1512700905, "timestamp_updated": 1512700905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38141139": {"recommendationid": "38141139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026905594", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1513926833}, "language": "english", "review": "Great follow up to the Trails in the Sky Trilogy.\nBless you Nihon Falcom - keep up the good work.", "timestamp_created": 1512691906, "timestamp_updated": 1512691906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38139387": {"recommendationid": "38139387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059587372", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512754177}, "language": "english", "review": "i like the games", "timestamp_created": 1512685115, "timestamp_updated": 1512685115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38130450": {"recommendationid": "38130450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148539774", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 3770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513248501}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65e5\u5e38\u5267\u60c5\u771f\u68d2", "timestamp_created": 1512658118, "timestamp_updated": 1512658118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38127776": {"recommendationid": "38127776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040368182", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 114, "last_played": 1514093047}, "language": "english", "review": "I never knew I needed a peak anime high school fantasy RPG with politics.

But whether or not you'll like this game depends wholly on what you're looking to do. If you want a hack and slash RPG that has fast action and a quick pace, this game is not for you. If, on the other hand, you greatly enjoy a game that is heavy on the story, you may have just died and gone to Valhalla. \n\nI've been a gamer forever, and have played hundreds of titles. I have never in my gaming history experienced a game that is so heavy on the storyline. You will be bombarded with cutscenes and dialog every literal step of the way. There is no skip option, so if you don't have time for all that, don't pick up this title. You've been warned. \n\nThat said, you're less likely to enjoy this game if you're an older gamer. Let's face it, we've heard all the basic scenarios before, and most of the dialog, though beautifully done, will probably come across as mundane to most older RPG fans. That, and also the fact that we have jobs, families, and lives to get to. It's really less like a gaming expeirence and more like watching an interactive anime. Which is cool, but I think it's been done way over the top in this title. \n\nAside from the storyline, the combat sequences are very good. There is a combo system, along with magic (functions like materia, ala FF7), leveling, etc. All the traditional things you would expect from an RPG are represented here. However, I have two gripes that are difficult to get my head around. \n\nFirst, the game is nowhere near an open world experience (at least not at the point I am in the game). It is entirely linear, so much so that, upon completing a quest, you advance days of the calendar year. Each day represents a certain timeframe in the gameworld, and only during those timeframes can certain things be done. If you miss out on talking to someone, getting a hidden quest, or purchasing an item, you're screwed. That means that unless you're playing with a guide, this game takes far too long -- you literally have to revisit every area and talk to everyone again each time the storyline advances. It's an interesting dynamic, but serves to slow down the action even further. To it's credit though, I will say that it offers an immersive experience having to talk to everyone and revisit things over again....though for most people you will just click the mouse a hundred times to get past the mountains of dialog. \n\nSecond, the combat system is a lot of fun, but it is a bit slow. It is far more strategic than typical RPGs, but primarily because you can't power level to dominate your opponents. The experience you gain from battles diminishes each time you level -- and since this is not an open world environment, it's obvious the developers wanted you within a certain level range for each chapter of the story. Yes, you can sit there for hours to gain a few more levels, but its truthfully not worth it -- especially since the first battle you fight in the next chapter is going to automatically level your characters. The worst part of this system is that battles within chapters never really get any easier, either. You can pack on 5 levels by grinding for 3 hours, but you're probably only shaving a few seconds off each battle, which average out out to 1-2 minutes per. \n\nPros:\nVisually stunning, even though the graphics are outdated\nIncredibly good voiceovers, and a whole lot of them\nFantastic cutscenes \nStory and Dialog are all extremely well done. They were paying attention to the details for this game\nGreat combat dynamics with all the essentials\nVery immersive, with great character development\n\nCons:\nVery slow paced (expect to dedicate a lot of time to progressing this game)\nLinear \nCombat gets repetitive\nMoney -- While you don't have to grind for levels, you do have to grind for money, and currency for essential upgrades\nNot able to skip the numerous and lengthy cutscenes\nToo much pointless dialog\n\nOVerall:\nGood game if you have the time to play it, love storyline and character development above combat, and want an immersive experience\n", "timestamp_created": 1512345671, "timestamp_updated": 1512345671, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38044737": {"recommendationid": "38044737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067475691", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1729, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512422146}, "language": "english", "review": "As I was happily browsing some sale Steam was having, I came across this game.

If you get it on sale, that's just a bonus.\n\nI'm someone who played Trails in the Sky (a sort of unrelated prequel trilogy in the same world) and thought it was trash. Trails in the Sky actually got  one of the few negative reviews I've ever written. I thought it had potentially, but was let down in way too many ways, so I thought I'd give this game a go.\n\nWhile Trials of Cold Steel doesn't fix every Issue trails in the sky had, it does enough in every area to turn it from a bad game into an increible one.\n\nRandom battle combat: Trails in the sky had unrewarding combat that you had to slog through. Every single fight whittled you down enough to cost the mana or item for a heal. In return for fighting, you got a little money (shit all) and very little exp. If you are 2 levels above the enemies in the area, you get 1 exp. This was my biggest complaint with the game.\n\nIn Cold steel, you can get through a lot of fights wihtout taking damage (think persona). The rewards still aren't great, but they are improved. You get moderate (maybe a little to the low side) experience, and a decent amount of money. Most fights you don't really need to think about, but things can get out of hand if you screw up too badly, so it keeps it relatively interesting. You have a tonne of spells that can be used by any character, and abilties that are character specific, meaning who you choose to have in your party matters and will change how you fight. I would say the combat is better than average for a turn based rpg.\n\nBoss Battle Combat: The bosses are usually very well designed. Each character has an ability called an 'S break' (Basically a limit break in final fantasy). It's charged by taking damage, dealing damage, or using some spells or abilities. Random enemies will almost always be one hit by these abilities. Bosses however, can usually take well above 4 of these abilities to kill, which means that you can't just enter a fight and murder the bosses by using each characters S break (parties have a maximum of 4 units with a further 2 on standby). The battles feel epic, and though you get into a routine after you have worked out what to do in each battle (for example have main character use normal attacks, one person heal, one person buff and another using attack abilities or something to this effect) you will often have to change this up. Maybe a character gets KO'd or you take a bit more damage or you get a status effect or the enemy is using a stronger aoe ability. Boss battles are engaging and have you of the edge of your seat. You can't switch off your brain or you will lose. You almost always feel like an underdog against a boss, but they are always possible to win.\n\nStory: Exactly the same problem as Trails in the Sky: There is a fuckton of dialogue, but that doesnt amount to a fuckton of story. Everyone talks so GODDAM MUCH, and very very little of it matters. I get that the designers want to create a world, but for goddsake, learn to show and not tell. It's the weakest part of the game BY FAR. The actual story is decent, it is just surrounded by so much bullshit that I can't find myself caring. Spend 20 minutes talking to everyone about who gives a shit what, and that 20 mins can by summarised by \"there are bad people. stop the bad people.\" Really, the story isn't that bad, but the STORYTELLING is really awful.\n\nGame flow: I don't really know what to call this. What I mean is that the game's chapters follow the exact same formula. Do missions around the school > Investigate old school (battle enemies) > Do teachers exam battle > Go on a train for a field trip > Do missions at new place > Beat a boss > Do more Missions at same place > have a section that is related to the story in the new place, usually ending in a terrorist fight > go back to school > repeat. \n\nIf this had happened once or twice it would be okay, but it happens every time. it just makes the formula for the story of the game so plain, which adds to why the story is the weakest part.\n\nMusic: Increible. Gets you hyped. Makes battles feel fun and engaging. You will find yourself humming it.\n\nCharacter/Party Customisation: Very good. Every character has a role that is assigned by the devs: eg Luara is a high damage character, Fie is the fast one, Emma is the damage mage, etc. However, you can play any character however you want (to a degree). If you equip a character with the right spells, equipment, and base magic ability 'orbment', you can passably play any character how you want. You can afford to play a character sub optimally, because the spells that everyone can use cover for glaring weaknesses.\n\nCharacters: They are interesting and likeable. You can form bonds that give you bonuses like in Persona. You can form links in battle that do things like let your partner attack if you crit an enemy. They all feel unique and their skills match who they are. They 'show don't tell' much better with the characters than the rest of the story, and it pays off well.\n\n'Side missions': There are a lot of optional side missions that are literally just go to point A, talk to someone, go to point B, talk, Point A, Point C, point A, mission complete. They suck. I used a guide to get through them. As I said earlier, the game has a dialogue fetish. It wants to build the world, but this is a piss poor way of doing it. Combat missions are better 100% of the time. Combat missions are more engaging 100% of the time.\n\nEven worse, there are special 'hidden missions'. you get these by 'stumbling across the right person at the right time'. By that, I mean you follow a guide to find them, because it could literally be a little girl in the middle of a kitchen in an army base that you literally never need to go into. That mission was another 'go to point A then B then A then B then A'. If you don't do these hidden missions, even if they are a waste of time, you can't get an S rank for the chapter. If they werent in the game, the game would be better, because you get rewards based on your ranking for the chapter, so you want to do them.\n\nOverall: I would say the combat carries this game, but it doesnt need to. There is more than enough good, and the combat just adds to it. I have said a lot of negatives here, but that's because other reviews will focus on the positives. The Combat is great. The world is great. The storytelling sucks ass, and the formula of the game is glaringly obvious. It's not a bad formula, but it would be better if it was shaken up more. This game is interesting, there are parts of the story that are awesome and keep you playing.

Some mechanics and quartz work inconsistently (e.g Detect quartz not working on Aurochs Canyon Path 3).  Combat links just being constantly severed (not due to enemy advantage) and character disappearing with my quartz and items.. just annoying. Other RPGs simply handle all these better.

If you love ( espscially classic ) JRPG ( or anime in general, while we are at it ), then I fully recommend this game", "timestamp_created": 1511776849, "timestamp_updated": 1511777614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37762290": {"recommendationid": "37762290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982415508", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511711051}, "language": "english", "review": "I've Been waiting", "timestamp_created": 1511774109, "timestamp_updated": 1511774109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506394", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37753810": {"recommendationid": "37753810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060932732", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 7790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1514022938}, "language": "english", "review": "The Golden Age of J-RPGs has ended. No longer can we expect to see a plethora of J-RPGs coming every year. This time has come and past, and some people do not hesitate to state that J-RPG, as a genre, is dead. Do I agree? Not quite. While it is true that the genre is less represented than before, some developers are hell-bent to keep making this type of game, and they can be divided in two categories. Those that keep trying to make the genre evolve, like Square-Enix, and those that focus on the core aspects, like all the J-RPGs made with RPG-maker that strive to recreate that nostalgic feeling of the SNES era.\n\nIf I were to put Falcom in one of these two categories, it would definitely be in the second one, with the interesting particularity that it's a relatively big studio, which means they can afford to be more ambitious, graphically speaking, than little indie devs. This means that what they do, is keep making J-RPGs with a PS1/PS2/Dreamcast vibe. Unlike Square, they don't focus on beautiful graphics and real-time action, no, they put their focus on what they've done well for the past decade : writing, music, and turn-based combat design.\n\nWhy all these info, why not speak about the game directly? Well, because if you're a fan of good J-RPGs of the PS1/PS2/Dreamcast era, I'm sure you already frantically installed this game to see what all these good reviews are all about. And if you're not in that category, then I hope it will allow you to know what to expect, more than detailing the strengths and weaknesses of Trails of Cold Steel.\n\nSome people like to point out how everything in Cold Steel feels generic and already seen. I won't argue, but I want to point out that while Falcom does heavily use tropes and clich\u00e9s, such as child-characters, a school-setting in Cold Steel 1, and things like that...they use them in the right way : not as the \"be all end all\" of an idea, but as the starting point for writing it and giving it an interesting swing. This is what makes the characters lovable, the world believable, and the story interesting.\n\nFinally, I want to put some perspective about this game. It's part of The Legend of Heroes series, comprised of J-RPGs that are set in the same universe, but are separated in arcs of 2 to 4 games. Each arc takes places in a different country of the main continent, and they are only separated by a couple years, or take place at the same time. As of now, there are three arcs : the Trails in the Sky arc, the Ao/Zero arc, and the Trails of Cold Steel are. The Sky arc has two games plus one side-story and is available on Steam, the Ao/Zero is not officially translated unfortunately (yet!), and Trails of Cold Steel will have four games, this one, the second should come out on Steam early 2018, the third one is out in Japan (count roughly 1-3 years for the translation), and the fourth one is in development. Falcom has also stated that they plan to do a fourth arc in the future.\n\nThis means that The Legend of Heroes, for how generic its name feels, is in fact the sole J-RPG series with so many games set in the same universe and that take place roughly at the same time. And Falcom does intend to keep making these games. Of course, if all the games are bad, or of diverse quality, it would not be that interesting, but Cold Steel 1 is considered one of the weakest entry in the series, a sentiment I kinda share, and it's still a damn awesome game.\n\nFor a J-RPG fan, this is something to follow : a whole ongoing series with an excellent average quality, that even at its lowest is still superior than the majority of the genre. So, is the J-RPG genre dead? Actually no, it may not be as flamboyant as before, but it's still very alive and kicking.

I can say with confidence that is one of the best ones I have ever played. There are quite a few things that they did correctly in this game, and there are just a few things that I would like to see changed.\n \nPros:\n\nCombat \n- Classic turn based but they keep the abilities and the mechanics interesting enough that it does not get stale.\n\nCharacters \n- Most of the characters have been fun and interesting to listen to. I find myself waiting for the next playthrough \nso i can engage in different bonding events to learn about different characters. \n\nStory \n- I am only on Chapter 3 but thus far the story and world are interesting, lots of mystery surrounding every character so far and still lots more to discover in the world.\n\nTurbo\n- I never played original but apparently this was not in it. Turbo makes traversing the maps so much faster, great idea\n\nDifficulty\n- Rare to see a genuine difficulty setting in many JRPG games from a couple years ago but it exists here. It is very difficult to out level your opponents and combat can always surprise you with a butt kicking. Although I have never recieved a Game Over on normal difficulty I have come close and that is a great feeling.\n\nPlay Time\n- 80 hours of good story for $30, yes please.I say 80 hours because that what I should average in a playthrough since I am purposely opening all chests and talking to all npcs.\n\nCons:\n\nIts a small thing but I would like to the costumes unlock after they are used in game rather than on new game+ The entire first playthrough you are stuck in the uniforms which the main character simply does not look that great in. \n\nThe repetitive nature of the field studies is starting to show. As I said I am only on chapter 3 but having repeated essentially the same exact process 3 times in a row just in different places is a bit strange. I have a feeling this is not going to be this way for long.  \n\nIf you want to complete 100% for any of the completionists out there, get ready to look up a guide.

I'd played Fallout and Skyrim and a few of its contemporaries, but no RPG seemed to scratch my itch. Then, I watched a video by Mother's Basement  ( [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaN2G-AEd9Q] linked here [/url] ) in which he described his love for Japanese developer Nihon Falcom and their incredible ability do build incredible worlds. \n\nI decided to pick up Trails of Cold Steel and Trails in the Sky not long afterward. I absolutely fell in love with this game from its Cold Opening (Pun intended) to its thrilling conclusion and every single moment in between. If you are like me and didn't play Trails in the Sky beforehand, the combat doesn't seem too complicated. If you have, you'll be rewarded with not only a similar combat system, but an improved one that has ties directly in with the lore of the Zemurian continent.\n\nThe characters, both playable and non-playable are fantastically written, the music is spectacular, and the voice acting is amazing.

combat is a fairly customizeable turn based combat system. You equip different Jewels to different party members in order to obtain different spells. Each character also has their own individual skills that can be used aside from spells along with skills that are sort of like limit breaks from the FF series.\n\nStory: The story starts off slow and becomes better and better leading up to a major cliff hanger at the end of the game. You start off as a student who is learning at a military academy who has to overcome many hurdles with his new classmates from different social statuses and forge bonds with them along the way.

sorpresa era una saga con bastante historia y acabo de entrar con este juego , no es necesario jugar los anteriores para entender , pero si para contextualizar mucho mejor y entender rapido algunos terminos , pero en este tambien te explican los terminos.\n-A nivel narrativo esta super bien llevado , es interesante y las conversaciones aunque triviales son bastante llevaderas y entretenidas , los personajes se sienten y son algo , pareciera que todo tubiera vida los pueblos la gente , me sorprendio bastante , aunque su apartado grafico deja bastante que desear con unos modelados en 3D que son sacados del 2005 -2006 , pero a nivel Artistico es bastante bueno , es algo generico pero de cierta forma logra destacar .\nA nivel de gameplay es muy entretenido , tiene una mecanica de combate por turnos super dinamica y estrategica , aunque algunas veces algo injusta y poco compensada , almenos esto le suma un reto al juego y se hace satisfactoria una victoria contra algun jefe .\nLa musica es algo extra\u00f1a me recuerda como a un rpg clasico japones pero con tintes semimodernos .. nose como explicarlo pero es bastante unico y muy bueno , 0 quejas en este apartado me parece todo muy correcto .\nen resumen es un excelente juego lo recomiendo a cualquiera que le encantes nos los rpg sea o no sean por turnos . \n", "timestamp_created": 1511415329, "timestamp_updated":

it), and the PC port of this game fixes all of the technical problems that I had with the game.\n\nToCS is a great JRPG in a time when I'm finding my patience stretched thin by other JRPGs like World of Final Fantasy or the latest Pokemon generation. The story is quite slow-paced, but my opinion is that this works to the benefit of the game; the worldbuilding and unexpected depth of interaction with the numerous NPCs sets the stage properly for its sequels, but also tells a story of learning to work with others, even if at first glance, you find nothing in common or nothing likable. Despite its slow pacing, I don't think that ToCS wastes my time unnecessarily. You can choose how much you want to play, since the majority of quests are optional, and story-related mandatory quests interesting.\n\nThe core gameplay involves moving around a world filled with NPCs that each have their own stories to tell, in the midst of a growing national crisis. Combat is turn-based, but it is my favourite turn-based combat system to date, staying simple to understand at a basic level, but providing a great deal of tactical depth and satisfaction when fighting the wide range of boss fights.\n\nAs for the quality of the PC port, XSEED did a wonderful job of improving upon the original in terms of performance (basically no FPS stutters like in the original PS Vita version), and adding additional voiced lines for the protagonist, Rean, who had several scenes without voice-over when others did. The new Fast-Forward feature is also a welcome edition, especially since I was replaying the game, which saved me a lot of time in the story cutscenes and combat animations that I didn't need to see again.\n\nAs a final note, there is a method of replacing the voice-over audio with the original Japanese audio, if you have a preference for it.", "timestamp_created": 1511397304, "timestamp_updated": 1511397530, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676057", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36869959": {"recommendationid": "36869959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101480164", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510514672}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u95ea2\u8d76\u7d27\u6765\u5427\uff0c\u6211\u771f\u662f\u6015\u6211\u5fcd\u4e0d\u4f4f\u4f18\u9177\u901a\u5173\u4e86~", "timestamp_created": 1511396591, "timestamp_updated": 1511396591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36864235": {"recommendationid": "36864235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003338530", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509873597}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, characters have their own personalities and stories that you can discover, many things to do and encourages you to talk to all npcs every time you change phase.", "timestamp_created": 1511395232, "timestamp_updated": 1511395232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36860547": {"recommendationid": "36860547", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081043582", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506462732}, "language": "english", "review": "XSeed have done a phenomenal job with this port, especially with the addition of turbo mode.

Each school trip was its own unique and quite detailed map and you explored different sections of the world of trails of cold steel. Quests and tasks were all unique in there own way you never really found you were doing the same thing twice, you could be fighting monsters, delivering books, or looking for loot and still be having fun.

However, before I go on with giving a decent recommendation let me first preface and say most of the negative things you hear about this game are true. The game really develops at a slow pace, this is undeniable however if you consider this is the first in a four game series it is understandable. The voice acting is generally terrible, and there is no option to my knowledge to switch to Japanese language with English subtitles. Lastly the game doesn\u2019t do anything incredibly unique in terms of mechanics making it rather unsurprising in terms of game play. \n\nThat out of the way I was never once bothered by the lack of originality of game play mechanics, what is offered is what I expected and I didn\u2019t feel that it detracted from the overall game. The story is unique, the characters are compelling, and the world feels sufficiently fleshed out to where I never felt like a dissonant element was introduced that broke my experience. In fact I was so absorbed in the world the developers created I played the game three more times just to ensure I got to see everything that is offered. The DLC\u2019s offered are completely optional and are primarily just cosmetics minus some low priced game play boosts such as money, crafting material and some accessories. Most of which can be achieved through normal game play or multiple playthroughs. \n\nAnyway, I highly recommend Trails of Cold Steel to anyone that wants to play a solid JRPG and can handle bad voice acting. \n", "timestamp_created": 1511381754, "timestamp_updated": 1511381754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36762988": {"recommendationid": "36762988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268945764", "num_games_owned": 1655, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 11815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511977923}, "language": "english", "review": "Trails of Cold Steel became my favorite Falcom game, both 1 and 2 are simply wonderful!

Die Story ist noch weit entfernt davon, beendet zu sein, aber Junge, es war ein angenehmer Ritt. Sicher, vieles war vorhersehbar, aber im Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen war alles mit viel Liebe zum Detail erzeugt. Die Grafik mag nicht die beste sein, denn hey, es ist original ja ein PS Vita-Game, aber es ist trotzdem verdammt gut. Viele Cutscenes, viele abwechslungsreiche Gebiete, die zwar an sich klein ausfallen, daf\u00fcr aber anst\u00e4ndig designt wurden. Selbst riesige R\u00fcckwege spart man sich oftmals, weil man kurzerhand an die Hand genommen wird - das sorgt f\u00fcr ein umso stimmigeres Design, bei dem genau eines stets dominiert: Die Story. Und auch wenn sie am Ende durchaus fantastischere Z\u00fcge annimmt, hat sie mir dennoch sehr gut gefallen.\nDas Kampfdesign ist gut und macht auf jeden Fall laune, kann manchmal vielleicht etwas fitzelig und verwirrend ausfallen, aber das ist vermutlich dann eher meine pers\u00f6nliche Ansicht. Die Vertonung ist echt gut und man hat bei diesem Port auch das Gef\u00fchl, dass man die Sache anst\u00e4ndig machen wollte.\n\nBl\u00f6d nur: es wird auf einem Cliffhanger enden, der erst mit dem zweiten und dritten Titel dieser Reihe erz\u00e4hlt wird.

I have played through all of the games in the trails series now, except ao no kiseki because there is no fan translation yet. After playing this game on the vita back in 2012 when it first came to america, it changed my life lol. Not even exaggerating. I have played this game 4 times and am currently in the middle of my 5th on the pc. I have bought this game 4 times, 2 for friends and two for myself lol. If you are at ALL curious, buy this game. The STORY AND MUSIC ARE GODLIKE. You get to know the characters and the world and you become really attached to the world. Not just  in this game, the rest of trails series make it even better. I love this series so much I bought the trails of cold steel 3, WHICH IS ONLY IN JAPANESE AT THE MOMENT, and played through it without knowing a lick of japanese and it was awesome. Will be buying the collectors edition again in english. Seriously, Falcom is my favorite gaming company ever, and XSEED are fantastic at localizing. I will keep throwing my money at them. I am so happy this game is going on pc for more to enjoy.  I hope this review will atleast get you to try it, the game probably isn't for everyone, but for me and many others this series is our treasure.", "timestamp_created": 1510787166, "timestamp_updated": 1510787344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595318", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36536179": {"recommendationid": "36536179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008361784", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512678963}, "language": "turkish", "review": "seslendirme harici idare eder", "timestamp_created": 1510768787, "timestamp_updated": 1511375615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36535361": {"recommendationid": "36535361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198436195998", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510850207}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8ddf\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5957\u8def\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u7565\u611f\u65b0\u5947\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u671f\u5f85\u95ea2\u4e0asteam", "timestamp_created": 1510765786, "timestamp_updated": 1510765786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36528123": {"recommendationid": "36528123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086914181", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510739220}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ec8\u4e8e\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u8fbe\u6210\u4e86\uff0c\u5b8c\u7ed3\u6492\u82b1~ \u53ef\u662f\u6211\u8981\u53bb\u54ea\u91cc\u73a9\u95ea2\u554a\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1510739256, "timestamp_updated": 1511486479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36522826": {"recommendationid": "36522826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399046121", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510401744}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u95ea\u4e4b\u8f68\u8ff9[strike]tls[/strike]\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00", "timestamp_created": 1510711104, "timestamp_updated": 1510711104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36513121": {"recommendationid": "36513121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297219084", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 409, "last_played": 1514703164}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6240\u4ee5\u8bf4\u95ea2\u5927\u6982\u5565\u65f6\u5019\u4e0asbeam\u554a", "timestamp_created": 1510671882, "timestamp_updated": 1512306059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36506442": {"recommendationid": "36506442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086047337", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 4317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510641131}, "language": "english", "review": "... 70 Hours later and im pissed that the second game is not out yet.

This entry is pretty much comparable to Trails in the Sky First Chapter scenario wise.  Its made as the first part of a duology and is mainly there to invest you in the characters and world and build up the conflict that'll see itself sprung into the forefront with its upcoming sequel.\n\nIt does what the series does so well in making a world full of character and the NPC's feel like characters with substantial growth by endgame!  While I do think the characters are stronger in the Liberl arc, the characters in Cold Steel are still an extremely loveable cast!  And with the way this game ends...you'll definitely wanna pick up its upcoming sequel to finish this story off (well at least until we get Cold Steel 3 that is ;) ;) ;) )\n\nThe soundtrack is great as per usual Falcom.  Atrocious Raid and Eliminate Crisis still get my blood pumping years after the games debut!\n\nAlso wanna just say XSEED put a LOT of love into this PC port as it looks absolutely PHENOMENAL!  The addition of the fast forward looks like its gonna help a lot with my playthrough as well.  And while I havent played the game entirely through on my PC (Just long enough to make sure it runs on my very basic non-gaming pc... and it does... very well ;) ), the improvements over the PS3 version are extremely noticeable, so kudos to them :)\n", "timestamp_created": 1509789680, "timestamp_updated": 1509789680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36237055": {"recommendationid": "36237055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346855082", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506511030}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u989d\uff0c\u7a81\u7136\u60f3\u8d77\u6765\u95ea\u8f68\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8fd8\u6ca1\u5199\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u62bd\u7a7a\u968f\u4fbf\u5199\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u90fd\u90a3\u4e48\u4e45\u4e86\u3002\u989d\uff0c\u6b63\u5e38\u6e38\u73a9\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u9700\u898170\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u8db3\u7684\u3002\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\u7684\u662fpc\u4e0a\u52a0\u8f7d\u5c31\u662f\u5feb\u554a\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u522b\u4eba\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b9d\u77f3V\u5728\u8349\u539f\u7279\u522b\u96be\u53d7\uff0cpc\u4e0a\u5c31\u6ca1\u8fd9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4f5c\u5730\u56fe\u53d8\u5927\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u611f\u89c9\u5176\u5b9e\u5185\u5bb9\u6ca1\u53d8\u591a\uff0c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cfb\u5217\u7c89\u4e1d\u80af\u5b9a\u65e9\u5c31\u73a9\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u5c31\u4e0d\u591a\u8bf4\u4e86\u3002\u60f3\u5410\u69fd\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u5c31\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u611f\u89c9\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u50cfgal\u4e86\u5462\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6536\u96c6\u662f\u771f\u7684\u70e6\uff0c\u60f3\u767d\u91d1\u4e0d\u67e5\u653b\u7565\u7684\u8bdd\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u6076\u5fc3\u7684\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1509700084, "timestamp_updated": 1509700084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36228270": {"recommendationid": "36228270", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986874667", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509318260}, "language": "english", "review": "So, I put in about over 140 hours into this game, and also did a second playthrough. As a guy who played the original trilogy (this includes the 3rd and final installment which happened to have been a dungeon crawler more than a JRPG), I think I can give a pretty well rounded review of the game mechanics as compared to the previous games, the story, the characters and etc.\n\n1) So, let's talk about the game mechanics. It follows the same basic premise of the battle system found in Trails of the Sky, except it's a bit more robust. They've added linked attacks which weren't present in the original trilogy, as well as more robust magic system (which is nice). So, I definitely enjoyed the upgrade battle system a lot.\n\nWhat really bored me was the school setting, because you're pretty much boxed into the main town Trista. You're also forced to interact with the same characters, same NPCs and same environments over and over and over - and it can get rather dull and redundant at times. I also didn't like the quizzes sprinkled throughout the game. I don't like to be quizzed about a game's lore. That annoys me.\n\n2) Now, let's talk about the graphics and environments. Well... The graphics are a bit better than the TotS trilogy, but of course, it's a port from a PSP game (I hear it's also on the PS3), so the graphics aren't exactly going to wow you. They did add a nice distance blur effect, which adds dimension to the environments, but that's about it. Many of the characters (or all of them) have very low poly counts, so you'll notice they look very blocky - especially up close. \n\nUnlike the previous games (I really should just say chapter one and chapter two of TotS), there's not a lot of environment to explore. You're first introduced to a town called Trista, but after you've explored everything about that town, you're kinda forced to get familiar with that town all the way up to the very end. Of course you visit other towns, but only small selected areas of those towns, and even then, when going to towns like Heimdallr, there are districts you can go to, but some districts are really very very linear, and you can only travel so far. It's not like the previous games where you could walk from one town to the other. When you go to a town, you're forced to finish off a list of quests before you can go off to the next one. Someone could argue that it was kinda the same way with chapter one and two of TotS, but at least I could walk from one town to the next without having to watch a cut scene each and every single time I traveled to a town.\n\n3) How about the story and character development? Well, many of us (I'm sure) enjoy watching anime, and I'm no exception. This game follows behind the typical school setting of most anime out there. So, in regard to the setting in which the game takes place, it's very cliched. The story, of course, follows behind a kid named Rean Schwarzer who goes to a prestigious military academy. From there, he goes through field studies and gets thrust into various circumstances dealing with terrorists, rebellions and eventually a [spoiler]civil war[/spoiler]. (I'm trying not to spoil anything). \n\nPeople say the story is great, but I think it's pretty meh - at least up until the very last chapter. Then the game turns on its head and becomes one of the best moments I've played through. I think that may have a lot to do with the pacing. The story goes very very slow. In this game, it really just feels like they're preparing you for the meat and potatoes in ToCS II & III. So, in other words, it feels like a prequel of sorts until you play the _actual_ game and jump into the main crux of the story.\n\nThe game does make many references to the previous trilogy. It'll also bring up names and titles of characters from the previous game, and if you haven't played those games, you will be completely lost. I.E. The Enforcers or who Cassius Bright is. I have to admit, after playing through the previous trilogy, seeing \"Olivert\" playing his role as a prince did seem rather awkward (play the previous games to understand why).\n\nThe characters themselves are actually interesting, and each one has their own personality quirks. The dialog between them is quite fluid, but there are times when they discuss things unrelated to the main story that becomes rather boring. Often times I wondered what some of the dialog had to do with even developing their characters, but I digress.\n\n4) So, here is my final verdict. It's a real good game and worth the purchase. Not a perfect game, mind you, but it's a solid JRPG and I can't wait until the sequel is available on Steam.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1509661594, "timestamp_updated": 1509661594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36222411": {"recommendationid": "36222411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008759286", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509825755}, "language": "english", "review": "As usual Legend of Heroes series never disappointed me. 9.5/10 recommended", "timestamp_created": 1509643571, "timestamp_updated": 1509643571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36205958": {"recommendationid": "36205958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322970683", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 22713, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512443654}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great.

Well, I was wrong.  Color me impressed with the outstanding effort given to localization, optimization, and straight up porting efforts by the team assigned to port this.  I read their blog and was surprised by how much thought they put into porting this over to the PC, with the addition thought of properly localizing this huge piece of work.\n\nAside from that, I love the gameplay.  I never thought I'd sink a significant amount of time into a JRPG ever again, but here we are.  It's fairly linear (don't expect to wander around too much) in terms of map design and direction, so don't expect to get lost (which is a good thing).  Gameplay is deep, and there's so many mechanics in play that you could get stomped in a boss fight if you never take advantage of any of them, while sweeping the floor in as little as 5 turns if you do take full use of them.\n\nOther thoughts\u2014The story is great.  It starts off reaaally slow, then suddenly gets me stoked for every chapter as soon as the pace picks up.  And another fun thing: You end up caring about the NPCs.  Never in a game have I chatted up every NPC to see what's going on after every story event.  They all have names, and even crazier, they have character bios!\n\nAnyway, be prepared to sink tons of hour into this puppy.

game. I love Turn-based JRPGs so this game was a natural pick-up for me. I hadn't heard of the series before nor had I played any prior installments and yet I had no trouble learning about (and getting immersed in) the world this game is set in. Sure the plot has some cliches here and there (Hero boy has some special unique power, he happens to be in the right place at the right time throughout the story and other such tropes) but they're completely offset, in my opinion, by the way the game pushes into the player into the situations and if that's not enough for you then the plot twists will definitely re-engage your interest in the plot. The world is an enjoyable one and if you're a nerd for lore like I am then you'll find you've spent far too much time in this game reading books about the history of the world or talking to sub-characters to squueze out any information you can.\n\nThe Characters for the most part are all very likeable and have their reasons for acting the way they do, some secretive about their past/families, others outright hostile to certain individuals through beliefs they hold which have never really been challenged by those around them, only enforced. The only character I didn't like from the main cast was Emma, she felt very bland backstory-wise through most of the game and even when other characters started to open up or give individuals a chance she only really dropped hints about herself (until the end where she half-reveals her past) and I can only assume that she will give us the full story in the sequel.\n\nThe battle system, whilst not revolutionary, was overall enjoyable. Being able to custom tailor your characters via quartz' was certainly a system that allowed you to feel like the characters were yours and not preset into roles (to an extent) like so many other JRPGs. Whether it be switching Master Quartz' to change a characters playstyle somewhat drastically or switching up the regular Quartz' to fine tune your characters and their ablilties/stats made each decision feel like it had an impact upon your characters, a minor one at first but as the quartz' got more powerful the choices of what to equip became harder. The characters unique abilities all felt good to use in battle and all served certain purposes whether it be knocking back enemies so that you could survive another turn, an AoE to quickly clear out weak/low hp enemies or to heal your whole team. This made party composition quite important and made you have to choose carefully about who you brought into battle (when you're given the opportunity to choose who you can have).\n\nFinally, the waifus (or husbandos for those so inclined). As I mentioned prevoiusly the characters all (bar one) have interesting and enjoyable personalities and have multiple layers to them which makes improving your relationships with them all the more rewarding. At the end of the game you get to make a choice of who to spend the festival with. You can pick from pretty much any of the major characters and a few of the sub-characters (assuming you've achieved the pre-requisites) and you get a nice heart-to-heart scene from the characters (no love confessions, just good quality bonding time). Alisa is the obvious choice for this as she is the girl that the plot pushes towards you but there are so many options that you shouldn't need to go for her out of obligation (saving before the festival can allow you to experience a few of the heart-to-heart scenes if you want to try a few out). My personal favourite is Sara Valestine, the alcoholic teacher but I'l llet you decide your waifu (or husbando) for yourself.\n\nI get that with this review I'm pretty much just preaching to the choir as most likely only fans of the game will see it, but, if you're thinking of buying this game and are looking through reviews beforehand then I strongly recommend buying and completing this game.\n\nSubjectively I'd give this game a 9/10\nObjectively it's more of a 7-8/10 \nBut in the end only you know what you like so I can only hope you enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1508096875, "timestamp_updated": 1511580185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418109", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35753775": {"recommendationid": "35753775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084473158", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508398728}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6b21\u95ea\u8f68\u7684\u79fb\u690d\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u951960\u94881080p\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5916\u52a0\u51e0\u4e4e\u770b\u4e0d\u89c1\u952f\u9f7f\uff0c\u8865\u7968\uff0c\u53e6\u5916\u671f\u5f85\u95ea\u8f682", "timestamp_created": 1508088620, "timestamp_updated": 1508088620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511294", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35740084": {"recommendationid": "35740084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040692455", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509430978}, "language": "english", "review": "buy and support this awesome game end of review", "timestamp_created": 1508053593, "timestamp_updated": 1508053593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35732397": {"recommendationid": "35732397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042235907", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508095344}, "language": "german", "review": "It's a really good port and a lovely game.

As a part of The Legend of Heroes series, it was first released for the PS3 and PS Vita September 2013. English version is later released at the end of 2015. Followed by PC port in late 2017. The game sets in the same universe of that of famous Trails of the Sky series.\n\nThe quality of PC port is on the top form. With introduce many of PC exclusive features such as a built-in turbo mode, auto save etc. There's little to no bug or crash at all.\n\nThe game is set in the Erebonian Empire. Rean Schwarzer, the 17 years old who enrolls at Thors Military Academy and a main character of this game, find himself in the military-powered Erebonian Empire struggles with its internal conflict, the upper class and commoners attempting to rise to power both militarily and politically, their struggle for power steadily intensifies with each passing day. Rean, himself will soon learn all these experiences throughout the new class program invested by The Thors Military Academy called Class VII, where in this very class, rank means nothing but skill means everything. Rean's adventure along with Class VII's nine hand-picked students from various backgrounds and different class, begin through the political quagmire that threatens them and the very foundation of the Empire itself. \n\nThough not only they have to face the country problem, but as well as their own flaws. These students will find themselves having to come up with own resolve and moving forward together into big elegant yet unknown world, and surviving together out there.\n\nIn Trails of Cold Steel, the player controls a cast of characters, embarking on a number of quests to progress the story.  There are two different type of maps when navigating in the overworld of the game: field maps(dungeon) and town maps. In field maps, enemies roam around and a battle ensues if the player comes in contact with one. In town maps, the player can visit various shops to purchase items, replenish health at an inn and, for the major cities, take on and report quests to the client. In addition, the player can interact with numerous non-playable characters (NPCs) in the game. The unique aspect things in the legend of heroes series is that each NPC's dialogue changes as the game advances, allowing the player to follow along sidestories that accompany the NPCs throughout the game, making a world itself feel much more lively.\n\nIn addition to typical RPG standard gameplay like exploring town and dungeon. The game also brings in the school life element into Cold Steel. Which mean not only they'll be making a journey throughout the land, the students will also be attending in classroom, and have to study various subject much like school life, and hang out with other friends in campus as to learn more about them and strengthen the bond with them. School will be considered as the main base where characters will find themselves hanging around most of the time.\n\nCombat in Cold Steel takes place on an small open battlefield turn-based, where your characters can move freely within their moving range assuming that it's their turn. During the character's turn, the player can move or make an attack. Each character also have three other methods available for attack/support: Arts, Crafts, and S-Crafts. Arts are kind of action involving magic spells that characters can use to attack opponents or support teammates but must take an additional turn to cast as well as using EP as a cost. Crafts are character individual abilities that are similar to Arts but can be used in the same turn; however, they utilize a special gauge called \"Craft Points\" (CP) for the cost to perform. S-Crafts are powered-up Crafts that can be performed once a character has over 100CP but completely depletes the CP gauge upon using it. Further extending S-Crafts are S-Breaks which allows characters to immediately perform an S-Craft regardless of when their turn order is.\n\nThe \"Tactical Link System\" also introduced in this game, which allow players to follow up with three different kinds of link attacks, dealing additional damage and providing various other benefits. Tactical Links becomes a more useful asset to the player as the story progress and characters level up their \"Link Levels\" or \"Bond\" with other characters.

I also felt the NPC stories and such were much less developed and lacking compared to FC and SC, and overall the repetitive nature of the school trips / anime school structure of the gameplay dragged on too long. I hope the second game shakes that formula up the way the ending seems to hint at.\n\nCombat was still the least interesting bit of the game, honestly, and the fact that the player knows more at this point (if they've played the previous Trails games) about what's going on in Zemuria than the main characters makes it frustrating that so little new info or significant development on that point happens in the plot here until literally the final few minutes.\n\nOverall, I have to say this is my least favorite of the Trails games so far, though I'll give the second Steel game a try before I decide whether the series has really jumped the shark for me or not. \n\nFor folks invested in the story since FC/SC/3rd, Steel will not build on much of what those games have laid as a story foundation. I'd almost recommend waiting for all 3 of Steel's games to be released before playing them (as maybe together they will progress the story more significantly than just this one does).", "timestamp_created": 1506527959, "timestamp_updated": 1506550149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35237118": {"recommendationid": "35237118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328718642", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508506566}, "language": "english", "review": "i cant even start the game, and i try almost everything, can someone tell me what can i do?", "timestamp_created": 1506496549, "timestamp_updated": 1506496549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35227154": {"recommendationid": "35227154", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966117425", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506459051}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2665", "timestamp_created": 1506449601, "timestamp_updated": 1506449601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35226707": {"recommendationid": "35226707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037443464", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512227105}, "language": "english", "review": "Literally the game I enjoyed the most on Steam.

Other than some small changes to orbments, arts, and extra in-battle mechanics, it's pretty much the same as in TS.\nMusic is top notch and matches the scenes pretty well, although I noticed they reused a couple tracks from the TS series (might be a reaccuring theme, I dont really know).\nThere is a configuration panel at the very beginning before you start the game which really helps out with optimization and detailing its \"speed up\" feature.\n\nFor 90% of the game, the storytelling is on point. The areas you visit, the characters, the world all feel pretty real and connected. The world itself is the same as in TS and seems to take place a couple years after the end of that series, so they make a couple nice cameos to some previous TS characters. The main characters feel pretty complex. None of them are 2D and I eventually end up liking them all despite hating a couple at the beginning. Although a lot of the side characters suffer as a result, but that's fine in my book. My only complaint with the story is how abruptly it turns 180 near the end, as if the writers wanted the big reveal to be the biggest plot twist they could possibly make with as little connection to the rest of the story (at least not in this game). \n\nThe biggest con I can think of right now is that, being a JRPG, there's a huge number of completely hidden side quests and hidden requirements for certain achievements that are literally impossible to find without a detailed guide (unless you scour all the areas throughly after each event and listen closely to every detail). Some of them are so obscure that they dont register as a quest even when you officially start it, and will only tell you about it after you complete it. Granted, this is nothing new in JRPGs and for anyone who isnt a completionist, it shouldnt really matter in the end.\n\nAnother thing I hated from the very beginning was the English Dub and the fact that there is no option for Japanese Dub. Luckily you can turn off all voices, which is what I was used to from the TS series so that was quickly resolved. \n\nIn the end, this is a great JRPG that is excellent in most of its presentation.

Legend of Heros exists since the late 80s, but it never gathered much of a following in the West. Gladly, XSEED has done an excellent job with the localization of the Kiseki series, so the following is starting to gather up!\n\nAbout this game especifically, I absolutely recommend it. There are a lot of JRPGs out there that follow an anime-esque storyline, but few write them as engaging and with so compeling characters as Nihon Falcom did with this game and its sequel. The story is great, you CARE for your companions and for the political situation of Erebonia and its people. Even NPCs are compelling.\n\nGameplay is also great (even if a little dated).\n\nOn the \"negative\" side, the game is LONG (prepare to stay with it for around 80 to 90 hours), it starts very slow (be patient, it's worth it! Every good book starts developing slowly) and some main quests can drag. \n\nNothing to make me dislike this game at any front.

I have about 80 hours clocked in on the ps3.\nWhat can i say? I buy very few games on retail price even less so when i already own them on another platform, but this game is truly something else.\nIn a world littered with flashy rpgs like Final Fantasy's which prefer style over substance, this game truly stands out above them all. Not just this but the entire Legend of Heroes series, though talking about them all would derail this review.\nWhat this game shines at, is its world building, the story takes time to unfold, you are gradually filled in how this fantasy world works.\nYou have a stellar cast of characters. None of them feel like placeholders, each person, each supporting character has a unique story and background defining them. \nThe characters traits may look cliched but when executed perfectly they shine through and through.\nYou get to live a school life not entirely dissimilar to Persona, you do quests, you go out exploring the world, you get entangled in political and civil unrest, explore the country of Erebonia and its heirarchy system, uncover a dark conspiracy, trust me, by the time you're done you'll be left wanting for more, which is a good thing cuz the sequel will be coming to pc in 2018.\nPlus the pc version is THE definitive version. Upgraded graphics (I seriously love the effort they put in the launcher, each option shows you a screenshot of what effect it has on the game) , turbo mode allowing you to fast forward cutscenes and battles (Wouldnt recommend doing the former) and about 5000 extra voiced lines exclusive for the pc version.\nNo japanese audio though, but the falcom server on discord has an unofficial japanese audio patch with instructions that you can use. Though personally I dont need it cuz the english voice cast is amazing!\nAll in all, a solid 11/10 . Highly recommended game!\n\nUPDATE: There are several other dlc costumes locked in the game. However there is no way to get them legally since probably XSEED couldnt acquire the licenses for them. Those files are lying dormant in the game. \nThe only way I have found to obtain them is on the pirated version with the 'dlc unlocker' . It can net you 5 extra costume sets namely  'Jenis Uniform, Reverse Uniform, Black Uniform, Mishy Uniform, and Lawson Uniform' They are simple recolors of the standard uniform and are fully translated too.\nIf you love to support XSEED like me yet still want those costumes, do what I did. Use the dlc unlocker on the pirated version and get to the Old Schoolhouse at the beginning, at which point, redeem all the dlcs from the dlc tab to add them in your inventory and then save. Now use this save with the steam version and those costumes will be there in your inventory.\nUnfortunately they'll be gone again in a NG+ so if you want them you'll have to repeat the process.", "timestamp_created": 1506022652, "timestamp_updated": 1507852703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35110877": {"recommendationid": "35110877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014063967", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 155, "last_played": 1514050569}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great game.\n\nThe world building is great.

Usually one expects to find characters with a lot of depth, a meticulously detailed world and a highly nuanced political story of conflicting sides in a book. Trails of Cold Steel does the first two of these things excellently despite being a game, while it surpasses what a book could do in the third. \n\nPolitical conflicts are best understood by listening to the inhabitants of the world in which it is taking place. A book cannot do this as well as an RPG due to the fact what these people think will mostly come in the form of exposition. Meandering from person to person simply wouldn't work in a book. However, speaking to NPC's inhabiting a town, who all tell you their take on what is happening, who's side they are on, and what is on their mind works very well for this. Trails of Cold Steel makes full use of this advantage RPG's possess. Each NPC in every town leads their own life, and they all have dialogue which updates between every major story event. In addition to this, there are many quests, some optional, some required, which also contribute to building what feels like a world of real people.\n\nThe obvious drawback to all of this is of course that the story is very slow-paced. It is not until the end of chapter 3 that things starts speeding up, although it certainly doesn't slow down. In addition to this the characters at the start of the game appear to be quite cliche. As the game carries on, it will become clear that these characters have more than enough depth to them, but both of these factors combined can make Trails of Cold Steel hard to get in to. \n\nIn addition to writing - its main selling point, Trails of Cold steel has quite a satisfactory combat system. It is different enough from other JRPG's, while there there is more than enough variety. My main issue would be that many bosses rely heavily on inflicting status conditions. This makes the combat a little easy when using the correct accessories which block these conditions, while it can very hard when these are lacking. \n\nFinally the music of Trails of Cold Steel is fantastic, and it is one of my favorite soundtracks from any game I've played. I would suggest to simply look up some of the songs on YouTube and listen for yourself. Some personal favorites of mine are \"Don't Be Defeated By a Friend\", \"Crimson Wings, A New Wind\" and \"Atrocious Raid\". (Be cautious looking at songs from the sequel, Trails of Cold Steel II, because the cover of this album has a major spoiler for this game!)\n\nOverall, if you are fond of story rich RPG's, and can handle the slow pacing this game starts off with, I'm confident you'll enjoy Trails of Cold Steel immensely.

But having said that, I enjoyed this game thoroughly. The voice acting is pretty standard for an English dub but I was able to live through it. The gameplay is actually really cool and can be broken if using certain exploits.\n\nWould I recommend this game to people? Sure, but this is more or a prologue to the 2nd game and will make you want to play the 2nd game straight away(if you enjoy this game anyway). I am currently hanging for the next game to come out as the ending left me extremely intrigued. \n\nSolid JRPG 8/10\nPros:\nDecent cast of characters even if some are annoying\nDifficulty can spike if unprepared\nDecent setup for the 2nd game\nEasy to learn combat, hard to master if new to the series, well for me anyway\nNG+\nFast travelling\nRuns very smooth with no crashes, for me anyway\n\nCons:\nVoice acting\nDialogue goes for too long sometimes without any plot relevence\nStrict repeatable schedule\nTalk to every NPC always after every little scene to make sure you get everything\nEasy exploits\nSome graphical glitches\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1505416459, "timestamp_updated": 1505416459, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It helps me actually to plan my day as to know when to stop haha! But more than that, there is diversity. Its not a game all about action, or all about this or that. Sure I would have enjoyed more puzzles personnaly, but one cannot have everything in one game (a pizza cannot have everything in it, would be way to thick if we tried to represent EVERY trends in one dish). You hardly get bored of something unless you are at the very end of it, which is good also. Sometimes you need to feel like you want to move on in order to really enjoy the transition when it happens.\n\n2-Combining different elements. If we were to ask me if I prefer the Trails in the sky or cold steel, I would say they are different enough to be enjoyable in their respective strong points. I do prefer for example the system in which depending on the ammount of quartz one puts on a character the spells change accordingly in the first serie. However, I enjoy alot if not more the combination of upgrading your quartz and of leveling them. It adds some customization to your characters. Its only annoying to having your characters reequip special quartz because they got unequipped simply because they didn't take part in a chapter. But oh well. One could also argue that with every new quartz you get, you tend to change their build anyways so might as well do it. Cooking and grinding is great. You don<t really grind materials as much as you grind the sepith which in turn you convert into mira in order to buy ingredients. All that is nice and relaxing. No pressure to do some HEAVY grinding, but still enough diversity in the ingredients to buy stuff. The different results is a plus compared to the first trails in the sky (have yet to play chapters 2-3).\n\n3-The approach to the story line is refreshing. Yeah, its linear, but having the socializing phase between the field studies is a great way to delve into the immediate lore. What I mean by immediate lore is not background information like what you get from reading novels or checking the library, which is good also especially if you like the sense of continuity with the previous serie. By immediate I am referring to things which are not important for the scenario, nor for the link between games, but has valuable information on your surroundings, your characters. I think the lack of romance till the end of the game leaves an open door for the second chapter which I hope will come soon on steam. According to some reviews I watched, on the second chapter it is less linear and choices do matter. Its great to keep things up your sleeves so no complaints from me (I am not that interested in hunting romance in a game actually, but this is my first review so I try to describe everything and I know for some its a plus).\n\nThose were, in my opinion, the strongest points.\n\nNow, three good points.\n\n1-Story. The scenario is really interesting and though its slow at first, it gets quickly out of hand and I like the idea you know not much till later on when other questions replace those you finally got an answer. Sadly, stereotypes tend to dilute a little bit the originality. The noble faction is an interesting enemy but their soldiers are just plain stupid. Sometimes I feel like its the overemphasis on the eyes and the evil laugh you often find in mangas or animes (as if a bad guy will laugh ominously all the time). Some time a cliche is great, and truth be told this games can exploit that alot in the good way, but that all the provincial soldiers are self-centered as they are snf do full of themselves, erm.... its like they all have one personnality. But beside that point, I found myself intrigued more and more as the chapters went by. The dilemmas are well balanced, not too much on the idealistic side of things. I like the fact they did such a great job in giving unique personnalities to important characters or side characters and not being afraid of using them as spices in their story dish. Its worth mentionning that many subtle details will slip before you on the first play, and certainly when I will replay it right after finishing it I will enjoy the details of the plot even more.\n\n2-The quest system is good. but to my opinion I do prefer the relation of Estelle to her quests than of Rean to his. He does not react so much, okay its his personnality, but he tends to be self sufficient a little. Estelle needed the help of Joshua to either calm her down or fill in where she needed help. Here, Rean is always on the right AND the righteous path. However, that we have different types of quest is a boon. First, you have those of Thors, given to you by the studen council. Second, you have those given to you in your field studies. And finally there are those hidden quests. They are all different.\n\n3-The fishing club. Too bad you cannot choose your club, but at least we have a mini-game which provides rewards and patience. In my opinion it could have been more developped but at least it follows you from the academy to your field studies, giving you a well deserved break from running all over the place (AND GIVING YOU FREE CP YAY!!). Gives you also the urge to fill your fish encyclopedia ;)\n\nThere are things which I personnaly dislike.\n\n1-The equipment shop seems rather linear. Not much diversity, not customization of weapons. I thought at first that the U-Materia and the option of customizing would ACTUALLY give you the pleasure of either upgrading your weapons or enchancing them, but its quite limited. You CAN upgrade them, but often you can simply buy the newer version in a store and both ways are equal in benefits. No rewards in customizing.\n\n2-Lack of character developpement with Rean. From the start to the end, he is always the same. When he seems to think alot and go on a re-examination of himself and of the world, most of the time its by reminding himself of events or ineractions he already had before. Truth be told, he does more often refere to events and interactions during the game, but they seldom have a lasting impact on him. How about a character that learns to discern? He already knows how to from the start, and already good enough that he does not really require more learning in that departement. He spends most of his time helping others developpe, but others don't tend to contribute to his slow growth.\n\n\n\nSo, should I recommend this game? Depends. If you like solid character growth you may be disappointed and I would rather recommend the first serie. However, this one gives alot in compensation to the other characters (Fie and Macchias being two good examples). Quick dip in the action of the story, nah, it starts pretty slow at first, but honestly I oftend get tired of games who throw you right away in the plot cause you get tired of it. Giving some timo to just get used to the culture IN the game is in my opinion a characteristic of a good plot. Graphics may not be the best, but I don<t care, they are good enough so you don<t bother and actually, I prefer a game with better scenarios and great playability over super fancy visuals. \n\nIn my opinion, these games (cold steel and heroes trails in the sky chapter 1) made me discover a great RPG company which is Falcom.

They do become this powerful. However i'll explain that later.\nThrowing in at the deep end with no knowledge or the characters is confusing as you are constantly foreshadowing what will happen 1/2 a year down the line (in game). As it leaves you at a pretty big cliffhanger. \n\nWhen you start attending Thor's Military Academy, you come off the train and head into the city, where you'll meet quite a few main characters, bumping into a fine lady whom you will be spending a lot of time with.\nOnce this occurs you'll have about an hour at most of dialogue to get through. Which, does seem heavy. However the trails universe does a very good job at introducing those characters and developing them as time moves forwards.\n\nI went into the game with no real expectations. I was looking for a good JRPG game, which I could throw my hours in over the remainder of the summer holidays.. I was and am impressed. The game lasted a hell of a long time, while. Yes, it only took  me a week. I had a lot of hours invested into this game. The main thing which I enjoy is the character development and the world building which was amazing inside of this game. \n\nThere are a lot of main characters, so much so that you'll start to lose track of what and who they are. However, you have the handy feature of the classbook or whatever you call. WHich you have to painstakingly hand out to everyone in your class quite early on in the game. This records all the important information which you will find out about characters. This could be through the bonding events, or just general interaction. \nThe flesh out the world more and more as you immerse yourself deeper and deeper into the game. With places which are mentioned early on, being places which you visit on Field Studies. You also get to learn about family members of the big 11. Along with their homes and way of life. \n\nYou will start off hating characters. While the hate never really faded for me with Machinas. However out of the eleven characters he is the only one that I didn't like. Mainly because he's a whiney little bitch. \nHowever he does have his moments. Near the end.\n\nThe pacing of the game at times does get a little dull and repetitive. As you fall into the rhythm of being the student council's little fairy, doing their tasks. Beating a floor of the old school house, having a practical examination (getting your ass kicked by Sara for the most part) then off you pop onto the train to the next city where you will spend two or three days solving a relationship dilemma within your group. Since you are the almighty Rean; the loveable hellspawn decides that it's your responsibility to deal with this as she cannot be arsed. \nI digress, the structure is not very flexible as you do get into this rhythm and it's hard to get out of it.\n\nHowever, Cold Steel makes up for this by having an absolute killer soundtrack. I am honestly impressed with how amazing the music was for this game. I would have the volume on full blast for the majority of this game so I could appreciate the music; as it fits the mood perfectly. However I would've liked for there to be more of a diverse set of music for each area of the game. Yes, the music is amazing. However it plays for half the chapter and doesn't change often. However, thank god it changed each chapter. \n\nThe Combat system is very impressive. With Attacks, Magic (Arts), Crafts (Character driven abilities), the standard items and run. I threw away Magic for the most part of the game as waiting for it to activate wasn't effective and just used mainly Attacks and Crafts. Which hit harder and faster. However once I got the Adamantium Shield Art, I started using magic again as it is insanely powerful. \nThe Combat system is refreshing, while it's nothing amazing, it is at least enjoyable. \n\nThe last few chapters, I was expecting the game to end anytime then. I could see many places where they could've ended it and resumed it in the next expansion of the arc. However to my delight, it continued on for quite some time! Once I went to bed after I got into the last floor of the Old school house and decided I'd clear it tomorrow, as it must of been where the game ended. As I had a little time free in the morning... I finished the dungeon after a good number of hours... then the boss battle... then the final chapter sprang up which meant that it still wasn't down for the count.\n\nThe game ends with a cliffhanger. To my great displeasure. As I have read many reviews that even told me that there would be a cliffhanger ending. I was not happy in the slightest. I did not want this game to end. I was in the developer's pockets until the very end. While, it isn't satisfying at the least. As you get CRAZY over powered towards the end and everything starts to kick off. You find out C's identify. Which while there were many signs in the game all along, is still a shock. The capital is occupied and they're coming for Thor's. Class VII with their fearless (and clueless) leader Rean, heading out to fend off the attack until the Military can send relief. \nYou fight off two enemies (Not spoiling it) and then fight C for the last time in Trails of Cold Steel I. After that, you leave. Not out of your own choice either. Flying off to the furthest place from Thor's as possible. Heading home. The game ends there. With the fleeting text from the developers to port the next game to PC. Which was enough to satisfy me.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is phenomenal. The characters are thoroughly amazing, they are fleshed out and you really get to know them. The game took me about 40 hours to complete. However, this was with the amazing feature of Turbo mode, allowing you to speed up the game to allow you to get back into the combat as quickly as possible. I had it turned on for the grand majority of the game. As it allows you to waste less time doing the side quests and running about from destination to destination. I am also ashamed to say that I found a way to go undetected by monsters that roam in the wild. Allowing me to breeze through the last dungeon. \nI would heavily recommend this game to anyone who is an avid reader of fantasy novels, as it achieves the same thing that reading can do in a short time. \nThose who love JRPGs will be in for a treat as this is the best which I have played in a long time, beating Final Fantasy X by a long run.", "timestamp_created": 1504961486, "timestamp_updated": 1504961564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34835274": {"recommendationid": "34835274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064435273", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504954999}, "language": "english", "review": "What an absolutely incredible roller coaster ride this game has been. I haven't felt so strongly about a RPG ever since FFX and even I feel that this game may be on par with it. Before I begin my review, I just want to reiterate that although I have 96.3 hours in this game and counting, that was only through my first playthrough. How I was able to amass that much time in a game will be stated shortly. \n\nCharacter Development\nThough you are introduced to an astonishing and somewhat intimidating amount of characters, each character has been developed with proper care and it isn't long until you begin to care about each of them. The characters are probably the strongest part in this game and they are all very much human. It is an absolute far cry to the last JRPG games that I played that consisted of FFXIII & FFXV along with some american RPG games that I've played such as Skyrim, and Far Cry. They also develop very realistically all having their own faults, as normal High School Kids are. And yet, their struggles are things that you care about as you get to know each of them. On you off days you are able to get to know each of your classmates, but it never seems like it drags on as you are only allowed a certain amount of bonding points per day. \n\nEven the NPCs you interact with seem to have very interesting stories. And It's actually probably what I spent most of my time doing in this game even though it wasn't required. The shop keepers don't just have a \"shop option\" in them, and you can actually get to know what their backstory is along with many of the other NPCs that you are introduced to throughout the series. All the characters, I feel, in Trails of Cold Steel added so much to the immersion. \n\nStory\nThe story starts off relatively quickly. You play in the perspective of Rean Schwarzer and you are just confused as he is in the class when he is placed in with the rest of his colorful classmates. Though each chapter is set in a school setting, the strongest part of this series come from these Field Studies that Class VII distinctly goes through. Throughout each chapter you go to these trips called field studies where you embark on other areas of the country along with subtle tidbits about the history of both the continent and your classmates. Along with these Field Studies are tasks that you do in order to A) progress the story forward & B) able to get to know the people in the city/town. And once you get to know all of the characters there, the story really starts moving along along with some mind jarring twists that even the most observant wouldn't see coming along. \n\nPort\nThe port is Fleshed out really nicely in comparison to the PSVita version and it almost makes me sad that I will probably have to wait a year or 2 before the second game comes out. I am tempted to buy the second one just on the PS3 and deal with the lower frame rathes, but to be honest the graphics wasn't something that I wasn't paying too much attention to anyways. There are some dated moments that have to do with the graphical engine at the time, that you will see as you're playing such as teleporting students or even the way characters walk may be a little jagged, but all in all it is a really clean port that I was able to run very nicely with my Asus 1070 I5 6600K which may even be overkill for a game such as this.\n\nSound\nAlmost all the cut scenes have voice lines, though they are mainly in English. Though I'm pretty sure it is possible to find a Mod for a Japanese voice acting, the English voice acting in itself is superb and that is coming from someone who has watched a long list of animes and is rather picky with the amount of Dub there is in an anime. Though be warned that according to the port, there was apparently 5,000 additional lines of text that was able to be voiced which may not be included if you were to mod this game. \n\nThe Soundtrack in this game fits absolutely well, from rocking action to some school-appropriate subtle spring music, I felt that the music only added to the immersion as it made me feel like I was a student that was studying at Thors Military Academy, or a citizen in Erebonia. The music felt very simplified and yet absolutely fit the theme to what the developers at Falcom were aiming for. \n\nOverall\n\nThis was the JRPG that I've been looking for this whole time and I felt like I found an absolute jewel in this game. I also feel that this game is criminally underrated, especially since Destructoid and Famitsu gave it some subpar ratings of 7/10 and 34/40. There is a ton of replayability in this game and you can bet that I will be replaying this and reliving the days with Class VII and playing the second part of the series on the PS3 and maybe someday play it on Steam as well when it comes out on PC. \n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1504957065, "timestamp_updated": 1504957065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34834523": {"recommendationid": "34834523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175255957", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505834147}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e04\u0e33\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e32\u0e04 2 \u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d", "timestamp_created": 1504954473, "timestamp_updated": 1504954473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34829822": {"recommendationid": "34829822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198414634154", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 146, "last_played": 1513869905}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the kind of game I'm looking for.

Like a 3D version of one of those really great PSone era JRPGs\n\nLook forward to..\n- A story with a ton of worldbuilding that makes you crave more.\n- Deep and interesting characters.\n- Writing in a JRPG that's actually good!\n- A fun and satisfying turn based combat system.\n- English voice acting that's really good.\n- Waifus,  So many Waifus.\n- A great port from console. (It's like Funcom actually cares.)\n\n\nPrepare for...\n- A slow start.\n- Some Persona time mechanics that aren't quite as well polished.\n- Much more talking than stabbing.\n-  A less than ideal menu system.\n\n\nThis is the second time I've bought this game.  The first time was on Vita and the PC is the best place to play it by far.  The near instantaneous load times and high frame rate make a huge difference in terms of making everything just plain better.\n\nWhat makes this game as good as it is, however, is the depth and quality of worldbuilding.  That is what this game is all about.  Each chapter introduces you to a new region and delves into one or two of the character's in your party.  Which will seem slow at first but after a few chapters you begin to realize that the game has tricked you into learning about it's world and it's character at a crazy level of depth.   Which it then starts using to full effect in the later parts of the story.\n\nThen there are the characters who are universally great.  At first they just seem like a bunch of anime tropes but all of them have a twist or some sort of backstory that builds your interest in each as the game goes along.   There is no finer example of than the main character himself, Rean.  At first he just seems like a normal vanilla hero.  Until you find out he's nowhere near as normal as he seems and is every bit as deep an interesting as the rest of the cast.\n\nSo if you love old school JRPGs with a deep story and don't mind a bit of a slow burn storywise.  Get this.  It's fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1504922041, "timestamp_updated": 1504922350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34823940": {"recommendationid": "34823940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140801744", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507076805}, "language": "english", "review": "Sooo first review, first thing's first:\n\nYou do not need to have played the previous Trails (or in Japan \"Kiseki\") series; the game makes some references to those games, mostly Ao no Kiseki (Trails to Azure?); but for the most part you really won't be spoiled for those games, in fact this game was made with newcomers in mind. \n\nI have played the PS3 version and I can tell you if you get this, you are buying the definitive version, I cannot tell you how great it is to replay this game in 60 FPS with extra voice acting. This game, like most of XSeed's localizations: has no censorship. Unfortunately there\u2019s no dual audio since they couldn't get it (Japanese VAs are very protective of their work, or so I'm told), however you can mod them back in, but the dub VAs are excellent! Better than your average dub, give or take; a lot of people don't like the VA for Alisa though; personally I think Laura sounds too old.\n\nWhat of the gameplay though?\n\nWell if you got that old Turn Based JRPG itch that needs to be scratched; this is the game for you. It has some of the best elements of other JRPGs old and new. \n\nI think the battle system is a lot like Final Fantasy X's battle system, but unlike FFX your party's positioning is taken to account on the field, so sometimes positioning is important. Crafts are unique moves that each character can use, S-Crafts/S-Breaks are your limit breaks and Arts are your spells, which take a turn to charge and a turn to cast (which makes sense IMO), but arts do not miss. \n\nOne of the new things in this game that wasn't in previous entries is the ability to physically attack and unbalance your enemy and follow up with the party member that character who unbalanced is linked to for more damage.\n\nMy biggest disappointment though with this game; is that Falcom dumbed down the orbment system compared to Trails in the Sky (also on Steam). Orbments are the game's explanation of the type of technology of how they can run vehicles, appliances, guns, cast Arts (spells), etc. What your characters use are combat orbments (The ARCUS in this game's case) which either increases each of your character's parameters such as increased Attack or HP and Arts such as Fire Bolt (basic fire spell) and Tear (basic healing spell) and later on a chance to inflict status on you opponant. \n\nYou can give spells to any character, although not all character's stats are the same, so ot's better to have offensive Arts to characters with a high ATS (Arts Attack) stat! This is done by inserting what is known as Quartz refined from sepith (dropped from enemies, which you could excange for cash, but I don't recommend) into your ARCUS orbments. In Trails in the Sky, Quartz has a value and that is determined by what you can cast. In Cold Steel: what you see is what you get.\n\nThis game\u2019s music is exceptional. I put it up there of what Square Enix, Capcom, Konami makes. Yes it can be that amazing. Falcom always has good music in their games. I still listen to them. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1tI_idiwnQ]Glint of Cold Steel (Main battle music)[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1bNrqTXacU]Eliminate Crisis![/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2OBpsUK5PU]Exceed![/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO9M2NqSf9A](a favourite, IMO underrated) Through the Canyon Road[/url] and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4JXuHiSPiU]Into the Abyss[/url]; but stay away from Cold Steel II's music! The album art is a BIG spoiler; you have been warned.\n\nThis game is also Story heavy; were talking long cutscenes and not every scene is voiced, but we\u2019re talking War and Peace in terms of how big this games dialogue is. I will say this, after the opening scene, the game does start off slow, because of world building and character development; this story is a time investment that WILL pay off; I guarantee you. As you advance the story, like Sky; NPCs usually have something new to say and usually have their own stories going on; this is what I mean by War and Peace, a lot of dialogue is optional. That's how detailed this game's world is. Playing this game on New Game Plus is also worth it because you can also pick up subtle foreshadowing and hints, that you will definitely miss the first time playing and you can carry over your items and character\u2019s levels \u2013 if you so wish.\n\nIf you like this game and plan to get the Cold steel II, which will be coming out on Steam soon (as I write this, it\u2019s not out yet on Steam), make sure you have a complete game save file. You\u2019ll get some nice items by how much AP you get in this game, as well as carry over character relationships.", "timestamp_created": 1504907818, "timestamp_updated": 1504907818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34807282": {"recommendationid": "34807282", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176479001", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3727, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504210030}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best JRPG I've played in awhile.

That said the visuals are still solid and enjoyable.\n\nSound is also great. The only issue I has with sound was one scene of a musical that sadly wasnt' done like the opening is and it so should have been. The same goes for the voice acting, which covers about 33% of dialog. The voice actors are a great crew, including Matt Mercer (Prince Olivert and George Nome), Ashly Burch (who sounds so much like Tiny Tina from Borderlands 2 and it's adorable), and Kira Buckland (Elise here and 2B in Nier Automata). The rest of the voice acting crew wasn't as easy to place, but those two are very easy to remember.\n\nThe only bad thing in this game is the ending...

It is one of my top ten favorite games of all time.  I'm a big fan of the Trails series and this ranks second among the Trails games for me, just behind Trails in the Sky SC.  I highly recommend it.\n\nThe highlights of this game for me were the story with all its twists & turns and the character growth throughout the game.  The writing is top notch.  Like a good mystery, all the clues are there, but I was still surprised by the story several times.  And every time, it was great to see how the story changed while also thinking about the clues I didn't recognize when I first saw them.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, I didn't like most of the characters.  I thought that would make it a rough game to get through.  But most of them show a lot of growth throughout the game and I ended up liking almost all of them by the ending credits.  I can't wait to see them continue their growth in the next game.\n\nI thought the English voice acting was generally very good and helped communicate the characters' personalities and their growth.  The actresses voicing Sara and Millium were fantastic throughout the game, with great delivery.  The actress voicing Fie showed a lot of subtlety in her delivery, showing Fie's growth in the game.\n\nThere is a surprising amount of really funny humor in the game.  Like a lot of other things in these games, it is a really slow burn.  Sometimes the payoff to the joke comes entire chapters after the joke is set up.  But I laughed harder at this game than almost any other game I've played.\n\nThe graphics are much improved from Trails in the Sky, but don't compare to higher end modern games.  They are still very well done and functional, though.  I never had any problems with them.\n\nThe music was well done and memorable, but didn't come close to the music in Trails in the Sky for me.\n\nThe controls are very easy and fluid.  I played the entire game with a laptop keyboard and trackpad and never had any difficulties.\n\nI encountered an occasional crash on earlier versions, but none in any of the more recent versions.\n\nI play games to relax and I found this gaming experience to be very relaxing.  I can't comment on the challenge of the game other than to say there are several difficulty levels and lots of gameplay choices you can make if you want more or less challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1504560700, "timestamp_updated": 1504560700, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34737663": {"recommendationid": "34737663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201411431", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5005, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503268374}, "language": "english", "review": "I hadn't played a JRPG in years before picking this up, but I liked Trails in the Sky on the PSP so I decided to give it a go. I got hooked and played it almost nonstop until completion. My reaction to Trails of Cold Steel is 95 percent positive with just a few minor issues.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Classic turn-based JRPG gameplay with light amount of Persona-style social sim elements. The devs clearly played Persona games and tried to incorporate a few similar mechanics. Combat has enough depth to keep you engaged, though as with most of these games, the fighting does get tedious at certain points. Please note that you spend pretty much the entire game locked within a framework of attending school, following a set schedule, and the progression is very linear. You can't explore wherever you want, whenever you want, like in some other JRPGs. Personally I thought it was an interesting way to structure the game, and I enjoyed it.\n\nSTORY/WORLD: Most of the characters are likable versions of the usual stereotypes: the upper-class snob, the nerdy girl with glasses (and always with the biggest rack. What's up with that, Japan?), the tomboyish warrior girl, etc. Your main character is a level-headed guy who reluctantly takes on the role of leader and develops strong emotional bonds with all of his classmates. In my opinion the character interactions are the best part of this game. A lot of the character development and world-building comes through playing the optional quests, so I would highly recommend not skipping those. The main story involves political and military intrigue and is well done but not particularly groundbreaking. The world itself is expansive and interesting with tons of lore. Note that this game tells only half of the story and ends on a cliffhanger. Expect to buy the upcoming (on PC) sequel if you want to complete the game's story.\n\nGRAPHICS: Well, it's a port of a Vita game. It looks like a port of a Vita game. For what it is, it runs great on high settings, and my PC is middle-grade at best. The final dungeon and boss are pretty spectacular-looking.\n\nMUSIC: I freaking love the music in this game. Equal to or better than Trails in the Sky. More mellow than Ys soundtracks but with plenty of memorable tunes you will find yourself humming later.\n\nREPLAYABILITY: There is a game plus mode after you complete it the first time, which allows you to carry over some elements from your previous game (which you get to choose - it gives you a set number of points with which to \"buy\" keeping your stats, or money, or items, etc.) Pretty cool idea. I'll probably play the game plus on hard mode at some point.\n\nFINAL NOTE: DO NOT play Trails of Cold Steel on easy mode! I started on easy mode and found that it was such an utter cakewalk that I abandoned my game and started over on normal mode. You can't switch it during a playthough. Even normal mode is pretty easy.", "timestamp_created": 1504540020, "timestamp_updated": 1504540020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500357", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34736332": {"recommendationid": "34736332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069750929", "num_games_owned": 1084, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 5666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505063728}, "language": "english", "review": "Nihon Falcom does it again!\n\nAnother amazing RPG made its way to PC and I couldn't be happier. Thank you for making this such a beautiful and smooth PC port, there's not enough of them these days.\n\n10/10 Music - The music is epic and extremely well done. I find myself paying more attention to the music than playing the game sometimes.\n\n9/10 Characters - The characters for the most part are great. They're voice acted very well and leave you wanting more. As you discover their backgrounds you quickly realize they're not who you thought they were. Every JRPG needs a Tsundere Twin Tailed girl, and Alisa fits the bill perfectly. Easily one of my favorites. \n\n8/10 Story - The story for me felt slow to progress, but that may partially be my fault. Every time I entered a new area or the day changed, I'd go around and exhaust every NPC's dialogue and read every book I can find. I was very immersed into the story and kept wanting to learn more. I won't spoil anything for you.\n\n10/10 Performance - Never before have I seen a JRPG with so many graphics options with descriptions and visual representations of what each setting actually does. I was completely blown away by this. The game performed extremely well and I was able to hold a consistent 90-100 FPS on highest settings 1920x1080. A PC port done right in my opinion.\n\nThis is another solid entry for the \"Legend of Heroes\" series, and while it may be older, it's new to me. I'm a PC gamer, so I never experienced the older PlayStation version of this game. Until a game hits PC it stays off my radar. Looking forward to the port of Cold Steel 2 and the eventual release, translation and port of Cold Steel 3. \n\nConsidering how much gameplay per dollar spent you get here, this game is absolutely worth buying even at full price.

The world and the story in this game are amazingly good. Every charactor has their own uniqe backstory which ties them into the greater world around them.

The country you play in is in a changeing period between a eropean nobility class system and a more modern state. The main problem I have with this game is some elements of the combat system and the balancing of some of the enemies. First off there are way to many statis effects and it just makes things confusing and tedius, The second thing is that some of the bosses just feel like complete bs and i cant tell why im losing to them. Am I underleveled? Am I not biult corretly? Am I just bad? Or is this boss just poorly desined bs. Atlest you can weaken the enemies if you lose so you never get stuck.

I honestly wasn't sure if the Cold Steel series would reach Steam, but I'm certainly glad it did. \n\nFirst, the battle system is great. Having played Trails in the Sky FC and SC before this, I was already familiar with the Trails combat system, but combat links, master quartz, and just being in 3D added another level of strategy to battles. The normal difficulty of Cold Steel felt a lot easier than normal did in Trails in the Sky, but I didn't really mind. If you want a challenge, though, hard or nightmare is probably the way to go. \n\nSecond, I really enjoyed the cast of characters. Sure, a lot of them start out being kinda cliche (the tsundere, the stuck-up noble, the loner, etc), but as the story progresses, they kinda break out of those stereotypes somewhat. It's also interesting watching them overcome their differences and learn to work together as a team.\n\nLastly, I really enjoyed the story of it. I like that you don't really know any more about what is going on than the members of your class do. Also, I really enjoyed how the school setting was done in this game. I've played several other games with a school setting, but this is the first one I've played where I actually felt like I was part of this school rather than just an observer. I also enjoy how events of the previous games are occasionally mentioned in passing. It really helps to connect all the games.\n\nI can't wait until Cold Steel II is released!

Although this may be the first of another trilogy, this game does not let you down, especially at the end of the game where the dramatic experiences escalates tremendously... theeeeeeeen ends on an incredibly cruel cliffhanger that makes Trails in the Sky FC's seem rather tame. Unfortunately, we have to wait a while before getting the second act of this incredible journey on PC, so we might as well tide ourselves over with this gem.\n\nBack to the synopsis; this game takes place in Erebonia, the country that has been notoriously discussed in the Sky series as a warmongering country, when in fact the truth is far more complex than it seems. You see how this country behaves through the time that Rean Schwarzer and the rest of Class VII spend over at Thors Military Academy. You get to observe how each character in Class VII progressively grows into the unique and fascinating inviduals that they are, as well learn where they stand with how Erebonia as a country runs.\n\nOne of the most interesting elements of the story is that it progresses over the course of a school year; each gameplay day represents a particular type of school day, such as Free Days, dungeon investigations, side quests for people at the academy and Trista, and of course the amazing Field Studies! Field Studies are the best parts of this game due to the fact that you travel to various parts of the country to learn about Erebonia's history, culture, and its people, furthering character development for all of Class VII!\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, I would argue that it is the best of the currently released PC Trails series, especially the combat. The combat is much faster than the Sky trilogy due to the Combat Links provided by the new ARCUS battle orbmants. With combat links, each character forms a bond with another to trigger an additional attack or effect depending on the bond level the characters have with one another. More combat link effects will unlock later in the game that will allow you to unleash devastating attacks on your opponents with satisfying flair. Oh the joy of seeing your party wipe the floor with your enemies!\n\nIf you are not aware, the Trails of Cold Steel series runs parallel with the Crossbell arc. Everything that is happening in Cold Steel is happening AT THE SAME TIME as Zero no Kiseki! You will see so many references to the Crossbell region that it makes you want Zero no Kiseki so badly to find out about the characters that are mentioned, as well as seeing just how exactly the story unfolds in tandem with Cold Steel. Who knows when we will get to see the parallels fully, but it is something to look forward to.\n\nIf you have not played a Legend of Heroes game, I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend you hold off on this game and go purchase and play the entirety of the Trails in the Sky trilogy; seriously, it is incredibly good and will help you more emotinally connect with the world of Zemuria even more, as well as care deeply about returning characters in Cold Steel, and go crazy when certain characters names are mentioned!\n\nOnce you do get the chance to play this wonderful first chapter in an epic new quadrilogy(?), I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have!\n\n*NOTE: You will need to play this game twice in order to experience everything it has to offer.

The series currently consists of 3 arcs, each arc set in its own country. This is the latest (3rd) arc which is set in the country Erebonia, \nthe previous (2nd) arc which is set in Crossbell runs simultaneously to this one, and as of the time of writing has not been officially localized (yet?). [b][u] If this is the first time seeing this series I would strongly recommend to consider playing \nthe first arc (Liberl) first, as events in this game are directly based on stuff that has happened in the past. [/u][/b]\nThe first game can be found on steam [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/251150/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_in_the_Sky/] click here [/url]\n\nEven if you haven't played the first arc you can still enjoy and understand most of the story, but the interconnectedness of this series is one of its strongest points.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe game follows the students of the special class VII at the Thors Academy in Erebonia through the eyes of our protagonist Rean Schwarzer.\nClass VII has a special curriculum that allows them to go on field trips throughout Erebonia. The game has a very Persona vibe.\n\nSince this is the first game in the arc expect a lot of world building in this one, the story moves very slowly but it allows for you to learn about this country, its problems and its people.\nFor me one of the best things is the large amount of npc dialogue available in the game, after almost ever game event npc dialogue changes and if you have the time to listen the npc dialogue can even foreshadow some plot twists.\nThe strong point of this game and this series in general is the world building, npc's have their little side stories that you can follow throughout the game, if you only take the time to talk to them.\nThere is the butler that is searching for a missing woman, learning more about teachers and students through talking with their family members and most minor characters on the campus have their own little arcs that you can choose to enjoy.\nIf you've played the earlier games you might just meet a few npcs who have come to this country all the way from Liberl.\n\nWhile the story is quite slow it ends on a high point and there might be a few twists and turns you won't see coming.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nVery similar to earlier Legend of Heroes games, you have your familiar arts and crafts. Orbments have been simplified a bit, you no longer have to accumulate your sepiths to get arts.\nThey are now inherit to the orbments themselves. New also are the ARCUS units Class VII uses, it allows them to us a ``master quartz'' which gives special bonusses and spells.\nAlso new is the inclusion of ``combat links'' class members can assist each other when you hit the enemy weak points.\nYou can socialize with your class members to raise their link level on the free days (think Danganronpa's free time).\n\nYou'll be doing quests around the campus and on the field trip locations each month, many which are optional and some are hidden as well. Optional quests are pretty easy this time around but never did I feel that I didn't want to do any of them.\n\nI played through the game on normal and never did I have a problem with the combat, it might've been a bit too easy as most monsters (and some bosses) can be killed with craft spam.

The story and characters are definitely the draw, the clash of ideals and politics of the country of Erebonia taking center stage. You play as Rean Schwarzer who is a new student at Thors Military Academy where he joins Class VII, the newly instated class which throws together members of both the noble and commoner social classes. As you can imagine this creates a bit of tension where the ideals of the students clash, but it's interesting to see how they get over their inhibition and prejudices as they learn more about one another. There's a lot of conspiracy and world building here. For my money it's the best JRPG of the last 15 years at least. On top of the great story you have one of the best soundtracks in gaming ever, and a fun, snappy combat system. If you're a classic JRPG fan you owe it to yourself to check out Trails of Cold Steel. It's available on PS3 and PS Vita as well as the PC, though PC is definitely the definitive version thanks to the option of sped up gameplay (turbo mode) beautiful upgraded graphics and additional voice acting where Rean doesn't stay oddly silent as everyone around him talks. Also, the voice acting is superb across the board.", "timestamp_created": 1504223566, "timestamp_updated": 1504223566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34645221": {"recommendationid": "34645221", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077655402", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 6750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504219755}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Trails of Cold Steel \u00e9 o primeiro capitulo do arco de Erebonia, terceiro arco de historias que se passam no mundo de Zemuria, mesmo mundo da s\u00e9rie \u201cThe Legend of Heroes Trails in the Sky\u201d. Ele se passa cronologicamente ap\u00f3s o arco de Liberl e simultaneamente ao arco de Crossbell.\n\nEmbora seja o sexto jogo do mundo de Zemuria, Trails of Cold Steel \u00e9 um jogo perfeito para iniciantes na s\u00e9rie. Com uma narrativa inicialmente cadenciada e meticulosa, o jogo se preocupa desde o in\u00edcio com a inclus\u00e3o e instru\u00e7\u00e3o de novos jogadores no universo da s\u00e9rie. Por sua vez, os veteranos s\u00e3o premiados com pontuais easter eggs e cameos. \nO game possui uma historia complexa cheia de conspira\u00e7\u00f5es e debates pol\u00edticos focados principalmente no tema de classes sociais. O inicio cadenciado logo vai ganhando ritmo \u00e0 medida que o plot vai avan\u00e7ando e se aproximando do final. Sua narrativa \u00e9 recheada de plot twists do inicio ao fim.\n\nPrimeiro jogo 3D da s\u00e9rie, o gameplay \u00e9 um avan\u00e7o em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos jogos anteriores, o sistema \u00e9 por turnos, porem \u00e1gil. Das novidades, \u00e9 introduzindo o sistema \u201cArcus\u201d, sendo poss\u00edvel fazer links entre personagens e selecionar at\u00e9 7 lutadores no time, sendo 4 no campo de batalha e 3 de suporte, havendo a possibilidade de substitu\u00ed-los durante a luta a qualquer momento. Outra novidade \u00e9 a possibilidade de poder executar ataques especiais e em equipe utilizando \u201cbrave points\u201d.\n\nGraficamente o jogo n\u00e3o se destaca em compara\u00e7\u00e3o aos os jogos da gera\u00e7\u00e3o atual, entretanto isso \u00e9 compensando por um worldbuilding imersivo. Os personagens principais s\u00e3o carism\u00e1ticos e suas motiva\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o bem desenvolvidas dentro da trama do jogo; o mesmo pode ser dito dos NPCs, praticamente todos tem seu pr\u00f3prio arco dram\u00e1tico o qual pode ser aprofundado \u00e0 medida que o jogador tenha curiosidade e disposi\u00e7\u00e3o para explora-lo.

Poucos jogos foram t\u00e3o bem tratados como este.\n\nEm suma, Trails of Cold Steel \u00e9 mais um excelente jogo da sempre competente Falcom. Contando ainda com uma bela trilha sonora, ele \u00e9 um dos melhores JRPGs dispon\u00edveis no Steam. Perfeito para quem n\u00e3o conhece e quer iniciar a s\u00e9rie, e um deleite para os f\u00e3s de velha data.\n\nE que venham as continua\u00e7\u00f5es.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1504216878, "timestamp_updated": 1504216878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34644029": {"recommendationid": "34644029", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092668799", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504152741}, "language": "english", "review": "Although perhaps this installment doesn't compare in its overall quality to classics such as Trails in the Sky, it does live up to the name of legend of heroes series, in terms of story and gameplay. \n\nThe newest combat gameplay system does not deviate too much from the traditional gameplay, slightly tweaking certain aspects and adding a lot more collection elements. Storywise, I found this part of the narrative quite good. Told mainly from the perspectives of a group of Erebonian military students, the POV is full of energy. The cutscenes have also been updated into 3D CG, along with about 30-50% English dub, helping to bring more (narrative) details into world-buidling and story-telling. However, there are two major problems that marrs this game: 1. how conflicts are resolved can be quite naive to certain extent 2. the school life and political conflicts, which make up the majority of the story, do not blend well with the ancient artifact/snake society's conspiracy part of plot\n\nOverall, this game is worth buying and it took for me about 40 - 50 hour to complete it on normal. I'd give it a score of 7.5/10. I won't be buying the cold steel 2 though because the story there seems quite weak.", "timestamp_created": 1504213570, "timestamp_updated": 1505163107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34641808": {"recommendationid": "34641808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249726434", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503429085}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A TRUE MASTERPIECE![/h1]\n\nWhat can you say about a game that exceeds your expectations on every level? \n\nIf you are a fan of the Trails in the Sky trilogy then you are going to love this game. Take my word for it.\n\nHave you not played any games from the series but you are a generic fan of anime/JRPG?  Then I say you should give it a try. Because Trails of Cold Steel  marks the start of a brand new story which adapts certain aspects from its predecessors but swings to a unique direction. Some background knowledge may increase the taste you take from the story but it is not a necessity. \n\nIt has a fascinating story that deepens with every step you take.  You watch the story through the perspective of Rean Schwarzer, a junior student in Thor\u2019s Military Academy.  Yet from the very start of the game you find yourself surrounded by a bunch of different characters, your classmates and instructors. Characters who have travelled from different parts of the Erebonian Empire.  \n\nEach of these characters possess a different personality, an uninhibited view of the world they live in. That\u2019s right! Those classmates not \u201cyour gang\u201d who keep following you blindly in your self-proclaimed quest.  They have their own thoughts, feelings and remarks. While some of them are rather friendly and modest from the very start of the story; you will find some are quite cynical and rude, rather hotheaded and prickly, quite cold and reckless, irritatingly proud and serious, amusingly childish and immature or rather polite yet completely shrouded by mystery. Every character has their own past and secrets which you discover throughout the flow of the game. These secrets vary from small ones like favorite foods or childhood dreams to rather serious ones like real name or lineage of a character. And these details make you feel like you are surrounded by real people instead of an army of side-kicks.  Only after experiencing some serious bonding events they will start to open up to you and respect you.\n\nWhile you are trying to get used to your new life in the military academy, a much thicker plot starts to unwind  in the background which contains components of an international crises, an ever-growing civil unrest  between different social classes, a dark organization with a mysterious agenda and an ancient fairy tale that starts to show signs of legitimacy. And each answer you get will only trigger more questions.  And get ready for some unforeseeable twists!\n\nApart from the fascinating story and fulfilling character development, Trails of Cold Steel also offers a vibrant atmosphere and a great soundtrack. The characters will travel to different points of a giant empire and each step of their journey will take place in a completely different setting  varying from the others with an authentic  NPCs and fitting background music. Unless you are rushing the game, try to talk to as many NPCs around as possible. The things you learn, or the items you acquire may surprise you. \n\nAs a fellow RPG-gamer I give this game 10/10 and recommend it to every JRPG lover. And keep in mind that this game is only the first installment of a trilogy.

This game originally released for Playstation 3 and Playstation Vita in 2013, but XSEED did a really got job at improving graphics for PC version. If you are interested in a good story, great characters and good turn-based tactical JRPG - this is the one for you.\n\nPros:\n- High quality PC port, no crashes, a lot of available video options and tweaks.\n- A \"Turbo System\" which will speed up your game, when you press and hold a specific button. Very useful for grinding levels/items or traveling over long distances. Seriously, every game should include a button like that.\n- Awesome story and main characters, most of them is not your-generic-anime-cliche-stereotype.\n- Your choices actually do something, so you better read the books in-game or search answers @Google.\n- Some boss battles may be hard at first, but there's a key to each one of them, either it's some status ailments(that will help you tremendiously) or magical attacks vulnerability and such. Limit Breaks (aka EX skills) do a decent amount of damage. There's a lot of possible characters/squad combination in this game.\n- Character customization. There's a lot of passive/active skills that you can equip. You can get those from treasure chests, as monster drops or even craft them. \n- There's 50% more voice lines, compared to PS3/Vita versions and i would say english voiceover in this game is really great.\n- There's a lot of optional quests and content, however, be aware that THOSE ARE EASILY MISSABLE! If you advance from June, 25 to June, 26 and did not finish all hidden or optional quests(related to June, 25), then you can't complete those until next playthrough. Hidden quests are never marked in your quest book and you must search for them manually.\n\nCons:\n- Some people may not like the graphics, since the game is kinda old already.\n\nTL;DR 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1504101898, "timestamp_updated": 1504102271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490259", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34607655": {"recommendationid": "34607655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151195123", "num_games_owned": 1846, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504089118}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "-Hist\u00f3ria rica, cativante q faz vc querer saber o q vem a seguir\n-Personagens carism\u00e1ticos (e q faz vc se importar com eles) muito bem constru\u00eddos cada um com sua pr\u00f3pria hist\u00f3ria\n-Personagem principal mais gen\u00e9rico imposs\u00edvel, o q n\u00e3o tira o seu brilho, pois acompanhar sua jornada foi incr\u00edvel\n-Sistema de batalha excelente (parecido com Grandia II)\n-Socializa\u00e7\u00e3o com os personagens (lembra um pouco Persona) atrav\u00e9s de [i]Bonding Points[/i], onde em um determinado dia do m\u00eas, vc recebe alguns desses pontos, geralmente s\u00e3o 3, ae vc os gasta com os personagens q estiverem dispon\u00edveis durante o dia pra vc se socializar com eles\n\nE apesar de ser uma turma grande (vc faz parte da [i]Class VII[/i], onde vc estuda em uma academia militar) , o relacionamento entre eles, a hist\u00f3ria contada e outros aspectos d\u00e1 de 10 a 0 na turma de Final Fantasy Type-0, onde l\u00e1 n\u00e3o tem um foco nos personagens em si, aqui \u00e9 bastante focado.\n\nApesar de se passar no msm universo, n\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio jogar a trilogia Trails In The Sky para entender a hist\u00f3ria de Trails of Cold Steel.\n\nE um final (t\u00edpico de season finale de s\u00e9rie de tv) q te deixar louco pra jogar a continua\u00e7\u00e3o (Prevista ainda pra esse ano na steam, e o terceiro jogo chegar\u00e1 em setembro no jap\u00e3o).\n\nEnfim, excelente jogo pra quem curte um bom JRPG e uma densa hist\u00f3ria.

(Trails in the Sky does not need to be played to enjoy this game. It does, however, give background to the history and goings on of the world Cold Steel takes place in)\n\nSimilarly to Trails in the Sky, it builds up a fantastic story with lots of character progression, not only from main characters, but from a bunch of characters that you can optionally talk to throughout the game.  This game tends to be humurous.\n\nOne can choose how much they want to know more about certain characters, especially when it comes to what the game calls \"bonding events\", which serves to help give perks in battle as well as give background to characters.\n\nThere's also a great deal of voice acting done in this game, and it is some of the best voice acting for a game I've ever heard.  The Voice Actors do a great job giving personality to the character's voices.\n\nWhile each character is better suited to certain fighting styles, each can be greatly customized to battle a certain way with the game's orbment system. If you've played FF7, it's kinda like materia placed into weapons, but in this game it's called quartz and it's placed into a kind of \"cell phone\" device this game calls an Arcus unit.  It allows one to use that device to use orbal arts, a.k.a. magic, and augment their powers.  It can be fun to try to figure out a nice setup, but it also can be tedius at times to try to set up (since party members change a lot, except for the main character, and the quartz can be freely exchanged between party members).\n\nThe music is fantastic.  I want to say it's worth it for the music alone, but $40 is a bit much for music.  However, experiencing the music along with the game makes it totally worth it.  All the tracks feel well placed and enhance the experience.\n\nI played this game entirely with a steam controller, so I can't comment on the keyboard & mouse experience, but playing it on a controller is very nice.  I've had lots of long play sessions (if my play time didn't make that obvious) and didn't have any hand fatigue.\n\nThe game also runs very nice and smooth.  It looks great, and there are already mods that can make it look even better.\n\nMy first time playing through, I tried to experience everything that I could blindly, and I ended up with 116 hours played according to steam, but it was probably closer to 105-110 actual hours since I had some afk time. So there's quite a bit to this game to enjoy. The New Game + mode, nightmare difficulty, and extra bonding event scenes make it worth another playthrough as well.\n\nGiven the amount of fun to be had, and how great this game is, it's well worth the $40 price point.", "timestamp_created": 1503983708, "timestamp_updated": 1503983843, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34567667": {"recommendationid": "34567667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018647783", "num_games_owned": 376, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503360148}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has cheese 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1503977247, "timestamp_updated": 1503977247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34567091": {"recommendationid": "34567091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121859451", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510123457}, "language": "english", "review": "If you enjoy games of the JRPG genre then you will without a doubt enjot this game.

I already own CSI and CSII both on PS3 and Vita.  I was also happy to pay full price on the day of release.  I did not buy the dlc constumes as I already paid for them once on PSN.\n\nThis game is probably not for everyone.  Graphics overall and character animations in particular can be rough.  This game will probably not appeal to those who like to get into fast paced action quickly.  Instead, this game is best enjoyed with a laid-back approach of talking to every npc, finding every hidden sidequest, exploring and customizing everything, end enjoying the game's excellent music.\n\nThe plot in CSI is interesting.  The pacing is intentionally uneven in the careful unfolding of a detailed plot.  Without spoiling anything I can say it will ramp up sharply at the end of the game.  This will make you want to play CSII immediately..  which is somewhat of a problem until the PC release of CSII.  (I just grabbed my vita version.. oh how I miss turbo mode!)\n\nOne of the strongest parts of this series is the likable characters.  Many times I find the main character of a jrpg to be shallow and annoying.  Rean, in contrast, is a dynamic character who sees a good amount of character development.  His voice actor in particular makes the character very likable and  accessible without being obnoxious or overly simplistic.  There are a lot of other solid characters as well.  I genuinely feel conflicted in every playthrough over which girl to choose, as there are a number of likable options.  Even the npc's are given unique personalities and are detailed if you go out of your way to speak to them throughout the game.\n\nThe dialogue between characters is not as excellent as Trails in the Sky but still pretty solid.   There are a few cringeworthy scenes between characters being contentious in a way that just feels derived and forced.  \n\nThe improvements to the PC version are also excellent.  Turbo mode, in particular, is extremely helpful.  I am playing on a 4k display with maxed settings using a Dualshock 4.  I am enjoying the fluid performance and instant load times.  Sadly one strange bug that occurred throughout the game is a black spiderweb-like pattern of lines popping out in the sky during rendered scenes.  Also a number of character models have a black shadow on their legs which should not be there.  Hopefully these get addressed in oncoming patches.\n\nI strongly recommend this game if you like rpgs, jrpgs, lengthy detailed stories, interesting characters, and/or excellent music,  It is worth full price.  It is my hope that by supporting this game, we will see a localized version of the Crossbell series that I would love to play.

While this game doesn't quite reach the heights of the Sky games, it's nonetheless another great entry in the Trails series. If you're interested in playing the Trails games I'd recommend you play the Sky games first, as Cold Steel takes place after them. Though it's largely disconnected, Cold Steel rather unavoidably ends up spoiling some things from the Sky trilogy - though they're mostly minor plot details, and there's really only one big one. That said, if that doesn't bother you too much, feel free to jump into this one - everything's explained, so newcomers won't be lost! The game's also incredibly long, so if the price looks high to you I wouldn't worry - it's still good value for money.\n\nOn the technical side of things, this port is absolutely spectacular. Runs like a dream, even on the most potato-like of systems, and features a number of quality-of-life improvements that raise it far above the original console version. Loading is near-instant! You can fast-forward through battle animations and slow panning shots with Turbo mode! Even the launcher is controller-compatible! Top work.\n\nAs always, the future of this series is determined by its sales, and it'd be a real shame to miss out on the games that aren't already localised. So, if you're interested in Trails, do go ahead and give Cold Steel (or Sky FC) a go.", "timestamp_created": 1503601918, "timestamp_updated": 1503601918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34465782": {"recommendationid": "34465782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098109157", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57, "last_played": 1514478900}, "language": "english", "review": "Certainly I recommend such a fine piece of work like Trails of Cold Steel.\n\nThe richness of the story, and how it develops over the chapters within.\n\nThe music done by Falcom is always expected to be great. Further more how certain melodies go exactly with the mood of the story, surrounding you a little more with the world of Zemuria.\n\nEven if people think turn based combat is something old-school... particularly the turned based combat from the Legend of Heroes introduces a dynamical factor, that even if this is not \"active time battle\", certainly it can be a big challenge to fight many battles in the matter of how you administer your resources and the battle's bonuses.\n\nAnother thing is that, characters have 2 different skill sets: one that can be customizable and another one that is fixed, having the best out of customization along with the uniqueness of each character.\n\nNow adding the link system into the battles, it produces a more dynamic feeling compared to the predecesor Trails in the Sky. However do not confuse \"more dynamic\" with \"better\". They are just different systems, made in different dates.\n\nOne thing I did not like at all but ended accepting, is the voice of Alisa. Althought at first I was a little annoyed by it, a little later I got used to it (just the tone of the voice, because I liked how the voice actress performed in the end).\n\nAnother thing to mention, is that I loved the way the story develops the bonds between the people that came in contact with Class VII (talking more focussed on the main story side, althought there are some exceptions), as well

The Trails of the Skies trilogy i knew generally what to expect when playing this game however, I was genuinely surprised when I found a plot better and deeper than the Skies trilogy with a few twists that I did not see coming. It also is complicated enough to be enjoyable without alienating the player in the process. And this is only the first of three games! I also love how the events take place within the same world near the same time as the events of the Skies series and how they hint back at events or even have character appearances from that series which helped make me feel like I was part of a larger world.\nThe combat is very similar to the Skies series with a few additions and also being in third person. The game had random spikes in difficulty of the fights especially near the end but it actually made for a very thrilling conclusion where every move needed to be planned carefully.\n\nThe few negatives i'm going to list are minimized do to the pleasant and much needed \u201cspeed up time\u201d ability added to this game where you can skip combat animations and speed walk/run through town all at the press of a button. Now for the negatives:\nThe game can be very \u201cJapanese\u201d at times where in my opinion conversations are stilted or \u201cslowed down\u201d by people over congratulating, apologizing, or being modest which is very typical in games/anime from Japan.\nThe crafting of weapons/orbments is pretty simple and pointless and i never really used it until the last chapter.\nThe music is meh.\n\nI guess that's all I really have. I look forward to the next installment in this series!", "timestamp_created": 1503560155, "timestamp_updated": 1503560155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34454561": {"recommendationid": "34454561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100107561", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 6095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509032768}, "language": "schinese", "review": "    \u65e0\u638c\u673a\u65e0\u4e3b\u673a\u7684\u7eafPC\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\u957f\u8fbe4\u5e74\u7684\u6f2b\u957f\u7b49\u5f85\uff0c\u7ec8\u4e8e\u76fc\u5230\u4e86\u95ea\u8f68\u7684pc\u7248\u672c\u3002\u4e00\u5468\u76ee99\u5c0f\u65f6\u666e\u901a\u96be\u5ea6\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u6210\u5c31\u8fd8\u6ca1\u62ff\u5230\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u6765\u8865\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u79fb\u690d\u4e0a\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u6765\u8bf4\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u73a9\u8d77\u6765\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4e0d\u9002\uff0c\u753b\u8d28\u611f\u89c9\u5c31\u50cf\u662f\u5728\u73a9\u9ad8\u6e05\u91cd\u7f6e\uff0c970 1080p\u5f00\u6700\u9ad8\u7279\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a60\u5e27\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u8fc7\u573a\u4f1a\u7a0d\u5fae\u6389\u523040\u5de6\u53f3\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u5f88\u6d41\u7545\u30023D\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u786e\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e00\u822c\uff0c\u4f46\u6bd5\u7adf\u662f4\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u80fd\u770b\u8fc7\u773c\u7684\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u524d\u4f5c\u5f88\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ae0\u5957\u8def\u57fa\u672c\u90fd\u5dee\u4e0d\u591a\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u719f\u6089\u5e1d\u56fd\u7684\u98ce\u571f\u4eba\u60c5\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5427\u3002\u540e\u9762\u51e0\u7ae0\u5f00\u59cb\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e00\u7ae0\u53d8\u5f97\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5355\u8c03\u4e4f\u5473\u3002\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7\u5728\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u4f9d\u7136\u4ee4\u4eba\u53d1\u6307\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f5c\u51e0\u4e4e\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2anpc\u90fd\u6709\u4ed6\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u683c\u7684\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u6e17\u900f\u7740\u4e0e\u524d\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u6218\u6597\u4e5f\u662f\u4f20\u627f\u7740\u524d\u4ee3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0clink\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u611f\u89c9\u8fd9\u4f5c\u7684\u201cgal\u8f68\u8ff9\u201d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u660e\u663e\u4e86\uff08\u6ed1\u7a3d\uff09\u3002\n   \u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4e00\u76f4\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b7b\u5fe0\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u5165\u624b\u4e00\u53d1\u3002\u671f\u5f85XSEED\u7ee7\u7eed\u79fb\u690d\uff08\u95ea2\u3001\u96f6\u8f68\u3001\u78a7\u8f68\uff09\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503560060, "timestamp_updated": 1503560060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688385", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34454360": {"recommendationid": "34454360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087296053", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503558408}, "language": "english", "review": "Left me wanting more.

do an exemption, having no no even 20hs in the game but can see the quality and detail, just as Trail of the Sky, i cant remember when was the last time i have so much fun in an RPG, going from town to town meeting new people and talking to every single NPC (all have names and personality, not just background fillers) and of course the main cast is very good with theirs individuals circumstances and back stories, make me want to know them more and feel attachment.

The enchantment from sounds, to dialogue, graphic options is well worth the full price.  If you are a fan of the Legend of Heories Series, dont let the price deter you because the port is so excellent.  There are dozens of pc graphic options you can control and even supports ultra wide resolution!  The game looks sharp and vibrant in high resolution. Not bad for a ps3 port. The voice cast are great and parts that don't have voice, the text translations are top notch.  The OST is pretty good as well.\n\nThe game does have the persona series vibe.  In a sense that you improve your relationship with your teammates by choosing which character you like to build frendship on your free days.  In turns you unlock moves that you can execute in battle once you level them up.  Also has a calender based progression system like persona.  The first few hours does start out very slow because it introduces you to every single one of your classmates.  The skill system reminds me of Final fantasy 7 materia.  You insert whats known as Quartz (maetria) and based on its properites, thats the skill you use.   You then upgrade them as you do battles and they are interchangable among all your teammates.  \n\nNihom/Xseeds lately has released some great old games with excellent ports.

Arts have been knocked down a few notches, with Melee/Crafts taking the front seat in Cold Steel. \n+ Music is Falcom. Enough said. \n+ Story and world building are as great as ever. Tons of twists and turns and an all-around great way to kick off the CS trilogy. \n+ World is vibrant, colorful, and full of different settings. Graphics are goood.  \n+ Turbo Mode is an absolute god send. \n\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\n- A lot of Items (Mainly Quartz) you obtain are pretty underwhelming and never really serve a purpose. \n- A lot of side quests felt rather pointless compared to the ones in the Sky Trilogy. I found myself skipping the dialogue in certain ones entirely, just to get to my reward faster. \n- Main cast of characters in Cold Steel, which mainly consist of typical anime tropes (Not the case at all in the sky trilogy), aren't all that interesting in the beginning and never fully live up to the cast from the Sky Trilogy. Which to be fair, is incredibly hard to live up to, and I guess an unfair comparison after me just playing one game. They do end up eventually evolving way past the point of being just \"typical anime tropes\" though. \n\n\nAs a huge fan of the Trails series, it probably goes without saying that I recommend this game. It's a great starting point for newcomers (I do HIGHLY recommend playing the Sky Trilogy first though) and an absolute must play for fans of the series. Despite my little rant on the characters, I still think the cast is great. I really grew attached to them as the game went on. Some of them are definitely bland at times, but I'm rather hopeful they will continue to grow as I play through the Cold Steel trilogy.\n\nFinal Score - \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606", "timestamp_created": 1503377690, "timestamp_updated": 1507627193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34408100": {"recommendationid": "34408100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069712875", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504154020}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u8bc4\uff01\n\u5b9e\u8bdd\u8bf4\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u6ca1\u6709\u65e5\u914d\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u5931\u671b\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u73a9\u4e86\u4ee5\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u82f1\u914d\u610f\u5916\u7684\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c31\u7528\u82f1\u914d+\u82f1\u6587\u6587\u672c\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u5468\u76ee233\u3002\n\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\uff0cF\u793e\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u6211\u662f\u5728\u662f\u4e0d\u6307\u671b\u592a\u591a\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u5f53\u7136\u65b0\u7684\u5bfc\u529b\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u4e0d\u4e60\u60ef\u3002\n\u4e00\u4e2a\u5165\u57515\u5e74\u7684\u4eba\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e5f\u5c31\u8bf4\u8bf4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65e0\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1503375142, "timestamp_updated": 1503375142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34407309": {"recommendationid": "34407309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162502776", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512634009}, "language": "english", "review": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5199\u5f53\u7136\u662f\u7ed9\u6211\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5566\uff0c\u82f1\u96c4\u4f20\u8bf4\u7cfb\u5217\u4ece\u5c0f\u73a9\u5230\u5927\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u60c5\u6000\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd8\u662f\u559c\u6b22\u4ee5\u524d\u7684q\u7248\uff0c\u95ea\u8f68\u8fd9\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u660e\u663e\u8fd8\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5c31\u662f\u82f1\u8bed\u7684\u770b\u7740\u5f88\u96be\u53d7", "timestamp_created": 1503370905, "timestamp_updated": 1503370905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34406065": {"recommendationid": "34406065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109086300", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 5796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1514598018}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm actually pretty new to the Trails of series, I started out with Sky but saw this came out so I'm trying this first.\n\nVery impressed with the game and it's characters. One thing I do like, is the use of every character where as some RPGs could literally let you use one team to beat it.\n\nI've heard about this franchise back on the PS3 but I've always simply never got the chance to play, now that I did, I'm really enjoying it.\n\nLet's get down to business with the game.\n\nPROS:\n- Pretty well done story \n- Great characters and development and backstories keep getting revealed\n- Has that Persona feel to it with the school system\n- Amazing soundtrack\n- Voice acting in English has been treating me great with a few corny morments here and there, it delivers nicely overall. I'm currently playing through the game in English and will stick to it.\n- The system overall is amazing\n- Keyboard and Mouse controls work phenomenal\n- Also the option for controller support\n- The ability to tweak the settings including skipping intros and cutscenes for the speedrunners\n- Lengthy game that keeps me wondering what happens next\n- Optional quests not being forced on the player for those who just want to focus on the main storyline\n- Bosses give a great challenge\n- Unlike many other games, it makes use of every party member instead of always sticking to certain party members\n- Ability to control every character in your party\n- A Lengthy game giving hours of content and gameplay to do\n- Several other games in the franchise take place at the same time\n\nNeutral:\n- Although the system is amazing, it does seem complicated at first\n- I'm not a fan of the auto removal of ORBS on party members not in your group\n- Optimization and performance on the game isn't crystal perfect as even on a 1070+i7 6700k on Max settings I get hicups here and there on 144Hz.\n- When not in your party, you can't change other characters outfits.\n- There's learning in the game. Now I'm not sure about you but I don't want to learn in these games so for the question answers I honestly just look up a guide like Persona.\n\nNegatives:\n- Sadly the game doesn't have Japanese dub as an option for those who prefer the native language. Though the English voices do deliver very nicely and were very enjoyable throughout this game and 2. (There's ways to put the Japanese voices in a mod)\n- The game still has bugs to work out, it's not 100% perfect\n- Sometimes the game may bug out when playing on a higher refresh rate. (More than 60FPS)\n- You can miss certain items or quests making you have to play NG+ to earn them again\n- This is a personal for me, no auto talk for voices cutscenes.\n- Some character animations like even the basic hi five or slap to the face look TERRIBLE. \n- Many times at 144Hz, they get hit before the animation ever even touched them.\n- Graphically today, it doesn't look too great as it kinda was a portable game. Still as they say, the older games hold lots of replay value. It looks a bit nasty lol.\n\nOverall I can say I give the game a 9/10 Very Great\nAmazing overall game but it still has kinks graphically isn't so great, but delivers on great story and gameplay\n\nI really felt like I missed out on a great RPG, now I will check out other Falcom games.\nNow when will Cold Steel 2 come to PC? I had bought it and beating it on PS3, but wish for a PC version to ToCS2 on here.

Cold Steel is set on the same continent and 1\u00bd years after the events of Trails in the Sky, but in a different country and with a new main cast. Having played Trails in the Sky is not necessary (but highly recommended, they are awesome games after all!), it's fine starting with this one.\n\nPort: Ported by Durante (you might know him as the one responsible for DSFix if you played Dark Souls) the game runs on a toaster and offers a wealth of graphical options. There is also a Turbo Mode, which allows you to speed up the game with the press of a button.\n\nSo, what about the game itself?\n- GREAT story and writing. It starts slow and steady as you get to know the world and its inhabitants and events slowly and slowly escalate and escalate until it culminates into an explosion of awesomeness that blasts your jaw to the ground while you scream internally (and externally) like a little child and then it's over and GIVE ME THAT SECOND GAME NOW.\n- Characters are pretty good. Not as good as the Trails in the Sky cast, but still pretty good. Some of them make a terrible first impression (looking at you Machias) but all of them get a ton of growth and character development over the course of the game.\n- NPCs: If you take the time and talk with them (all of them offer new unique dialog after every little story progression), you learn a lot about the world, their lives, relationships, problems,... Many of them even have  their own little story arcs going on over the course of the game and at the end I knew the students of Thors Military Academy as good as the main cast.\n- Combat is turn-based with a maximum of 4 active party members. It has elements of positioning and turn-order manipluation and the challenge level is pretty good.\n- Music: It's a Falcom game, of course it has an awesome soundtrack :P\n- Length: around 60-80 hours depending on how deliberate you are\n- Voice Acting: No Japanese voices included, but there is a mod for that if you want. The english dub however is very good and has around 5000 more voiced lines than the japanese one.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503253517, "timestamp_updated": 1503253517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767600", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34376652": {"recommendationid": "34376652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165411622", "num_games_owned": 1634, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 65, "last_played": 1514554637}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u95ea\u8f68\u90fd\u4e0aSteam\u4e86\uff0c\u96f6\u78a7\u8f68\u8fd8\u4f1a\u8fdc\u5417\uff08\u5e0c\u671b\u4e0d\u662f\u6709\u751f\u4e4b\u5e74\u7cfb\u5217\u5427\uff09\uff1f\n\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7\u771f\u7684\u65e0\u60c5\uff0c\u53ea\u770b\u597d\u6b27\u7f8e\u7684\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u65e5\u672c\u672c\u571f\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u65e5\u8bed\u914d\u97f3\u90fd\u4e0d\u52a0\uff08\u5176\u5b9e\u82f1\u914d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5927\u5bb6\u90fd\u8ba8\u538c\uff09\n\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728psv\u6253\u4e86\u4e24\u5468\u76ee\uff0c\u4f46pc\u7248\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u8212\u670d\u7684\uff0c\u8d77\u7801\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6253\u4e00\u573a\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e00\u573a\uff08psv\u673a\u80fd\u9650\u5236orz\uff0c\u8c8c\u4f3cpsv\u8fd8\u9501\u5e27\uff09\u8fd8\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u952e\uff0c\u7b80\u76f4\u4e86\u5c31\u662f\u95ea\u8f68evo\uff08\u7b11\uff09\n\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u559c\u6b22\u7a7a\u8f68\u548c\u96f6\u78a7\u8f68\u7684\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u5c0f\u5c0f\u4e2a\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u90fd\u5f88\u53ef\u7231\uff08\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4ee5\u524d\u53ef\u4ee5\u770bNPC\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u5934\u50cf\u6765\u5224\u522b\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u4eba\u7269,\u7b11:\uff09\u4e0d\u559c\u52ff\u55b7\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u89c4\u8ff9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\uff08\u540c\u65f6\u6211\u4e5f\u5f88\u671f\u5f85\u53cc\u661f\u7269\u8bed\u4f1a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5728steam\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\uff09\n\u5fd8\u4e86\u8bf4\u4e86\u6709\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u5c3d\u60c5\u7684\u5241\u624b\u5427\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u6cd5\u8001\u63a7\u4ee5\u540e\u5c06\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u642c\u4e0asteam\u3002[spoiler]\u201c\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u5962\u671b\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5361\u5361\u5e03\u4e09\u90e8\u66f2\u80af\u642c\u4e0a\u4e86\u5c31\u597d\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u53c8\u6709\u591a\u5c11\u4eba\u4f1a\u73a9\u4e0a\u4e2a\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff1f\u201d[/spoiler]\n\u5927\u5956\u53c8\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u6211\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e26\u76d0", "timestamp_created": 1503244671, "timestamp_updated": 1511450513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669260", "comment_count": "17", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34375371": {"recommendationid": "34375371", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000425597", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504541710}, "language": "english", "review": "Give me the other two!

And i'm sure when he finally gets wrecked or he will just join the good guys no questions asked or he will die and say something like \"i was testing your power, now you can go save the world!\"\n\n>Have i mentioned that everyone is completely fucking dumb? like really dumb? no one puts 1+1 together, shit that you know about in the first chapter is, somehow, complete mystery to the characters.\n\n>The animations and cutscenes are horrid, all of them, through the entire game, I've seem games made by a single guy have better animation than this thing, i can't believe a full blown company would do such a lazy job at this, it's like they didn't even tried to do a good job, it's disgusting.\n\n>The game is a fucking theme park, for a series always so lauded by having so much world building you barely see the world, you go to a scene, see what you could call the \"episode of the week\" because it plays out just a like a fucking anime episode, and go to the next scene, 13~15 scenes later the game ends, if this game took more than 6 months to be developed i would be shocked as how fucking lazy the developers are.\n\n>Character development happens as if the characters were leveling up, you don't see a single character developing along the course of the game, just like a anime again, you will have that special episode where suddenly the character will deal with his 2 or 3 problems in life and become a exemplar member of society, and then he will stay like that for the rest of the fucking game, the only exceptions being Emma, Alisa and Rean to a extent.\n\nThe only good part in this game was the soundtrack, not even sound in general, because some of the attacks/abilities sounds like farts when they hit. The soundtrack is amazing though, i give them that.\n\nAlso, the game doesn't have a ending, it just comes to a close in the middle of all the shit.\nNext games that come on PC will be pirated, holy fucking shit i'm angry of wasting money on that piece of shit game, was even thinking about playing it again with the japanese voices but no, will uninstall and hide from my library on steam.\nWhat a fucking dissapointment.\n\nNow, the crux of why i can't recommend this game, the battle mechanics, or better yet, the battle gimmicks.\nAt the start of the game you will not notice this, don't know if by design or if they just gave up later in development, but this game has a lot of debuffs, way more than buffs actually, and every monster is weak to some of these and strong against others, that means you can (at the start of the game) make certain compositions of builds to suit your play styles, like a delay heavy character with a petrify and freeze support and so on, you will have a easier time with monsters that are weak against your composition while you will have a thougher time against monsters strong against these debuffs.\nThat's a very good mechanic for a jRPG, BUT, and that's a very big but, the devs drop the ball hard midgame onwards.\nMonsters and bosses start becoming these specialized gimmick-focused enemies, that are strong against everything but one or two debuffs and dealing almost assuredly debuffs that cripple your party completely, even that wouldn't be a problem, if you could change equips mid battle, but the lack of this mechanic makes it so, unless you use a walkthrough that tells exactly how the enemies have to be beaten, you will get to a battle, die horribly to the mechanic of that boss (monsters you can still run and come back after wasting 10 minutes reorganizing your build) reload your last save, reorganizing the build of your entire party, coming back and curbstomp the boss, because without it's gimmick it's just a normal enemy with a large health pool.\nTHIS IS THE WAY YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT EVERY SINGLE BOSS IN THE GAME.\nyou get in there, die without barely being able to attack because they all use area attacks that give up to three debuffs, and by debuffs i don't mean speed down, or attack down, no, i mean that they, with one AOE attack will freeze, confuse and sleep 3 or 4 of your characters, even if you spread out your characters and keep even two chars for curing status effects (which sometimes will not be possible because the game decide which characters you will have at any given time, you can't choose yourself) the way magic work, makes it so that is not rare for you to queue up a magic to cure the status effect, just for the boss to act before it and debuffing your other characters, so unless you have the comp specialized for that single boss, with all the immunities to his debuffs, you will lose, not because your characters are underleveled or because you can't strategize, but because you didn't knew that for this boss, you needed a nightmare/confuse immunity build on your characters, even though you never fought the enemy or had prior knowledge on it's habilities.\nNot only that, but the boss is also immune to almost every debuff in the game, save one or two, so you know that character that is good because his habilities can delay the monster from acting (really helpful seeing as bosses are fast as fuck in the later parts of the game)? Nope, the bosses are all immune to delay debuff. Know that char that have good faint skills? Nope, immune too. What about freezing? Immune. Burn? Immune. Can i at least mute him to stop him from using those abilities? Nope, he immune to Mute too.\n\nAnd for that reason i just can't recommend this game, it's bosses are way to gimmicky on all the wrong ways and this makes the game a chore and the fact that, unless you have a walkthrough with you, you WILL die that first time you fight the boss because you don't even know it's gimmick, it just makes the game not worth your time.\nSad really, because the first half of the game was amazing.", "timestamp_created": 1503238715, "timestamp_updated": 1505220712, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501725", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34372607": {"recommendationid": "34372607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329759879", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503745973}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u603b\u7b97 \u5543\u5b8c\u751f\u8089\u4e86\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\u5427\u3002\u611f\u89c9\u6700\u540e\u6709\u70b9\u4ed3\u4fc3\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684link\u7cfb\u7edf\u5012\u662f\u633a\u6709\u610f\u601d\u7684\uff0c\u671f\u5f852\u90e8\u51fapc\u5566", "timestamp_created": 1503232818, "timestamp_updated": 1503232818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34368512": {"recommendationid": "34368512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096906041", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 2618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506933360}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9019\u904a\u6232\u771f\u597d\u73a9 \u5230\u73fe\u5728\u9084\u6c92\u7834\u5b8c \u5287\u60c5\u65b9\u9762\u5f88\u8c50\u5bcc \u6230\u9b25\u756b\u9762\u8207\u6230\u9b25\u5167\u5bb9\u8ddf\u524d\u5e7e\u4ee3\u90fd\u6709\u5927\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd~DLC\u53ef\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u62ffEXP~ DLC\u670d\u88dd\u4e0a\u6c92\u6709\u5f88\u559c\u6b61\u7684\u8863\u670d \u597d\u53ef\u60dcQQ\n\u53ef\u60dc\u6c92\u6709\u65e5\u8a9e  \u82f1\u8a9e\u90fd\u6709\u628a\u52a0\u5165\u611f\u60c5((\u4e0d\u932f  \u4f46\u9084\u662f\u7fd2\u6163\u65e5\u8a9e\n\u6700\u559c\u6b61 \u6703\u9577+Alisa's Casuals  \u7d42\u65bc\u7a81\u7834\u4e00\u6b21\u4e86QQ Alisa's Casuals\u9084\u6c92\u544a\u767d\u8ddf\u4e3b\u89d2\u544a\u767d\u5c31  QQ", "timestamp_created": 1503218468, "timestamp_updated": 1512507838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34368120": {"recommendationid": "34368120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076382411", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12358, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513741809}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished my first playthrough, here's what i like about this game (this is just my opinion and may differ from others)\n- Awesome Story\n- Likable Characters and character developments (each character has a story to tell)\n- Solid Battle System\n- A variety of areas to explore\n- Deep lore on the world itself\n- Cool battle music (especially the last boss)\n\nHere what i dont like:-\n- Aside from battle music and the bar music in Reinford, the music is kinda boring\n- A lot of areas are only available for a limited time (if u miss something in that area, then bye-bye, see ya in New Game+)\n\nAll in all, I LOVE this game!\ncurrently doing my second playthrough and trying my best to complete all achievements.\nIf u really decide to pick this game up, i recommend going in blind (dont look at any guides or walkthroughs)\n\nLooking forward to the sequel!

III was more of a Dissidia Final Fantasy type game for my tastes. \n\nTL;DR thoughts: Trails of Cold Steel I is very similar to Trails in the Sky, with more streamlined combat, and a number of 'school' and dungeon aspects that seem reminiscent of the Persona series. Overall, I really enjoyed it, though much like Trails in the Sky I and II...there was enough in Trails of Cold Steel I to suggest II is where the real meat and potatoes will come into play story-wise, so to speak. \n\nMore Detailed Thoughts\n\nCombat: Very similar to Trails in the Sky, but increased CP generation allows it to be a bit more \"fun\". Also, you form links with party members, that allow for additional attacks, minor heals, etc.\n\nCharacters: Like Trails in the Sky, your party is made up of likeable characters. You can tell, right off the bat, that even the cold ones would soften up over time. The main character is a dude this time, but much like Estelle from Trails in the Sky, is the type of good-hearted individual you wouldn't be ashamed of introducing to your parents. There were moments in both Trails in the Sky and Trails of Cold Steel made me kind of wish for less...heartful characters, I guess, but there's something endearingly charming in that, in a world where I tend to want more Game of Thrones instead. The antagonists are largely underdeveloped, but I suspect it's much like the Trails in the Sky series in that it will get much more fleshed out in Trails of Cold Steel II. \n\nStory: One could say it's a little too similar to Trails in the Sky in its design (it was pretty obvious where things were going, especially the \"reveal\" at the end if you had played Trails in the Sky), but I still enjoyed it. I think you can enjoy things that are familiar. Others may disagree. I will say that much like Trails in the Sky I's relationship to II, Trails of Cold Steel I really feels like it's going to end up being more of a prologue to the \"real story\" in Trails of Cold Steel II (and III). That's not to say it isn't good. But, I remember really enjoying Trails in the Sky I, and then when Trails in the Sky II finally became playable...realizing how much larger the story was intended to be. Now that I've seen that formula from this franchise, I think that was always in the back of my mind as I played through Trails of Cold Steel I. \n\nPlayability: It is one solid JRPG. As you can see, I played 58 hours for one playthrough. That might have a couple of hours of pad time for when I took a break for dinner, etc, without turning it off, but that's still old school length of play. And, I definitely missed things, as I hadn't realized there were quests that don't have quest markers; you have to either talk to everyone at least 2-3 times to find them (which I didn't), or use a guide off the internet. I never look at guides on a first playthrough, hence me missing them. \n\nThere's also a new game+ that allows you to carry various things over. If you're a completionist, you'll have to do a number of new game+s to complete everything. I'm not really a completionist. I did carry over the ability to see all character member bonding moments (by default, you are limited on that front, so you'll miss a good chunk of them in one playthrough), and will likely play this again in new game+ when (hopefully) Trails of Cold Steel II is close to release as a refresher. \n\nText/voice: There's a TON of text in this game.

It's fun and the story is decent. Unfortunately the story doesn't end with this installment and you would need to play the sequel to know how everything ties together. \nThe combat system is decent and you can pretty much just rely on physical attack with status effects until the last chapter where arts would do much more damage than physical.\nOverall I liked it and I hope the second installment comes to steam soon!",

While the Trails of Cold Steel trilogy is intended as part of a series (the middle elements of the series, known as Ao No Kiseki and Zero No Kiseki are, unfortunately,  not yet translated to English), it functions quite well as a standalone tale - the wider series references are so sporadic you can just look them up on various trivia websites if you want to stay up to date. \n\nAs to the mechanics - this is a tactical, turn based RPG with a very strong emphasis on story driven gameplay. Basically, the game is split into dungeon crawling segments and story segments. The story might strike you as the typical JRPG \"school-driven character development cliche\", but it's far from that. The game generally tends to subvert and play with many of the traditional JRPG cliches, which is one of its strongest points. \n\nThe story and characters are one of the strongest points not only of the this game, but of the entire Trails series. The main story is complex, yet consistent, with enough subplots to get you hooked, but not enough to make you feel that it's all random. The plot twists are clever and not really that predictable, which makes the storyline all the more appealing.\n\nAs for the combat part of the game, the game does quite well to avoid unnecessary grind - killing just the quest-related monsters on the way is mostly enough to level up your characters to get proper EXP and gear. I would say that for JRPG games, this game definitely ranks in the lower part of the spectrum in terms of grinding. The tactical battles are quite interesting, not being your typical, static JRPG combat with just the selection of different actions - positioning also plays a role, making it more varied and more similar to western RPGs in that respect. Characters choose from a range of standard attacks, magic (arts) and special attacks, with the magic fully customizable due to the Quartz system (carried over with minor changes from previous Trails games). Boss battles are usually quite challenging, although the normal difficulty is probably a bit too easy for the RPG veterans out there - if you want a real challenge, it is recommended that you play at least on Hard.\n\nAs with the Trails in the Sky series, I strongly recommend this game to any RPG fans, not just the JRPG fans out there. In fact, the Trails series are the games that actually got me into JRPGs in the first place. This game does not have the marketing of the huge Namco titles, but I enjoyed it far more than I did many of the AAA productions.", "timestamp_created": 1502971102, "timestamp_updated": 1502971102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34301983": {"recommendationid": "34301983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064537803", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508237999}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u95ea\u4e4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\uff01\u6211\u6c38\u8fdc\u7231\u5c24\u5a1c.jpg\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1502956003, "timestamp_updated": 1502956003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34301520": {"recommendationid": "34301520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015847365", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511859747}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u611f\u8c22XSEED\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u628a\u8fd9\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5e26\u7ed9\u5927\u5bb6\uff01\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u8ba9\u6211\u56de\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u521d\u7684\u611f\u52a8\u3002\u5982\u679c\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u539f\u7248\u8bed\u97f3\u5c31\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\uff01\u5982\u679c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7684\u8bdd\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5f15\u8fdb\u524d\u4f5cEVO\u7248\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60c5\u6000\u7c89\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6562\u51fa\u6211\u5c31\u6562\u4e70\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1502953774, "timestamp_updated": 1502954314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34301513": {"recommendationid": "34301513", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201678438", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503368653}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my fourth Legend of Heroes game played, (the first three being trails in the sky 1-3) and I am still constantly impressed with the story telling, game play quality and music.

The rest is doing odd jobs for the plebs at the not-Japanese highschool or exploring the old school house. You can always tell that tension and plot is boiling beneath the surface but the majority of the time it's on the back burner or ends with some plot stuff happening at the end of each chapter in which the kids somehow bungle themselves into. They're more reactive than proactive. Even in the final chapter, the motivation of the kids to do things is to [spoiler]save the school festival[/spoiler]. The game is also always teasing things and not delivering. See that bike? Next game. See that airship? Next game. See those yellow exits that you can't use on the map?

Still worth the price . I used \"not recommend\"  option becouse this game  shouldnt have similar rating as trail in the sky and \"mixed feeling option\" that describes what I think about this game is not available\n\n***********\n*Edit\n\n So i finished the game. Althought some things started to shine from half of chapter of 3, like plot started to thicken and new engine  started to show its beauty another things pop up like strange plot blocks  (\"my classmate can have crucial information what is going on that can even save our lives but what the hell I will not ask, There is some ill omen above our country but i will focus on festival and  dont interfere ... ) or another genre ingredience to already overrich \"Eintopf\" - too much spices that i can not  enjoy the main flavor of narration.\n\nSo my opinion to this game remained the same , maybe a little more unfavorable. I sense lot of dedication from authors, like in trail in the skyes but at least for  me with wrong choices and directions. After 1st part of Trails in the Sky i shed tears of fury, : i want more  dont let me wait. Here I am ok with waiting, no need of hurry....\n\nPS: Why Jusis, why, arent You the main protagonist!\nPerson I like and will miss are Sara with , Jusis and Angelica.\nPerson I dont like Rean, so bossy so unnatural so hearthless. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn comparison to trails in the Sky: \n\n+ new engine\n- simplified quartz system (no bonus abilities when you haveacumulated in orbment certain amount of orbs from specific class\n- feeling that they added some features that are very popular these days to have bigger number of possible buyers but that  doesnt fit in the game and and especially trails genre very well\n      - attending school, with \"tartarus -PES3\" labyrinth. open for everyone but teachers let explore it exclusively  first grade class without hesitation....and to this point (chapter 3 without any connection to main arc)\n       -card game( every game should have card game, sigh), simple, luck based unnecessary\n\n- different storytelling : In trail in the sky You had 2 basic protagonists with them u got  hooked and then slowly there were added more interesting characters. Here you have only one main character and from start 8 classmates. I personally dont like so big numbers from the  start but it would be ok if only main character wasnt the most boring from all 9. He is so calm so clever without flaws . He is mostly observer . Estelle  from trails in the sky on the other  hand would kicked some ass or threatened to use her stick, or be warned not  bend with skirt so short...simply put she was so lively and real  and i loved her. He is so cold, unnatural\n\nI am now in the middle of chapter 3 i hope that at the end i will change my mind but being  in the middle of game and still not hooked, this takes too long even for Trail game.", "timestamp_created": 1502835458, "timestamp_updated": 1504369841, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.387932", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34264480": {"recommendationid": "34264480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112688140", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511406914}, "language": "english", "review": "i really can't wait cold steel II come to steam, this game is the best (Y)", "timestamp_created": 1502832749, "timestamp_updated": 1511406750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500188", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34259195": {"recommendationid": "34259195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081174212", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502989149}, "language": "english", "review": "I.

other console ports over the years, I have to say this one is extremely good. Performance is excellent, I encountered no crashes during my playthrough, and apart from some cases of the text overflowing the text box and a few spoken lines not matching up to the text, no obvious bugs either. The addition of a turbo mode adds a quality of life improvement that cannot be overstated, especially if you're replaying a section of the game.\n\nThe game itself is pretty damn good too. No Japanese voices is a bit of a shame, but the English ones are pretty good, ranging from eh to great, depending on the character.

Urgh! Honestly, I couldn't care less of nobility like the initial Machias. The endeavours of Class VII of Thors Military Academy comprising of nine gifted students are the crux of the whole plot. You will have military students trying to save the world with the guidance of more experienced affiliates. \n\nPersonally, I am not really into their endeavours riddled with \"plot convenience.\" All this while, as I continue playing JRPGs, I failed to understand on the convenience of the plot. For example, in FF franchise, if someone dies outside of battle, why can't anyone just use Phoenix Down to save the dying person? Those are the kind of things that seem unexplainable. In ToCS case, I encountered a situation where Comrade C could have died by my hands if not for the advancement of story.\n\nIn short, I am bitter with the series but I will still recommend the game as I adore the very concept instilled since Trails in the Sky; quartz system and turn-based system that are the centre of the JRPG. What I don't like since the beginning is the cast. I can honestly say that I am like the initial Fie that don't give a damn about other characters except Sara.

What defining factor does this game have that can have the same effect on someone who has played these for years, to someone who has never heard of this series before and even to someone who only plays for whatever abstract reason modern day gamers assign themselves? \n\nIs it the gameplay?

I loved everything about the game from the combat to the story. I could break down the game in sections like some people do when reviewing it, but I rarely review games so I'm just going to simplify it. All I can say is combat was really interesting, each character gets an ultimate attack that reminded me of a mystic arte from the Tales Of series if you've played any of those. Of course like most RPG's as you level up you'll unlock new techniques as well. The game's magic system lets you discover new quartz that when equipped let you use different spells. Some of the spells are passive spells, such as increasing the amount of sepith you obtain, or having a chance to inflict debuffs on enemies when attacking them.\n\nOf course you also have plenty of side things to do, for instance there is a fishing mini-game and the game has 20 different kinds of fish. If you catch them all then you'll get a trophy and prizes. The game also has a cooking system in which you collect recipes, and just like the fishing challenge you can be rewarded for collecting all the recipes as well. I'm sure you probably guessed it, but the game does have a NEW GAME+ mode as well, so even after beating the game you can start a new game carrying over your level, equipment, spells, items, etc. The only downside you'll probably experience is having to wait for for Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 2 to come out on Steam because I will warn you, the game ends on a MASSIVE cliffhanger that will have you saying \"What? COME ON!!!  I WANT TO KEEP PLAYING!!! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!!\" \n\nOverall I'd easily give the game a 9/10, I had no real problems with the game. The port is excellent, though I can recall one or two times it did freeze on me but technical issues are super rare from my experience.

If you have played the Trails in the Sky trilogy, don't even think, just buy it, you won't regret it. \n\n[b] Story [/b]\n\nAs you probably already know, this is the first game of the Erebonia arc. However, the story took a really different path than I was expecting. Not in a bad way though, it really took me by surprise. Falcom again proves that their JRPGs are the best as far as the story is concerned. You control Rean Schwarzer, as he joins a military academy as part of Class VII, which is different from the other classes as it doesn't follow the class system, and the nobles and commoners are treated equally. This leads to less than ideal situations, and it mostly falls to our protagonist to sort it out. \n\n[b] Soundtrack [/b]\n\nI won't even explain this. Falcom JDK compose the best soundtracks, peroid. If anyone doesn't accept that, they should just bend over and consider where their life went wrong.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nThis game has a turn based combat similar to the Trails in the Sky games and the other Legend of Heroes games. The artes/magic works using the orbment+quartz system. However, this games features an enhanced versio of that system, called Arcus, which makes it significantly easier to use, although I have mixed feelings about that. I mean it's way too simplified. But nonetheless the combat is insanely fun.\n\n[b] NPCs and Characters [/b]\n\nThe NPCs and the other main characters are good enough but I can't say they are as good as the older Trails games, but they still kept me entertained. And, the antagonists. Well, I gotta say they just can't hold a candle to the likes of Wiessmann, Loewe or Campanella. Ah, well, but the good thing is that I have heard the badies from Obs make a return in the subsequet games. \n\n[b] PC Port [/b]\n\nThis port is in one word perfect. The launcher lets you change each and every graphics option, from Anti-Aliasing to Ambient Occlusion, FOV, Shadow Resolution, Transparency AA, pretty much everything, plus they have also included NVIDIA's advanced AO algorithm HBAO+. But thats not it, there is an explanation of each option on the side with images, comparing the various levels of the effect/option. I have got to say. I really am impressed.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\n\nDo you like RPGs? \nDo you like JRPGs?\nDo you like video games with good stories and an innovative turn-based combat? \nIf the answer to any of those Qs is yes then just buy the damn game already.\nLiked the review?\nRead the complete thing [url=https://www.techquila.co.in/single-post/The-Legend-of-Heroes-Trails-of-Cold-Steel-Launches-on-PC] here [/url] (screenshots also included):", "timestamp_created": 1502607659, "timestamp_updated": 1502607792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501511", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34207285": {"recommendationid": "34207285", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137164816", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 4236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509799914}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ec8\u4e8e\u51faPC\u4e86\uff0c\u7b49\u4e864\u5e74\u4e86\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u95ea2PC", "timestamp_created": 1502605102, "timestamp_updated": 1502605102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34207127": {"recommendationid": "34207127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109853511", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507356913}, "language": "english", "review": "Taking place on the same continent as Trails in the Sky, Cold steel doesn't require you to play the previous games, Cold steel 1 was made so that new players can jump in.\n\nTo put it shortly the game has:\n+Great Story, The story is long (took me about 80 hours) and falcom writing is great as always even though this game is kinda like a set up game for the next ones by introducing all the characters etc. (like FC in sky series) so dont expect anything too great from the first game.\n\n+Likeable characters, all the characters have great backgrounds and everyone finds their own favourite, only ones i found lacking were the villains, they just seemed too lackluster in terms of personality.\n\n+Combat, combat is turn based and has been made smoother with 60fps and new link system, arts have been simplified atleast in my opinion, which is dissapointing but it doesnt take away from the experience because the story is great overall.\n\n+Soundtrack is great, but sky series had better in my opinion.\n\n+Turbo mode makes it faster for those only interested in the story and for those who have already played the ps version\n\n+/-Great voice acting, i saw some thread about not buying the game because there was no Japanese voices, but the dub was great and it doest take away from the experience and there was a mod for Jap. voices.\n\n+/-School setting and the political conflict kept me interested but some might find it repetitive when they spend so much time on it in this game.\n\n-Alot of missable stuff, but this is just a thing that i dont like\n\n-Random crashes and game freezes(Maybe it was just me)\n\n-Graphics might look a bit outdated, but it really doesnt matter in this game\n\ntltr:\nIf you want an lenghty JRPG with smooth combat, school setting and likeable characters[spoiler]Waifus[/spoiler] then this is your pick, falcom delivers!

The closest comparison I have to classic JRPG combat systems would be Lunar: The Silver Star, with somewhat tactical turn based combat where a character's positon relative to the enemies is important. This game can seem difficult to newcomers, but it rewards mastery by making you feel very powerful. There's nothing quite like playing the system well enough to deny the boss a single turn on nightmare difficulty.\n\n- Also in comparison to Lunar, this game has a large variety of colorful NPCs who have their own stories going on that wll upadate constantly as the game progresses. If you like incidental dialogue and banter, then this is the game for you!\n\n- This is a game that takes place in an ongoing continuity. While this is a very good starting point into the larger series, this game is part of the larger \"Trails\" series, which includes the \"Trails in the Sky\" trilogy and the (currently unrealeased in English) Crossbell duology. If you liked the worldbuilding of games like Suikoden, then this is a series you will really want to sink your teeth into. This game is the Suikoden 6 you've always wanted!\n\n- An excellent soundtrack.\n\n- A very good PC port. It runs at a solid 60 FPS on my rig, with pretty good quality. Considering this has been upscaled from a PS3/Vita game, I'm pretty impressed. I've also heard that this runs fine on a toaster, so that's good too. They've also added a Turbo mode akin to the one in FFXII Zodiac Age, which gives you the opportunity to fast forward through the game's slower moments without interrupting the music or voice acting. There are currently a few issues with running this game at an uncapped framerate, but it looks like the developers are working on that and there is currently a beta out which implements some of those fixes.\n\nCons:\n\n-Slow Pace. This game takes it's time to build up to the crazy parts. If you've already played \"Trail in the Sky\" you are already familiar with the sort of way theses games are paced. This game is mostly focused on establishing the setting and characters. If you are good for a slow burn, and are willing to play a game that is structured more like a book, you will be ok with this, but it is worth warning newcomers about.\n\n- A handful of bugs. While I have not personally experienced these issues, I have seen that some people are having trouble with crashes on AMD GPUs. I have also seen that there are issues with certain third party video codecs that can cause a crash on startup. It looks like the devs are aware of these issues and are working on fixes, but be aware of them before you buy.\n\nOther:\n\n-No dual audio. I don't consider this  to be an issue, since the English dub is exceptional. We've really come a long way since the days of FFX. That said, you should be aware that is the state of the game you will be buying. This is because Japanese copyright law has some really weird stipulations when it comes to licensing the audio tracks. An undub patch does exist if you absolutely can't stand English audio.\n\n\nIf you've read all of the above, and you're still intrigued, then I think you will enjoy this game, as well as the \"Trails in the Sky\" trilogy that came before this. Go ahead and get this game, play through it, and then you can join in the chant of my people as we say \"Crossbell When?\"\n\nCrossbell When?", "timestamp_created": 1502594427, "timestamp_updated": 1502594427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34204979": {"recommendationid": "34204979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078943705", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505716120}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u671f\u5f85\u95ea2\u79fb\u690d", "timestamp_created": 1502593597, "timestamp_updated": 1502593597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34204455": {"recommendationid": "34204455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296288271", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503750119}, "language": "schinese", "review": "I prefer a English/Japanese voice selection,n what do u say?", "timestamp_created": 1502591176, "timestamp_updated": 1502591176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553073", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34203970": {"recommendationid": "34203970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247094736", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506435176}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u6c38\u8fdc\u559c\u6b22\u4e9a\u7eff\u838e.jpg", "timestamp_created": 1502588811, "timestamp_updated": 1502588811, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34203708": {"recommendationid": "34203708", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319980795", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508205082}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a long game, give it some time and you will be rewarded.", "timestamp_created": 1502587554, "timestamp_updated": 1502587554, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34202639": {"recommendationid": "34202639", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960891146", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 5331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502581753}, "language": "english", "review": "GAT DAMN", "timestamp_created": 1502582808, "timestamp_updated": 1502582935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34201664": {"recommendationid": "34201664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195114666", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504784557}, "language": "english", "review": "The story and cast isn't quite as strong as the 'Trails in the Sky' games and it's clear that Falcom aimed this at a difference audience.

I already played it on my PS Vita and I fell in love with it. But right now, the ultimate version is on PC. Falcom, you did it great!!!\n\nTechnically, runs great at solid 60 FPS at 4K resolution (3840x2160) on my GTX 1070. The game looks beautiful, pretty smooth.\n\nRight to the game itselt, this is one of the best games that Falcom has made. I fell in love with the Trails in the Sky series, but this game does one step further. Refined gameplay, improved combat system, refined Orbment system, even though I prefer the combinations what you could do in Trails in the Sky, for example, if you want to use an art called Death Scream, you have to combine certain different types of quartz and so on. Here in Trails in Cold Steel, you only need a quartz called Death Scream and there you are. There are some simplifications, but they are ok. Furthermore, you get the Master Quartz, which allows you to boosts the stats of your characters and get some skills. I struggled to get used to it, considering I came from Trails in The Sky, but finally I got used to it and liked it.\n\nThe combat system is almost the same as always, but improved. Now you can link the attacks between two characters, or you can perform a Rush attack, in which all characters attack at once. This new feature it's really cool!!\n\nNow, the party can contain more than four characters, even though only four are the active. However, you can exchange a character with other, so your combats gonna be more strategic.\n\nThere are a lot of other improvements in terms of cooking system, quests system, inventory system, etc.\n\nBut where the game really stands out is in the character development and story. I'm not gonna spoil you, for the people who didn't play the game yet, but we are in one of the best plot in a JRPG. Basically, I'm only gonna say that we are in the prelude of a civil war. And our young heroes, the class VII, enters into the party. The noble faction and the commoner faction have an increasing tension in the internal businesses of the Erebonian empire, and the class VII slowly begins to know what's going on. We have nine characters: Rean, Elliot, Gaius, Alissa, Laura, Machias, Jusis and Fie, each one with their own personalities, dreams, aspirations, doubts, fears and a past.\n\nAnd of course, there are a bit of fan service with the girls xD All of them are waifus, but if I would have to choose, I like Laura, I think she is the best girl of the game.\n\nSo, If you enjoyed Trails of The Sky series, you will fall in love with this game, so make yourself a favor and buy it!!!\n\n... oh.... yes.... there are a bit more Olivier (or Olivert) in this game also.", "timestamp_created": 1502557123, "timestamp_updated": 1511646880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34195430": {"recommendationid": "34195430", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026378014", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505059908}, "language": "english", "review": "My best purchase this year.

And what a game it is.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is a turn-based JRPG that is heavily story-based, building off of the world developed in its predecessors, the Sky trilogy. The game takes place in the Erebonian Empire, one of the military superpowers of the Zemurian continent. It focuses on Rean Schwarzer, a first-year student at the esteemed Thors Military Academy, as well as the rest of his classmates in Class VII as they undertake field studies and proceed through the academy's rigorous curriculum. Now, I know what you're probably thinking right now. \"Dammit, Japan, another school life trope?\" I thought the same thing at first. But, if I learned anything about the series from the Sky games, it's that the Trails series tends to have a slow start but a HUGE payoff later. So bear with me here, folks, because Cold Steel has a lot more to offer than it appears on the surface.\n\nThe combat system is in a turn-based format, much like the other Trails games, but is significantly faster-paced compared to the Sky games. The core concepts of Trails combat still remain - that being turn bonuses, arts/crafts, and S-Breaks. However, Cold Steel brought with it a whole new addition to the combat system that speeds it up and makes it more reactive: the ARCUS system. The way the ARCUS system works is that it \"links\" two of your party members together. Depending on their link experience (which can also be called \"bond strength\"), they can have special interactions during battle. This is achieved mostly through the new \"unbalance\" mechanic. Each character has a different proficiency in four different types of attack damage, and each enemy has weaknesses and resistances to the proficiencies - not in damage, but in likelihood of being unbalanced. Successfully unbalancing an enemy allows a link attack to commence. The linked character can instantly follow up with an attack of their own, without delaying their turn or interrupting their casting. Higher link levels add some neat perks to the system, such as auto-healing a damaged partner or covering them to shield from damage.\n\nYou can gain link experience just by fighting with your party, but that is significantly slower than the main way of obtaining them: bonding events. In between each field study, in which your party gets sent to a different location in the Empire for a few days, the party remains on the academy campus, going about their lives as students. During free days, the main character can interact with specific characters at certain times to trigger bonding events. Completing a bonding event will significantly raise the character's link experience with Rean, with a drawback: you only have a certain amount of bonding points per day, so you cannot see all bonding events on one playthrough.\n\nWhile Nihon Falcom made some pretty drastic changes to the general formula of the Sky games, the focus stays the same: world-building, story progession, and music are the top three priorities, and Cold Steel shines in all of them. The music quality and instrumentation has improved from the Sky trilogy, which already had exceptional music, and while the story can be somewhat cliche at times, Falcom has a bad habit of throwing unexpected plot twists into the works. Much like the ending of Sky FC, Cold Steel's finale caught me completely off guard multiple times in the final hour of gameplay alone. I thought I had everything figured out, too.\n\nMy one biggest gripe about Cold Steel is the change in the orbment system from the Sky series. In the Sky games, orbal arts were granted by elemental values from the quartz you equipped, along with the stats those quartz granted. Here, it's practically reversed. The same stat quartz are in the game, but give you no arts - there are separate quartz that grant arts by themselves. You can find \"rare\" quartz in chests that also offer stats: for example, the default Soul Blur quartZ grants the Soul Blur art, while a rare Soul Blur grants the art plus an additional 2 speed. One of my favorite things about the Sky trilogy was the amount of flexibility and strategy you could use in orbment and arts setups, but it's practically trivialized in Cold Steel. However, there are a few new quartz with some very interesting effects, so it balances out, I suppose.\n\nPeople tend to shy away from English dubs of Japanese media, with some even refusing to buy dubbed Japanese games (you know who you are), but Cold Steel's dub is very high quality. XSEED has shown themselves to be very good at casting its voice actors as well as its translation quality, as there were no voices that were not fitting for the character or that I didn't like. This is worth a mention on its own as most English dubs tend to be lacking, but not here. XSEED pulled out all the stops.\n\nWhile on the surface Cold Steel looks just like generic school life weeb garbage, the Trails series is known as one of the best JRPG franchises on the market, and for good reason. Sure, it panders to that audience a bit more than its predecessors (if it sells, it sells), but the core qualities that makes the series so damn good remain. It is important to note that you do NOT need to play the Sky games before picking up Cold Steel; it can be played entirely on its own, although there are some minor references to the Sky games in the dialogue and story. And, as a Trails game, it is quite long. It took me sixty (yes, SIXTY) hours to complete my first playthrough, and I'm fairly sure I missed a few side quests. The price tag may seem a bit steep, but $40 is more than worth it for the game's quality. It's got its share of issues, such as slow pacing, but practically everything else is outstanding. If you're a fan of the JRPG genre (and ESPECIALLY if you've already played the Sky trilogy), I very highly recommend picking up Cold Steel. I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming port of Cold Steel II.\n\nOn a final note, Towa is best girl.

It's great.  The characters are lovable, the story is engrossing, the music rocks, the combat has precisely the right level of complexity, and the exposition and world-building are unparalleled.  If you're familiar with the series you know all this, of course.\n\nIf you're [i]not[/i] familiar with the series, you should know that it is one of the longest running high quality RPG series out there, with a lineage and pedigree on par with Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest.  While you'd generally be recommended to pick up Trails in the Sky FC and SC first, Cold Steel is an acceptably entry point for the series as well, although you'll miss out on some references and have some events from earlier games spoiled.\n\nBeing the first part of a three-part series, it necessarily starts off a little on the slow side -- but it builds up [b]much[/b] faster than Trails in the Sky FC, alleviating easily the largest complaint about that particular duology.\n\nOn the technical side, the port is almost peerless.  It has a few very minor issues, but nothing gamebreaking unless you intend to play with an unlocked framerate right now (Don't, it's still in testing and the 60fps option is buttery smooth).  With everything cranked up to max, the excellent art direction and shading more than make up for the relatively modest polygon count and texture resolution; it's a beautiful game.\n\nIf you like JRPGs and aren't turned off by a game with a structure somewhat similar to the latter Persona games (3, 4, and 5), you will absolutely have a great time with Cold Steel.", "timestamp_created": 1502297297, "timestamp_updated": 1502297297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34127069": {"recommendationid": "34127069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342091579", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502465118}, "language": "english", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502292045, "timestamp_updated": 1502292045, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34126419": {"recommendationid": "34126419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176404031", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509036628}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b21\u826f\u5fc3\u7684\u79fb\u690d\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u540d\u4ece\u7a7a\u8f68\u4e00\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u63a5\u89e6\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u6700\u7231\u8fd9\u7cfb\u5217\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u4eba\u8bbe\u548c\u58f0\u4f18\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u95ea\u4e4b\u8f68\u8ff92\u4e5f\u5c3d\u5feb\u79fb\u690d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502289849, "timestamp_updated": 1502289849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34124931": {"recommendationid": "34124931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309445401", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 3771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506439452}, "language": "schinese", "review": "WE NEED CHINESE PLEASE!\n\u867d\u7136\u95ea\u8f681\u548c2\u65e9\u5c31\u5728psv\u4e0a\u73a9\u8fc72\u904d\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u95ea3\u9a6c\u4e0a\u53d1\u552e\uff0c\u80fd\u5728pc\u4e0a\u518d\u590d\u4e60\u4e00\u904d\u524d\u4f5c\u5267\u60c5\u662f\u518d\u597d\u4e0d\u8fc7\u7684\u4e86\uff0c\u679c\u65ad\u5165\u624b\u3002\u95ea\u8f68\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u95ea1\u548c\u95ea2\uff0c\u90fd\u6bd4\u524d\u4f5c\u7a7a\u96f6\u78a7\u8981\u5dee\u8fdc\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u8fd8\u5c1a\u80fd\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u95ea\u8f68\u4e24\u4f5c\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u6765\u8bf4\u771f\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff01BGM\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u6bd4\u524d\u4f5c\u90fd\u8981\u5f3a\uff08\u542c\u97f3\u4e50\u987a\u5e26\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\uff09\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u964b\u4e0d\u8fc7\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u8fd8\u662f\u633a\u8212\u670d\u7684\uff0c\u6218\u6597\u7684link\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed9\u56de\u5408\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u723d\u5feb\u611f\uff0c100\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u771f\u7684\u662f\u5f88\u5212\u7b97\u3002\u5e0c\u671bps4\u7684\u95ea3\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5267\u60c5\u548c\u753b\u9762\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b49\u4e0d\u53ca\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1502284559, "timestamp_updated": 1502284559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34122852": {"recommendationid": "34122852", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064111493", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1513936138}, "language": "english", "review": "Will edit this as I go but so far I'm really impressed with the game.

Overall I enjoy it and the animations for those attacks are awesome especially the Super CP one's; feels like Tales Mystic Arts\n\nThe story has yet to really start so will talk about it more later but like I said the world building and characters already hooked me in :D\n\nAnother thing that hooked me in to this game was the music. It's awesome like any other falcom games; YS is already really good and damn this continues that streak for Falcom\n\nThere's nothing to dislike about the game other than the graphics look a bit outdated like any other Falcom game; In the future, hopefully they get a better in that department. Once they nail that and the characters models, this series and every other Falcom game will be a lot more better overall\n(I can excuse this one because I have played other Falcom games before so I know)\n\nAnyways so far 10/10!\nFrom the look of things this is going to be a long journey\nand I look forward to continue take part in Class VII story!!!\n\nJust absoutely love the fact that it's a mix of almost every JRPG I've played especially Persona/Tales and FF xD\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1502277180, "timestamp_updated": 1502277180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34122535": {"recommendationid": "34122535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208874073", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502791192}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cfb\u5217\u4f9d\u7136\u90a3\u4e48\u68d2   \u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u628a2.3\u548c\u96f6\u78a7\u4e5f\u642c\u4e0a\u6765\u5c31\u66f4\u68d2\u68d2\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1502276087, "timestamp_updated": 1502276087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34120978": {"recommendationid": "34120978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179586598", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506154267}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Persona, I love the Tales Of Series.

cast and all of that jazz.\n\nthe gameplay in the game is clean, its smooth and it is turn based. \nthe soundtracks amazing, however sometimes the characters are lacking.\nthere is a continuation for this game, legend of heroes tcs 2, and that continues after the end of this game, so if you're wanting a \"finished ending\" you're going to have to buy the second game.\n\nthe only problems I can say for the most part in this game that may arise for some people is the format of the game is somewhat repetitive, however I think the story and the overall quests override my irritation of that, and could be said for others.\n\nI'd definitely say buy this game if you're looking to play a good JRPG on your PC.

eventually come to pc because trails in the sky series hit here as well. and we get a enhanced edition for 40 bucks. I honestly say this is a good and fair price for what you are getting. yes, the game is older but it's also looking far better on pc, spoken dialogue has increased by 50% (the voice acting is REALLY good and i normally bitch about no japanese voice acting for these types of games) you have durante, the guy who fixed dark souls for pc helping with the port (huge plus imo) and you get a game that will grip you all the way to the end of it. which is around 60-150 hours i'm told. you can even change some things that will move to your save file for part 2 of the game which will probably be here in about a year. gives me time to replay it a few times. so price of 40 is acceptibe.\n\nnow for this game, it's very similar to persona 3 and 4. you are at a military academy and you get bondings with each character that increases their relationships with you and increases how good you sync with them in battle as well. all months are scheduled by basically Free day > practical exam > field study > repeat. now this formula works for this type of game. it's not boring at any point (i'm 30 hours in and i bought it 4 days ago. to be honest i haven't played a game this much since... hell, persona 4 when i beat that in a week or 2 while working a full time job p4 is 80 hours...) \n\nfights in this game are very similar to the old legend of hereos games except they now have link system attached to the game which allows for you to get assist hits from the other characters in your group. as you rank up this also ads moves like cover for the party members and auto heal. \n\nI will have to say the best aspect of this game isn't something that normally people want i guess. i only have ever seen it in the pc version of FFX. which is turbo mode. this allows you to speed time up and have grinding take you far less time than it would normally. you can set it in the settings from 2x to i think it was 8x. it's a great system for these types of games that is always neglected. \n\nthe story is where legend of heroes games shine. this story is about rean joining the military academy of Thor. he joins it and finds out that there his uniform is different than other members of the school. which is nobles wear white outfits and commoners where green. his uniform is red. he finds out later that day when he meets up with his teacher that his class of 9 is a mixture of noble and commoner. now each character has their own personalities. two of them hate eachother ALOT. one hates you for that STUPID trope of he touched my boobs (seriously... get rid of that damn trope...made me hate alisa for no real good reason) you have your quiet ninja girl and you have a outsider to the empire that doesn't get your class system. I love the characters in this story and how they interact with one another and how they overcome their problems.  as the game progresses new mysteries on characters are introduced to keep you wanting more. they did it very well in this game.\n\nall in all this is probably one of the if not the best JRPG on pc at the moment. if you see this before week one is up it's 10% off for 35 bucks. it's worth every penny. though steam totally screws up the dlc and if you want the costumes i'd buy this game on gog... it's 10 bucks on gog for the dlc while here it's 2 bucks for each outfit and their are 10 outfits...", "timestamp_created": 1502153984, "timestamp_updated": 1502153984, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34092661": {"recommendationid": "34092661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335095254", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508338914}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u53e5\u8bdd\uff1a\u82f1\u914d\u5f88\u86cb\u75bc\uff0c\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u5f88\u7ed9\u529b\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u65e9\u65e5\u51fa\u65e5\u914dXD", "timestamp_created": 1502152672, "timestamp_updated": 1502152672, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34091638": {"recommendationid": "34091638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161652530", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502163894}, "language": "english", "review": "So I've already played and beat the PS3 version of the game, but I suppose I can write a review for it here\n\nPositives:\n-Great voice acting which improved of the PS3 version (no more Silent Rean)\n-Engaging combat that has you pay attention to position\n-An interesting story with a few neat plot twists\n-Turbo mode!\n-Ability to skip cutscenes in second playthroughs\n-Runs great even on low end PCs\n-Ability to buy missable items\n\n\nNegative\n-May miss some references or be overwhelmed by the lore\n-The plot seems to slog at certain points\n-Arts and Quartz have been simplified with less customization compared to Skies\n-Graphics are a but still and outdated\n\nUnknown\n-The game occasionally had freezes and crashes in the PS3 version including on startup\n-Money problems (praise the omelette boy)\n\nI'm going to warn you that this is a long game and only part 1 of 2 (we're not sure how CS3 will work but it's after this arc), but if you are willing to commit the time it will be worth it. The legend of heroes trails series is a game that takes place in segments with part 1 being the Skies games (this is a good game to get into the series though), but the series splits in part two between the Cold Steel and the unlocalized Crossbell series. Anyways, Cold Steel is about a boy named Rean beginning his life at school in which he works with a specially formed class called class VII (in reference to lucky #7 I'm guessing). You'll be going through a bit of a pattern of school life, doing quests, then going to the haunted school house followed by the class field study. The field studies are kind of the meat of the story where the plot moves forward despite being its own sub-plot. Once you hit chapter 4 of 6, things start getting interesting so try to hold through until that point.\n\nBut I recommend this game because it's very simple and easy to follow once you get the basics down. It's also a lot of fun as the cast is lovable (who doesn't love Sarah). And if the price turns you off, it's cheaper than most shelf games and about the price of skies 3rd, which this game is longer and more worth your buck. My biggest fear was due to CS II being laggy on the PS3, I thought this game might share a similar fate, but it has run great so far. Only weird error is some movement when switching directions on my DS4 controller Rean walks instead of runs but it's not a major issue. If you want to get into the Trails series, I absolutely recommend going to this one first as many of Skies' gameplay can be offputting.", "timestamp_created": 1502148139, "timestamp_updated": 1502148139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566105", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34089156": {"recommendationid": "34089156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159430911", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508884208}, "language": "english", "review": "As a long time Trails and Falcom fan, having played all the previous Trails games, I will say this game is just amazing!\nOnly played for an hour and already shocked by the production value of this game on PC.

"last_played": 1502067491}, "language": "english", "review": "So- forward. I haven't beaten this game yet. It's hella long, and I use the valley girl terminology because I haven't finished the game yet, but here's my opinion so far.\n\nThis game is great, if you're patient. \n\nIt starts with a prologue featuring characters you don't know not particularily showing off their unique personality traits, fighting a threat that you don't quite understand, to save some land mass or another that you aren't really sure what it is.\nThen we flash back and you go through a bunch of cutscenes and don't really have any meaningful exploration for a long time, and your first interaction with the world keeps you out of every building except the one you're supposed to go to in a whole town of buildings, then your first real open, explorable instance is a dungeon with narrow pathways and a set party of character that aren't in the all important in media res prologue. And then you're introduced to literally 10 characters at once, all of which have those weird \"Japanese trying to be German\" kind of names. You know the ones. The main character is \"Rean Schwarzer\". Yes, every other name will be about in that vein, and yes, every character introducing themselves to every other character will use first name/last name, no matter how unimportant or even impeding to the situation it would be to introduce their last name. Seriously. There's a whole chapter and several interpersonal conflicts in the game that could be avoided if the characters just introduced themselves casually with their first name.\n\nHowever, after that, things start to open up. The first chapter introduces a ton of characters that will be in your party, and not only are they all playable, you can do bonding events to give your character better unison attacks with them in combat. Your choices change stats and how you would most optimally play the game. I mean, I'm sure there's a speedrun optomized bonding strategy, but it seems like no matter who you choose to be friends with, there are advantages.\n\nAlso, the game is (almost) all voice acted, with only odd parts of scenes cutting out of dialogue into that kind of chat.. bubbling sound. You know the one. I thought the voice acting fit the characters pretty well, and there were only a few issues there. The protagonist breathes really heavily at the end of any line that has emotion, the lead love interest has a nasaly voice that sounds weird when she says \"fire\", which is a pain because she has a fire ability by default, and there were not pop guards on the mic because everybody says their t's way too prominently. Honestly, though, those are tiny complaints, and it's not like the voice actors were at all bad, so honestly it's pretty solid. The music is good, combat sounds are fitting, generally pretty solid.\n\nThe combat system, though, is why this game makes the big bucks and the good reviews. I mean, this is a game for the patient, but if you are patient, you can learn why this game kicks so much butt. You get this kind of \"master build\" orb, which changes your stats, and on it you put little mini orbs that give you moves, abilities, and stat boosts. So you can build your characters to be whatever you want them to be and change them on the fly. There's like 3 different currencies to get there, but again, if you're patient, you make the big bucks. Combat begins in the overworld, and if you aren't careful, that might be where it ends. You have a field attack that's there to stop monsters for a second so you can run past them, unless you attack them from the rear, which stuns them.\n\nA normal \"approach from the rear\" by you gives your team one extra turn each. A stunned monster attacked from the rear gets two turns of damage and a health decrease. However, even if you've punched a monster four times, stolen it's treasure, and ran off into the horizon, if it attacks you the monsters start surrounding your team with two turns each. This will kill the greater half of your team most of the time unless you're playing easy. But provided that blunder doesn't kill you, the battle can begin!\n\nYou have like 3 different meters, and they have their own names but I don't care so I'm calling them what they are. HP, MP, and like... rage or something. You run out of HP you die. You run out of MP you can't use your cool two turn charge attacks, revives, and most of the heals. Run out of rage and you have to punch something again to get it back, and it's used for instant, character specific special attacks and really strong entire meter draining... mega attacks? Let's go with mega attacks.\n\nBut that's not what makes the combat fun.\n\nIt's fun because it exists in a 3-d plane that your characters can move around in. If they're too far away to hit an enemy, they will move up as close as they need to, provided they can make it that far, and hit the enemy. You can also sacrifice a turn to move which is often strategically advantageous, since magic takes a hot second to cast and you can see on the ground where the casting radius will be. Since every monster has a location and space they take up, positioning is a big deal. If your group has your durable people in the front, wimps in the rear healing, you'll be way better off against physical threats that would have to blow through your front line, howeever AOE magic spells would hit everyone at once.\n\nAnd enemies really require knowledge on how to beat them. You'll die a bunch unless you read a walkthrough or grind a ton. For example, there's a set of 3 enemies that have a good chunk of health but don't do a lot of damage at first, but when you kill one they use a new skill called \"distress signal\" or something, which does a ton of damage to everybody.

Et puis je le trouve vraiment sympa.\n\nMais avant toute chose, j'aimerais rappeler que, comme vous l'avez s\u00fbrement remarqu\u00e9, le jeu est uniquement en anglais (et japonais). Vu que les dialogues font partie du coeur du jeu, un bon niveau en anglais (ou le minimum pour bien comprendre) est requis, sinon, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du jeu serait donc amoindri vu que vous auriez du mal \u00e0 profiter des dialogues qui contribuent \u00e0 l'ambiance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du jeu. Ou alors vous pouvez aussi vous servir du jeu pour enrichir votre vocabulaire, et un coup de Shift+Tab avec Google Traduction peut vous aider \u00e0 rapidement traduire des mots ou phrases que vous ne comprenez pas. Cela pourrait vous aider \u00e0 vous am\u00e9liorer par exemple.\n\nLe dernier point avant de passer \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation concerne la fameuse question : \"Est-ce que je dois jouer \u00e0 Trails in the Sky d'abord ?\"\n\nVous avez peut-\u00eatre remarqu\u00e9 que sur Steam, il existe trois jeux de la s\u00e9rie \"Trails in the Sky\" (elle-m\u00eame sous-s\u00e9rie de The Legend of Heroes), ces derniers pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent Trails of Cold Steel \u00e0 la fois dans leur ordre de sortie et chronologiquement.\n\nCependant, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir fait les Sky avant, puisque Cold Steel est une nouvelle trilogie avec de nouveaux personnages et se passant dans d'autres endroits que ceux de Sky. J'avais moi-m\u00eame commenc\u00e9 Sky avant de craquer et plonger dans la version Vita de Cold Steel tr\u00e8s peu de temps apr\u00e8s. Je n'ai d'ailleurs toujours pas fini Sky \u00e0 l'heure o\u00f9 j'\u00e9cris ces lignes. Au lieu de rusher la trilogie (ces jeux ne sont pas faits pour \u00eatre rush\u00e9s... aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat l\u00e0-dedans au vu du nombre de dialogues et d'autres choses qui font qu'il vaut mieux prendre son temps), j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de directement commencer Cold Steel sur PC avant de terminer Sky, car Cold Steel me branchait plus (il faut dire que j'ai attendu la version Steam pendant 1 an, et ayant pr\u00e9ssenti sa sortie, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas continuer ma partie sur Vita en attendant de le faire v\u00e9ritablement sur PC).\n\nMaintenant passons enfin \u00e0 ce qui me pla\u00eet (et me pla\u00eet moins) dans Trails of Cold Steel. Tout d'abord ce jeu est tr\u00e8s immersif. Pour ceux qui ne savent pas de quoi il s'agit, imaginez-vous un mix de Final Fantasy Type-0 avec Persona \u00e0 la sauce Falcom. On incarne des \u00e9tudiants \u00e0 l'uniforme rouge dans une classe sp\u00e9ciale d'une \u00e9cole militaire, tout en partant en mission entre les diff\u00e9rents cours (comme dans Type-0), et on peut s'occuper de sa vie \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole et de ses relations avec ses camarades (comme dans les Persona \u00e0 partir du 3), le tout, avec une narration qui me para\u00eet finement ma\u00eetris\u00e9e (je dis bien para\u00eet car je n'ai pas encore termin\u00e9 le jeu, mais je fais confiance \u00e0 Falcom et tout me semble correct jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent) et des personnages attachants, avec des dialogues tr\u00e8s corrects made in Falcom. Personnellement, je ne suis absolument pas fan des dialogues des derniers Persona, ni de leur gameplay (que je trouve bien trop r\u00e9petitif). Ces probl\u00e8mes, en 16h de jeu (ce n'est pas beaucoup car apparemment la qu\u00eate principale durerait 60 heures ou plus) je ne les ai heureusement pas retrouv\u00e9 dans Trails of Cold Steel. En termes de dialogues, il n'y avait qu'une certaine Alisa R. qui me donnait envie de lui donner des claques durant les toutes premi\u00e8res heures de jeu, mais m\u00eame elle se r\u00e9v\u00e8le finalement \u00eatre un personnage profond voire m\u00eame sympathique.\n\nEn parlant de profondeur, on peut s'amuser \u00e0 parler du lore. Parce que j'ai pass\u00e9 presque une heure \u00e0 la biblioth\u00e8que de l'acad\u00e9mie pour me renseigner sur ce dernier, et franchement, \u00e7a en vaut le coup. Tout est si bien construit, tellement d\u00e9taill\u00e9. Falcom ne trahissent vraiment pas leur r\u00e9putation (ne parlons m\u00eame pas de l'OST qui semble \u00e9galement de tr\u00e8s bonne facture). La plupart des DLCs qui \u00e9taient disponibles dans les versions PlayStation sont directement inclus en jeu, \u00e0 l'exception des tenues \"Casual\" des diff\u00e9rents personnages qui restent disponibles \u00e0 l'achat (\u00e0 ce sujet, si vous comptez tous les acheter, je vous conseille de prendre le bundle \u00e0 10 euros, \u00e7a vous \u00e9vitera de payer le double pour \u00e7a) et des Shining Pom Baits (un bundle existe \u00e9galement pour ces derniers mais ils servent surtout comme raccourci pour XP).\n\nPour ce qui est du niveau technique, attendez vous \u00e0 des graphismes dignes d'un Tales of (avec des animations moins bonnes cependant). Mais heureusement, le portage est tr\u00e8s bien fait, j'ai pu comparer la version PC \u00e0 la version Vita c\u00f4te \u00e0 c\u00f4te et malgr\u00e9 les graphismes pas top, c'est un vrai plaisir d'avoir une telle d\u00e9finition et une image si lisse sur PC, sans parler du 60 fps. Le portage est par ailleurs co-d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Durante, celui qui a \"fix\u00e9\" pas mal de probl\u00e8mes dans d'autres portages comme celui du premier Dark Souls, FFXIII... et d'autres. En tout cas, je n'ai pas \u00e0 m'en plaindre (\u00e0 part peut-\u00eatre pour les touches AZERTY qui fonctionnent naturellement mais ne sont pas prises en compte dans l'interface, par exemple si vous appuyez sur A, un message de tutoriel ou l'interface vous demandera quand m\u00eame d'appuyer sur Q, m\u00eame si ce n'est que purement visuel et ne change rien au gameplay).\n\nOn peut donc tr\u00e8s bien ignorer les graphismes pour s'immerser dans le jeu et savourer la belle ambiance qui se d\u00e9gage de ce titre. Je passe le plus clair de mon temps \u00e0 parler et \u00e0 re-parler aux PNJs (jeu Trails oblige, les dialogues se renouvellent tr\u00e8s souvent) ainsi qu'\u00e0 explorer tranquillement au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l'histoire avance. Certains peuvent penser que le jeu est trop lent \u00e0 d\u00e9marrer (comme certains JRPGs d'autrefois), mais ce n'est pas du tout un d\u00e9faut. C'est m\u00eame une qualit\u00e9 car tout est mis en place de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s fluide et rien ne semble soudain. On s'attache donc aux personnages et \u00e0 l'univers du jeu comme si l'on y \u00e9tait.\n\nVoil\u00e0 pour mon \u00e9valuation, j'esp\u00e8re qu'elle vous aura \u00e9clair\u00e9 un peu et donn\u00e9 une id\u00e9e de quel genre de jeu est ce Trails of Cold Steel.

On Max settings (PC), draw distance is increased, character and enemy models look alot better, shadows are alot better, and the game just flat out looks 10x better than it did back on PS3.

You can also choose to use the undub to replace the english VA's with the JP VA's (instructions on the falcom discord).

However, after my first year spent as a student of Class VII, I can confidently say that it has, and knowing that this is just the beginning of a new series fills me with great anticipation. [/h1]\n\nIf you've played Trails in the Sky FC, SC and TC you'll know what to expect. A great story, compared with wonderful Soundtrack, depth when it comes to characters and a wonderful Gameplay mechanic. Cold Steel is a game in its own, you dont have to play FC, SC and TC to understand the story. However if you HAVE played those Games, you'll get a better view at some point in the Story.\n\nMy Specs:\n\ni7 7700k @ 4.2ghz\nGTX 1070 EVGA SC @ 8GB VRAM\n16GB DDR4 RAM\n\nI play on highest available Settings possible and on 1920x1080p and FPS unlocked to \"Limitless\".\nI get 144 FPS constantly without any drops so far and it feels really good on my 144 Hertz Monitor.\nPerformance-wise this is a Gamers Dream.\n\nI'm crying just because I'm able to play this on my PC without having to buy a \"Console\" for it.\nThe Game has so much to offer and if you really wanna play this Game - take some time.

Its world building is supperb, the characters are amazing and enough time is given to them to develop their personal traits. The gameplay is also worth mentioning: it's fun and quite active despite being turn based. Besides, there's a lot of customization and strategy involved.\n\nHonestly, if you have never played this game and you like RPGs...

(I am one of these guys that talk with every npc and in this game, the npcs say new stuff and tell their own stories all the time, so I already invested a few hundred hours in this game in 3 playthroughs on PS3, initial playthrough with talking to everyone I could find, was a fair amount above 100 hours, btw).\n\nFor new players: You can jump right into this JRPG without prior knowledge of the series. Mostly you'll miss some innuendos, but nothing major or anything that would shorten your enjoyment or understanding of the game. The cast, location, story etc. are all completely different. This takes places a few years after \"trails in the sky\" and sky featured another region of this world, so you won't really revisit old places (I still recommend playing the other trails games later on, as it still adds to the overall lore, every trails game is great fun and you will know more about the whole world). \n\nIf you like old-school RPG's and found yourself unsatisfied with all the stuff we got offered in the last few years, chances are you will really like this game, as I was in the same situation. While I normally prefer Japanese Dubs, the English Dub for this one is pretty solid. Especially seeing how many additional lines were voiced. Be warned though: There are millions of lines for this game, but for the most part only the main story relevant scenes are voiced. \nSchool setting, some standard character troupes and standard japanese jokes and clich\u00e9 happenings can be found in this game, yes. But that's only a small part of the whole game. Character development is definitely noticable and will go on as you move forward. This is only the first game of the triology (and I already played the first two games), so there is massive room for even more. \n\nWhile I like slower-paced stories with good worldbuilding, it's not for everyone, so let me get this out of the way:\nThe pace isn't fast. The game starts with a situation you will only reach much later on (in the later half of the game). Consider most of this game as introduction to and familiarisation with characters, factions, the empire in which this story takes place, some organisations, circumstances in the empire, slow-pace-build-up for more intense events later on (and part 2) and the lore etc. A slow story, yes but enjoyable nevertheless. Besides some cliche character interactions, there are a lot of great and funny ones, too. The main character might seem pretty standard, but he undergoes character development, too and as most of the time he isn't the only character you play, this shouldn't be a reason to not buy this game. Characters in your party which may seem annoying and stereotypical at first will developed as you move onward and gain a deeper and interesting personality (grew to love the cast after some time, when I first played).\nIf you are like me and talk to every npc, you will need a 3-digit amount of time for a playthrough, without it's hard to say as I always take much longer than the average guy for my playthroughs and can only speak for myself. A new playthrough offers NG+ options and some neet options. Slower sections you can accelerate via turbo function. \n\nWhile this game is pretty linear, the story slowly begins to unfold as you move on. The worldbuilding is were this games strength is located. Pretty much every minor npc has his own lines, which will change every time the time of the day changes...  The whole world feels alive. Characters you first didn't know and felt were stereotypical will grow on you sooner than you may think. The amount of characters with more screentime is huge and even this first part of a triology as a whole will only scratch on the surface.\nMusic is great in this one, once again. The pc port has a great support and you can play it on low-end or high-end-pcs all the same (thanks to customizable settings). If you just want to have a lot of action and grinding, you should look for another game. If you love if there is a lot of text and slow but good world-building: Just try it! At the end of this game, things will be more \"lively\" and the battle system is still pretty great and will be used often enough :)\nThough be warned: The second game was already confirmed for steam, but the first game ends on a huge cliffhanger.\n\nThe battle system is pretty cool and a big plus for this game. The battles are turnbased and you will be introduced to new aspects of them, step by step throughout the game. Arts, Crafts, Link Attacks, Special Attacks, later on another kind of battle (though that would be a spoiler if I said more) etc.. In this game I consider crafts as the most useful abilities, arts play a smaller role. In the second game CSII (Cold Steel II) this was rebelanced so that I started to use magic more often. Still didn't influence my enjoyment of the game and you still can focus on magic, all the same, but your chars have to wait for their turns, longer.\nCustomization of characters via orbment system is another great point. Besides basic stats you can decide how to skill your character. A master quarz will decide some boni, arts and status effects while you possess a a few slots you can unlock and fill with prefered spells, stat boosts, probability to inflict status ailments, more drops etc. via quartz. Hell, Rean hasn't the best stats for it, but you could even completely neglect his physical stats and build him into a mage-type if you want to.\nDifficulty is sometimes pretty challenging, but all in all it's not too difficult. \nMuch grinding isn't needed, either. As you progress through the game you earn quite a lot of EXP. While you can (and should if you play at a higher difficulty)grind for some items, sepith,  money etc. it's not necessary in any kind of great extent.\nAnother thing: In each chapter there will be field studies which take you to different places in the empire, introduce the world (and slowly some problems/conflicts that grow more interesting at the end and in the following game). Inbetween your missions, you receive some bonding points to absolve mini-events with your party members. They can be quite nice from time too time and net you Link XP. These will help you in battle, too, if you are linked to a specific character. more Link XP---> more advantages when linked with said character. These events are like a small relationship system, although they don't influence the main story per se. Especially the ending event is influenced by the level of your bonds. So while there are possible romantic implications, nothing major here. The second game though has the possibility to take over your save from CSI and you will encounter a few different talks, if you max'd different chars. \n\n\nSO IN SHORT, once again:\n\nI'm not good in reviews and much is still left to be said, but that would be too much for now. More people than not, like trails in the sky more than trails of cold steel, but for me it's just the other way around. Great worldbuilding, great character development, a world that feels alive, as even minor npcs have new stuff to tell (all the time!), solid english voice acting, great music, a lot of text & content (if you like it), not much grinding required, but a nice turn-based combat system with a few customization options as far as skills/arts are concerned and some (sometimes more, sometimes less) enjoyable bonding events with characters. The story is still slow-paced and there are cliche's from time to time, but nothing to major. I still like the story and the time the game invests in building it up. Trails was always known for it's worldbuilding and the story moves quicker the further you are in this triology. Nice for lovers of classic JRPGs that were unsatisfied in the last few years (no guarantee, though- everyone's tastes are different) and one of the JRPGs of my favorite JRPG series.",

of time in on the Playstation 3.\nAs unexpected as it is to see this game get ported to PC, it's not completely out of left field seeing as Cold Steel had a fair amount of success in the US for a console JRPG.\nSo at first I want to commend Durante for doing a fine job porting this title going beyond to give it all the bells and whistles everyone wants from a console to PC port.\nA fair amount of scaling can be done for low end PCs and enhancements can be added for higher builds. \nThe Turbo Mode is something that funny enough makes the game a lot more playable as speeding up cutscenes and going through tedious grind battles can be done with the hold of a button.\nOptions for high framerates are nice but generally help shine an unfortunate light on Cold Steels lackluster animations and generally poor character models.\n\nNow sadly this is where the review is going to take a negative turn, not that I think Cold Steel is an awful game but it is a clear step down from previous Falcom titles and it's embrace of the school setting seemingly alienated me as a return player coming from previous games. \nThe game looks rather underwhelming with the character models generally looking unfavorable and many areas containing flat barren walkways with occasional monsters.\nThankfully the game can better disguise these detail lacking environments by constantly switching the scenery as the games \"plot\" unfolds. \nI can also at least be relieved that the PC players will not have to put up with poor performance and long load times of the PS3 and Vita originals\n\nIn terms of setting and story Cold Steel has a high focus on capturing \"life at the academy\" and this is often results in minimal eventfulness and comes a bit too close to the \"slice of life\" genre I really have a distaste for.\nIt has the benefit of being part of the expansive Legend of Heroes universe but squanders it with it's poor story.\nThe ending has a twist that is too stupid for me to put into words. \nFans can still get a kick out of this because of the ties to other games but on it's own it really can't stand on it's own two feet. \n\nThe gameplay is mostly good retaining a similar simplified version of previous games with the addition of links between characters in combat. \nI feel the second game expands upon the combat in a much more substantial way but Cold Steel still plays well enough, even if basic. \nThere is a fair bit more story than other LoH games but it includes engaging with classmates and managing character relationships so it's more than just text. \n\nIn short:\nI'm mostly neutral\nI like this port and I like Legend of Heroes\nI don't hate this game but feel it's a low point for the series and CS 2, while not exactly \"night and day\", is still a fair bit better.\nI feel the price tag of $40 is too high, but being the console ports cost that much and were worse I can't really complain\nI'd recommend the Sky games over this any day but if the school setting really intrigues you I guess it may satisfy.", "timestamp_created": 1501864565, "timestamp_updated": 1501864565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

Nope, not at all, since most characters has game breaking skills like Rean and Millium either both are still having trouble in nightmare mode so its still fun.) \nStory - 9/10 (Mostly cliche scenes, but the lore connects to the Sky and Ao series so the moments sometimes makes it worth it, It took me 80 hours on first playthrough to finish).\nSound - 9.5/10 (The sounds are good in some part and irritating at some point but if I was ask whether I love it or not its the love it part. The voice part was also one of the reason why I bought the game, hearing Rean's voice and not a silent protagonist like the Vita.)\nSeries CS 1 of 3 - 9/10 (Since this is the first trails game I've played and put a lot of effort to, It became attached to me but the story was so cliche that it didn't hit me except for the characters since their so lovable.)\nOverall rating - 9.5/10 (I loved playing the game, it immersed me in a five day straight of epic rpg, the first days of field study was boring and dull but every time the second day arrives I had to do a marathon of it, from seeing modern fightings mix with Arts, the VC is also again much appreciated.)\nIs it worth it? - Yes (Everything is Solid in this game, S-Craft Exhibition, Skills Exhibition, Arts Exhibition, School life simulation, NPC aren't decorations(No they seriously aren't), Almost 3/4 of the game is Voiced, Side quests, Multiple Endings based on character relationships and best of all it connects to Trails of Cold Steel 2, Your save data might get connected to Cold Steel 2 when its release so I really recommend it to those who will purchase cold steel 2.)\n\nLast note : I purchased the game due to my love of the game and my love for XSEED games, I support Falcom and XSeed, I just hope they released Cold Steel 2 in steam since my country can't get the physical version and I have no Credit Card to get it

Trails of Cold Steel is nonetheless extent of Falcom's successful story-rich series; in terms of world-building, there really is nothing like this series. World goes around without you; it does progress with you, but every npc has little stories and problems that they're dealing with, and it's up to you to talk to them. NPCs always have something to say about the things that happened in their town, and if you like walking around the town talking to people about some weird stuffs that you don't even have to really know, then you will spend more time reading texts than playing and progressing main storyline. \nCharacters will look as cliched as it can be, but as story progresses, you will start to see more of them, so it adds kind of weird depth to their personality. Combat system is tight; if you don't let your guard down and stun enemies before you engage, game won't be a challenge even on hard mode, but it will still keep you at the edge of your seat, and focused because link system is all about that quick button pushing. Soundtrack is still good, just like all the previous series.

I have a GTX 760 and I am playing the game at maximum settings @1080p. I am getting between 50 and 60 fps unlike the 30 fps on consoles. It has a turbo mode to boot to save plenty of your valuable time in battles, saving your game and traversing the fields.\nThe following is my review of the game proper:\n\nThis game is one of the best jrpg'sI played in recent memory; it's very long though and has huge replayability factor due to its game plus mode and the need to play it more than once to get all achievements for their hunters out there.\n\nDespite the above praise, this game presents no real innovations in the jrpg genre, but it excels at what it does. It spends so much time in world building and making you so much attached to and invested in getting to know the characters. The characters are, for the most part, unique, complex and have interesting back stories. Even the countless NPC's are unique and have their own personalities and problems. I was reminded of persona sometimes when I played it, which is a good thing, due to its social-link like mechanic with your fellow classmates and exams.\n\nThe graphics are a slight letdown but this is more than compensated by its great gameplay, beautiful music, nice English dub, which isn't full but much more is English dubbed than many other Japanese games.\n\nThe battle system is turn based in the tradition of classic Japanese rpgs like persona and the earlier final fantasies and utilising enemies weaknesses, delaying enemies' (particularly bosses' turns) and performing links with your party members play a crucial role in securing your victory in battles. Also, despite spending a long time grinding for levels and items in this game, I never really got bored or annoyed by the battle system, which is a huge plus in a long game in my book.\n\nDespite being long and very detailed that it makes you feel part in its universe, the game ends on a cliffhanger, which prepares you for its sequel as it is part of a trilogy.\n\nThis is the definitive edition of this game due to the excellent port and its various enhancements, which made me want to replay it despite my huge backlog.\n", "timestamp_created": 1501804874, "timestamp_updated": 1501804874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.777806", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34004224": {"recommendationid": "34004224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042094286", "num_games_owned": 684, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502394785}, "language": "english", "review": "They fixed the framerate issues, good port of a good game", "timestamp_created": 1501803197, "timestamp_updated": 1503518861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.371907", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34003409": {"recommendationid": "34003409", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984592911", "num_games_owned": 602, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 5511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502930773}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fan of the Trails in the Sky Trilogy, this builds on the previous mechanics with an updated style.

TC and now CS! Please localise and bring the Crossbell Arc to the west as well! I will give you all the mira I can spare!!\n\nA quick summary of sorts: \nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel 1 is a good place for newcomers to get into the Trails series. Cold Steel 1 is a school based JRPG, similar to the Persona games, where you go through school life while the story unfolds. Note that combat is TURN BASED STRATEGY. You control Rean Schwarzer, a freshman attending the prestigious Thors Military academy. You are placed in Class 7, a class comprising of various people coming differing backgrounds. Some are nobles, some are commoners, some have secrets to hide and together they form the quirky bunch that is Class 7. Like the Persona games, social links with the many various characters are available. As these bonds develop, you slowly get to learn about them. Get these bonds developed enough and you can make your favourite girl your waifu. What seems like an uneventful school year, turns into a sinister conspiracy as Rean fights to protect his country and loved ones. \n\nQuick Trails primer for newcomers:\nThe Trails games are set in the continent of Zemuria and the story is split into Arcs, with each Arc taking place in one of the nations. Set in the Liberl Kingdom, Trails in the Sky the First, the Second and Third Chapter (all available on Steam), form the Liberl Arc; the first arc in the Trails Series. The Second Arc takes place in Crossbell State (Zero no Kiseki and Ao no Kiseki- currently only available in Japanese and Chinese; a fan made English patch is also in the works). When fans cry for the Crossbell Arc to be localised, they refer to this duology. The third arc set in the Erebonian Empire hence the name, Erebonia Arc is where the Cold Steel trilogy comes in. Cold Steel 1 is the first game in this trilogy and like I said, is a good place for newcomers as the game slowly introduces you to the places, people, characters and history of Zemuria. As a result, the game can feel tedious because of its slow start. It\u2019s a slow burn but shit hits the fan by the end of the game and the story will continue with Cold Steel 2 (coming to steam, eventually). The Erebonia Arc will finally close with the release of Cold Steel 3 which hits Japan on 28 September 2017. No word yet on a western release so we can only hope. While each arc follows and concludes the main character\u2019s story, the different arcs overlap to form a giant web, telling an interconnected, overarching tale. If you want to fully understand the world, characters, organisations and lore of Trails, I would highly recommend that you play the other Trails games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1501768652, "timestamp_updated": 1501768652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497331", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33992619": {"recommendationid": "33992619", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099171825", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501766742}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00.jpg\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u8f68\u8ff9\u53a8\u4e70\u7206\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1501766772, "timestamp_updated": 1501766772, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487616", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33992600": {"recommendationid": "33992600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025365309", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 9841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511789499}, "language": "english", "review": "Gone are the days where evil developers aiming to pad the game time with unecessary stuff like DIALOGUE and MEATY COMBAT ANIMATIONS that emphasized the strength and oomph of your characters when fighting. \n\nNow with the magic superpower known to mere mortals as TECHNOLOGY everything is merely a button HOLD away.\n\nCan't wait to finish this fight?

It's one of my fave games ever.   And I've  been gaming since....well, let's just say that my original console was Atari 2600, the year it came out. \n\nI've played 100+ hours of ToCS on my PS3s and PSTV.   It's kinda hokey, sappy, and not the best-looking game by far but it just clicks.   The turn-based combat manages to stay fun throughout.   It never seems grindy.  But it's the story that pulls you in and keeps you invested in the game.     For the most part, it's not dark.  It's not edgy.  It doesn't try to be hip.  Fan service isn't obtrusive.  It's sincere and not saccharine in its relatively good-natured approach.   The characters and story mature and develop in unison.   I will say that the game ends on a cliffhanger.   So if you haven't played ToCS2 on PS3/PSTV, you'd better hope that the second part makes it to PC.  [Edit: Apparently it is! :)]\n\nAgain, coming from both the PS3 and PSTV versions, the PC version is simply breathtaking.   If you are totally new to ToCS, you won't obvious share and appreciate this evaluation.   It's a joy to have it run buttery smooth at 60 fps.   The models don't look upgraded, but the textures certainly have.    It looks absolutely glorious at 4k on my LG 55\".  Even the colors have a vibrance and pop that literally makes the PS3 version pale in comparison.  No hiccups or bugs noticed thus far.   I'm gaming with my X1 controller.   No problems there.   (It does seem strange not seeing my PS prompts though.)\n\nI'll enhance the meat of this review as I play more, but after an hour I wanted to leave a positive review.", "timestamp_created":

Speaking of stories to tell, all of the NPCs feel like real peaple with real lives. Their dialouge is always changing, so I recommend speaking to them as often as possible.\n\nBesides that, there isn't much else to say, except this is personally my favorite game because of the fond memories I have with it.

into this port, I knew that I would have to double-dip and pick up what can pretty safely be called the now-definitive English version of the game.  It runs beautifully on a modern gaming PC, and of course, has never looked or sounded better, but options exist that will allow the game to run well on even the most basic device that can manage DX11.\n\nIn much the way that Trails in the Sky begins with the familiar archetypes and tropes of JRPGs and anime of the 90s, Cold Steel takes more contemporary cliches to begin with, and then expertly expands upon them, exploring or subverting them in ways that you don't expect, and crafting a world with heart and depth that makes Zemuria feel like a second home for as long as you're willing to pour hours into exploring it.\n\nThe turn-based combat can offer as much or as little strategy as you please depending on how you set your difficulty.  Breeze through and focus on the story, or grind it out, maximizing your ARCUS builds until not even bosses can touch you.\n\nThere's a social element this time to the game, and building link levels with your classmates will lead to new scenes and stonger link bonuses.  The link attacks and other systems add back a bit of complexity that has been lost in Cold Steel's more streamlined quartz crystals.\n\nWhile longer-time Trails fans will find plenty of references and through-lines to get excited about, Cold Steel represents a good point of entry for newcomers to the series, particularly as Trails in the Sky continues to show its age, if only visually.

I have it on the PS3 and its great to be able to run it at 4k 60 fps. Its never going to be Horizons: Zero Dawn on looks, but it has its own art style that is easy to appreciate. \n\nThe Legend of Heroes Games (there are 3 others on Steam under Trails in the Sky) thrive on wonderful characters and world building. Almost every NPC is going to have something interesting to say to you that makes the world feel more immersive. The characters you have in your party are a bit tropey (is that a word?) but in a good way. They all have more than one dimension to their personality and back story and their interactions with one another make for interesting group politics. \n\nThe combat is standard turn based combat, quite a bit like the one used in Lunar or Chrono Trigger in that area based skills can cover multiple enemies based on grouping and everyone gets knocked around by attacks. The orbment system works well and allows you to vary things up and grind out some powerful characters. \n\nI think you will enjoy the game and will definitely want to try out the others in the series. You don't need to have played them to understand this one as it takes place in another region after the events of the first trilogy. All 3 of the Trails in the Sky games are also well worth your time and are pretty epic adventures in their own right. Probably the coolest thing about this series is that the history / setting is so well fleshed out so each game is going to fit like a puzzle piece in the history and lore of the game world. The Trails of Cold Steel games are also a trilogy and I believe the other 2 will eventually end up on Steam (hopefully sooner than later). If they are like the original trilogy, your save file carries from game to game for bonuses and other cool things. Its not Mass Effect level (decisions change the game in large ways) but its still a nice touch. \n\nTLDR: Its a very fun turn based RPG with great characters and a very impressive world. Also, its set in a school so if high school animes / Persona games are your thing, you're set.", "timestamp_created": 1501720564, "timestamp_updated": 1501720564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33982164": {"recommendationid": "33982164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073659123", "num_games_owned": 665, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503972001}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally I can play this on something with more processing power than a smartphone.", "timestamp_created": 1501719982, "timestamp_updated": 1501719982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33982143": {"recommendationid": "33982143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200702853", "num_games_owned": 383, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 169, "last_played": 1514509469}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53ea\u521a\u5f00\u573a\uff0c\u79fb\u690d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c60FPS\u3002\nTurbo Mode\u592a\u9b3c\u755c\u3002\n\u636e\u8bf4\u82f1\u6587\u6709\u65b0\u6dfb\u52a0\u6587\u672c\u3002\n\u6ca1\u6709\u65e5\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u65e5\u8bed\u8bed\u97f3\u5305\u5df2\u6709\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6709\u5b98\u65b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002\n[spoiler] \u516b\u53f6\u4e00\u5200\u514b\u59bb\u6d41\u5df2\u7ecf\u767b\u5cf0\u9020\u6781\uff0c\u7a7f\u8d8a\u6b21\u5143\u4e4b\u58c1\uff0c\u5c06\u5973\u4e3b\u4ece\u4f5c\u54c1\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u514b\u6389\u4e86\t[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1501719877, "timestamp_updated": 1501729062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764676", "comment_count": "23", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33982130": {"recommendationid": "33982130", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962189010", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4723, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503818311}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played the first three Trails in The Sky games and so far it feels like playing a modern version of those.

Game is long, I skipped most of  the side quest and it took about 50ish hours to clear the game.\n- Even more voice acting, one thing that bugged me about the ps3 versino was that the main character kind of had way less  spoken lines then everyone else. In this version it would seem that alll of those lines are voice acted.\n- Game models look great and the game runs at 60fps\n- Sound track is really good, there are tons of really good songs in this games.\n-1440p supported\n- you can play with a controller and can easily remapp\n- Hands down the definitive edition of the game.\n\nCons -  The only major thing that I feel takes a bit away from the game, is that the images that they use for characters are ripped directly from the ps3 version. Which is fine.... they dont look awful but you can tell that they are a low qulity image which makes them slightly blurrly.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1501713890, "timestamp_updated": 1501713890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33980805": {"recommendationid": "33980805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006068403", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503171979}, "language": "english", "review": "Played and beat this on the Vita and loved it then heard it was coming to PC after getting Trails in the sky TC. I love how these games tie the universe together so well. Along with the characters personality, sound track, and NPC interaction make this game a great buy. Also 10% on release day is well worth it even at full price its still worth it. This game can be played alone without Trails in the Sky, but Id suggest playing at least FC and SC to better understand some slight references made in the game. \n\nGame plays well on the PC Port and you can Customize the controls to your liking and you also have a decent set of video options. (It would of been nice to make it mouse only like in the Trials in the Sky series, but being a port and not a actual PC game like the other three, it would have been hard to develop it in the already complete game without breaking it.)\n\nIf you like classic JRPG games then I recommend this game for you as well as the entire Trails in the Sky series.

Basically, you're doing yourself a disservice by not experiencing TCS.

If you are looking at the price tag and thinking that you may not want to spend 40$ on an RPG i just wanted to talk about a few of the features that makes it turly worth the price.\n\nFirst the main story in this game took me over 100 hours to get through on the PS3 also upon completing the game their is a new game plus feature that allows you to carry over things into a new playthrough that gives the game alot of replayablility. I believe to get everything you need to beat the game three times.\n\nWith so many games calling themsleves RPGs as clickbait to get people to buy them this is a true RPG. The combat will be a little different if you've never played a legend of heroes games, but is fun and engaging with alot of mechanics being unlocked as the game goes on the make combat generaly fun. On normal difficulty combat can be really difficult (especially if the party is suprised and the enemy goes first you can be wiped out before any of your characters can act) but to combat this you can save anywhere at any time and with a suprise attack you can beat most any enemies.\n\nYou have a large cast of characters in this game and the opprrtunity to get to know them (and increase you link level with them that increases your effectiveness in combat by linking with them) with each character having a unique and engaging backstory. This is one of the only story driven (an engaging story that makes you want to keep playing to unlock more of the games world and your characters backstory) true RPGs that has come out in a long time. You can choose to date most of the female characters in this game (which is fun if you want to but in no way is required or necessary to experience the whole story). I cannot express enough how much fun it is to get to know each of the characters and where they come from and what their background is. \n\nI really hope people give this game a chance and it's financial success leads to more games from this series. If you have played the other Legend of Heroes games on steam this is an update and moderenzation of the series which looks visueally great and more like a modern game on PS3 or 4. I hope everyone can find over a 100 hours of enjoyment from this great addition to the series.

PORTED BY THE GUY WHO FIXED DARK SOULS IN FIFTEEN MINUTES or however that story goes, it's a JRPG with a super heavy emphasis on world building, surprisingly deep characters, and awesome music. It might seem a little anime, and it is, but there's more to it than that.\n\nDid you play trails in the sky and find it too slow paced? Good news! This game starts out with some enticing plot points to get you hooked before slowing down for world building shenanigens. Also, exclusive to the pc port (Based Dark souls guy) is turbo mode, which basically speeds up the game a bunch without affecting music and the like. If you've played the recent Final Fantasy 12 remaster, it's like the speed up function in that, it's great.\n\nAnyway, I want to get back to replaying this, so uh, more voice acting is great, the voice acting in general is great especially once the characters warm up a bit (Don't take the trailer at face value, all of those lines are battle quotes and some of them have been distorted for special attacks), HAVE I MENTIONED THE MUSIC IS GREAT, and I love almost all of the characters a little too much.\n\nAlso also, I love 60FPS.

So, this is one of my favorite of all time rpgs. First of all, if you like Trails In The Sky, (in my opinion) Trails of Cold Steel is better, so fans of In The Sky would love this series. It has one of the biggest replay values I have seen in an rpg. For one, you get to choose who to romance, which alters the ending and gives exclusive bonding events. In quite a few certain points in the game, you get to choose who to bring into your party, and depending on who you bring alters the diologue. Also, the friendship and romance options you pick transfer over to the new games, (2-3, for when they come to steam) giving new diologue and changed cutscenes only possible with the save data clear with the romance and friendship choices transferred over. Now for the gameplay---The gameplay is full 3D and enhances the gameplay of In The Sky further while adding new elements. Outside of combat, you walk around the areas, talking to npcs, doing side quests, bonding with classmates, and some mini games at certain points. The side quests unlike most rpgs actually enhance the story and feel relevent. If you dont know about Trails In The Sky and want to skip right to this series, then thats fine too. This has its own unique story and chars that arent in In The Sky. The books also tell about what generally happened in the In The Sky series, and on Cold Steel. It is turn based but its a unique style with its duo attacks and 4 person party attacks. The game starts off slow but give it some time, as it takes it slow on purpose to give excellent character depth and world building. 10/10 in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1501704704, "timestamp_updated": 1501704704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506118", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33978344": {"recommendationid": "33978344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144757773", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501703875}, "language": "english", "review": "Compared to Trails in the Sky, Trails of Cold Steel has less reading, faster/funner combat, and more waifus.

The game has more Persona like mechanics with bonding, but the battle system is your same turn based grid tactical combat (except in Cold Steel its super fast). \n\nTheres tons of wonderful characters, a brilliant musical score, and while it may start slow, the intrigue picks up and leads into the next games in the franchise. \n\nA hugely recommended title, it will keep you busy for hours on end.

I played the original Japanese version of this game on PS Vita two and a half years ago, and I think it is a very brilliant JRPG in many aspects despite some minor flaws.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\n\n+ World-building is extremely well done, just as what Falcom has done for the past games in the Trails series. NPC's dialogues change when story progresses and even after some side quests/stories end, which I believe most RPG's do not really care. This is a living world with tons of details.\n\n+ There are many insteresting characters, and they develop as the story progresses. Every character in Rean's (the main character) class has interesting background story, motivations, and purposes they want to achieve. Rean might be an exception though because his development is mostly in the sequel.\n\n+ Lots of Amazing music exist in this game. Falcom JDK is famous for its high-quality music production, and Trail of Cold Steel shows how good they are. I love the music when they go out of town into the roads, and the background music of the final labyrinth and battle.\n\n+ Game mechanics are creative and fun to play. The Orbment (magic) system changes a lot from the last game in the series (The trail of the Blue), and I personally think it is good change. ARCUS Link is a new feature in the combat system that is well-designed.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\n- The story is unfinished at the end of the game, and it is also a cliffhanger. Unfortunately the sequel (Trail of Cold Steel II) is not on Steam yet, and personally I would not call this sequel a very good sequel because some questions still remain unaswered in the sequel. Japanese version of Trail of Cold Steel III is coming out on Sep 29, and I will be able to give a good opinion of the series overall after I finish it.\n\n- The friendship (relationship?) system is what feel a little uncomfortable about this game. These are side stories which you, as Rean, can trigger with your partners (usually one character per side story), and you deepen your relationship with him/her after you complete the side story. Sometimes side story with female partner has subtle romantic implications, and this makes me feel like I am playing a visual novel. Gladly there is balance of male and female characters so this did not affect my experience that much.\n\n-  Falcom is not very good at Graphics and modeling, unfortunately. This game came out a few years ago, and I think the postures and actions of character models are not that satisfying. As you can see, this game has a very Anime-like drawing style, and some people might not like this style. The sequel improves a lot on this aspect though.\n\n\n[h1]Not Sure About[/h1]\n\n\n? Since this is a English-voiced version, so I do not know about English voice-acting until I play it. However, I heard there are a few thousand more lines that are voice-acted than original Japanese version.\n\n? I heard the translation is very good becasue translators add more meaningful stuff to the text when they translate. I still need to confirm that myself.\n\nEDIT: Port is amazing. I feel it is better than Atelier Sophie and Neptunia series.\n\nFor voice acting, most of the characters' voices is good, although I still prefer Japanese probably because I first played this game in Japanese. Thumbs up for Sara, Emma, and Towa's voice actresses.\n\n[h1]Ending Notes[/h1]\n\nThis is a great JRPG you cannot miss if you like JRPG's. This video by Mother's Basement on Youtube might help you understand what I mean by \"world-building\".\n\n[u]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaN2G-AEd9Q[/u]\n\nAnd WATCH OUT FOR SPOILERS: This is the official site of Trails of Cold Steel III if you are interested (I am so excited btw)\n[u]https://www.falcom.com/sen3/[/u]\n\nThanks for reading my review.", "timestamp_created": 1501697558, "timestamp_updated": 1501874333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33976181": {"recommendationid": "33976181", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979460111", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503137711}, "language": "english", "review": "Welcome to \"The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel\" (ToCS)\n\nMy review is based on my PS3 experiences (Cleared ToCS I and II twice), early PC insights and my personal opinion about this game. \n\n[b][h1]Trails of Cold Steels:[/h1][/b]\n-J-RPG \n-Turn-Based \n-Flexible skillsystem with a lot of strategy\n-Not the hardest but really pleasant difficulty [Normal] \n  (Go hard if you would like more of a challenge) \n\n-Story rich (Can drag on a bit at the beginning but it's getting really epic and interesting once you are hooked)\n-It's quite linear but you have time to discover various places and towns (You have your freedoms) \n-No prior knowledge needed (Trails in the Sky or the other titles - Just light references)\n \n-Great and illustre characters and character development\n-Motivating to deepen the bonds (Similar to Persona) \n-Almost every character (NPCs included) has his/her own story \n\n-A lot to do (amsuing sidequests, minigames, discovering and collecting various stuff)\n\n-Average graphics in general\n-A lot of love put into details, characters and environment \n-Graphics are still way better compared to PS3!\n-A lot of improvements over the PS3 version like higher resolutions, higher frame rates (60 FPS), depth of field, shadows and so forth\n\n-Really great OST which is underlining situations and the mood greatly (Still listening to them from time to time)\n\nPlaytime: Between at least 80 hours and 120+ (Average for my first time was around 110 - PS3)\n\n-It's the first game of a trilogy \n-ToCS II will come later to PCs and ToCS III will release in Japan this year\n \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n[b] It's pretty difficult to recommend this to everyone depending on what you like...and if you have some experience from games like Trails in the Sky FC/SC/TC and Persona [/b]\n\n[u]At best I would say it's a mix of the previous Trails in the Sky and \"Persona\" in general [/u]\n\n-It's a mix because like in Persona you have your everyday school life and mysterious battles/characters\n-You are deepening your bonds with the \"main characters\" and getting to know their personality.

Class VII is the only class in the entire academy that does not segregate the two different social classes.\n\nThe game follows Class VII throughout their school year, mainly around the times when Class VII receive special field training that takes them all over Erebonia. Throughout their training across Erebonia, Class VII matures and casts aside their preconceptions of the two social classes and witness first hand the reality of the empire; The power struggle between the aristocracy led by the four noble houses, and the working class reformists led by Iron Blood Chancellor Osborne which threatens to lead to a civil war.\" [/spoiler]\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n[b][h1] So who would I recommend it to?[/h1][/b]\n=> People who like Persona and are into spending time to develop bonds with various characters\n=> People who like to play turn-based games with deep strategy (You can abuse every system...)\n=> People who are into longer games (Average time = 90-100+ hours)\n=> People who are seaching for a great story where everything feels connected (Characters, Story, Backgrounds)\n=> People who don't dislike certain clich\u00e9s \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nPOSSIBLE LIGHT SPOILERS! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !\n\n[spoiler] Some random notes at the end (Just for me or maybe you even like it => (My Personal opinion)\n\n-Rean is a great chracter for me [Realistic - Intersting - Mysterious] \n-Rean is human/kind and may come across as your \"typical\" hero [He is not - but he tries]\n-His schoolmates come from various societies and families\n-They have all their traits and quirks \n-They don't get along too well at the beginning and even later\n-Problems will arise among themselves\n-They are at odds with themselves\n-The different reasons for their behaviour/quirks are explained well and make them loveable \n\n-The battles are fun and interesting\n-The characters for battle are changing depending on the school trips and where you are in the story\n-Even if you are not leveling you don't have to fear to be underleveled and to grind endlessly because you are getting more EXP the lower your average level is compared to the current monsters you are fighting\n-You are even getting less EXP when you are higher compared to the average level of the monsters you are fighting \n\n-It was a pleasure catching all kinds of fish (Fishing), to play Blade (Card Game), to collect certain books and read a novel from time to time and to get to know more about the society and the world around ToCS\n\n-A lot of German words mixed into the game (I'm from Germany so it's quite funny how they use different terms)\n\n-Fun scenes: School trips, schwimming, awkward/funny situations the characters are getting into, school festival...

We lose some features like Rush, but we also gain a different way to do battle in the way of Master Quartz, to furter augment the skillsets and stats of your characters and the ability to swap them lets you build your characters in interesting ways.\n\nOverall, a highly recommended title.

They open up the way to new experiences, great memories, and unlock powerful combat techniques that can be used to take down monsters from the Dark Ages. At one of Erebonia's top military academies, young people from all walks of life come together to team up and show off their combat skills they've mastered in their brief time on the planet.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is the first entry in a trilogy that is part of an even larger video game world. Play as a student who must grow his relationship with his fellow classmen in order to overcome challenges both mystical and political. Customize your skills with the Orbment and ARCUS systems, utilized advantageous positioning, and swap characters in and out in the middle of battle to adapt to changing scenarios. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThe writing of the game is something of a mixed bag. While the plot handles some deep and complex subject matters like political uprising, social class systems, and school dances, it's all bogged down by the subpar dialogue. Regardless of how many characters are in a scene, the game feels that every single one needs to voice their thoughts on the matter, no matter how innane or if it's already been said. After awhile, scenes feel bloated with unnecessary thoughts thrown out into the mix.\n\nCharacters start off two-dimensional and tropey, but through the course of the game they unfold into more layered people. They go from chariactures to characters. That's part of the overall theme of the game, too. That while things are presented in a rather black and white manner, clear lines of delineation made, the truth is more muddled than that. Your friends might be nobles, but there's usually some element that makes them outcasts within their own social circle. The same can be said of the commoners in your party.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThe turn-based system in this game is immensely satisfying. Rather than all your characters standing in a row, you are free to move them across the battlefield, to reach enemies or allies or to avoid oncoming attacks. Movement can only be done on their turn, and moving uses up that turn, however. Think of it likes a \"Tales\" game, but far more limited. Attacks come in a few varieties (Attack, Craft Skill, and Arts) and you'll need all of them to overcome even basic monsters on the field. \n\nThe battle can turn sour quickly, as enemies aren't afraid of hitting hard. Making use of link attacks and damage types will be necessary to avoid having your entire party faint before you even leave chapter 1. Links are formed by building up your relationship with characters outside of battle. Each day you have a limited amount of interactions you can make with friends, and there is always more friends than you can meet in one day, so manage your interactions wisely. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nPROS\n+ Very enjoyable combat that is never too hard or too easy.\n+ Familiar upgrade system (to anyone who's play FF7, at least).\n+ Beautifully upgraded graphics that run at 60 fps.\n+ Substantial plot and interesting developments therein.\n\nCONS\n- Tedious and redundant dialogue slows everything down to a crawl (even in turbo mode).\n- Even though characters develop into more interesting people, the main character remains the dullest somehow.\n- No Japanese voice cast.\n\n[h1]To read the full review, please visit this [url=https://www.keengamer.com/article/16895_the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel-review-pc]link[/url].[/h1] Thank you!", "timestamp_created": 1501692278, "timestamp_updated": 1501692278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608922", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39413916": {"recommendationid": "39413916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037886234", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3991, "last_played": 1516230845}, "language": "english", "review": "\"im stronger\"\n\"ive been holding back\"\n\"i have a robot\"\n\"i have a better robot\"\n\"ive been holding back\"\n\"its my turn\"", "timestamp_created": 1516198403, "timestamp_updated": 1516198403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39407228": {"recommendationid": "39407228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387380158", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 58, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513747658}, "language": "schinese", "review": "We need Chinese and Japanese voice", "timestamp_created": 1516171678, "timestamp_updated": 1516171678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39401973": {"recommendationid": "39401973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009630098", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1933, "last_played": 1516231977}, "language": "english", "review": "Ive been playing this game for quite a bit now.

This game reminds me of \"Persona Lite\". There are bonding events with characters, but it's really mostly just dialogue, they try to incorporate the relationships into the combat system, but it's pretty weak. I would honestly hardly notice if I was using Lvl 1 bonded characters vs Max Lvl bonds. That's fine, I dont NEED that type of system to make a good game, but this game tries to implement it and comes up short. If you're going to have me talk to people under the pretense of growing relationships, there needs to be some tangible evidence of that. In this game, you get some extra dialogue and that's literally all there is + the Link EXP. For people who are REALLY into the whole anime thing, and mainly play these games for the narrative, that will be fine, but I personally look more for gameplay on top of story.\n\nTo get to the gameplay: this game's combat is actually quite fun. It's positionally based (even if the positioning can be relatively clunky) and there are AoE effects to consider as well as status effects and the like. Customizing your characters and which \"quartz\" (ability gems) they use is fun. Towards the end, however, it migrates into a bit of tedium as you are given party members largely at random, and you will likely find that the characters you've been investing in all game will be taken away from you for the final encounters and you will have to juggle Quartz between your active party members and there is no great intuitive way to do this quickly.\n\nI will underline all of this by saying that this game was originally on PS Vita. This limitation shows through OFTEN. There is hardly any animation here. If you're looking for a cinematic experience, you are wholly looking in the wrong place. The visuals are basic, the characters are relatively basic, and the conflict is really the saving grace of the game. The storyline is strong enough to hold your interest, though the myriad of anime tropes and overdone exposition might turn you off.\n\nyes. LIGHT SPOILER ALERT\n[spoiler]\nBut this game WILL in the final chapters of the game, where the stakes are the highest, force your party to GIVE A HALF A FUCK about a god damn summer festival at school. I. Dont. Care. Why would my characters care about putting on a fucking concert for their classmates when theyre trying to prevent a war and have been facing a supernatural mansion every month for the past year.[/spoiler]\n\nThis type of stuff REALLY REALLY pulls you out of a game like this. I have to believe that this is true unless you are the most die hard of anime fan and you just absolutely can NOT get enough of the uncreative, overused tropes that they use. They are not even approached in any different way than usual. This will be a selling point for some, and an absolute turn off for everybody else.\n\nAll of that being said, I enjoyed the game, I will [b]HIGHLY RECOMMEND[/b] that you play on the absolute hardest difficulty from the start if you're looking for any kind of challenge or have played JRPGS before or you will quickly find out how to \"Cheese\" the enemies and bosses in this game, however if you play on nightmare, I can pretty much guarantee that the fights alone will make this game worth buying. Thats one of the major reasons I love JRPGS and I can tell you this game nails it. Status effects can actually effect bosses, and thats all I really need to say.\n\nOverall; if you're a JRPG fan, get this.

Trails of Cold Steel.  I think as a whole it's a really good RPG, it does have some flaws; foremost is the FFX/FFXIII corridor layout  of maps/dungeons.  This is not a game where you're going to be able to wander about, every map is simply Point A to Point B and if there is any side areas, it's only to hide away a treasure chest or boss.  Now given how most of the game is mission based and you can fast travel to most places, you never really get the feeling of running back and forth over the same map continuously.\n\nThis leads to the other major issue: Not being able to go back to locations from previous chapters.  You're introduced to various towns and  locales, all populated with interesting characters and countless amounts of dialogue.   But once you've beaten a chapter in the game you never go back, which kind of hurts the chance for more interactions.  Maybe because this is the first in a trilogy they want to keep from over-exposing people and places and we'll get more of them later, but it does seem like a waste from a stand-alone game perspective.\n\nAnd that's the final gripe right there:  This game really feels like part one of a series.  The big plot hook comes at the last part of the game, you basically get two big fights and then it's see you next time Space Cowboy.  Now that's not to say there haven't been plenty of other games that were part of planned series where that wasn't an issue; it's just you get cliffhanged so badly it kind of ends the game on a bit of a downer.\n\nSo with all those gripes out of the way THIS GAME IS REALLY ENJOYABLE.  This game's strengths is the depth given to all of it's characters.  The main characters start out very basic, but as the game progresses so do the characters and by the end of the game you find yourself attached to all the members of Class VII.  What's even more impressive is that effort was also put into the NPCs.  That's right the usual cardboard cut-outs that say things like \"I like swords\" get their own growth throughout the game.  Off the top of my head the feud between to business-minded students is a blast as you watch them try to one up each other throughout the game.  It's not like they play a major part in anything, yet they still get their own character arc.  For the first time I found myself talking to everyone to see what new little tidbits or quirky characters I might find.\n\nThe combat was also enjoyable.  It was turn-based with an order turn, allowing more strategy in interrupting/stun locking opponents to get through combat unscathed.  Also you get XP bonuses for identifying mobs/multi kills/ending battles fast, so if you do more then just press attack you can find yourself racking up the XP.  And achieving that is simple with Orbment skill system the game has.  Think of it as FFX's sphere grid, but where you get to choose what skills/stat buffs you want for each slot; though some slots require a certain element.  The added benefit is that there is no real class system, so you can simply take the characters you like and make them whatever class of character you want.  It helps to reduce the feelinggy of being stuck with an annoying character because they're they only one of a certain class you have.\n\nSo yeah in the end this game was really fun, it's one I want to eventually go back and try to get some of the stuff I missed and to get better bonuses for when Part 2 comes out; which is a rare case for me (the Mass Effect trilogy were the last ones where I went back and played multiple times for stuff).

The voice acting for the most part is excellent, though there are a few moments where some characters, such as one of the characters parents, sounds rather mechanical in her responses, but that may be intentional as you will understand when you meet her.\n\nThe combat - It's pretty standard for JRPG's in that it's turn based with the usual types of attacks with slightly different names.  If you've played the other Legend of Heroes series (Trails in the Sky) then it's pretty much identical.  It's also a follow on of the story from that series, so it's worth checking that series out as well!\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some infuriatingly cheap moments that come with extremely bad luck, such as losing 2-3 party members to one deathblow attack because the numbers stacked against you, but when you learn how the system works it becomes far less of a problem, after which only 2-3 fights gave me any real problems.\n\nI won't say the combat doesn't get a bit repetitive, but the endearing characters and the decent story more than make up for it.\n\nSo, that's the basics...  As for the most important part, the story:\n\nI was quite surprised to be perfectly honest.  When the game started, despite seeing the reviews raving about it, my first thought was \"Urgh...  It's going to be another trope-fest\", but as the story progressed each chapter found something new that either took me completely by surprise, or egged you on with juuuuuuuust enough information about one of the characters that meant you just wanted to keep playing.\n\nThe only warning I will give is (and I'll use spoiler notice here, although it's not a direct spoiler it is regarding the ending of the game, without giving any story etc away) [spoiler] that there are 2 games to the series and as a result, it ends on possibly one of the worst cliffhangers I have experienced, be it in game, film 'or' TV series.  And that includes cliffhangers between some episodes of TV shows, not even season finale's...\n\nThe next game in the in the series 'is' apparently being worked on, but most information I can find on it seems to indicate that it isn't going to be at least until the end of 2018 before it's released...  Hopefully it will be before then, but I am not going to hold my breath...

I am a huge fan of JRPG's, it's what I grew up on, and still continue to play to this day. Tales of Vesperia is my favorite JRPG of all time, but Legend of Heroes has taken a firm number two spot. \n\nWhat the game does right: \nCharacters - The characters are diverse and well written. I find myself liking a majority of the characters they introduce, and find myself LOVING a select few. Very few characters are poorly written, and although you may hate a few characters in the beginning, the more you learn about them, the more you understand. With 9 main characters, they do a great job of talking about all of them and showing the type of person they are. \n\nStory - Super enthralling. I played 12 hours straight my first night with this game. I couldn't put it down because I had to keep playing\n\nMusic - OH THIS SOUNDTRACK. It's incredible, so pleaseeeeeee play with volume up and don't have anything in the background \n\nCombat - Incredible single-player JRPG strategy combat. I think its unique and enjoyable. \n\nThings this game does wrong: \nTraveling - Sadly, this game puts HUGE restrictions on traveling, limiting you to small areas for quite a while, and keeping you stuck in that one area until you finish your job. \n\nQuests - The quests ALWAYS end the same way for each zone, which leads to a lack on unique gameplay and a predictable ending to the chapter. \n\nOverall, 9/10.

Absolutely worth price.\n\nI'll start off with the good then hit up the couple of slightly more annoying bits at the end\n\n***Worth noting that this game is a slower paced STORY/LORE heavy RPG, do not expect action 24/7 with this game. Lots of character development and world building. This game will probably take 70-80 hours to beat.***\n\nThe good:\n\n-The amount of effort that must have gone in to giving every single NPC new locations and new dialogue during every single transition from morning to noon to night must have been staggering. No NPC will ever tell you the same thing twice if the time of day has changed. From the annoying Patrick Hyarms to the janitor. They all move throughout the day with new lines each and every time. Makes talking to NPC's in the game amazing. (Talk to Beryl or vivi whenever you can for good laughs.)\n\n-World building is nuts as well in this game. Every chapter you visit a new location and find out more and more about political climate of the hot mess of a country that is Erebonia. The zones themselves range from snoozer to oh shit I wouldn't mind living here. Nord is gorgeous with great music, legram is hauntingly beautiful little town.\n\n-The ending. Yeah thats right. I'm putting this under good. I won't spoil anything. But anyone who Played FC and had to wait for SC knows exactly what kind of cliffhanger falcom like to give it's fans. If you end the game with anything other then \"WHERE THE FUCK IS THE REST OF THIS GAME\" you're weird. but its in a good way. You will spend the next 3 days of your life googling \"WHEN DOES TRAILS OF COLD STEEL 2 RELEASE ON PC\" in all caps, of course. Love you folks at XSEED!\n\n-So many other good points to this game. It's a slow burner. Don't rush things even when you get impatient, you will cheat yourselves out of so many little breadcrumbs. Take your time and enjoy the ride. It's worth it.\n\nThe barely bad:\n\n-Voiced parts of the game can be a bit patchy at times. One scene will be fully voiced followed by the next being not. Not too big a deal though and takes very little away from an otherwise amazing game. \n\n-The way they handle character movement during cutscenes can be a little underwhelming at times. Outside of a few headpats and a couple other instances, everyone stands the same or poses the same during scenes making things feel a little robotic at times. I will say you will only notice this for the first few hours or so before you get used to it and no longer care.

Reach is enlisted in a very prestigious military academy named Thors and was inducted into the secret, \"Class VII\".\n\nClass VII, lead by Rean, is thrown in the middle of a huge power struggle and must learn to understand all sides of it.

This game sucked me in and didn't let go for over 80 hours. I've never really clicked with a JRPG before, though I am a pretty avid anime/manga fan, so finally finding my game in the genre is amazing.\n\nFrankly speaking, The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is a steal at $40, the sheer volume of quality gameplay and story you're getting for your money blows most Western RPGs out of the water. It isn't an amazing looking game (it was originally made for the PS3 and PS Vita, after all), but the graphics are consistent and the game runs at a buttery-smooth 60 FPS.\n\nThe plot slowly unfurls to reveal one of the most intriguing video game storylines I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The characters are all memorable and rapidly endear themselves to the player, while shadowy political entities duke it out behind the scenes and create more than a little mystery. There are two other released Trails of Cold Steel games that are direct sequels to this, and another one is on the way - II should be on Steam by mid-2018, while III may take much longer; IV will release in Japan in Fall 2018 so that game may not show up in the West until 2020. You should be prepared for the long haul with this series.", "timestamp_created": 1514851821, "timestamp_updated": 1514851821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38950775": {"recommendationid": "38950775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115599003", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 7222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514783477}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first time that I play a jrpg by Falcom so I can assure you that you don't need to play the other The Legend of Heroes to enjoy this. Sure, there are references to the Trails in the Sky series but that's not a big deal and I understood, more or less, what they refers to.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI can't say so much about the plot so far. It's very clich\u00e9 and japanese-style. Also it's setted in a military academy so it's politic-centered, otherwise Cold Steel has the usual high school stuff like your average anime. There's also a lot (A LOT) of lore so it's difficult to understand everything on the first hours but you'll eventually take the grasp of that. I don't want to write other things because I don't want to make spoilers. I'll only say that the ending is full of plot twist followed by other incredible plot twists. I usually hate plot twist but those were breathtaking and lastly there's a huge cliffhanger that I hated, but also loved.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nPretty solid stuff I'd say. The game has good mechanics, taken from various jrpg (for the battles) and from Persona (for the school life). Unfortunately Persona is way better in this kind of things but Trails of Cold Steel is still fun and enjoyable. In the long run I eventually got bored only by the many NPCs because I wanted to talk with everyone and their dialogues often change after every stupid event. Thumbs up for the rest.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nIt's not that good but it's a porting so it's natural. At the first glance is nice and catchy but it's not difficult to see that the environment is empy and with low quality textures.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nVery good and orchestrated in general. 2 or 3 bgm (Atrocious Raid for example) are simply marvelous and addicting. \n\n[h1]Characters[/h1]\nThis is the worst thing about the game because there not a single interesting character. I love Fie, Jusis and Crow for example but they are barely good enough. The others (Gaius, for example) are so plain that it is actually sad. I have seen characters like these in hundreds of anime and games and they are usually used as secondary characters lel.\n\n[h1]Longevity[/h1]\nOk I'm a slow player but it took me 120 hours to finish this game. I red in Howlongtobeat that the average is about 80 hours (60 for the story) but I can't understand how is that even possible. Probably I lost time talking to every single NPC 2-3 times after every event. And as you can see I still miss lots of achievements. So I don't think anyone could complain about this. Usually you don't even play jrpg if you don't like long games.\n\n[h1]Porting[/h1]\n*Clap clap clap*\nGood job for this porting. It's very solid and the settings in the game folder are extremely precise, it started to lag only in the final part of the game because of the crowd of people. And I only have an humble laptop.\n\nSo... what else can I say? Good title but nothing outstanding. I'll gladly wait for the incoming second game.", "timestamp_created": 1514841166, "timestamp_updated": 1514841634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

simple storyline but after the first 15min the game really picks up pace.

As the young mage Zia, you fight baddies, you explore ruins, get power-ups, and delve into mystery- you know the score. So lets get into it!\n\nThe graphics are a bright, smooth, bold, expressive, and cutesy look. This is great for a game with a camera that's pulled out to see all the action to help distinguish the components of a scene. The animations are fluid, though they can be too expressive during cut scenes. The characters flail about as if frantically conducting an imaginary orchestra. The areas themselves are wonderfully crafted and are a treat to view. The first town is especially eye catching and just seems wonderfully homey.\n\nWhile the visuals are good the music is great. The orchestrated score complements the world of Mystalia swelling with intensity during combat and calming down while in the safety of town. You can tell a lot of love went into the score and its worth picking up if you enjoy video game soundtracks in general.\n\nWhile the story is somewhat predicable, it's never a slog. The writing feels rushed and is a weak point. Characters are introduced and zip away constantly and their goals and distinct personalities feel shallow. Other than Zia, most characters seem to have at least one layer of smarm and smugness, which makes them unmemorable due to the \u201csameyness\u201d. The dialog balloons all start with a distinct \u201chum\u201d or \u201csim speak\u201d. Though a nice touch, it is done every time a new dialog balloon is made and can be grating \n\nBut lets cut the heart of the matter- how does it play? Combat is the core of the game and its quite fun. The controls are responsive and the world is varied with tons of secrets tucked away. The spell crafting systems allows the player to express themselves in a lot of different ways and can result in utilitarian, powerful, goofy, or mana hungry spells. The enemy pool is shallow- you'll mostly be fighting goblins that either throw javelins or try and wack Zia with a stick. The other enemies are not much different and the same tactics can be used to smite them. Players who want one spell to tackle many problems can do so. Bosses are well done, varied, and many are a fitting capstone to a dungeon or area. Most are of a fair difficulty but always memorable. \n\nIs it worth the modest 20 clams though? It really depends on how you approach the magic crafting system. If you're the kind of person who wants to win and have the best spells by looking them up online, you may find the game to be average. If you're like me and love to express and toy around just to find strange, amusing, or just fun spells than Mages of Mystralia is a solid action-adventure game. The has some replay value if you're the kind of person who enjoy treasure hunting and 100% a game. It also features a \u201chard mode\u201d with a few new enemy types that use crowd control attacks. (Your mileage may vary an how you you think getting knocks down and frozen is either difficult or annoying) . If you enjoy action adventure games styled like Secret of Mana, Hyper Light Drift, Bastion, and Legend of Zelda you'll have fun with the game.\n\nAs an aside to the devs (who may never read this) the game feels open for a sequel- I hope it happens. If you choose the same magic system, I encourage you focus on more enemies vulnerable to certain spells as well as certain elements. By mixing it up with different enemy types like this you force players to use different spells rather than resort to a \u201ckill-all\u201d styled fireball spell.

The gameplay is smooth and well considered, so casting spells and vanquishing enemies is a breeze. When I first heard about other game - \"Stories: the path of destinies\" I imagined it will run something like that. It didn't and I end up dissapointed (even if the main character was a fox - and I loooove foxes). Mystralia doesn't have foxes, but hey - main protagonist is a redhead, so I won't hold a grudge ;).\nThe spellcrafting system is a great minigame that can drasticly change Your gaming expirience. I do recomend to experiment with it and I can't stress that enough. EXPERIMENT with magic! What can go wrong? It's not like You end up summoning a demon... or will You? :>\nGame seems to be targeted to younger audience, but it does it in enough charming and slick way, that we- the adults will be delighted and miss the good old days, when someone else were paying bills and popquiz every now and then was our only worry.\nI really hope that there will be direct sequel or at least an open world game with chqaracter creation in same universe. I would love to take it for a spin with some of my friends to bounce meta-synergic spells between us!\n\nWhat I've liked\n+Gameplay. Game is realy intuitive and fun to mess around.\n+Spellcrafting! One of best spell-craft models I ever seen in game!\n+World. World have this good'ol fable and myth flavour I particulary love.\n+Story. Nothing to fancy, nothing too complicated, few twists and turns - good, relayeble and enjoyable story... well told on top of that.\n+Likeable characters. Starting with our big-ears Zia, and finishing on our antagonists, most characters in this game is well put together and generally refreshing nice.\n+A lot of puzzles and hidden little bonuses. It's like a remnant of a long lost era, more civilised times in gaming world, when creators rewarded explorators for their effort.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n-Some puzzles. I do own several gamepads (X360, Xbone, PS4, NES and SNES replicas just to name a few and show off a bit ;) ) and I admit that playing this game on my fav X360 gamepad was most enjoyable for me, but some puzzles required fireball precision that is hard to match with analog-stick. Not big problem on PC - You can always switch for mouse and keyboard for those parts, and they generaly give You bonus runes for spells or pink orbs - so You can live without. But can be pain for complitionists.\n-Harder parts in game (ghost queen for example) were not easier to do by creating more ingenius spells and utilizing better tactics, but by smashing Ybutton faster. I wanned to outsmart my boss-enemies, but usually I end up spamming them to death with my most powerfull spells.\n-No spellcasting Foxes! ;)\n\nTo finish it - if You know Polish, I do have ongoingYouTube series for this game -You can always check it out!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XOsyUSUWII&list=PLRtDTx_AqkjjL8wB6sC08JIVwvjkSXc-i", "timestamp_created": 1517147494, "timestamp_updated": 1517147494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543860", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39651500": {"recommendationid": "39651500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057147488", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517050279}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5d4\ub529\ubcf4\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud574\ubd04\n\n\n1. \uc801 \uc885\ub958\ub294 \ub2e8\uc870\ub86d\uc9c0\ub9cc --- \uce90\uc8fc\uc5bc \uac8c\uc784\uce58\uace4 \uba38\ub9ac\ub97c \uad74\ub824\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4 / \uc561\uc158\uc131 \ub098\uc058\uc9c0\uc54a\uc74c\n\n2. \ud37c\uc990\uc740 \ub9ce\uace0 \uc9c4\ud589\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc2b5\ub4dd\uae30\uc220\uc774 \uc790\uc5f0\uc2a4\ub7fd\uac8c \uc5f0\uacc4\ub41c\ub2e4 (\uadf8\ub7f0\ub370 \uc880 \uc9c0\uacb9\uae34 \ud558\ub2e4)\n\n3. \ub9c8\ubc95\uc740 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud560\uac70 \uac19\uc740\ub370 \uc870\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub300\ub9cc\uc871 (\uba54\uc9c0\uce74\uc640\ub294 \ub2e4\ub984)\n\n4. \ud2b9\ud788\ub098 \uc720\uc800 \ucde8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \ub2e4\ub904\ubcfc\uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc740 \uc7a5\uc810\n\n5. \uc778\ub514\uac8c\uc784\ub2f5\uac8c \uc5ed\uc2dc\ub098 \ucee8\ud150\uce20\ub7c9\uc774\ub098 \ud018\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc544\uc27d\ub2e4 (\uba54\uc778\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \ub098\uc058\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc)\n\n6. 2\ud0c4\ub5a1\ubc25\uc788\ub2e4\n\n\n\n\uce90\uc8fc\uc5bc\ud55c\ub4ef \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ucde8\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc9ec\ubf55\ud560\uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub9c8\ubc95\uc870\ud569 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \n\ucee8\ud150\uce20 \ubd80\uc871\uc744 \uc5b4\ub290\uc815\ub3c4 \uc0c1\uc1c4\ud588\uc73c\uba70 \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900 \uac8c\uc784\n\ub204\uad6c\ub9d0\ub300\ub85c \uc624\ub79c\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ub85c\uadf8\ub77c\uc774\ud06c \uac8c\uc784 \uac19\uc9c0\uc54a\uac8c \ud3b8\ud558\uac8c \uc990\uae38 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\uc74c\n\ubb3c\ub860 \uc801\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\uc218\ub85c \uc555\ubc15\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0\uc18c\uc885\ub958\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub370\ubbf8\uc9c0\uac00 \uc548\ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\uae30\uc5d0 \n\ucee8\ud2b8\ub864 \ubd80\uc871\uc5d0 4\uac00\uc9c0 \uc6d0\uc18c \uc774\ud574 \ubabb\ud558\uba74  \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uba74 \nYOU DIE  / YOU DIE / YOU DIE / YOU DIE\n\n\n4 / 5", "timestamp_created": 1517050877, "timestamp_updated": 1517050956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39592349": {"recommendationid": "39592349", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992783558", "num_games_owned": 1241, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516835679}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun, very well crafted game.

Cute and highly polished art style, remarkably intricate and detailed animations, cool magic and puzzle mechanics, nice overall atmosphere - on most levels this is really a gem. I was a bit hesistant to buy it, having almost never heard of it, but I'm so glad I did.\n\nThe highlight is the magic mechanic. Using a socket grid, you get to craft a wide variety of spells by adding behavior and modifier components around a central core element; the variety of spells you can craft, and of runes you can collect, is really impressive. Finding a new encounter or environment and crafting a reliable set of spells to deal with the environment is really rewarding, and experimenting with the spellcrafting system in general is really fun. There's some great puzzle design that makes imaginative use of spell properties, and the boss battles all have puzzle elements that encourage you to figure out good spells.\n\nThere's also a really fun and intuitive little rune-puzzle mechanic that's mostly used to open doors to secret areas, but then makes a surprise appearance later in the game to great effect. Everything has a puzzly feel to it, despite also being a magical action-adventure game in the moment-to-moment. It's a great combination; and despite most people seeming to beat it in 6-7 hours, I got almost 12 out of it without feeling like anything was dragging and without even finding all the secrets. There's more than enough to do in here.\n\nAlso, when you open the spellcrafting menu, the game pauses, so you can whip up new spells in the middle of a fight if you need to, which is wonderful. And the final boss encounter is divided into three sections with save checkpoints in between each, which is also great. I really appreciate these little conveniences.\n\nThe only downside is that the story is a pretty generic fantasy story with broadly unremarkable characters. This works in the sense that it allows the game to focus on introducing novel mechanics, but it would still be nice if the story were a bit more involved or surprising. The protagonist Zia started off with potential - she destroyed her home by accident using fire magic, for example - and the game suggests there are character struggles going on, such as noting that when she has to master the fire element she'll be facing her shame, but in practice that gets zero exploration in the story. There are also a handful of moments I did feel like the WASD+Mouse controls weren't quite as well-integrated as they should be, but broadly speaking it wasn't an issue.\n\nThe ending of the game unambiguously sets up a sequel, though, so hopefully the devs will get the opportunity to expand the world and story and characters in the next game. And the magic mechanics overall were just so fresh and fun, and the world was so pretty, that I didn't really care.

Se que es un juego de magos y la gracia reside en los hechizos, perdo aunque fuera una acci\u00f3n para rodar o hacer un peque\u00f1o teleport estar\u00eda genial y le hubiera dado un toque de profundidad al combate.

After watching the trailer, I expected a more polished version of magicmaker. After a couple minutes of playthrough I realized it was far beyond these comparisons. Mages of Mystralia offers more room for creativity and a more engaging storyline and gameplay than I could have expected. It manages to expand upon hours of entertainment using simplicity. Controls are extremely easy to grasp and character progression grows on a steady and pleasant pace. Furthermore, the soundtrack is amazing and the scenery, albeit simple, doesnt't cease to amaze with a mixture of small details and a bit of lore. The downside of the game is its length. The game is in no way too short, but replayability is not very encouraged, and by the end of the game, players might miss the pleasant pace of progression this game offered. In other words, although it offers just as much, or more, play time as any other game, it's such a pleasant game that it makes us wish to keep this pace for a little longer, something that few other games can offer.", "timestamp_created": 1511483844, "timestamp_updated": 1511483844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37215404": {"recommendationid": "37215404", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997206563", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506849837}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0417\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u0443, \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442 Nintendo? \u0422\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435)\n\u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u043e\u043d \u0417\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0434\u044b. \u0417\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044f \u0443\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0451\u0445 \u0431\u0430\u0437\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0451\u0445 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u0443\u043d. \u0412\u0441\u0451 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b.\n\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0436\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441-\u0444\u0430\u0439\u0442\u044b, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0433. \n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u044d\u043c\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0439, \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430, \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0432\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0430, \u0437\u0432\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1511474457, "timestamp_updated": 1511474457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37207936": {"recommendationid": "37207936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066292318", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498513153}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Most spellbinding and creative game[/h1]\n\nMages of Mystralia is a cutesy indie game where you play as a Mage who has seeked refuge in a town of other mages in a world where magic is outlawed.

Examples include :\n\n- The At Once rune is broken : one particular challenge that requires the At Once rune and above all requires some careful positioning to aim fireballs that go in an arc and backwards is rendered impossible due to the At Once rune completely messing with the starting direction of the spells. Something as simple as casting several spells in a row with the same starting conditions was failed. Simply unbelievable.\n\n- Having to mash a button to break free from freezing effects : mechanics that require button mashing have already become a no-no a long time ago. Having to mash a button normally unused in combat to break free from an effet that freezes you on place and, worse, can be re-applied immediatly after breaking free ? That's pure unfairness. Simply having the freeze effect last a set duration would be enough, and letting the player react to the next potentially freezing attack before getting frozen again would make the game actually fair, rather than having some useless breaking-free animation that prevents the player from even raising a shield.\n\n- Those goblin lightning spearmen are insane : as if splash damage on ranged attacks didn't make the game hard enough, get ready for a ranged attack that splits into 4 bolts that go in 4 separate perpendicular directions, are insanely fast, have no range limit, penetrate shields and above all have a totally random pattern. What makes a game of this kind fair is enemies having a degree of predictability. Being hit by an attack must be mainly the player's fault for not paying attention, not an occurence of pure randomness.\n\n- A bug that simply makes a boss disappear and denies you of any rewards for beating it : at least it didn't prevent the story to continue, but still, having the boss simply disappear befire then end of the fight and neither getting the achievement and the upgrade to health and mana is infuriating. When the game auto-saves and the only way to get them is to start all over again, that's when you want to throw your controller through your monitor.\n\nBadly programmed mechanics, unfair fights and bugs that potentially break the game, I cannot recommend it unless it gets patched to fix this.", "timestamp_created": 1509637519, "timestamp_updated": 1509916861, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487255", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36207825": {"recommendationid": "36207825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346857394", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496557180}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u611f\u89c9\u8fd8\u662f\u5feb\u9910\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u597d\u73a9\u4f46\u4e0d\u8010\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1509592676, "timestamp_updated": 1509592676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36128367": {"recommendationid": "36128367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036837761", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 837, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514311060}, "language": "french", "review": "Ex\u00e9lent jeu.\nLes m\u00e9caniques de magie sont tr\u00e8s bien pens\u00e9.", "timestamp_created": 1509325618, "timestamp_updated": 1509325618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36072092": {"recommendationid": "36072092", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969364344", "num_games_owned": 648, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518499540}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Zelda with a splash of Magicka.\n\nSlightly longer: if you like Zelda games, you'll almost certainly like this.

Nein, ist es wirklich nicht.\nW\u00fcrde ich das Spiel aber einem Freund empfehlen? Nein. Vielleicht aber f\u00fcr dessen Kinder.\n\n\nDas Spiel wirkt von Beginn an so als h\u00e4tte das Spiel viel besser und interessanter sein k\u00f6nnen. \nOptisch ist der Stil inzwischen extrem ausgelutscht und die meisten Spiele wirken damit immer irgendwie etwas \"meh\", egal wie gut der Rest dahinter ist. Die K\u00e4mpfe k\u00f6nnen dem ganzen Magie-System leider kein St\u00fcck gerecht werden.\n\nDas Magic-System ist echt gelungen. Es erinnert sehr entfernt an Magicka, aber ohne den ganzen Chaos-Faktor. Mages of Mystralia bringt Ordnung in das Magie-System und das ist echt gut so. Das Spiel k\u00f6nnte das System schneller einf\u00fchren, aber das System l\u00e4dt immerhin zum experimentieren ein. Leider bleibt es blo\u00df bei einer Einladung. Wie bei Metal Gear Solid 5 k\u00f6nnte man das Spiel blo\u00df mit den normalen Angriffen durchspielen und zwingt den Spieler kaum mal was anderes auszuprobieren. Die R\u00e4tsel erfordern aber immerhin den Einsatz der Runen zum Ver\u00e4ndern der Grund-Spr\u00fcche.\n\n\n\nDer Rest vom Spiel ist relativ belanglos nett  ( Story, Spielwelt, Design, Chars, Sound usw.) und da liegt das Problem. Das Magie-System sollte mehr gefordert werden, viel mehr Bedeutung in den K\u00e4mpfen haben und die Inszenierung sollte einfach ein wenig aufwendiger gestaltet werden. Das Intro-Video deutet ebenfalls schon an, dass hier mehr gegangen w\u00e4re mit ein wenig mehr Aufwand.\n\nIch habe mich leider die meiste Zeit beim spielen gelangweilt und hab st\u00e4ndig gehofft, dass das gewisse etwas noch kommen w\u00fcrde, aber leider kam das nicht.\n\nMit einem Koop-Modus w\u00fcrde ich mich eventuell eher mit dem Spiel anfreunden k\u00f6nnen, aber als jetzt aktuelle Singleplayer-Erfahrung bleibt das Spiel unter seinen M\u00f6glichkeiten und leidet an der belieben Optik.

It also doesn't have to be complicated - a simple fireball with maybe 1 modification will get you through most of the main story, if you want it to - the right staff or robe also helps. As spells grow in complexity, the mana cost also goes up, so there is some balance there. Experimentation is a lot of fun.\n\nThere are quite a few puzzles to be solved using the right spells.

Fun, yet simple, graphics style\n5. Music is reasonably good (never felt the need to turn it off)\n\nCons:\n1. The spell system, being its greatest asset, is sadly not explained in detail very well. You'd never know detonate and overcharge are mutually exclusive, when more complex runes are affecting what they are connected to, or things as simple as how to read the mana requirement bar under the customizable spell name.\n\n2. The game ramps up far too slowly. If I could recommend anything to the developers, it would be to make a couple more augment and/or trigger runes accessible earlier on.\n\n3. Once you learn the system, the game isn't very difficult. The real difficulty is figuring out what I listed as a con under 1. \n\nSuggestions:\nBuy the game. Play the game. Enjoy the game.

first, but very quickly runs out of steam to keep up that feeling of wonder and meriment as the spell system and what truely unique things you are capable of doing with it stagnate. The game itself also runs out of ideas and restorts to becoming a very simple and plainly boring zelda clone. The only part of the game that truely tests the magic system is the puzzle rooms which encourage you to figure out what spell you can put together to solve the puzzle, meanwhile the latter portion of the game resorts to only 1 of 4 special modifiers actually giving a spell a new function, and that one function will be how you solve essentially the same puzzle over and over.\n\nThe only reason I held onto this title for so long was because the story was fairly interesting and I wanted to see how it played off, but the game cuts off like they didn't even finish making the real final boss and just rolled credits. It was clear there was a vision and potential they tried to seek with this game, but in the end it just failed and was a dissapointment.", "timestamp_created": 1501014239, "timestamp_updated": 1501093375, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33775017": {"recommendationid": "33775017", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065116263", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501991902}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, it's a cute game with a fun play style. 7/10, would recommend.\n\n\nPros:\n\nCombat system.\n\nThe combat is fun and interesting. The choices in runes allow a certain flexibility in your play style. \n\nArt.\n\nThe art style is adorable.\n\nCons:\n\nStory.\n\nThe story is a bit lacking. The lore isn't very immersive or interesting. About as basic as it gets.\n\nMovement.\n\nIdk if it was just my controller, but the movement was slow and clunky af.

It was on sale, and I got more than my money's worth.\n\nWhere to start? There's a lot of good stuff. I'm not normally a fan of puzzles, but the puzzle mechanics in Mages aren't pushed in your face (Except in the final boss battle, in which it is done BEAUTIFULLY), and they're flexible. Don't have the prerequisite runes for a challenge? If they're behavior runes, maybe you can finagle ones you already have to work for it. Things aren't set in stone, and if you're creative enough, and lucky enough, you can get ahead of the game.\n\nThat leads right into runes and spells. Like it says on the tin, you're a Mage. In most games that means you get a few spells that you can customize with a talent or two, making them slightly different. In Mages you have four \"behaviours\" of spells, each of which determines a lot about the spell - but not nearly everything. Immedi hits things in melee range, right when you use it. Igni creates an orb of its element. Creo creates a full elemental effect. And Ego creates a defensive effect based on its configuration and element.\n\nRunes change how your spells act, and they influence each other as much as your spells. For instance, to start with, Igni creates an immobile, hovering orb of its element (Fire, to start with) that simply sits in place. Not incredibly useful unless you time it right. Combine it with a Homing rune, and you have a mine that seeks out a target when it gets close. Combine those with Move, and you have an enemy-seeking fireball. However, runes have different effects based on the spell they're affecting. For instance, if you combine Ego with a Homing rune, it will pull enemies and objects towards you like a magnet. And then there's combining spells, and...I could go on for a hot minute. Point is, it's fun to see what you can do.\n\nThe difficulty scales up pretty quickly, at least for me, which was interesting. It definitely puts pressure on you to stop messing around with funny spells and find ones that work at least reasonably well. Though that isn't to say your \"silly\" spells aren't useful. Sometimes what you REALLY need is that defunct \"bouncing betty\" spell you were trying to make work and just left in your spell list.\n\nAs well, I've found that there is no one \"God spell\" or somesuch that will solve EVERY problem. Someone will be immune, or it won't target properly, or it uses too much mana, or something else I can't think of on the spot. Point is, you have to be flexible.\n\nThe story is really great. Cute, without being too cheesy or being pointless. I constantly felt as if I had a set goal in mind, even during sidequests. Props.\n\nProbably the only real downside I've found is that the game is SHORT. Not abysmally so, but it's really not long. The story, at least. I've still got a good chunk of game left to explore right now.\n\nIt also feels like it might be more intuitive to play it on a controller, but I also feel more comfortable on a keyboard. I don't think it has a real effect on my enjoyment of the game.\n\nI keep thinking that a good way to describe it might be like this: Legend of Zelda, without Link, and Zelda is the hero.\n\nAlso: Read the Wanted signs.", "timestamp_created": 1499476328, "timestamp_updated": 1499476328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33332318": {"recommendationid": "33332318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003518140", "num_games_owned": 1219, "num_reviews": 153, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499043115}, "language": "english", "review": "Not much time invested yet but love the art style.", "timestamp_created": 1499400444, "timestamp_updated": 1499400444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33316243": {"recommendationid": "33316243", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960788171", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499455489}, "language": "english", "review": "Child friendly Adventure RPG.

The last boss wasn't really \"final-boss difficult\", but other than that the game's battles presented a good challenge.\n- The spellcrafting, while probably not as deep as the creators pretend, is still a lot of fun to build and explore with. I did find that I just relied on four or five powerful spells for most of the game, but it was still fun to create new spells to solve puzzles and earn secrets. \n- The art was cute. Not ground-breaking, but cute and it worked for the style of game. The world building was sufficiently interesting and the characters were entertaining enough.\n- The game was the perfect length, in my opinion. I always felt forward momentum, and the difficulty curve matched well.\n- I enjoyed the constellations puzzles.\n\nNeutrals:\n- The story was engaging enough to keep me a *little* interested but it really could have been significantly more interesting. They seem to set up sequels to this game, but the story wasn't nearly deep enough to warrant any sort of multi-part series.\n- The items, wands, and side quests were somewhat lacking, but I never felt a huge need to go get more. The game could have used some healing items (I never found any).\n\nCons:\n- The UI lacked a lot of feedback, especially in the spell crafting. Descriptions of what things were (like when selecting elements) was sorely lacking and made the learning curve steeper than it should have been.\n- What the hell is there to use money on? I had 999 currency the entire game, it seemed, never finding anything to spend it on.\n- The \"homing\" attribute of spells didn't work as expected like half the time, which really hurt during battle sometimes.\n- The camera angles had some issues.\n\nOverall, solid, cutesy, not-overly-long puzzle and action game. Recommended for fans of the genre looking for some mostly-intuitive spellcrafting.", "timestamp_created": 1499311392, "timestamp_updated": 1499311392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33247315": {"recommendationid": "33247315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075192649", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499199761}, "language": "english", "review": "As soon as I've seen this game shown in Montreal at the start of the year, I was hooked. The wonderful artistic choices made for this game easily get any player hooked before they even start to play, while the story and gameplay assure player retention. For anyone that has played any Zelda game before and has liked it, this is an amazing game for you. I've only been able to play 4 hours so far because of school, but I can't wait to get back in it and continue acquiring more modifiers for my spells.

Not to mention the plot twist I could see coming from a mile away, and the character straight up [i]named[/i] \"Mentor\", like they forgot to give him a proper name and left his character-trope-name in the final draft ([spoiler]and whose inevitable death, btw, is lessened when he plays his dying animation every time you walk into the tower where he dies.

The story had some great beats in the middle, [spoiler]like the burning of the town that left the townsfolk questioning their conclusions (and left me unable to complete a sidequest)[/spoiler], but they could have been tied together better.\n\nBut the fun spell crafting makes up for it. Once you collect the right runes, you can chain one spell into another into another in an infinite loop that can drain your whole mana bar in one button press if you wish! You can make a spell that fires off four different kinds of elemental magic in one hit, bypassing any resistances the enemy has! You can make it rain fire from the sky! It's amazing! Buy it for that!

Unfortunately some incredibly uncreative writing, limited scope and a lack of polish in key areas will probably stop MoM ever getting recognition it deserves.\n\nMouse and keyboard are good despite the suggestion to use a controller, at no point did I feel the need to switch.\n\nCombat is the biggest thing holding MoM back. In a better game studious use of dash and shield, mana management and the right spell use would be key to overcoming the game's most difficult challenges. The reality is once you settle on a specific combination you'll probably continue to use that with only minor tweaks as you unlock more modifiers.There are a couple of enemies that will give you pause the first time you encounter them but they both have very exploitable weaknesses.\n\nCombat strategy isn't much deeper than 'unload your most powerful spell and run around so you don't get stunlocked to death.' Mana regen is slow, and even approaching the end game a full pool isn't enough to take out more than 2 or 3 weaker enemies at once. The toughest enemy in the game can take close to a minute to take down, however due it's slow movement speed and low damage it's a not threat compared to several weaker enemies which will ensure that once you're knocked down you're not getting back up.\n\nSpellcrafting and the process of collecting more modifiers for your spells is the game's best aspect, however many of the modifiers are either useless or mandatory and some completely invalidate others. If you're wondering how many spells you actually have it's basically area blast, area explosion, projectile, area damage over time, dash, shield, clone. Some of which can be set to trigger into others. They vary for each element (fire, lightning, ice, earth) but very rarely in a way that will mean you'll have to reconsider how you'll use it.\n\nPuzzle elements are consistently rewarding but mostly pretty simple, fortunately the game respects the player's intelligence enough to not feed them the answer before they've even begun.\n\nEnvironmental design is consistently good if a little bland, level design is almost flawless.\n\nStory has a couple of mildly interesting points stuck in the sort of plot a computer could spit out (the goblins grow bolder, quaint village is razed, go collect the things and fight the guy, roll credits). The game has no shortage of characters, none of which are memorable. Even your mad, talking spellbook who will occasionally comment on environmental objects just fades into the whitenoise of the rest of the game. There's even an optional 'scene' in which you revisit the house of your mentor, you can read his diary and find out why he trained you, poignant music plays in the background. No one's gives a fuck about this guy, he must have less than 50 lines of dialogue in the entire game and he does nothing interesting or memorable whatsoever.\n\n10/10 it's okay", "timestamp_created": 1497998439, "timestamp_updated": 1498130042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492410", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32579812": {"recommendationid": "32579812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081265006", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498460767}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f4e\u914d\u7248\u9b54\u80fd\u52a0\u585e\u5c14\u8fbe\u4f20\u8bf4", "timestamp_created": 1497918947, "timestamp_updated": 1497918947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679487", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32467890": {"recommendationid": "32467890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390995103", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508564628}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7a81\u7136\u505c\u7535 \u5b58\u6863\u90fd\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\uff01\u621160%\u7684\u8fdb\u5ea6\u554a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1497602031, "timestamp_updated": 1497602031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32459313": {"recommendationid": "32459313", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978126730", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497413075}, "language": "english", "review": "Mages of Mystralia is a game that will enchant more than magic spells with its accessible spellcrafting mechanics, sublime soundtrack, and Zelda-like linear progression.\n\nYou can read the full review at [url=http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/review-mages-of-mystralia-pc/]Geeks Under Grace.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1497575525, "timestamp_updated": 1497575545, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32401561": {"recommendationid": "32401561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052492115", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497403875}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a good game. \nI came for an experience like Lichdom battlemage i wanted an expansive spell crafting system.

A more accurate time would be about 10-12 hours.\n\n[b]Introduction[/b]\n==========\nWhen I first saw this game in the Steam store, I instantly fell in love with it. Not only was it beautiful, but it had the awesome gameplay AND great mechanics to go along with the gorgeous graphics! What more could you want from a game? Offering a simple yet deep spell crafting system, Mages of Mystralia is setup to be a fantastic adventure from start to finish. Let's take a closer look! \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n==========\nThe story opens when our young protagonist, Zia, discovers that she comes from a particularly rare bloodline that can use magic. The initial shock and discovery of her powers causes her to lose control of them, and she accidentally sets her house on fire. Confused, alone, and terrified at what she had just done and what she could do in the future, she exiles herself from her village and sets out on her own. \n\nShortly thereafter she meets an odd fellow simply known as \"Mentor\", and he directs her to Haven, a magical hamlet for mages to come together to share and learn from one another. With nowhere else to go, Zia decides to head to Haven. On her way there, she falls off a bridge and into the valley below, where she discovers a powerful tome that speaks to her. It says that \"she'll do\" and teaches her a few basic spells to help her reach Haven. Once there, she is tasked with all sort of objectives to help further her study in the magical arts, and discovers a war is coming. It's up to her to learn as much as she can to help stop the upcoming war.\n\nThis game has a distinct Zelda feel to it, in that it allows you to roam the land and battle monsters, find treasure, and upgrade your equipment and abilities. As an action adventure game, you'll find yourself facing hordes of enemies and big bosses, with only your spells to defend yourself with. Fortunately, Mages of Mystralia features a robust spellcrafting system that eventually allows you to create your spells in an impressive amount of ways.\n\nYou start off with your 4 runes: a projectile spell (Fire), a melee spell (thunders), a shield spell for defense, and an ice spell. As you progress, you'll find/earn more runes that you can add to these basic ones to customize the effects and behaviors of your spells. You example, at first the fire spell just drops a small, stationary fireball that explodes after a few seconds. But once you find the Movement Rune, you can add it to the Fire rune and throw fireballs across the screen! Even more than that, there are more Movement Runes and also Trigger Runes that allow you to change the way spells move and what happens when they hit a target! The possibilities are quite endless. In addition to the Runes, you will also find a myriad of other items. Different Wands are available, which can be found or purchased with Green Soulbeads. There are also Purple Soulbeads, which when 4 are collected can be used to upgrade your maximum health and mana. Mana regenerates slowly over time, so you never really have to worry about running out or stocking up on potions; However you can do so if you wish and use a Mana Charm to restore your mana in a pinch!\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n==========\nThis game is insanely gorgeous. I found myself taking a ton of screenshots and just stopping to look at the environment of each area I found myself in. Each area is colorful and vibrant, full of small details, and greatly immersive. It made me really want to help Zia protect this beautiful land! One thing I really enjoyed were the loading screens. Yes, you heard me right. Each loading screen has a bit of art and some lore for the area you are moving to. It really helped me get to know the land and the stories behind it, which only served to immerse me deeper into the game. \n\n[b]Sound and Music[/b]\n==========\nMusically, this game is like a fairy tale. Very simple but enchanting tracks play literally everywhere. It makes you feel like you really are playing a fairy tale, and that's kinda what the game is. Haven's theme is probably my favorite, and the theme from the Swamp is great as well. It was dark and gloomy, which perfectly matched the spooky feel of the Swamp. Get used to magical tracks as you play this game, as you'll be hearing a lot of them!\n\n[b]Performance[/b]\n==========\nThis game ran almost perfectly. High framerate, controls were pretty simple, and I never had any real issues with it whatsoever. Use of a controller is recommended, but not entirely required; but the game itself does recommend a controller.\n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\n==========\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time playing Mages of Mystralia, and can't recommend it enough to anyone looking for a magical adventure. Zia's journey is one that relates to many people who are also trying to find and make their own way through life. A beautiful game with tons of customization, Mages of Mystralia is well worth giving a shot, and I recommend you do so if you are able.\n\n[b]Gameplay Demo[/b]\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYvg3T7bjL4\n\n[b]Nerd House Verdict[/b]:\n==========\n[h1][b]Highly Recommended[/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1497389133, "timestamp_updated": 1497389200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 147, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.877603", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32390306": {"recommendationid": "32390306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960514574", "num_games_owned": 1256, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497189403}, "language": "french", "review": "D\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par Borealys Games et financ\u00e9 en partie par le biais d'une campagne Kickstarter, Mages of Mystralia est un jeu d'action-RPG dot\u00e9 d'un syst\u00e8me de magie particuli\u00e8rement original. On y incarne Zia, une jeune fille qui est bannie de son village suite \u00e0 un accident de magie. Malheureusement pour elle, la magie est interdite dans le royaume de Mystralia et elle va devoir apprendre \u00e0 maitriser ses pouvoirs gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un bien \u00e9trange mentor. En chemin vers Hauven, le village des magiciens, elle fera la rencontre d'un livre de magie isol\u00e9. Celui-ci va lui apprendre les rudiments de la magie en vitesse acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e et lui faire part des difficult\u00e9s que rencontre la for\u00eat et le monde qui les entoure.\n\nApr\u00e8s seulement quelques instants dans le jeu, on comprend tr\u00e8s vite que l'on est face \u00e0 un jeu unique. Que ce soit au niveau du fond ou de la forme, Mages of Mystralia s\u00e9duit avec une r\u00e9alisation l\u00e9ch\u00e9e et d'une fluidit\u00e9 exemplaire et une histoire plus complexe et int\u00e9ressant qu'il n'y parait. Le tout d\u00e9but du jeu est parfait dans sa mise en situation et on apprend tr\u00e8s vite comment jouer et surtout comment g\u00e9rer la plupart des situations. Une fois que l'on a obtenu les pouvoirs essentiels, il y a toujours quelque chose \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir et des secrets \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir en utilisant de fa\u00e7on intelligente les pouvoirs. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de puzzles, on apprend \u00e0 maitriser le syst\u00e8me de combos de sorts et \u00e0 deviner quelle combinaison fera l'affaire. On aura \u00e9galement la possibilit\u00e9 de savoir si on dispose bel et bien de tous les sorts n\u00e9cessaires permettant de d\u00e9bloquer le puzzle. C'est malin et cela fait gagner du temps en nous \u00e9vitant de faire moult aller-retours sur la carte du jeu.\n\nkamehameha!!!!!!!\nOn est donc face \u00e0 un jeu d'action-RPG plut\u00f4t classique dans son gameplay mais qui dispose d'un syst\u00e8me de combos de sorts juste excellent \u00e0 explorer et \u00e0 exp\u00e9rimenter. On peut imbriquer des runes ayant des effets particuliers comme le rebondissement, le changement de sort \u00e0 la vol\u00e9e et bien d'autres. On peut \u00e9galement programmer des s\u00e9quences de sorts diff\u00e9rents gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une rune sp\u00e9ciale. On peut ainsi se cr\u00e9er plusieurs profiles de sorts pour chaque type de sort de base et les changer \u00e0 la vol\u00e9e sans que la manipulation soit trop complexe. Chaque puzzle nous permettant d'acqu\u00e9rir de nouvelles runes nous obligera \u00e0 maitriser certaines combinaisons ou \u00e0 innover en la mati\u00e8re. On est jamais bloqu\u00e9 m\u00eame si on a pas une rune en particulier et sachant que l'on peut revenir en arri\u00e8re afin de retenter sa chance, il suffit juste d'\u00eatre patient.\n\nL'aventure est vraiment prenante avec une intrigue originale et des protagonistes int\u00e9ressants. On peut \u00e9galement s'amuser \u00e0 trouver des qu\u00eates compl\u00e9mentaires nous permettant d'obtenir de nouvelles runes et des gemmes. Ces gemmes peuvent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour augmenter sa barre de vie ou de mana. Ces 2 barres remontent progressivement apr\u00e8s quelques secondes sans se faire toucher ou sans utiliser de sorts. Il faudra donc optimiser ses sorts afin de ne pas utiliser de sorts trop complexes et qui consommeront plus de mana que d'autres sorts moins complexes. Il n'y a rien de pire que de se retrouver \u00e0 sec en plein combat contre un boss! Sachez toutefois que l'on peut consommer des ressources sp\u00e9ciales nous remontant automatiquement notre mana et notre vie, pratique mais rare. Il y a \u00e9galement une gestion d'inventaire et d'\u00e9quipement dans Mages of Mystralia. Il faudra changer de baguettes magiques en fonction de leurs bonus et des situations que l'on va devoir g\u00e9rer. La glace fonctionnera mieux contre des ennemis de feu par exemple.\n\nMignon mais pas si facile que ca!\n\nMages of Mystralia est un jeu tr\u00e8s complet, il dispose d'une excellente dur\u00e9e et de vie et bien des challenges \u00e0 affronter. Comptez 12-14 heures pour en venir \u00e0 bout et 6-8 heures en plus pour peu que vous souhaitiez d\u00e9bloquer tout ce que propose le jeu en mati\u00e8re de runes, puzzles et de challenges divers. En plus des puzzles utilisant les sorts afin de d\u00e9bloquer des runes, il existe aussi d'autres types de puzzles n\u00e9cessitant une forte r\u00e9flexion afin de placer des curseurs dans le bon endroit afin d'illuminer toutes les pi\u00e8ces dudit puzzle. C'est parfois complexes mais tellement gratifiant lorsque l'on y arrive par soi-m\u00eame. Le style graphique du jeu est juste impeccable avec des effets de sorts splendides et un character design original et r\u00e9ussi. La maniabilit\u00e9 est excellente avec des touches bien pens\u00e9es et une gestion parfaite des manettes Xbox One et 360. Le jeu est int\u00e9gralement en excellent fran\u00e7ais ce qui est un \u00e9norme plus!\n\nJe me suis r\u00e9gal\u00e9 en jouant \u00e0 Mages of Mystralia que ce soit au d\u00e9but ou \u00e0 la fin malgr\u00e9 un challenge final plut\u00f4t cors\u00e9. Ne vous fiez pas aux graphismes mignons et au c\u00f4t\u00e9 cartoon, ce jeu est difficile et ne conviendra pas aux plus jeunes d'entre vous. Mention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la bande son qui est vraiment excellent et apporte un \u00e9norme plus \u00e0 l'ambiance et \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 du jeu. Il s'agit d'une excellente surprise me concernant m\u00eame si j'ai particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la campagne Kickstarter et que j'ai pu y jouer en version beta.

I was worried when I saw the \"plays best with a controller\" warning during startup; luckily I've only hit one thing that baffled me for a while (namely, your character's facing is irrelevant even when using a directional shield spell - it's the relative direction to the mouse pointer. Very unintuitive, though once I caught on it was actually easier to use.)\n\nBut it's extremely frustrating to not be able to configure the k/m controls. I am stuck with keyboard equivalents for spells 3 and 4 when I have three perfectly useful extra mouse buttons; it's particularly clumsy to target a spell with mouse and spacebar while also in motion (WASD).\n\nGiven the chance to do more than thumbs up or down, I'd give this game a solid A for design and features (not an A+ because of the puzzles that require split-second timing instead of solid thinking) but only a B or B- for playability on mouse and keyboard.", "timestamp_created": 1497300989, "timestamp_updated": 1497300989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32352857": {"recommendationid": "32352857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059283944", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517074532}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.

It was the last day of the convention and I only had two appointments, so I mostly spent the day walking around checking out booths, and I\u2019m so glad I got to try this one out! Mages of Mystralia follows the journey of a young mage-in-training named Zia, who struggles to protect the valley she calls home while fighting the anti-magic ruling class of Mystralia.\n\nSo I\u2019m gonna dig right into it with Mystralia\u2019s spell crafting system, which is this game\u2019s main and strongest feature. Mystralia focuses quite a bit on puzzle solving to move through its many dungeons, and this is accomplished through the use of four basic spells: Immedi, which allows for melee attacks and bursts, Actus, which creates mines and projectiles, Creo, which can create a variety of useful tools from ice bridges to windy tornados, and Ego, which is used to cast shields, dash, and more. As you move through the game, you find runes which allow you to modify the spells in certain ways. Behavior runes allow you to modify a spell\u2019s behaviors, such as making it move, multiplying the effect, or making the effects more potent. Augment runes effect behavior runes and base spells in certain ways, making them veer left or right, extending their time, or causing a spell to move backwards.. Trigger runes allow spells to trigger other spells, creating cascading chains. All these alterations, however, are dependent on your level of mana. The more alterations you make, the more mana a spell costs. Adding complex trigger spells could result in you only getting off one spell and then being left in the lurch! Later, you can also change the essence (element) of the spell to create different effects. The nice thing about the spell system is that you can save and rename spells. This allows you to quick cycle through your spells for battles and fast puzzles.\n\nAnd like I said, most of this game is environmental puzzle solving. In addition to the dungeons, which are filled with Zelda-esque puzzle solving, there are puzzles are hidden around the valley. Solving these puzzles with grant you purple soul beads, which you can use to purchase health and mana upgrades at the mage\u2019s Haven. These puzzles my also yield runes. As far as I could tell, important runes were hidden in obvious places in the dungeons while runes not necessarily required to complete missions were scattered around the world. While these ruins may be skipped over or collected later, collecting the runes earlier allows for more diverse gameplay and styles. I am a huge fan of puzzle solving in RPG adventures, and love hidden collectibles, so this was a treat to see. In general, this game rewards those who explore hub areas, talk to NPCs, and complete side quests. My favorite!\n\nThe story, from what I\u2019ve seen so far, is fast-paced, which keeps the game moving at a good speed, but there are actually times I wish the game would slow down and tell the story a bit more fully. We are rapidly introduced to the world of mages then almost immediately sent on a series of quests to save the valley. We meet necromancers and sages and (no spoilers) but a character that seems important dies suddenly off screen. Environmental storytelling helps to cushion the pacing, but this world is ancient and magical and I\u2019d love to take a little more time to appreciate it. Speaking of the world, the styling of the game is beautiful. The colorful and simple but detailed design is reminiscent of The Windwaker series or Epistory. When occasionally playing cutscenes things can look a little clunky, but just in overall game play the world looks great, and plays great. Even with more complex spells, I didn\u2019t notice any particular issues with frame rates or graphics. \n\nThe camera is fixed, moving along its own set path. By and large, this is fine, because even when moving behind buildings you can see Zia silhouetted on the other side, however for some challenges and puzzles I wish it were possible to get a little more perspective on the situation. Additionally, I will say that there are certain cases, when facing mobs of monsters, you can drain your mana very quickly and be forced to dodge attacks while your mana reloads. There are a few situations where this leaves you backed in a corner absorbing a lot of damage. I never died in one of these attacks and there is a quick mana recharge option that can be used as long as you have a spare mana charm, but I can see that being a potentially frustrating situation for some gamers.\n\nSo let\u2019s bring it home with my final thoughts on Mages of Mystralia. This is a gamers to program their own way through puzzles and battles under the guise of magic. The story can be too fast-paced and you may occasionally have to deal with camera issues while searching for secrets or fighting a particularly nasty mob, but I think this game set out to do one thing really well and I think it nailed it. I recommend this game for any adventure RPG fan.", "timestamp_created": 1496733209, "timestamp_updated": 1496733209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32214379": {"recommendationid": "32214379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259879891", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496727938}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u600e\u4e48\u8bf4\u5462\uff0c\u524d10\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7ed9\u4eba\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u597d\u3002\n\n\n10\u5c0f\u65f6\u8fc7\u540e\uff1a\u54e6\u600e\u4e48\u53c8\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u602a\uff1b\u8fd9\u8c1c\u9898\u597d\u65e0\u804a\uff1b\u53ea\u8981\u8fde\u70b9B\u952e\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u5427\u3002\n\n\n+BGM\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u7cbe\u826f\u4e86\n+\u753b\u98ce\u8d4f\u5fc3\u60a6\u76ee\n+\u521b\u610f\u4e0d\u9519\n\n-\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fc7\u77ed\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5c31\u6e38\u620f\u7ed9\u4eba\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6765\u8bb2\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u4e5f\u8bb8\u521a\u597d\u3002\n-\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u89e3\u8c1c\u5957\u8def\u548c\u4e3a\u6570\u4e0d\u591a\u7684\u51e0\u79cd\u9b54\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4eba\u5f88\u5feb\u89c9\u5f97\u67af\u71e5\u4e4f\u5473\uff0c\u7b26\u6587\u57fa\u672c\u90fd\u53ea\u80fd\u6781\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u9b54\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u5b9e\u8d28\u4e0a\u7684\u4e50\u5b50\u3002\u62ff\u5230\u964d\u96e8\u4e4b\u540e\u6218\u6597\u57fa\u672c\u5c31\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u65e0\u53cc\u5272\u8349\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7b26\u6587\u9664\u4e86\u5076\u5c14\u89e3\u8c1c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u7528\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u90fd\u662f\u6446\u8bbe\uff0c\u5c31\u7b97\u662f\u89e3\u8c1c\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u964d\u96e8\u548c\u4f20\u9001\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u4e8eimba\u7684\u7b26\u6587\uff0c\u767d\u778e\u4e86\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u521b\u610f\u3002\uff08\u6301\u7eed\u6cd5\u672f\uff0c\u9009\u571f\u7cfb\uff0c\u7b26\u6587\u63d2\u964d\u96e8\uff0c\u5728\u6c34\u91cc\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u653e\u4e0d\u51fa\u6765\u554ammp\uff09\n-\u602a\u7269\u79cd\u7c7b\u5355\u8c03\uff0c\u7ffb\u6765\u8986\u53bb\u5c31\u662f\u90a3\u51e0\u79cd\u3002\n-\u5267\u60c5\u5c55\u5f00\u8fc7\u4e8e\u751f\u786c\u548c\u83ab\u540d\u5176\u5999\uff0c\u5f3a\u884c\u5b89\u6392\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u7ebf\u8ba9\u4f60\u8fd9\u4e48\u53bb\u8d70\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\u7a81\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2a\u732b\u5934\u9e70\u554a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5bfc\u5e08\u6b7b\u7684\u554a\u2026\u2026\u795e\u79d8\uff0c\u55e6\u4e0d\u51fa\u8bdd\u3002\n-\u6c49\u5316\u6709\u673a\u7ffb\u5acc\u7591\u3002\u79bb\u5f00\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u771f\u7684\uff0c\u906d\u4e0d\u4f4f\u3002\n\n\n\n\n\u5982\u679c\u73a9\u5230\u4e00\u534a\u6765\u5199\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bc4\uff0c\u90a3\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u597d\u8bc4\u7684\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u518d\u6765\u5199\u2026\u2026\u53ea\u80fd\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e0d\u503c\u8fd9\u4ef7\u3002\n\u901a\u5173\u540e\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u6709\u518d\u53bb\u6253100%\u7684\u5fc3\u60c5\u4e86\u3002\u8f93\u4e86\uff0c\u8f93\u7684\u900f\u5f7b\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1496729362, "timestamp_updated": 1496729362, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569359", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32212382": {"recommendationid": "32212382", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972070146", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496524758}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed the crap out of this game.

Definate thumbs up. Things to note: As of this writing you really should have a controller to play it right. They are working on better keyboard bindings and I am sure that in the future this will not be such an issue.\n\nWhile it might look like a simple platformer at first the spell grid sigil system is pretty neat, and there are fun puzzles, both to open areas in a grid like puzzle format and in figuring out how to best build spells to solve other puzzles.\n\nThat combined with the over all story (which is a bit campy and tongue in cheek but cute) leads to a fun game.\n\nIf I were to make any suggestions about the game I would say that each time you get a sigil it would be nice to see a little example, like a cut scene or one free example of a spell using it so that the player knows what it does more clearly. The tool tips are nice but sometimes it is not entirely clear what a function does and how best to place it in a grid to get the desired effect.\n\nStill, it is a great game and I encourage you to try it, at $25 (at the time of this writing) I found it actually a pretty good deal.\n\nThe one other thing I'd like to see is a variant of this where you can play a necromancer with different spells and so on.

Maybe a bit too easy (for me anyway) and no adjustable difficulty. Hoping for an expansion. 8/10.\n-----\nLike other people are saying, the spell creation is awesome. It's simple to understand with lots of combinations and different modifiers.\n\nI really enjoyed the game, and it's a nice thing that all the challenges/quests are solveable the whole game through. No risk of missing anything.\n\nGraphics are really saturated and cute, kind of cartoonish that works really well. Background audio is fitting for the environments. Sound effects are good and delivers the right atmosphere.\nThe UI is clean and the menu system is simple and easy. No issues at all.\n\nPersonally I had no bugs or error except for one tiny thing - when I got struck by an enemy the camera stopped following me for a short time. But when I ran out of picture and back again it snapped right back to me. No biggie and it only happened once.\n\nThe game offers some interesting challenges, but I wish there was an option for a harder difficulty setting. I completed the game without ever dying. Which doesn't have to be a bad thing, of course.\nTo me the hardest part of the game was _finding_ all the extra stuff. A lot of running around and checking every corner.\n\nThe game recommends playing with a controller when you start it, and I totally agree. This game could probably be played with KB/M, but with the controller everything just feels right. I think it would be pretty hard keeping all the spells intuitive on the keyboard. \n\nIf you're looking for a cozy adventure game with magic and puzzles, you have it right here. \u20ac20 is a good

The only complaint I have so far is the spell hotkey system's controls. You have 1-4 on the keyboard set for spell slots, and tap the keys repeatedly to cycle each slot's spell. The issue is the first press doesn't change the selected spell out. This wouldn't be a problem if it was selecting a slot on the first press ro something, but each slot is already bound to different cast keypresses (left/right click, space, shift-click) so there's no need to select. And if you dont press the same key again fast enough the spell selection times out.

You will spend a lot of time tinkering with the spell system to come up with some crazy spells. \n\nIt also makes the optional content more enticing since you could get more ways to alter your spells. The game also makes use of interesting puzzles that will involve modifying your spells to achieve the objective. Thankfully, the game will indicate if you have the right runes in each puzzle so you dont need to tear your hair out trying to find a solution you dont have yet.\n\nControls are tight.

"playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495704083}, "language": "english", "review": "The spell crafting is the main event here. I didn't really like the visual style, it was pretty clean and the color palette was very appropriate for each area, but the models and animation really didn't work for me. This game rewards completionist and explorers while having a good pace about each area. 95% of the time the spells were intuitive, but the occasional hiccup wasn't a big problem. The music was solid enough that I wouldn't listen to other music on the side while playing, which is an accomplishment when it comes to soundtracks and sound design. \n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: I liked being able to express my creativity in spells and I love collecting things that are useful, which this game has plenty of. Despite the game's weaknesses those two features carried the whole enjoyment of the game for me and I had a great time. \n\n--- Somewhat spoilery from here on ---\n\nA problem I can't entirely blame on the developers is the dominant strategy gameplay and low difficulty. Considering how much freedom we have in spellcrafting it would be hard to balance the game if certain players never found or experimented with the right spells to be strong enough to fight the bosses. I think they were undertuned for this reason, but its a bit too low. They made a good move with the 4 spell types so it avoids some of the \"make the best spell then never change it\" style gameplay, but doesn't really fix it.\n\nThe last section of the story is the weakest when it comes to pacing. You've finally acquired all the main elements for spellcrafting, then you go through a simple gauntlet to the boss and its over. The element of your birthright as Zia is the last and most unused element just because it's last. \n\nThe balance of puzzle to combat is just about perfect. Each has some problems though:\nThe puzzles that aren't \"drag circles with arrows\" puzzles, the kind that are in the world are the best ones. They're only interesting early on when you have limited spells and need to use some creativity. My favorite was using the Shield spell with the homing modifier to pull items towards you. Pulling an explosive barrel into a destroyable wall was the most \"I think I figured this out earlier than I needed to\" moment I had, which was great experience. Most of the rest are simple or a little too precise to not have brute force be easiest solution. \nCombat almost works, but I feel like kiting gameplay gets old after a while. Being chased by multiple enemies seems to class with spell casting. There are four reinforced combat dynamics:\n1-Shoot your best spell before it can touch you.\n2-Run, turn around, shoot fast spell, turn again and run untill you have distance.\n3-Run, cast an area of effect spell, keep runing.\n4-Attach a reversed strong spell to the dash and just dash in straight lines. \n(5-Change element of any of the above if they're resistant)\n[olist]\n[*]usually fails and leads to 2, \n[*]is 90% of the game, \n[*]is boring and weak, \n[*]s very effective but too repetetive to not be boring.\n[/olist]\n2 has an alternate where you drop stone copies of yourself to draw aggro and shoot whoever is tricked, but it really is just the same. Run, shoot, run, shoot. Its engaging because it will kill you if you don't keep running and shooting, but its not that deep. \n\nThere is little precision and little thinking when it comes to most enemies. The interesting ones are the shaman ones who capture and reflect spells and the scorpions that have an armored carapace that can be broken with explosives. They get subverted when you get enough magic to spam spells, but untill then they're pretty interesting. I may be forgetting one or two other interesting ones but most are just [charge straight at the player unless staggered]. \n\nThis game could use some more puzzle bosses. The chess crypt boss was really close to being very solid, the floor mechanic just missed the mark a little. The big tree was just ok, it needed to be simple since it was an early boss. The twin slimes was just ok too, but gets points in making you decide who to attack in the boss itself. The ice salamander was mostly a waiting game. \n\nI'm not much of a story structure-literate person, so I won't comment on it, someone else probably will say what I could much better. I liked the voice blurbs, but I'd like if there could be more of them so it didn't sound like it repeated so often. \n\n[i]To summarize and mention some other things:[/i][list]\n[*]Great magic system with questionable balance\n[*]solid music\n[*]one good boss and two good enemies\n[*]magic casting clashes with the enemies in the game\n[*]meaniful collectables that approach a metroidvania\n[*]classic but overused elemental areas like ice, fire, and forest, the crypt and mine were a nice change of pace and had good puzzles\n[*]I liked Zia as a character, but the overall character art style wasn't my cup of tea. Maybe it's a cultural difference, or maybe I'm too used to [i]muh japanese anime style[/i]\n[/list]\nI don't think I'd replay the game, but my playthrough was a great time and it was very worth the price and time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1495708568, "timestamp_updated": 1495708568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31949087": {"recommendationid": "31949087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142257855", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 443, "last_played": 1521188906}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u600e\u4e48\u8bf4\u5462\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u773c\u524d\u4e00\u4eae\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u9b54\u6cd5\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7528\u624b\u67c4\u6bd4\u7528\u952e\u76d8\u597d\u4e00\u4e9b\uff0c\u597d\u8bc4", "timestamp_created": 1495707728, "timestamp_updated": 1495707728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31947001": {"recommendationid": "31947001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014816693", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495688026}, "language": "english", "review": "Received via Kickstarter  (Mage King reward level)\n\nI wanted to hold off on a review until I had finished the game, which I did this morning, quickly followed by finishing up the few achievements I had left. After finishing the game I can say that I don't regret in the slightest backing the project and have been recommending the game to all of my friends. \n\nThe game itself was written by Ed Greenwood, of Forgotten Realms fame. It has a very bright and colorful visual aspect. While it does have combat and a few mentions of darker content (very glossed over), it's suitable for schoolage children and older gamers alike. \n\nThe game story isn't super deep and I really hope they expand on it with future DLC, but where Mages really excels at are its spellcrafting system and its puzzles. Every spell in the game is something you have to craft yourself, from a simple lightning slash to screen-filling homing fireballs that explode with ice. The puzzles come in two types. Some you have to craft a spell with just the right properties to fulfill the requirements, and others you have to move connectors to form a specific pattern. The lasty thing I'll mention here is that the soundtrack is EXCEPTIONALLY well done, and really adds to the game experience.\n\nThere are some downsides. Quests are very basic, mostly in the errand/fetch category, and there aren't very many of them at all. Some of them seem very very basic at that, with some NPCs seemingly losing interest in what they asked for. In fact, some of the NPCs are very basic, something that occurs in most games to be honest but with the low NPC count in this game its much more noticable. My only other complaint is that if you boil away all of the exploration and rune/bead hunting, the game is actually quite short. I have roughly 22 hours in the game, but 3/4 of that is all treasure hunting.\n\n\nPros:\nAmazing spellcrafting system\nVibrant, cheerful colors\nOverall story is great\nAwesome puzzles\nSpellcrafting deserves two mentions\nAmazing soundtrack\n\nCons:\nQuests are basic and simple\nNot enough quests\nNPCs aren't fleshed out\nMain story is a bit short", "timestamp_created": 1495696474, "timestamp_updated": 1495696730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31946020": {"recommendationid": "31946020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063300679", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496268878}, "language": "english", "review": "Not played a lot, but i see a lot of potential in this game.

I recommeng the purchase for people who have tastes between casual and light experience as a game.  More experienced gamers play everything.  :)\n\nI loved the art, but did not like the character.  I had no issue with her, but I have no affinity for Zia.  I have no issue playing  female.  I just don't care for her.  I have no reason to care about anyone in this story.  The city had one good thing, a reference to Terry Pratchett.  *Salute*\n\nOther than that everything in the world felt telegraphed.  It was too easy - and it had to be because of how linear it is.\n\nThe game mechanic is a great step - but incomplete.  I would love to see this grown into a real experience, but for now, there is little more to this than an easy beat-em-up....  with the same areas over and over with more difficult, but not really hard, enemies that scale to your new spells.  Frankly, at that point - this is a one time playthrough that has no pay-off.  Mods will save this, but what is here feels like a game that needs mods, which seems like it is flexible, but actually has less freedom and is somehow more linear than Torchlight.  I keep looking to hope this is just early access.\n\nThe spell crafting is neat, but needs more sophistication and maybe some actual context.  It is not *endless* by any means.  No object animation, no combining elements to fuse hybrids...  Also, Regio would be a better name for Actus, and Muto would be a better one for Ego.  Also, what Mage doesn't have conjuration???  The magick is light programming logic with limited effective combinations - to solve puzzles.   The rest is beat em up with magic....  with infinite respawning enemies in areas that are small in size and hedged in.\n\nAs for spell crafting - Two Words 2 is ABSOLUTELY MORE FLEXIBLE.\n\nThe story is dialed in.  I love Ed Greenwood.  I really enjoyed the world of Faerun for decades.  It does not even fit the atmosphere.  It certainly does not hit like Spellfire, but it has glimmers of it...  The music is lovely, but doesn't shine.  Good background.  As a game, this would likely be a much more fun experience for an inexperienced or casual gamer.\n\nThe art is superb and I wanted to enjoy this more than I did.

The combat leaves enough room for you to win using vastly different setups, though enemies immune to multiple elements might make you feel frustrated at times.\n\nI'm currently around 30%~40% progress, and even if the later parts of the game don't maintain the level of quality as the part I've seen so far, it will still be super fun (there will be more magic to find and more spells to craft - that will never be not fun), and worth every penny of the full price.\n\nThe devs seem to have plans to update the game for a while, so I'm looking forward to see the game improve in the near future. \n\n-------------\n(Below is a quick Chinese review for the game.)\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u201c\u521b\u4f5c\u6cd5\u672f\u201d\uff0c\u9b54\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u975e\u5e38\u76f4\u89c2\u6613\u61c2\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ec0\u4e48\u7f16\u7a0b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c[b]\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u73a9[/b]\u3002\n\u5728\u5267\u60c5\u3001\u8282\u594f\u3001\u754c\u9762\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6216\u8bb8\u4f1a\u6709\u8fd9\u6837\u90a3\u6837\u7684\u7455\u75b5\u548c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c0f\u5c0f\u7f3a\u70b9\u5e76\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6e38\u620f\u6700\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u968f\u7740\u4e3b\u89d2\u89e3\u9501\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u65b0\u9b54\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5c1d\u8bd5\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6cd5\u672f\u6784\u6210\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b26\u6587\u6765\u89e3\u8c1c\u4e0e\u6253\u602a\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u53d1\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u65f6\u4e0d\u65f6\u90fd\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4eba\u6709\u8c41\u7136\u5f00\u6717\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u8fc7\u763e\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\n\u521d\u671f\u7684\u8282\u594f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6162\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u201c\u81ea\u5df1\u8bbe\u8ba1/\u7f16\u7a0b\u9b54\u6cd5\u201d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7edd\u5bf9\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u3002\u6211\u5173\u6ce8\u8fc7\u4e5f\u73a9\u8fc7\u597d\u51e0\u4e2a\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u8fd9\u6b3e\u7b97\u5f97\u4e0a\u662f\u540c\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7c\u4f7c\u8005\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u4e8f\u3002\n\u754c\u9762\u548c\u83dc\u5355\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u4f46\u636e\u8bf4\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4e0d\u7528\u62c5\u5fc3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1495643367, "timestamp_updated": 1495643415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804567", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31935990": {"recommendationid": "31935990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163370909", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511701568}, "language": "german", "review": "Wenn ich nach Haven versuche in andere gebite zu reisen dann st\u00fcrtzt das spiel im oder kurz noch dem Ladebildschrim ab\n", "timestamp_created": 1495639112, "timestamp_updated": 1495639112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31935864": {"recommendationid": "31935864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029516215", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495634922}, "language": "french", "review": "J'\u00e9cris ces mots apr\u00e8s avoir fini le jeu \u00e0 80 % selon ma sauvegarde, et ce apr\u00e8s 8 h de jeu (ne vous fiez pas \u00e0 mon compteur d'heures de jeu, on met tous nos jeux en pause le temps d'aller manger ou de faire autre chose). Et la prmi\u00e8re chose qui me vient \u00e0 lesprit, c'est : \"Est-ce que j'ai envie d'y rejouer, histoire de finir le jeu \u00e0 100 % ?\" et la r\u00e9ponse est non.\n\nAlors j'ai pay\u00e9 20 balles pour un jeu qui dure 8h et que j'ai pourtant pas mal retourn\u00e9 ?\n\nOui.\n\nMais ce n'est pas la dur\u00e9e de vie qui compte, n'est-ce pas ? Apr\u00e8s tout, il y a d'\u00e9xcellents jeu qui sont assez courts et vendus plus chers que \u00e7a. Ce n'est pas la dur\u00e9e qui compte mais le plaisir qu'on a dans l'\u00e9xperience.\nCe n'est absolument pas mon avis mais oublions la dur\u00e9e de vie fam\u00e9lique du jeu pour se concentrer sur la qualit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9xperience. Parce que l\u00e0 encore il y a des choses \u00e0 redire.\n\nPremi\u00e8re chose, qu'on voit d\u00e9s qu'on d\u00e9marre le jeu (enfin trois minutes apr\u00e8s parce que le jeu rame \u00e9norm\u00e9ment au d\u00e9marrage), les mentions l\u00e9gales s'affichent. Parmi elles, on peut lire ces mots \u00e0 la lecture desquels j'aurait du refund le jeu instantan\u00e9ment :\n\n\"Powered by unity\"\n\nA ce moment l\u00e0, je savais d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 quoi m'attendre.\nQu'est-ce qui en d\u00e9coule ?\n\nEt bien le jeu est MOU. Les animations sont molles, le gameplay est mou, les contr\u00f4les sont mous (au clavier en tout cas, car si le jeu est fait pour \u00eatre jou\u00e9 \u00e0 la manette, il a le bon go\u00fbt de ne pas supporter ma manette.) Vous voulez bouger pour esquiver un projectile qui arrive sur vous ? Pr\u00e9voyez une bonne seconde !\n\nLa dir\u00e9ction artistique est passable au possible. C'est tr\u00e8s \"cartoon\" mais sans les d\u00e9tails. Bref, \u00e7a essaie d'\u00eatre \u00e9pur\u00e9 mais c'est juste trop simple. Le nombre d'ennemis diff\u00e9rents est ridicule en plus du fait qu'ils n'aient RIEN d'original. Les gobelins viennent en quatre coloris, les squelettes en 2, les vers cracheurs en trois. Rien de ce que vous verrez n'aura un sentiment de fraicheur puisque ce sera soit vu et revu (ouah, des gobelins. Original.), soit vu et revu DANS le jeu.\n\nEt comme dit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, les animations sont bien molles. La d\u00e9marche des squelettes qui essaie de donner une impression de maladresse est juste risible tant on a l'impression qu'ils sont constament en train de fondre. En bref, ce n'est pas beau \u00e0 regarder.\n\nEnsuite, le gameplay a un \u00e9norme souci de \"vigeur\" de jeu. Quand on prend un coup, on est stun lock. Quand on est stun lock et qu'on prend un coup, on est re stun lock. Au d\u00e9but \u00e7a va, on esquive rapidement les coups et puis, on croise des groupes de cinq-six \u00e9nnemis et puis on se fait taper en boucle pendant trois secondes avant de pouvoir \u00e0 nouveau bouger. Evidemment, vous allez perdre un tiers de votre vie dans l'op\u00e9ration :) .\n\nCe genre de conneries, c'est frustrant, mais c'est aussi super visible d\u00e9s qu'on test le jeu. Normalement ce genre de soucis disparaissent \u00e0 l'alpha, mais l\u00e0 non. Ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 vous amuser dans des combats de groupe.\n\nCe probl\u00e8me de stun lock est encore plus criant contre les ennemis qui jettent des explosifs. Un coup et vous vous retrouvez \u00e0 terre, parfois pile avec le bon timming pour vous en reprendre un juste derri\u00e8re et recommencer (encore merci aux d\u00e9placement qui mettent quasi une seconde \u00e0 se lancer). Le manque de maniabilit\u00e9 du jeu est d'ailleurs sa seule source de difficult\u00e9 puisque mes seules morts (3 au total) ont eu lieu contre un boss qui jette des explosifs et o\u00f9 l'on se bat sur des plateformes r\u00e9duites, ce qui emp\u00eache de manoeuvrer \u00e0 causes des chaussures en savon de l'h\u00e9ro\u00efne.\n\nJe passe sur le niveau ultime de backtracking que propose le jeu. Visitez une fois la for\u00eat et elle sera \"sympa\", visitez la cinq fois et vous conna\u00eetrez par coeur son absence de textures.\n\nMais le syst\u00e8me de magie !\n\nOui le syst\u00e8me de magie est cool. C'est parfois utile de pouvoir changer ses sorts mais on finira tr\u00e8s vite par programmer quatre sorts pour ne quasiment plus toucher au livre des sorts.\n\nPourquoi ?\n\nParce que sur le papier, c'est super cool de pouvoir faire des triples boules de feu rebondissantes qui, quand elles touches, d\u00e9clenchent des \u00e9boulements. Ca serait mieux si, dans les faits, vous pouviez en lancer plus de trois avant de vous retrouver \u00e0 court de mana et vous retrouver \u00e0 courir en rond autour des ennemis.\n\nLes combats de boss sont d'ailleurs assez pitoyables puisque vous allez passer votre temps \u00e0 courir en rond en attendant que votre mana remonte, a esquiver les attaques path\u00e9tiques car molassones du boss.\n\nLe seul point vraiment positif du jeu, ce sont les \u00e9nigmes sous forme de d\u00e9fi qui utilisent vraiment bien le syst\u00e8eme de magie. Le hic, c'est que vous alles passer cinquante minutes de combat mou du genou et de backtracking pour moins de dix minutes d'\u00e9nigme.\n\nPour terminer, j'aimerais vous parler du sc\u00e9nario et de l'univers \u00e9crit par Ed Greenwood, juste pour vous dire qu'il n'a AUCUN int\u00earet. C'est plat \u00e0 en mourir, les m\u00e9chants ne sont pas en fait de vrais m\u00e9chants sauf celui qui a une t\u00eate de m\u00e9chant. Les mentors restent chez eux \u00e0 rien branler pendant que vous sauvez le monde. L'histoire est convenue et le lore est chiant, simpliste et enfantin. Ca a clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 pens\u00e9 pour des enfants mais m\u00eame dans cette optique, \u00e7a reste totalement oubliable.\n\nA n'acheter que si vous n'avez rien \u00e0 faire et que le prix descend \u00e0 dix euros ou moins.\n", "timestamp_created": 1495638617, "timestamp_updated": 1495638617, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593135",

"last_played": 1496110603}, "language": "english", "review": "Fabulous game.  Spell creation is really intuitive and fun, and it lets you do a lot of exciting things, like self-multiplying random firing spells that propagate continuously until you run out of magic.  The world is very vibrant and colourful and fun to run around blowing up with magic.  It's very Zelda-esque, with a lot to discover.\n\nThe puzzles are all pretty good.  Camera is at fixed angles, so you're never left missing things that you should see.  They take a reasonable amount of thought without ever being frustrating.  I suspect someone who is like, hardcore into puzzle gaming probably won't be that engaged, but otherwise I found them fun to solve.  There's too many \"light all the torches in X seconds\" puzzles though.\n\nHas some problems, and I really love a lot about this game, so I hate saying that.\n\nThe bosses suck.  Just completely suck.  They LOOK awesome, but they're boring, bog-standard latter-day Zelda bosses.  Expose glowing weak point, attack glowing weak point, repeat until dead.  Then there's some that DON'T follow that pattern, but go down like chumps.  So that's pretty disappointing; I've stopped dodging most of the time, as I can usually just stand there and spam my best attacks.\n\nDungeons and general progression in the game are/is pretty formulaic.  You will require an element from the previous dungeon to progress in the next one, and that's a little disheartening.  I feel it would have benefitted a lot with a more open design that allowed you to build your own solutions to problems, rather than putting solid barriers in your path that say \"you must have X element to proceed.\"  Something like Zelda 1 where you are just in the world and so are all the things you want to do and get but in no specific sequence, would have been perfect.  Or like Zelda 3 where the plot happens in intervals but how and when you get to those intervals is up to you.\n\nMy one problem with the puzzles is that a lot of the minor ones (that is, puzzles which don't bar your progression in the game) can be solved without the \"correct\" solution, but it's never creatively.  That is to say, I've never solved a puzzle I shouldn't have been able to solve by doing some quirky trick with a new spell, but I HAVE solved a lot of puzzles by spamming random bouncing fireballs that proc more random bouncing fireballs.  It's funny the first couple of times, but it's not much of an accomplishment.  Compare this with a Metroid game where I can get an item early by figuring out how to do angled bomb jumps or mockballing or some other clever trick.\n\nSo what it boils down to is there's a beautiful set up that lets you be super creative with all this magic... and then the world doesn't really give you an opportunity to excersize that creativity beyond how you choose to annihilate full screens of enemies.  Instead, you progress through a very linear series of dungeons and plot events with very clear solutions reliant on the most basic of your spells.\n\nBut in spite of all that, it's a super fun, amazing game, and I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1495594445, "timestamp_updated": 1495594445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31927782": {"recommendationid": "31927782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988544676", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501490677}, "language": "english", "review": "wow...", "timestamp_created": 1495593577, "timestamp_updated": 1495593577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31927281": {"recommendationid": "31927281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005317429", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487428743}, "language": "french", "review": "This game is epic !

realise that most gamers either do have game pads or are comfortable with the WASD keys. It looks good and I wanted to know more about the world and its people even though I only played 15 minutes or so.    But for me it was time for a refund.\n\nI didn't notice any warning that you should use a controller to play the game.  The game looks great and I love the idea of the games spell system.  But there was no way to remap keys that I could find.  I don't use WASD keys to play game nor do I use gamepads.  I gave it a go on the WASD keys - and the game is engaging - but I just couldn't adapt to play and ended up walking off cliffs etc.\nSo, it\u2019s a thumbs up from me \u2013 but a warning to older gamers like myself or left handed players who like to reconfigure the keys.    \n", "timestamp_created": 1495509557, "timestamp_updated": 1495509557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598865", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31911368": {"recommendationid": "31911368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083996180", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498548276}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u98ce\u6e05\u65b0\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6863\u6b21\u7b97\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e86\uff0c\u6709\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6709\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\n\u4f60\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\u80fd\u9047\u5230\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u5b50\u7684\u7b26\u6587\u3002\n\u53ef\u662f\u6bcf\u5f53\u4f60\u83b7\u5f97\u7b26\u6587\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u7279\u522b\u5174\u594b\u3002\n\u800c\u6211\u4f1a\u653e\u4e0b\u6240\u6709\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u82b1\u4e0a\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u53bb\u628a\u8c03\u6574\u7b26\u6587\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u90fd\u4f1a\u60c5\u4e0d\u81ea\u7981\u7684\u54c7\u51fa\u58f0\u6765\u3002\n\u6211\u8fd8\u53ea\u662f\u4e2a\u4e94\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u840c\u65b0\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u6211\u76f8\u4fe1\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u503c\u5f97\u6211\u53bb\u628a\u8fdb\u7a0b\u73a9\u5230100%\u7684\u3002\n\u6e38\u620f\u521a\u51fa\uff0c\u73a9\u7684\u4eba\u5c11\uff0c\u8d34\u5427\u8ba8\u8bba\u7ec4\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e5f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\n\u4efb\u4f55\u4e8b\u60c5\u90fd\u9760\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u653b\u7565\u4ea7\u751f\u4f9d\u8d56\u611f\u3002\n\u6709\u4eba\u8bf470+\u6709\u70b9\u8d35\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u503c\u5f97\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u503c\u5f97\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1495508063, "timestamp_updated": 1495508063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737514", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31911025": {"recommendationid": "31911025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004428529", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496357684}, "language": "english", "review": "Here's the deal, \n\nI've played 18 hours to complete 100% of the game that include the marvelous story, the very creative puzzle and all the achivement steam.\n\nI enjoyed every seconds of that game.

Not yet anyway, as I still want to finish the game. \nSo let me just start by saying that I love this game, and nearly everything about it. Right from the start I was grabbed by it, not to say I'm a hard mark(I'm probably not) but to say that there is so much that I find captivating about it. The music is the first thing you get to experience and it is anything but lackluster, the puzzles made me stop and think(again, probably not that hard) and the world is beautiful. \nI wanted to mention this last because I think it is the most important aspect of this game; the spellcrafting. The spellcrafting is an extraordinary system imo as it allows you to tailor make spells for any situation and encourages exactly that through it's combat and puzzles. It has so much potential as a mechanic and I've ALWAYS played mages before other classes in games for their flashy magic. Let me just say that this did not at all disappoint me.\n\nNow for fairness sake I will say there are a few parts that fell a bit short; the story isn't 100% engaging(to where I am in the game), there isn't any (real) voice acting throughout the game(so for the most part I just did it myself XD), the characters aren't all too memorable, the enemies are a fair bit too predictable. \n\nThis kind of gameplay makes me want to love everything about the game but I can't currently say I do, however these are small things in an indie like this and I would LOVE to see an expansion on this solid effort and beautiful piece of art.\n\nJust to end this off I would like to put a more in depth review of the things I loved and didn't but I'll leave that till the end.

It is, however, forgettable. Good nonetheless.\n\nThe story is really boring and typical. Evil king, mages are persecuted, go save the world or something. The game ends on a needless cliffhanger, even though the game already feels a bit short on story content.\n\nVisually, the game is quite nice. It has the typical cel-shaded Unity game look without looking lazy or bad. It actually is kinda nice. The shadows look kind of bad in some spots, but the game look really good in general.\n\nThe real point of the game, however, is to craft and cast spells. And this is the part of the game that makes me feel conflicted. There is a fair amount you can do with the spellcrafting system, and that is the part that I love. But the part that I don't like is that there is no real reason to actually come up with creative spells. In a weird way, the game falls flat in terms of both combat and puzzles, but it succeeds in the spellcasting system itself.\n\nSo the combat fails for one main reason. The only thing that really matters in combat, besides blocking and dodging, is dealing tons of damage, and there isn't a lot of creative ways to do that. Sure, you can create a rotating image of yourself that shoots out homing projectiles, but why do that when you can create projectiles that shoot out projectiles that shoot out projectiles and so on? Pretty much every combat encounter in the game can be solved by creating these recursive spells that just annihilate everything until you run out of mana. Even the last boss was a joke, with every phase of the fight ending with a single press of the right mouse button. But in a way, the combat was kind of enjoyable. There was something fun about watching my spells destroy everything in the room and lagging out my game. Just seeing how much mayhem I could cause with a single spell was fun in a way. But it leaves me wishing that the spellcasting system was a bit better tuned and that the game found a better way to actually challenge my spellcrafting abilites.\n\nPuzzles kind of have the same problem. Pretty much every puzzle at first was solved by me dashing around and shooting projectiles in quick succession with some exceptions like logic puzzles involving creating statues of yourself and putting them on buttons. But the story puzzles never really challenged me in any meaningful way. I also went out to find all of the spell components to see if those puzzles were any better, but they were solved in mostly the same way, and the teleport component further trivializes the puzzles. In a way, it was kind of fun to solve the puzzles in an unintended way when the game tells me that I may not have the proper components to do so, but I really wish that they would make their puzzles actually require me to be creative.\n\nAnd that is the main issue I have with the game, and the reason why I can only recommend this game if you are really in love with the idea of creating spells. There is never really any reason to utilize all the different components. In my opinion, the game should have given you all of the elements and most of the components early, and then forced you to actually use these components in a creative way to actually progress through the game. But as is stands, you can beat the game without most of the components (quite easily, in fact), you unlock the elements in the last stretch of the game, and you can kill all the enemies by just creating spells that continue to just create themselves. The game feels like it has done the job of fleshing out the underlying mechanics, but not done the job of actually giving you a reason to use them.

felt like I was finding something new to do without having to push the story forward.  Over all the experience feels extremely polished gameplay feel.  Have been told more content patches are on the way (more difficulties, speedrun mode, ect.) as well.\n\nA note - Was playing at 1280x720 windowed using Borderless Gaming.  No AA (Anti Aliasing) setting in game and had to force it in the Nvidia settings (been told there will be a patch for it soon).\n\nPros\n - Expansive spell crating system\n - Lots of extras hidden\n - Great mood music that fits\n - Puzzles all around! (They even tell you if you have what is needed to beat it - Could still beat them even when it ways you don't have everything)\n\n\nCons\n - A bit slow to start\n - Dialog that slows pace game down\n - Keyboard can be clumsy for movement [only have WADA] (Controller is very preferred)", "timestamp_created": 1495188802, "timestamp_updated": 1495188802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31837455": {"recommendationid": "31837455", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997817748", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494493480}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game.

You'll definitely need a pad.\n\n</end of warnings>\n\nIt's a very fun and interesting game, though. The spell system rocks.

I have found myself disappointed every time \"life\" makes me have to sign off. I've only played about 15% of the game contents, but it's been great so far!\n\nThe adaptability of the spell creation is fantastic. This is reason alone to buy the game. I can create the spells I want and play how I'd want to be a mage. You start with a basic set of three spells, then unlock modifiers to make those spells do other things like adding movement or direction, or chaining spells together. The unlock rate is a great balance between keeping you interested/excited about the next unlock & not overwhelming you by drowning you in modifiers. My personal favorite thus fireball with an explosion when it hits something :)\n\nGraphics are cutesy & fit in great with the style of game play. It's a mix of rpg feel with a puzzle game thrown in. The puzzles work really well to increase your creativity with spells creation. Certain puzzles require certain spell combos to complete. It's nice too to have an in game \"cheat\" option, where hints can be provided at the cost of orbs (currency). So if you're super stuck just murder some badies & use the loot for a hint. I also like the first hint free mechanic on all puzzles which tells you if you have the spell components necessary to solve the puzzle. Very much appreciated.\n\nGameplay does feel a bit restricted in that the games does guide you where you need to go. But I'm finding there are some areas that need to be revisited to complete the next step, so perhaps that will continue to improve as I get further in the game.\n\nOverall, a good game, with amazing game mechanics, bosses, and a storyline.", "timestamp_created": 1495143975, "timestamp_updated": 1495143975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31829496": {"recommendationid": "31829496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111157040", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492893559}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to begin,\n\nMages of Mystralia is a puzzle-action game where Zia, a to-be mage, is tasked with going around solving issues as she matures, slowly mastering the four types of magic through runes.\n\nRunes are the basic aspect of the game.

Unlike most other games, this game incourages strategic combination of runes, which imbue the magic casted with specific properties such as the ability to create a path of ice or homing projectiles.

There are TONS of chests and quests to find, and the game encourages backtracking to finish quests or start new ones that hadn't been opened up before. From start to finish, the game was crisp and nothing really felt repetitive. As you played, your skill developed, and every time you hit peak, you got a new rune or ability that opened up to more possibilities for you to uncover.

Great soundtrack, fluid combat, challenging puzzles, tons of secrets.\n\nI am one of the Kickstarter backers and have been playing since Beta. Through the beta it was amazing to see the devs take the advice of the community and continually update the game and its mechanics from the feedback.\n\nI use a keyboard/mouse to play and the game functioned well. Things moved/aimed as I expected them to. This game was designed with consoles in mind so it has very good controller support, but it is definitely NOT a console port.\n\nGameplay feels fluid, puzzles ahead show you how to use abilities you had previously discovered. Sound and music is very suitable to the environment. In combat, you can [i]feel[/i] the impact of your spells. It makes for a VERY immersive game.\n\nPuzzles range widely in difficulty from very easy to quite difficult. It makes you think outside of the box on what to do with your spells.\n\nDesigning spells is very intuitive. Shapes function as you'd expect with a few surprises here and there. The only limit is your imagination. Making spells even feels like it has purpose. Not all shapes can fit in all patterns, which means to make that ultimate spell of destruction, you have to figure out HOW to make it first.\n\nOne issue I have is that it feels a bit short. Two more game modes are being added, So I'm fairly certain that issue will resolve itself. Progress through the game is constant so you will keep discovering new items, spell runes, and puzzles right up to the end of the game.\n\nI will be live with this game frequently at www.twitch.tv/MattmonGaming if you'd like to see it first hand.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1495139836, "timestamp_updated": 1495139836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.733077", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31828552": {"recommendationid": "31828552", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998079479", "num_games_owned": 467, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495137583}, "language": "english", "review": "A short yet packed adventure game that is reminiscent of Zelda in many ways.

It starts off with a bang, placing the reader in Shion Sonozaki\u2019s shoes rather than the previous protagonist, Keiichi Maebara. The game starts off a year before the first three arcs do, and then continues on to follow the plot of the second arc up until its conclusion, all from Shion\u2019s perspective.\n\nThis is wonderful. Shion, the one main character introduced in the second arc rather than the first, had always been a bit of a dark horse. By seeing things from her perspective, the narrative opens up and 07th Expansion begins to give readers answers to their questions as well as rounding out her character and her twin sister Mion\u2019s as well. The end of this arc shows us a change that starts a pattern that will repeat in the upcoming answer arcs, eventually setting the state for the finale arc.\n\nI\u2019ve read through all of Higurashi once before, so reading it again lets me pick out all of the foreshadowing I didn\u2019t see the first time. Shion is probably my favorite character, so of course I\u2019m going to love a whole episode from her perspective! That perspective isn\u2019t always a good one, though - while her situation is sympathetic, Shion takes things way out of line by the end. She\u2019s an interesting, complex character and it shows how far someone can go when pushed - but how that same someone can be so single-minded to forget incredibly important things that end up making the situation way way worse by their own hand.\n\nThis is all, of course, meaningless taken on its own. Higurashi is meant to be read all together in order. If you\u2019re at all interested in Higurashi, start with the first chapter and go on from there. Each one is better than the last (well, except the fourth one, but that\u2019s an extra one anyway).\n\nNote on graphics: I dislike the MangaGamer sprites and used the PS3 sprites and Voices patch to play with the PS3 release\u2019s sprites, which I love. I also want to note here how lovely the background art is - it\u2019s very detailed and lively in a very appealing way.", "timestamp_created": 1516214680, "timestamp_updated": 1516214680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39314128": {"recommendationid": "39314128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050637112", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 699, "last_played": 1515860152}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't worry after this chapter according to the author there would be another one called Tsumiboroshi- the only regret I have so far is I watched all seasons of the anime including OVA's and I think everything I read so far is portrayed in the anime, but this was many years ago so I can't tell it for sure. So coming back to the story and everything else. What can I say.. It really moved me- I knew this story but I did forget about it but even tho the memories were coming back I still cried and lamented for the outcome. I'm going to answer the simple question asked by the author and that is well- when people commit murder depending on the motive I could sympathise, since sometimes even the worst serial killer would have certain motives that we can't hope to understand unless we are them. Sometimes psychopathy is totally induced because of a dysfunction in the brain which can happen at birth, cerebral injury and all sorts. Sometime's that not even the case the environment just contributes you to loose yourself. \n\nThis arc is the most depressing one and the most interesting and it STILL does not answer the most anticipated question the readers want to know. However, will clear out certain doubts you may have. And at some point (if you have not watched the anime at all) then this must be one of the biggest plot twists of all time for you. Also as Watanagashi this chapter may also strike twice as gorey than the latter so prepare yourself. The story mainly focuses on well how the pain of loosing someone close to you would end up tearing you apart and also how normal human beings could sometimes turn to be a demon. Humans at the same time can be either angels, demons or even humans. It's their choice sometimes it's not. But, whatever the situation is in this chapter it's obvious that there is more under the rug than the surface. So this would just make you speculate more things than solving. After all it's just one answer arc so don't get disappointed yet lol. You'd get to see in depth the mystery around Houjou Satoshi's disappearance as well as Keiichi Maebara coming to Hinamizawa. The chapter answers the most vague questions related to Watanagashi. The story is also a bit longer than others I think. \n\nIn terms of art it was really good. You can see the character arts of people you haven't seen before. Make sure the graphic and voice patch is on for this chapter- since Higurashi mainly is famous for it's superior voice acting, you would miss a lot if you don't put it on. The music thankfully is much more better than the other higurashi chapters thank god! It's so suited than the previous music and I hope the music stays improved in the next chapters as well. There isn't an All Cast Review Session as in the previous chapters and a new thing called staff room is there instead. The tips should be carefully read too, even after the ending new tips would be unlocked and it would shed more light into the mystery bits of the story. At the ending scenario it felt like even tho I was depressed- just to increase it more I got another kick in the stomache lol. \n\nLastly, I would want to thank the people who made the graphics and voice patches, (it's a lot of work really and it's tough so please if you are good at programming help the 7mods guys at Github) and my kind boy friend who bought me this chapter and my friend who gifted the third chapter for me.

pulled afterwards.\n\n[spoiler] Meakashi was great, and what made it this way obv was Ryukishis way of retelling the story from \"shions\" perspective (putting that in quotes, because for obvious reasons. Strongly recommend to reread it if you didn't catch that). She's sly, sick and a really fucked up garbage can. CH 2 showed us what Keiichi actually is capable of. Her talking him down to the utmost just... felt so wrong. Her arrogance slightly slows down during the end, but from all of the characters so far, her mindset was the most godlike.\n\nNow you'd probably think I'm talking about the parts after she gets \"fucked up\".\nHoney, no. As stated above, I adored Shion and that was mostly due to Satoshi and her caring personality towards him. Only through the VN honestly I saw how obsessive she's over him and thats before shit goes down. Ryukishi prob wrote it that way on purpose, but the more it disturbed me when I realised how sick her situation was beforehands.\nAll of her violent acts only add up to that and highlight her worst traits - which always makes you question the character at hand (AND I love that the most abt his novels because yes).\nHer jealousy towards satoko is completely uncalled for, given the situation the houjous have to fight through. The reader learns how satoko actually is aware of her own faults, which is so sad and I had to put the game down a few hours because it was so harsh. So good, but so harsh. You get what I want to say. [/spoiler]\n\nIn conclusion, I prob liked CH 5 the most because of the way it made me feel.

It's got thrilling parts, cruel parts, sad parts, beautiful parts, and an ending that is breathtaking and capable of pull out some tears from your eyes. Comparing it to the anime, it doesn't give that much importance to the gore and focuses on the psychologic scenario of Shion, allowing you to understand better why everything happens, and I've mentioned earlier the ending, that differs from the ending of the arc in the anime, not in what happens, but in how the protagonist sees everything (In fact, that can be applied to the whole game) making an incredible moment in all the series.\nThe problem with the OST that I mentioned in other analysis (in arcs 2-4 the OST is really terrible) is solved. The new songs match perfectly the sad, intense, and grotesque moments. \nOnly thing left to say is that this is another wonderful and marvelous game that you must play if you loved the last ones.\n\nOne little SPOILER:\nKeiichi's updated sprite is a little bit lame. He should be able to put down his fist in tense situations, and he has a kinda goofy face that doesn't suit him at all.", "timestamp_created": 1501638507, "timestamp_updated": 1501638507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33842434": {"recommendationid": "33842434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066074860", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493593794}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun had to wash dishes whilst playing :)", "timestamp_created": 1501193395, "timestamp_updated": 1501193395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502772", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33758931": {"recommendationid": "33758931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096210523", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500869733}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u043e\u0442 \u0438 5 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430))\u0418 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443) \u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b. \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0436\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0443\u044e \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0443 \"Higurashi When They Cry\".\u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0439, \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b \u0442\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u044b,\u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u0447\u0435\u043c \u0442\u044b \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c.\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0436\u0434\u0443 6 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c, \u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0430 2017 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 2018 \u043c\u044b 6 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c...( \u041d\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u041f\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0443 \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e. \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435.)", "timestamp_created": 1500872479, "timestamp_updated": 1500872479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33748319": {"recommendationid": "33748319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143517109", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500828192}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't think any of the Higurashi games could beat Chapter 3, and I was right.

arc. \n\n[b]Graphics: 8/10[/b]\nApart from a few new locations and Keiichi finally getting a character portrait, the graphics had remained the same and consistent. \n\n[b]Storyline: 9/10[/b]\nThis arc is told in the shoes of Shion Sonozaki (Mion\u2019s twin sister) as she escapes from her private school and returns to Hinamizawa; she is assisted by Kasai Tatsuyoshi in her escape. She then later meets Satoshi H\u014dj\u014d when she surrounded by thugs. We later find out that Shion would often switch identities and would often refer to herself as Mion, one of the only way of distinguishing them apart is the demon tattooed on her back. The rest story is revolved heavily around Shion\u2019s love for Satoshi H\u014dj\u014d and his disappearance, as Shion figures out how the \u2018curse system\u2019 works. \n\n[b]Sound: 8/10[/b]\nIt seems that there is a bit more variety of soundtracks in this arc compared to the previous 4 that were released which is a good thing as they were kinda \u201coff\u201d in the 3rd arc. It\u2019s only a minor improvement, but it sure does make the gameplay more engaging. \n\n[b]Gameplay: 7/10[/b]\nThe first thing I noticed was the menu UI, it looks much cleaner than the other novels, but it remains as functional. Although the game didn\u2019t crash, there were still minor spelling and grammar mistakes here and there (hopefully the devs will consider this and make an update).\n\n[b]Price: 10/10[/b]\nFor only \u00a35.59, this is a great investment. If you\u2019ve read the other 4 novels, this is highly recommended as it will clear up the (most of the) questions that you\u2019ve might have been asking yourself. \n", "timestamp_created": 1495906809, "timestamp_updated": 1495906809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31942848": {"recommendationid": "31942848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034301775", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495427414}, "language": "english", "review": "First of the 'Answer Arc' chapters, it sheds light on one of the previous scenarios by following it through a different point of view.

Ryukishi07 (creator/writer) did an excellent job here. So far, Meakashi is one of the best Higurashi chapters I\u2019ve read so far, not only because it helps to answer several questions, but because it\u2019s so well written and connects so perfectly to Watanagashi that once you reach the end you\u2019ll feel that you [b]need[/b] more of this series, but you have to wait for the next translations.

It's my favorite visual novel to date and might be the thing I regret never having a chance to experience for the first time again the most.\n\nI really can't put into words how much I enjoyed Meakashi.

Meakashi is the first of the answer arcs, and this time, Shion is the main character.  Story-wise, it takes place about June 1982, so a year before the main events that have happened in regards to the first three question arcs.  We are given a look into Shion's life, from the time she runs away from boarding school to return to Okinomiya (being physically close to Hinamizawa) all the way up to the events at the end (but I won't reveal what those events are, as they are spoilers lol).  So there are really two arcs told in this episode.  The first one is from June 1982 when Shion runs away from her boarding school and the events include meeting Satoshi (yes, Satoshi finally appears!) to shortly after the end of the Watanagashi festival held that year.  The other one recalls the events that are told specifically in Higurashi Ch.2 Watanagashi, as Meakashi is the answer arc for it.  So basically, it's best to have played and read through Watanagashi first (and probably Onikakushi, since it is the prologue question arc, as well as maybe Tatarigoroshi, since Satoshi is mentioned in it quite a number of times).  As for the story itself, I won't reveal any more than what I've already detailed here.  ;)\n\nNow as to my thoughts on Meakashi, I truly enjoyed reading this answer arc.  I liked Shion's character and it was interesting to see how her character developed and what ended up happening to her.  It's difficult to explain my exact opinions without spoiling things but I'll give a mild spoiler here so beware.  [spoiler]In the end, I did truly feel sorry for Shion/Mion.  Suffice it to say that she was dealt a bad hand and it didn't help that her older family members had archaic punishments that needed to be handed out.  Of course, I do take into account the time that this takes place but still, it was the late 20th century and times had definitely changed to a point although I guess that being in a small village makes some people still narrow-minded.[/spoiler]  There were grammatical mistakes here and there and I felt that they could have been polished more but the writing was great and the deaths and torture were definitely gruesome.  It was interesting to find out the parts that some people played in regards to Oyashiro's curse, and the end of Meakashi does still leave us with questions to ask.  Although it answers some questions, we end up having more and I suppose the following answer arcs will help us to get those answers, hopefully.  ;)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Meakashi a lot and I'm excited that the answer arcs are finally making their way onto Steam.  Next up is Tsumihoroboshi and it'll be the answer arc for Onikakushi and I'm totally excited for it.  ^^", "timestamp_created": 1494226915, "timestamp_updated": 1494226915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692048", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31619613": {"recommendationid": "31619613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197896761", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493996784}, "language": "english", "review": "Higurashi When They Cry Meakashi is the fifth chapter in the Higurashi series.\n\nThis chapter was really good. Shion is the star for Meakshi.\n\nI just loved everything about Meakashi. The new music was awesome. It took some time getting used to as I was used to the ones for four chapters. Once I got used to the music I really enjoyed the music a lot. One thing I also noticed right away was the quality of the music was much much much better than the previous four chapters, For some reason the other four chapter's music quality is low. Also there are two tracks in particular that I enjoyed a lot. I don't know what the tracks are called. One track I guess best to describe (In my opinion) is suspense/intense. I don't think this track played a lot. Maybr three or four times. I wish I heard the track more as it was really good. The other track which os my favorite that I relly like is the sad one. Now this track plays a lot more. This track played a lot more towards the end of the game.\n\nOMG seeing a sprite for Satoshi was awesome. But man it felt super weird to finally see a Keichii sprite. I was like yes it's great to finally see Keichii's sprite in the game. I really love Satashi's and and Keichii's new sprite a lot:) I swear Keichii looks like he works out a lot LOL.\n\nThe story without spoiling a lot was amazing. This chapter is an answer arc and answers question's for the second chapter Watanagashi. I found out there is a reason why the answer arc's are not in order. So it makes sense that Onikakushi is not first.\n\nBut there are still some questions raised and left unanswered. I'm pretty sure those left unanswered and new questions will get answered. I just don't know when that will happen.\n\nDefinetly get chapter five Meakashi and play:) It was a very good chapter and I cannot wait to get the next chapter.

Through this change of perspective, you find out what really was going on during that earlier storyline and why. And that story, the story that Meakashi tells, is probably the best one in Higurashi. It also is one of the most depressing tragedies I have ever come across.\n\nKeeping this review free of spoilers means I can't get into things in any real detail, but Meakashi affected me quite alot when I first came across it. While earlier storylines in Higurashi have a similar pattern of watching a pleasant world crumble, before you didn't really have a clear sense of what was going on. Here, you know exactly why things go wrong, and it is easy to understand the motivations behind it all. The villain's actions are horrific, but you are able to see the road that led them there and how something that started so sweet turned into an inescapable nightmare fueled by madness, paranoia, and grief. \n\nWhile some other arcs like Tsumihoroboshi or Tatarigoroshi come close, Meakashi ultimately is my favorite of the eight main Higurashi storylines. It can be incredibly disturbing and hard to stomach, but to me that is just proof of how well-written it really is.

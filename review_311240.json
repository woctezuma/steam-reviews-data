It didn't come out as well as either of the previous games' stories, in my opinion, but it got the job done and left me somewhat satisfied.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe visuals were pretty enough although I hated the janky animations. The fact that mouths sometimes just didn't move at all when a character was talking, or that hair just ripped through bodies made it an annoying experience most of the time, but especially during intense scenes. I strongly preferred the more static visual novel style of VLR, but it didn't make ZTD unplayable by any means.\n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\nMusic was good as always. Only had a few instances where I felt the score was a little too powerful for what was happening or the other way around.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nOr rather lack thereof. Scenes play out without you having to click to go to the next line and the scenes have a more 'cinematic' feel to them. So you are basically not allowed to do anything by yourself, except during the puzzle rooms and the decision games. It felt more like watching a movie than playing a game. During each of the long discussion scenes I felt my attention slip more than once, while this was never the case during previous games because I was forced to read and click, so I had to be looking at the screen.\nThe fact that jumping between fragments and teams was available from the very start made it so that not a single choice felt even remotely pressuring aside from that one in the AB game format. There wasn't a single time where I thought \"oh no, if I choose this now, they might choose this and screw me over, but what if they don't\". Nor was there any time where I actually legitimately felt bad for a choice that had a bad outcome for a certain team.\nAnother issue I had specifically with the fact that this is a port is that the memo feature is virtually unusable because drawing with a mouse sucks. The least they could've done was allow keyboard input for typing (which would've also been cool for the password inputs etc.)\n\n[h1]Final[/h1]\nOverall I am very glad that we got this game after all the issues it went through, but I'm not happy with the design choices that were made for it. It's obvious they went for a style that was very much inspired by the West (TellTale Games), rather than sticking to the original VN style. The cinematic scenes, the (largely unnecessary) gore and fountains of blood, and the fact that some of the characters did OOC things just made me roll my eyes most of the time.\nAll in all I would say I recommend this game solely for the fact that it's the one that wraps up a lot of the story.", "timestamp_created": 1514989571, "timestamp_updated": 1514989571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.569911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39005637": {"recommendationid": "39005637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198452785514", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514735637}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Y con esto concluye Zero Escape.\nJugablemente sigue siendo lo t\u00edpico, muchas cinem\u00e1ticas y salas con puzzles. \nPero hablando francamente lo que realmente importa de este juego es la trama.

A pesar de que es uno de sus encantos, tambi\u00e9n puede volverse su punto d\u00e9bil. ZTD no es un mal juego, pero dentro de la saga pierde fuerza. Es dif\u00edcil hacer un buen final para una trilog\u00eda y, especialmente, cuando es tan esperado y no hay mucho presupuesto. La narrativa de ZTD a veces resulta confusa, ciertas cosas resultan forzadas (en mi opini\u00f3n, especialmente el final) y, teniendo en cuenta la saga completa, bastantes cosas quedan sin responder.\n\nEn ZTD se opt\u00f3 por cambiar de una manera un tanto dr\u00e1stica el gameplay, narrativa y visualmente. Desapareci\u00f3 la narraci\u00f3n literaria del protagonista y pas\u00f3 a ser 100% di\u00e1logo. No est\u00e1 mal hecho pero quita cierto nivel de inmersi\u00f3n del jugador. Esto, mezclado con que visualmente pas\u00f3 a ser 100% 3d y la acci\u00f3n/narraci\u00f3n depend\u00eda de di\u00e1logos y acciones de los personajes, fue un punto muy negativo. Por motivos de presupuesto, los modelos en cuanto a expresiones y movimiento no eran muy all\u00e1, lo que a la hora de crear tensi\u00f3n, emoci\u00f3n o una escena dram\u00e1tica puede revertir el efecto y hacer que resulte rid\u00edculo. Por suerte, la banda sonora de Shinji Hosoe compensa en muchos momentos por lo buena que es. En VLR la mec\u00e1nica de juego es similar, pero dada su narraci\u00f3n la tensi\u00f3n sigue presente mientras que en ZTD esa atm\u00f3sfera se pierde un poco. \n\nEn resumen; ZTD es un final para la trilog\u00eda un poco regular. No es un mal juego pero tampoco es un juego muy bueno.

But 6 hours in I felt an overwhelming urge to play something else. That was months ago, and I just can't find the motivation to give it another chance when there are so many other time wasters out there. Unfortunately it's too late to demand my money back.\n\nNow this is a matter of taste, but ZTD's chaotic, disjointed storytelling structure bugs the hell out of me. I loved the precedessors because making a decision, and watching the consequences unfold before your eyes was so much fun. ZTD hops from scene to scene seemingly at random and you don't get to see the consequences of your actions until MUCH later.  This caused me to stop caring and just about killed the story for me. I don't care if it all comes together and starts to make sense 15+ hours in. I want a story right away, not disjointed puzzle pieces of one.\n\nI also didn't like how the story would 'end' repeatedly after ONE SINGLE ROOM. No, not the 'to be continued' kind of cliffhanger, but an actual ending. After. One. Room. Not just once, but every single time I did a room during those first 6 hours.\n\nI also felt that the story sequences were much shorter than in previous installments, though that could be because the animations are awkward and many of the voice actors amateurish at best. Plus some of the characters who appeared in the previous games have undergone off screen character development that felt forced and unbelievable.\n\np.s. those who say that the voice actors are good don't know what good voice acting sounds like.

Dicho esto...\n\nDentro de su particular campo esta es la tercera parte de una saga... la cual sit\u00faa los acontecimientos ocurridos entre el primer y segundo juego (si... suena raro pero para entenderlo tendr\u00e1s que empaparte de la historia y jugarlos ;P)\n\n[h1]Valoraci\u00f3n y nota:[/h1]\n\nEs uno de esos juegos que se te puede hacer pesado al principio pero consigue engancharte... juega mucho con teor\u00edas relativas las cuales para que enga\u00f1ar... a todos nos han atrapado alguna vez (o me negareis que no hab\u00e9is tenido inquietudes rayantes acerca del espacio/tiempo y el origen de muchas cosas... ya sab\u00e9is todo muy Zen XDD), pero al mismo tiempo tiene un entramado bastante oscuro aunque un tanto explotado, ya sab\u00e9is, mastermind detr\u00e1s de todo que tiene un objetivo y tal... \n\n\nEn los tiempos que corren ya esta casi todo inventado asi que me da por saco ver tanta gente quej\u00e1ndose de que falta originalidad... pese a todo hacia mucho que un juego no me consegu\u00eda darme tanto en el coco como en la patata (Peero hab\u00e9is visto mi s\u00edmil t\u00f3 guapo con la comida eh eh?! vale ya me callo uwu) \n\nEn definitiva le doy un [b]8/10[/b] a la saga en s\u00ed no solo a este juego... el por si solo se quedaria en un [b]7[/b].\n\nLa raz\u00f3n es que yo primero me pase este y aunque por eso diria que es mi preferido (ya sab\u00e9is los feels\u2026) pero tengo que reconocer que flaquea ante sus predecesores en cuanto al carisma de los personajes y entramado de los retos.\n\nAunque es un acierto como lo han llevado porque no es f\u00e1cil crear una historia tan bien hilada as\u00ed como as\u00ed... por eso chap\u00f3. \n\n[h1] Mi comentario personal acerca de esta saga[/h1]\n\nEsto era lo que iba a poner como an\u00e1lisis en un principio pero mi di cuenta que pon\u00eda demasiado \u00e9nfasis en mi experiencia personal y no en como deber\u00eda verlo de cara a gente que no pueda entender mi planteamiento asi que... lo a\u00f1ado por si alguien quisiera noticear mi fangirleo >.>\" \n\nPueh eso... \n\n[spoiler]Este juego as\u00ed como sus anteriores entregas son para m\u00ed una joya... no porque sea especialmente sobresaliente pero consigue dar a tu cerebro una buena colleja y recapacitar sobre cosas que por ti mismo nunca te habr\u00edas planteado...\n\nIgual que una pel\u00edcula en la cual al final te das cuenta que todo estaba conectado pero no supiste relacionarlo en su momento y en este caso tienes la oportunidad de ver por ti mismo todos los diversos caminos...\n\nPero noo solo es eso... ves como los personajes van evolucionando y d\u00e1ndose cuenta (o no) de las cosas... como crece la confianza o la traici\u00f3n, como surge el sacrificio o el ego\u00edsmo y como todo esto les pasa a los mismos individuos siendo la \u00fanica diferencia la circunstancia que les ha llevado a dicha situaci\u00f3n. \n\nConcuerda totalmente con mi filosof\u00eda acerca de como las personas no tienen una naturaleza establecida... uno avanza y mejora/empeora en funci\u00f3n de a los acontecimientos y experiencias que se ha tenido que enfrentar. \n\nAunque no es una excusa por la cual todo pueda justificarse.\n[/spoiler]\n", "timestamp_created": 1510669591, "timestamp_updated": 1510669591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531250",

I'll try not to include spoilers, but it'll be kind of hard without discussing my biggest gripe with the game.\n\nTl;Dr - The change from first-person view to outside observer of events killed the atmosphere and suspense, the game no longer has any meaningful mystery because you're given next to no clues on who's secretly killing people and who's Zero until the game is just suddenly ready to reveal their identities, Then some other minor gripes. Ultimately, though, you should probably play if you care about the overarching plot. \n\nFirst off, Atmosphere. The Nonary Games both had only partial voice acting, and were in traditional VN first-person view. This brought two things: Immersion, and focus on the environment. Both of those things were lost in Zero Time Dilemma. Sure, the music was just as unsettling, but it was played behind fully-voiced conversations, and the player was an outside observer instead of a participant in the Jigsaw-esque \"game\" the characters were part of.\n\nSecond, Horror. Sure, this could be part of atmosphere, but I think it deserves it's own footnote. In the Nonary games, when a character died, it was a terrifying thing to discover because you KNOW one of the other characters killed that guy, and you could totally be next. In Zero Time Dilemma, characters dying like that just brings an end to the memory fragment. That, combined with the altered atmosphere, just makes those scenes seem tragic instead of chilling.\n\nThird, this game lost it's \"whodunnit\" factor when it decided the player didn't deserve all the information to at least try to solve the mystery on their own. Who chopped up Junpei and strangled Mira in the third timeline? We never get any clues, just the answer.\n\nThen, there's the entire existence of a character named \"Q.\" When the game starts, you're told that \"Q\" is the kid wearing the helmet, but then you almost immediately learn that his name is actually Sean, but this \"Q\" character is still referenced, even though he is literally never shown until after you've seen the timeline where two children, \"Delta\" and \"Phi\" are born during the game's events. I continued to assume that Q and Sean were the same person until Delta revealed himself to be Q, and that happens at the same time we learn that a now-grown Delta (time travel, it's a Zero Escape game and timelines are not boundaries. There's a 22-year-old with the literal mind of a 67-year old.) has been there the whole time. We, the outside observer, are never, ever shown this character, and no, it's not because we've been secretly playing as him. We're Carlos, Sean, and Diana.\n\nAnyway, The fact that we are given next to no information on Q's existence ruins the potential to discover the truth for yourself. Yeah, he's locked in the game with the rest of you, but he's not a player, but he somehow is central to the plot.\n\nFourth, things get re-explained WAY TOO OFTEN!!! It would make sense if this were one of the older games and you had to restart at the beginning because you hit a bad end, but with the fragment timeline system in ZTD, there's no need. For example, Eric explains how he met fellow player Mira 3 times.\n\nFifth, there was a huge step back on the central theme of the games, which has been people with the ability to pull information from past, future, and alternate realities.

The story is less compelling, the reveal of the major conceit of the game is poorly pulled of by comparisonf, and it feels like there are fewer puzzles. This game also really drags at the begining, and your first through jumps through the story line don't make sense - not in an \"oh, maybe this is a mystery they'll solve later\" kind of way, but in a very 4th-wall breaking, \"I'm thinking about the design of this game instead of having fun playing it\" kind of way.\n\nThis game also has some of the same problems ZE;VLR had, most notably a couple of puzzles where you'll definitely be googling the solutions and then wondering \"how did you expect me to figure that out???\" This goes beyond puzzles being challenging - some of the solutions just feel cheap, while others are too easy, and the game rarely manages to land in that sweet spot in the midddle that ZE:VLR hit more frequently.\n\nThe one great thing about this game is the endgame.

I also think most of the puzzles on this game were better than most of the puzzles on the other games (of course, there are exceptions), i think that because the puzzles on this one are more about decifrating codes and finding passwords than doing math based minigames (nothing wrong with that, i just think it got very annoying in the other games). There's also one important thing that differs this game from the others, the story is not told in a linear way, you play through fragments and later you find out what actually happened and how these fragments matched with other fragments, initially i hated this, i thought it was confusing and ruined the storytelling, but as i continued playing, i noticed it's not that bad, mainly when things start to make sense. \nSo, after all, what makes this one worst than the other ones? Well, i'll start by stating that the story is overall weaker than in the other 2 games, but that isn't so much of a problem, because it's still rather interesting, what i actually disliked a lot about this game were the poorly made plot twists near the end, don't get me wrong, there are some plot twists in this game that turns the other 2 games around, but mainly the final 2 ones, involving the mastermind and his \"complex motives\" that are NEVER entirely explained, i won't spoil it for you, but it does ruin the experience a little bit.\nWell, so in conclusion, the game is weaker than the other 2, but not bad, and if you played the other 2 and want to finish the story, you totally should play this.", "timestamp_created": 1504298018, "timestamp_updated": 1504298018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706220", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34658124": {"recommendationid": "34658124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002600769", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504266792}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet, just like this review\nGotta play the \"Nonary games\" for context though.

I would say the graphics have a comic book style feel.  I really did appreciate it, especially when compared against the other two games in the series.  I also felt the voice acting was drastically better, although I hated zero\u2019s English voice actor so much that I played the game with the Japanese voice actors and English subs.  I also felt the puzzles were drastically better then Virtues Last Reward.  There were a few that made absolutely no sense, but for the most part I felt they were well done.\n\nI will say that I felt the way the menus for the time flows were laid out just was terrible.  Most of the time I had no idea what I was supposed to be clicking on or where.  It\u2019s divided into story fragments menus, global flow menus, and character flow menus.  I guess it was kind of fun to do a character menu scene and then after see where it appeared on the global flow and if that\u2019s entirely how you picked things that would be fine, but eventually it gets to the point where you have to go into sub menus of the character flow menu to find the right path or clicking on the global flow menu and then choosing paths from there to find the character path.  It was too much.  I guess if the plan was to have the menu\u2019s be its own puzzle then job well done\u2026but I\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t, which means it was just poorly designed.\n\nDespite that if the story was good I would recommend the game, but it\u2019s just not.  I don\u2019t understand why people praise the story of this series.  First, this game is a direct sequel so it\u2019s not like you can skip the other games.  You\u2019ll be utterly lost if you haven\u2019t played the others.  Which is certainly fine, but the way character act and the way the story is laid out makes no sense.  You fine yourselves at a Mars simulation in the desert, maybe in Nevada.  You have all agreed to be part of this test because the organization was paying people $500k to participate (I\u2019m not sure  who thought that was an accurate number, no one is paying people that much money for this.  Especially, a group of randos with no real skills).  You are then captured by someone calling himself Zero and forced into a death trap game in a bunker where 6/9 of you will die. So again it sets up a murder mystery\u2026but it\u2019s just so utterly terribly told and just a mess at every turn, explaining why would all involve spoilers though.\n\n[spoiler] First, so long as you\u2019ve played the other games it takes all of 2 hours to figure out every single mystery in the game except who is Zero.  It has the same problem of Virutes Last Reward, but at least thankfully this game is shorter.  So you only have to wait about 20 hours after figuring everything out for the characters to admit it.  Such as it\u2019s painfully obvious Sigma and Diana are the parents of Phi\u2026to the point where I\u2019m not sure if this was supposed to be a mystery or not.  Diana and Phi constantly act like mother and daughter\u2026so when it\u2019s revealed at the very end they are and the characters act surprised I was just utterly baffled.  \n\nThere is also a subplot that one of the characters is a serial killer (not zero, I mean another serial killer).  I mean it\u2019s Mira, their isn\u2019t even a question.  She acts like a sociopath in everything she says and Sean\u2019s hint that he knows about a serial killer so painfully points to Mira that it\u2019s just ridiculous.  Again\u2026since it was so obvious I\u2019m not even sure if it was a mystery.\n\nSo really the only mystery in the game is who is zero and it\u2019s an unsolvable mystery.  Zero is a character that you have never heard of.  See it turns out Zero is really Phi\u2019s twin brother Delta who Sigma and Diana put in an alien teleporter that teleported him to the year 1904 where he was raised by German scientists (and I mean clearly he became a Nazi, there is no way this lunatic that performs horrendous experiments on people wasn\u2019t one of Hitler\u2019s top scientists).  He came up with this master plan in order to fix the paradox that if he didn\u2019t put people in this death trap game he would never have been born, because he gets conceived in the death trap game\u2026except it\u2019s not a paradox, so there was no reason for him to do this.  He exists simply because the teleporter sent him to a world where he exists\u2026there was absolutely no reason for him to recreate the circumstances where he was born.\n\nOh yea, I should also mention the entire game is an unreliable narrator.  It turns out Zero was part of your group of 9 the whole time and it was really a group of 10.  They just never really mention or reference him and I guess it\u2019s supposed to be that the player is him.  It\u2019s a cheap twist.  It takes the genius of Agatha Christie\u2019s twist in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and bastardizes it.  The game literally could have done that twist though and it would have been genius.  All it would have required was the game telling you that you are the character of Delta and everything is seen through your eyes and the characters could have directly been talking to you.  That\u2019s not what happens here, no one really acknowledges Delta\u2019s existence, he\u2019s apparently there in every scene, but no one mentions him at all.  Clues all certainly point to him existing, but the game tries very hard to obfuscate that.  \n\nThe game wanted a grand twist at the end, but that twist also ruins the murder mystery occurring in the game.  I guess a lot of people don\u2019t care.  They seem to think this twist is a masterstroke, but I can\u2019t really accept it.  It\u2019s just too many logical leaps. (1) that when characters talk about Q, they mean Delta and not the robot who the game makes you think is Q (2) That Delta is a 124 year old man who is the son of Sigma and Diana who was sent back in time in an alien teleporter (3) That Delta/Q is Zero and their motive for putting everyone together is to stop a terrorist in the future form killing 8 billion people so really he\u2019s a good guy.  Even if you could make the logical leap that hey wait this is weird the game doesn\u2019t seem to be talking about the robot boy when they are saying Q\u2026their must secretly be a 10th person here which is me\u2026and if they are doing that it must mean that Q is Zero!  I don\u2019t see how then you can connect the motive of\u2026he must be doing all these horrible things in order to stop terrorists from wiping out humanity.  This point is literally never even brought up until the very end of the game, so you couldn\u2019t possibly know this was the motive.\n\nI guess the game is a serviceable time travel scifi story.  I don\u2019t care for it because I dislike the twist that it deals with alien teleporter technology.  Also the ending where everyone is now friends with Mira\u2026who again is still a brutal serial killer\u2026who they all remember specifically murdering everyone in the game as well as the dozens she killed outside the game, but apparently is now sorry so it\u2019s alright (what serial killer has ever said, oh I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m going to be a nice person now).

Be warned that you cannot play ZTD without first completing both 999 and VLR in that order.\n\nZTD is a very different direction for the series. It doesn't play like a traditional VN, it's more of a Telltale style--a really low budget TT game.\n\nI don't put that lightly. This game has horrendous models that make VLR's look good by comparison, and it also has the most stilted, stiff, and just downright terrible animation I think I have ever seen in a game this popular. It looks absolutely awful. As for the voice acting, it's hit and miss. It's servicable overall but it's not as good as VLR's. Nearly every escape puzzle is terrible in ZTD as well. There's a couple interesting ideas here and there, but the game feels a need to make every room feel like a scavenger hunt. Unlike VLR where the puzzles were consistently challenging and logical, ZTD tends to present solutions that will either warrant a reaction of \"oh, come on!\" or \"how in the hell was I supposed to know that?!\"\n\nZTD's puzzles are not hard. They work almost exclusively in a manner where the most challenging part is finding wherever the hell Zero decided to hide every piece you need. If a puzzle seems impossible, it's simply because it is. However, unlike in VLR where characters would tell you when you were wasting your time and didn't have enough clues, ZTD's cast is often as oblivious as you are, resulting in indefinite times of trial and error. You'll often become irritated not because you weren't smart enough to figure out a simple solution, but because that answer was hidden away in some corner you wouldn't have considered to look in. As someone who disliked most of 999's puzzles and adored VLR thoroughly, these are the worst puzzles in the entire Zero Escape series by a landslide.\n\nSo, why am I recommending this game that I'm tearing to shreds?\n\nBecause once you pass all of the lackluster escapes, preferably with a spoiler-free guide such as this one\nhttp://www.thonky.com/zero-time-dilemma/\nyou are in for one hell of a story. That's all I can say without getting into spoiler details.\n\nOverall, ZTD has a fantastic story that will surprise you several times, and it's safe to say that it will stick with you long after you've completed it. Just look past the terrible presentation and the awful puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1501044745, "timestamp_updated": 1501060087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635925", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33800028": {"recommendationid": "33800028", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082770949", "num_games_owned": 411, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502335337}, "language": "english", "review": "Beat the game at around five minutes.

disappointed in the direction this series headed. From the get go, the bizarre choices of redesign and complete change in personality of all recurring characters from previous entries is jarring to say the least.\nIf you are able to overlook those flaws, there's still the serious issue of subpar PS2-like graphics, terrible voice acting, unlikable characters and strange controls. Also, a complete departure from the visual novel esthetic and the strange inclusion of a 10 minute long ending is pretty bad, but those could just be a pet peeve of mine.\n\nIf you've never heard of this series before, and just feel like playing a SAW ripoff, go right ahead. You might have fun laughing at it. But wait for the price to drop, because, as is, the princing is unacceptable.", "timestamp_created": 1500747528, "timestamp_updated": 1500747528, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510299", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33712826": {"recommendationid": "33712826", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993364964", "num_games_owned": 772, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500698950}, "language": "english", "review": "This game continues the story from the two far better games collected under Zero Escape: Nonary games. The game is so far worse than the first two that it's really hard to recommend.\n\nFirst, don't even think about the game without having played the prequels: The game would make no sense whatsoever, and you'd have trouble caring at all about any of the characters.\n\nSo why don't I recommend this game? I'll do my best to avoid spoilers for the previous two games, but if you want to remain unspoiled, just play them before reading: They are more than worthwhile on their own.\n\n1) Graphics. While the game might is newer, and the prequels were not technical masterpieces, This one is so ugly it's unsettling. The facial expressions are so grotesque, they'll have you wishing for Mass Effect: Andromeda. It's not as if I expected good animation, but the few frames of animation that were selected could't make characters seem much less human. A couple are passable, but the large majority should just be redone.\n\n2)Splitting the game into fragments. Unlike the previous games, where we got to play a branching tree, from start to end, here we get to play a wide series of fragments, most of which involving very few characters, and maybe a puzzle in the middle. The fragment system makes each scene have to stand on its own. This makes all the sections that are attempting to get emotional responses from the player to fall far more flat, because you could be getting them way before you have a chance to investing in the characters at all. \n\n3)In previous games, every decision led to more and more changes later, and thus we just got to see the narrative play differently, and especially in the second game, made it far easier for the player to navigate the game in a satisfying way. However, since we have fragments here, and we don't know what the next step is, the game instead wants us to just make a decision, and immendiately follow with the opposite one, as that's the way to move forward. How can I get invested into making a decision if the consequences will be instantly erased in a couple of minutes? this makes the game mechanical. For extra boredom, there are a few situations that are very similar to each other, so you face the same decisions over and over again, and you will pick both. It's the definition of how to kill the mood.\n\n4) The game plays more like a video than like a visual novel: There's a button to speed up, but it often will end up skipping text. So at any time that the dialogue is moving slowly (and there's a lot of that), you end up missing entire sections, instead of just being able to move at the speed at which you can read.\n\n5) It breaks a couple of conventions of the series in ways that just make the storytelling feel cheaper.\n\nSo ultimately, this is the worst game of the series by a country mile. You'll get though all the puzzles pretty quickly, and then it's an exercise in frustration to see all the little corners to reach the true ending. \n\nSo I finished it, just out of completionism, but I wish I hadn't bought it.", "timestamp_created": 1500700183, "timestamp_updated": 1500700183, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663394", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33601929": {"recommendationid": "33601929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031994154", "num_games_owned": 365, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499897903}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as the nonary games, but still a very fun game..\n\nI like the cinematic presentation, it is quirky, but I think it works very well. I also find the puzzles more casual and entertaining than VLR, and think the story works well. It fails to fullfill the ambitous promises of VLR, but it stands well on its own.\n\nThe game is certainly flawed. The fragment-design makes storytelling incoherent and mechanical, Mira and Eric does not really have much of a role other than being bat-shit crazy, and worst of all, at the very end of the game they suddenly inform the player that there was another character present the entire time. This was a key player, but they \"just didnt care\" until the end.\n\nIt is no 999, but this is a fun game wich (mostly) wraps up Zero Escape.", "timestamp_created": 1500273653, "timestamp_updated": 1500273653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33580633": {"recommendationid": "33580633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028020568", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500160960}, "language": "english", "review": "The game should probably be reviewed for two angles: people who played the other zero escape games and have build up expectations for this game, and those who touch it the first time, skipping the nonary games.\n\nfor the veterans:\nthere are several things you will have to get used to. while 999 was a pure visual novel and VLR slowly tried to make the shift (3d-VN), ZTD is more kind of a TellTale story-telling game. you have animated characters and the conversation only stops when you pause or have to make a decision. this is a BIG deal for some people (and for those who won't really understand: it is like the difference between reading a book and watching a movie about the same story). they also remodeled some of the characters having an appearence in ZTD, like they already did in VLR. Except for the name, i struggled a bit recognizing them here, to be honest. they use the same excuse for that fact again, but you get quickly used to the new design (if you could stand VLR that is).\n\nThe story told is still good, and it answers several questions you might had after the first two games (but not all). The way it is told you could also dislike being a fan of the earlier titles, tho. It's in short episodes of 5-15min, you can play in a semi-random order. early episodes add the classic escape rooms and a decision, the later episodes are mainly for story-conclusions. speaking of the rooms, they are as difficult as in 999, so not even close to VLR. you should finish a room in 10-30 minutes on average (if you don't get stuck because you overlooked the multiple ways of using a coin *like me*) without much paper work. I think that's fine, probably because the rooms didn't felt like the center of the story anymore (it's more about the decision game afterwards). \n\nOverall, It was a nice game and I enjoyed it more than The Walking Dead, but it still wasn't what I was expecting, so I love it a little less than 999&VLR. The price feels high for the playtime you get, so maybe grab it on sale (but get it).  \n\n\nfor new players:\nyou should probably play the other games first, but it is really not a must. Be warned that it, if you don't, maybe ruins the earlier games for you, because it reveals most of the main plots of 999 & VLR in the first 1-2 hours of the game. These can feel like the game is throwing kinda nonsense-explanations at you nonstop, and you might are not used to that. The characters have never time to explain the whole thing, so they buzzword bingo especially early in the game. If you played the nonary games, you got hours to slowly learn the ideas and truths in the Zero Escape universe. If you just play ZTD, you will have to except them pretty quickly, or else you get that bad scifi-fanfiction vibe (which can still be fun, nevertheless) and might lose interest. they even add more layers to their concept for the veterans, so try not to get lost.\n\nThe puzzles in ZTD are not too difficult and the NPCs give you a lot of tipps how to solve some of the problems (if needed). It is fun to see the story fold out fragment after fragment and you should definitely take the time to make some own theories how the story will end, who zero is and what this is all about. this might be easier (again) with more backstory, but the game tells you what you need to know along the line, except some of the fan service bits which are not really main-story-relevant. there could be plot/explanation holes I am not aware off because i played all games, but i felt they were pretty consistent in themselves. I can recommand this game, if you liked games like The Walking Dead, Life is Strange and obviously these escape the room type of games ;)", "timestamp_created": 1500197531, "timestamp_updated": 1500198299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557196", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33572161": {"recommendationid": "33572161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008779432", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499834184}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game, ending an amazing trilogy.

If you're dying to see how the story turns out, watch a lets-play or read the spoilers on the wiki. I honestly don't think you'll be missing anything. Here's why I think that:\n\n(I take a roundabout way of framing this review. Feel free to skip a few paragraphs down if you want to skip to the meat of my thoughts on the game.)\n\nEvery once in a while, you find a game that is truly great, and leaves you wanting, desperate for more. And sometimes they decide to make those games into a series. You know the next ones won't be the same as the first, but you're so attached to the characters and world that you want to see where it goes. Soul Reaver was one of those games for me, and I had a similar experience with the Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game.\n\nWhen I read the rest of Ender's series, it was different. Not as good, but not without merit either. Very different though. It's an ethical examination at the intersection of a handful of hypothetical sci-fi situations, not the story of a boy trying to make his way in a confusing world. I'm glad I didn't read the later ones right after the first, because it gave it time for it to exist in my mind as an independent thing. A complete work in and of itself. Nonetheless, I was glad I eventually read the rest. They weren't the same, but they were good in their own right. After 999, I felt the same about VLR.\n\nHowever, when I played the later Soul Reaver games, I was deeply disappointed. They just threw the characters into circumstances that in many ways contradicted the previous ones. There was a half decent plot twist, but for the most part they were crappy. I felt like they added nothing to my experience. I would have probably been happier had I never played them. Completely without merit. After 999 and VLR, that's how I felt about ZTD.\n\n\n(Ok, here's where I start the real review)\n\nThe game uses a \"fragment system.\" The characters each have a short episode with typically involves waking with no memory, doing a room-escape and then a plot decission, and typically ends with the injection of meds that erase their memories of the episode. So to capture the feel of that, the game is presented in a series of disjointed, nonsequental chapters. You click on a team and a pic, and you get thrown into the middle of a story with no idea how it fits in with the rest of the story. It's a great idea, and I respect the developers for trying something more experimental, but in practice it runs into a few problems. \n\nFirst, I would imagine a terrific sense of isolation and disorientation if I imagnie being in that situation, which I think is what they were going for. They don't manage to pull it off though. The characters wake up and briefly discuss their lack of memories, but then go about solving their puzzles. Sometimes they wake up missing a person with no explanation, and there's some overly dramatic running and shouting. But they never really develop the characters enough that you get emotionally invested. Perhaps because the reactions are so dramatic, the characters so plastic, that it just is hard to relate.\n\nSecond, you really aren't that isolated. You click a button and it takes you to a flowchart that shows exactly where you are in the scheme of things. It's trivial to say \"oh, they can't find this character, because this is an offshoot of that plot line. Yea, I know what happened.\" \n\nAnd third (and perhaps my biggest issue), the fragments just don't affect each other that much. I mean, they open up different puzzles and situations, but there's no reason for them to. Q team makes a decission about an injection, and the results for Q are identical. I mean, it changes the room the next group wakes up in, but there's no reason for it. In terms of meaningful decissions, there was one big one at the beginning, then one in the middle with Phi and Sigma, but otherwise they were all pretty meaningless. VLR felt like \"I'm going to make good decissions to try to save everyone! I wonder if I can do it!\" but this is more like \"I've no idea why this choice matters, but i'm going to try both options to unlock more story pieces!\"\n\nThe developers made one other decission that I feel was a big mistake. They decided to have three teams that almost never interact with each other, and you could control each individually. This had two major problems. First, they had no protagonist. You can control all the characters and events through each of their eyes. And if each of the character does what you ask them to do and never make their own decissions, they really become shells of characters. You aren't always trying to guess what such and such a character was thinking when they made their decission, because ultimate you'll see them make both, and then see the game's writers try to justify how the choice fit with the character.\n\nAlso, when you control each member of the group, there's no delimma in the prisoner's delimma. In VLR you were always trying to guess what the other characters would decide. Here, you control them and make them do what you want. Logically, it's so much simpler and less interesting. Except then in some situations, one character will make big decissions by themselves or take major actions without the player observing. The disconnect is very confusing. Ultimately, it's hard to make a mystery when you seem to see everything.\n\nThe last problem... the game was painfully simple. This ties in tightly with my previous concern about the teams being isolated and choices not mattering, but also just simply the length of the storylines. VLR's storyline let you make 3-5 decissions, making around 20 fully fleshed out endings. Excluding \"they made the wrong choice and everyone immediately died\" kind of decissions, ZTD had  1-3, for maybe 10 endings (A few of those are so simple, I'm reluctant to count them as real endings). Maybe 5 that felt as involved as the simplest VLR ones. \n\nLet's look at the line where C-team dies in first decission. After the character introduction and first choice (C's execution), we see team Q. They do a puzzle then make a decission that does not affect the other team. Next we see team D (in one of two rooms, depending on the choice Q made, but without any reason Q's choice should have changed their room). On both branches, D solves a room puzzle, has a chance to die, and then a final cutscene plays and the game is over. There's some final minor decissions tacked onto one of the branches, along the lines of \"what does the person left behind do with himself\" but nothing complex and nothing that influences any other characters. So there you have it 2 meaningful decissions, 1 meaningless decission, 3 or 4 fragments of things happening, and the game's over. That accounts for 2 of the 10 endings, or 20% of the game.\n\n\nThere were a handful of little things too. \"Guess the word\" style typed questions. The game asks \"Who are you going to shoot?\" I type \"noone\" and it doesn't recognize it so I assume I have to shoot someone... I read a faq later and find out it'll accept \"nobody\" though. Also, they introduce a new character right at the end, like \"oh, he's been sitting around forever. We all knew about him; remember we referred to 'the old guy' once in one scene? We thought he was catatonic though, so we just ignored him.\" Seriously, that's just bad writing. Also, some solutions to puzzles are \"do it alot.\" When the villian says \"You'll die unless you roll 1s on 3 dice\" I never imagined the solution was just \"replay the scene multiple times, because eventually you'll hit all 1s and that storyline will continue.\"\n\nI really was disappointed. VLR wasn't 999, but it was alright. But this game had some good ideas, but just came out bad.", "timestamp_created": 1499463015, "timestamp_updated": 1499463015, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503284", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33334165": {"recommendationid": "33334165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069764551", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4835, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468019441}, "language": "english", "review": "So....ZTD.\n\nI've played both 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors and Virtue's Last Reward, this game's predecessors.  Both of them are amazing. VLR being my personal favorite in the series. Luckily, you can buy them both on Steam! (Finally.) \n\nSadly though, we also have this game. Don't get me wrong. As a game, it's definitely a decent find. It's got twists, turns, funny jokes, interesting characters, and a reference to Back to the Future. What more could you want?\n\nClosure. That's what.\n\nSure, it does wrap up the plot and all, but it doesn't do a truly clean or satisfying end. The ending of VLR was setting up the finale to be a big ol' bonanza jamboree. A big climax that would satisfy any fan. And they fell short of the mark. \n\nFurthermore, at various points, I felt that the dialogue and plot were getting rather repetitive, a hard thing to get away from with the way they've set up the plot all jumbled together like, but they'd managed to fix that in VLR, so it's a little annoying here.\n\nAnd speaking of annoying, gosh darn. The Q side of the story has that in spades. It has its good moments, but of all three groups, it has the most weak or even just terrible sections. As one may be able to tell from the trailer [spoiler]Eric goes gun-crazy a lot. And unlike how weapon-crazy characters have gone in the last two games, where they went weapon-crazy at about the same time into the plot for the endings that had them, it seems like Eric just whips out a shotgun and waves it around whenever a puzzle room is complete. Sadly, I'm just nitpicking here.[/spoiler]\n\nAlso, the game centers around these Decision Games, where you are meant to make tough choices that lead down several different paths. While some of these are used to good effect, plot-wise, many of them seem to be there just for padding purposes or to fulfill certain things. Many decisions are either extremely obvious as to which the right answer is or [spoiler]in the case of the final flippin' choice,[/spoiler] don't actually matter which you pick. Generally speaking, you'll find most of the good Decision Games (and the best plot moments (and the best (and most) puzzles, for that matter)) in Carlos's group. \n\nIn the end, the is a good game, mechanically. And this is an okay game, plot-wise, it just can't seem to stick a good, satisfying landing. But as a Zero Escape game? It pales in comparison to its predecessors. It's like Sticker Star for Paper Mario, or Mass Effect: Andromeda for Mass Effect. As games go, it's fine, but as a member of the series? You shouldn't touch it. However, you kinda have to, if you're a big fan of the series. After all, it has the ending, however muddled and unsatisfying it is. \n\nGameplay: 8/10. Not exactly original, but it keeps up the pace its predecessors set here.\nPresentation: 7/10. Puzzle Rooms look great. Scenes look a little wonky, but you'll get over it. Runs pretty smoothly too.\nStory: 3/10. It's kinda garbage. Some of the plot splits made due to Decision Games make little to no sense, and it is far less satisfying than previous works in the series.\nWriting: 6/10. Snappy dialogue from old cast members and the new guys they hang with. Team Q lags behind a bit here, but they have their moments, though sparse they may be.\n\n5/10. Get it if you've played the others, or if you like room escape games. It's good for that. A game like this generally lives or dies by its plot and writing. If the presentation or gameplay go down, it sure does hurt, but it's hard for it to be amazing with a crap plot or crap writing. \n\nGet it. Just, for the love of all that is holy, get it on sale.

The escape rooms have a lot of repeat puzzles. One type of puzzle re-appeared in 4 different escape rooms. It isn't even a particulary interesting type of puzzle. Granted, the 999 series has always had repeated puzzles, but usually you would only see repeats in the final escape room. The real cool feature of hard mode versions of puzzles from VLR is also missing from the game. It was cool to be able to solve a puzzle multiple ways. The game also basically gives you the solution to some puzzles if you don't solve it right away. This is really annoying because some puzzles require you to look at an item in your inventory before you solve it. The game still has some interesting puzzles though.\n\nHow the game handles some of its characters is also lacking. Compared to the rest of the series, the character design is really low-key. Part of the 999 series' appeal is the flashy characters, Due to the nature of how the game works, some really unatural characterization is forced on an important character. It doesn't really add up with the character's history, despite how they try and justify it. Furthermore, the character is even made ignorant of knowledge they should know at this point. It also doesn't help that some of the animation is really low quality, so you get some wonky facial expressions from some characters.\n\nThankfully, the story still has the signature craziness of a 999 game. It certainly goes places. Although it also unfortunately fails to resolve some hanging plot threads from VLR. It does leave an opening for a sequel, but to be honest, I'd be happy if the series ends with this game.\n\nOverall, I did end up enjoying the game a fair amount, so if your a fan of the previous 2 games you should definitely pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1496467628, "timestamp_updated": 1496468979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32132943": {"recommendationid": "32132943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191962838", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 2822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498406887}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u5f88\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\uff0c\u8981\u5f88\u5f00\u52a8\u8111\u7b4b\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u62ff\u4e0a\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u505a\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002infinite\u7cfb\u5217\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u9707\u64bc\u7cfb\u5217\u3002\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1496421353, "timestamp_updated": 1496421353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32120927": {"recommendationid": "32120927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142557826", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508479404}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, let's talk about Zero. In the first game, Zero was a mysterious and intimidating menace. The kind of character who was a man of few words, but every word he spoke had value. The second Zero was the opposite. He was sort of like the Joker, as evil as can be, but yet somehow charming and charismatic. Then we have this Zero... who is honestly so fucking boring I don't even care who it is anymore. He goes on and on and ON in such a monotone voice you will have tuned him out by his second sentence. \n\nI know the game is a visual novel, and I have no problems with a game that is 90% exposition. But if you are going to have the narrative be your main focus, then that narrative better not suck. This game's dialogue is so bad it made me want to gag.\n\nSo how are the characters? They are worse. They are so badly written you can literally define them in 2-3 words. We have the whiney guy, the jerk guy, the over sensitive teen girl, etc. The only character I even found slightly interesting was Carlos, because he is the only one who isn't painfully annoying.\n\nAnd I understand that they had practically no budget. I am very aware of \"Operation Bluebird\" and how this game nearly never existed to begin with. But the animation still had no excuse to be this bad. There are single individuals capable of doing BETTER animation using FREE SOFTWARE then what we have here. \n\nBut the worst part... this is an adventure game where you can't explore. You just get knocked out and magically teleport from room to room. Yaaaaaay. Just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any more boring... it gets even more boring.\n\n0/10 Honestly I don't have a single good thing I can say about this game. And that makes me sad, to see a series I love fall so low. Just buy \"Zero Escape: The Nonary Games\" on steam.

Il est fortement conseill\u00e9 d'avoir fait les deux jeux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents vu qu'on va retrouver les protagonistes de ces deux jeux dans celui ci et que c'est tout simplement la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements des autres jeux. \n\nGraphiquement c'est tr\u00e8s moyen, on a l'impression de se retrouver dans un manga : les personanges sont plutot bien mod\u00e9lis\u00e9s malgr\u00e9 des d\u00e9cors en basse r\u00e9solution. Mais c'est surtout aux niveau des animations que le jeu est a revoir, c'est rigide et tr\u00e8s ir\u00e9alistes pour un jeu plutot r\u00e9cent vendu a ce prix la. \n\nSa sera surtout cot\u00e9 sc\u00e9nario que le jeu se d\u00e9marquera, je ne vais pas tellement en parler pour \u00e9viter le spoil. On est dans la lign\u00e9 des deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents jeux : beaucoup de choix bien diff\u00e9rents dont la plupart seront assez mauvaises (les morts sont d'ailleurs plus travaill\u00e9s et certaines sont assez horribles). Un sc\u00e9nario bien allambiqu\u00e9 avec diff\u00e9rents d\u00e9nouement et ou on sera oblig\u00e9 de faire toutes les branches possibles pour pouvoir tout comprendre au sc\u00e9nario. On a le droit a quelques r\u00e9ponses aux questions laiss\u00e9 sur VLR mais malheuresement d'autres apparaissent sans pour autant avoir de r\u00e9ponses clairs, voir restent en suspens.\n\nNiveau puzzle on est au niveau de ceux de VLR mais plus simplifi\u00e9, exit le mode hard et les fichiers suppl\u00e9mentaires a d\u00e9bloquer. Les puzzles sont mieux construits, globalement plus simples (une pi\u00e8ce \u00e9tait assez difficle) et pas du tout frustrant. Il y a beaucoup moins d'objets a g\u00e9rer par contre l'interface est toujours pas top.\n\nLe jeu est toujours en anglais (bon niveau requis), avec voix anglaises ou japonaises. Les doublages sont tr\u00e8s bons en japonais, ils ont repris les doubleurs des jeux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Pas mal de musique sont aussi r\u00e9prises ce qui ne m'a pas d\u00e9rang\u00e9 plus que sa, il y a quelques clins d'oeils aux deux jeux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ce qui est plutot sympa.\n\nA faire absolument si vous avez deja fait les deux jeux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents sinon je d\u00e9conseillerai de le faire avant 999 qui est mon \u00e9pisode pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 et VLR. \n\n\nPoints positifs :\n\n-Un Sc\u00e9nario toujours aussi prenant avec sa logique et avec son lot de surprises.\n-Des puzzles bien construits, accessibles et pas du tout frustrant. Pas trop simple non plus, il faut faire preuve d'un minimum d'observation pour trouver les objets et de logique pour sortir des salles.\n-Content de retrouver les personnages principaux des deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents jeux.\n\n\nPoints n\u00e9gatifs :\n\n-D\u00e9but un peu maladroit et lent?

Maybe if you had never played a Zero Escape game before this you would think this was God's gift to you, but as a fan of the series, I was sorely disappointed. None of the story threads that were present in VLR are resolved, Junpei and Akane are UNRECOGNIZEABLE as characters, for some reason there's fucking aliens, the new characters (except for Carlos) are trash, and the entire premise is pretty ridiculous.

If you forget what happened during certain scenes, you will end up having to look up what to do after you get stuck, because you won't know exactly where you need to go.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fantastic storytelling and satisfying conclusion to the franchise. \n\n- Cuts the tedium out of VLR, which suffered badly from almost identically repeated sections and redundant information, but preserves the thought-provoking questions about morality, science, and philosophy that made VLR stand out from 999, which was mostly occult myths and pseudoscience.\n\n- While hated by some fans, taking the perspective away from a single protagonist and instead giving us a telltale-style 3rd person perspective freed up the game and story to go in different directions.\n\nIt ended up being my favorite game in the trilogy in some ways, though all of these games have serious flaws.", "timestamp_created": 1494388439, "timestamp_updated": 1495838524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31620781": {"recommendationid": "31620781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029220070", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494048863}, "language": "english", "review": "DO NOT PLAY IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED \"Zero Escape: The Nonary Games\" (Or you've played 999 and VLR separately)", "timestamp_created": 1494231199, "timestamp_updated": 1494231199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31547764": {"recommendationid": "31547764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044456364", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483958779}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b80\u8bc4\u4e00\u4e0b\u4e09\u4ee3\u6e38\u620f\uff1a\n999\uff1a\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ba4\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u5f88\u68d2 \u5c31\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u8be1\u8ba1\u67d0\u4f5c\u5f71\u5b50\u592a\u91cd\uff08\u4e0d\u8fc7\u81ea\u5df1\u6284\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e5f\u4e0d\u7b97\u6284\u5427233\uff09\n\u5584\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff1a\u6316\u5751\u4f5c\uff0c \u4e0d\u8fc7\u662f\u6211\u6700\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u4e00\u4f5c\u3002 \u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u80fd\u5728999\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u628a\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u548c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5c55\u5f00\u5230\u90a3\u4e48\u5927\uff0c\u5bc6\u5ba4\u4e00\u8d2f\u9ad8\u6c34\u51c6\uff0c \u7cfb\u7edf\u7a0d\u5fae\u590d\u6742 \u5267\u60c5\u7ebf\u663e\u5f97\u5f88\u4e71\uff08\u73a9\u4e86\u96f6\u65f6\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u5df1\u56fe\u6837\u4e86\uff09\u5267\u672c\u7684\u8bdd \u6c14\u6c1b\u5f88\u597d \u6838\u5fc3\u8be1\u8ba1\u867d\u7136\u8001\u5957\u4f46\u662f\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u7528\uff0c\u7f3a\u70b9\u662f\u6316\u5751\u592a\u591a \u6ca1\u6709\u96f6\u65f6\u7684\u8bdd\u8fd9\u4f5c\u5c31\u663e\u5f97\u6709\u70b9\u5751\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd8\u597d\u6700\u540e\u6253\u8d8a\u8fd8\u662f\u628a\u96f6\u65f6\u505a\u51fa\u6765\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\u96f6\u65f6\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0d\u591f\u5f3a\u884c3D \u5f3a\u884c\u5168\u7a0b\u52a8\u753b\u63a8\u8fdb\u5267\u60c5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u753b\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u5c34\u5c2c\uff0c \u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8868\u60c5\u52a8\u4f5c\u90fd\u975e\u5e38\u50f5\u786c\u3002 \u5bc6\u5ba4\u8fd8\u662f\u4e00\u8d2f\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u521d\u671f\u770b\u7740\u5f88\u6df7\u4e71\uff0c \u4f46\u662f\u73a9\u4e45\u4e86\u8fd8\u597d\u3002\u3002\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u7684\u8bdd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u586b\u4e0b\u4e86\u524d\u4ee3\u7684\u5927\u5751\uff0c \u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e86\u81ea\u5706\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u795e\u68cd\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u8981\u6263\u5206\u7684\uff08\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8bb2\u9053\u7406\u8fd8\u662f\u6bd4\u9694\u58c1\u5f39\u4e38\u672a\u6765\u7bc7\u597d\u591a\u4e86233\uff09\n\u603b\u4e4b \u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u60ac\u7591AVG\u7231\u597d\u8005\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u9519\u8fc7\u7684\u597d\u7cfb\u5217 \n\u6253\u4e2a\u5206\n999\uff1a 9/10\n\u5584\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff1a 8.5/10\n\u96f6\u65f6\uff1a7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1493929820, "timestamp_updated": 1509250016, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31472142": {"recommendationid": "31472142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092668799", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493583764}, "language": "english", "review": "I have mixed feelings about this game.

La fin notamment: ils ont eu la bonne id\u00e9e de ne pas terminer sur un cliffhanger(comprendre un \"to be continued\" frustrant). Elle reste assez ouverte; [b]j'ai cru lire que \u00e7a sera le dernier \u00e9pisode.

I'm gonna say this is easily the weakest of the triology, but in the end I enjoyed playing it, despite my disliking it at first.\n\nThe main issue with this game is that its got a very blatent identity crisis going on. This is a game that ONLY exists becuase of the Zero Escape fan base, those that are even bigger fans then me. Without them, the sales of the first two games aren't really good enough for sequels. Its by their passionate support that the game creators can point at and say 'there is audience for this.'. This game sets out to answers the major lingering plot lines of VLR, but ends up leaving a lot of questions unanswered; some of which were stated WOULD be answered here. \n\nThe other side of the game however... this is a game that feels like its was made to try to appeal to a larger portion of gamers... I guess I can understand that from a business sense but they do it by pretty much dropping or weakening a lot of the elements that made people fans of the first two games. The biggest being dropping the visual novel format which seems to feed into the idea people don't want to read anything anymore. Everything plays out in cutscenes that makes it hard to memorize plot crtiical details, since in the last two if there was information that NEEDED to be remembered, you could not advance the dialogue and write it down to save for later. Here you've got to rewatch cut scenes multiple times in case you want to be sure you got it right, as sometimes stuff flashes past before you're even ready for it. \n\nAlong these same lines, it feels like the majority of the puzzles are easier to solve, only one really feels like its on the same level as some of the previous ones. It feels like puzzles here are a distraction then actual game play, just so there IS game play, as otherwise this ends up being mostly an interactive moive of just chosing wither to do something or not. \n\nThe game at least has much of the clever writing and deep story as the first two, though there is one element of blatent dues ex machina that feels like it was just made as a solution to writing out of some of the corners they end up written into. There's no real explination for why it exist, its just does and has for a long time apparently. \n\nThe changes to how the story is handled doesn't really help either, while I got used to it and one particular twist made me kinda enjoy it in the end; I still would have prefered a more 'Point A to B to C or D, etc'  story rather then 'Point A, to B, to D or f to E or maybe d...' way that this game just skips around... like an episodic show being aired out of order. It leaves you lost and confused... and that kinda works since that's how the characters can feel as well... it just doesn't fully gel with me. Nor the fact that there's no mix'n'match with the characters. Team D is always Team D, while in the previous games your teams got shuffled up allowing for more character interaction. \n\nCharacter is another kinda issue here. Five new characters, and only half of them are kinda interesting. Two are player characters feels like we get to know them fairly well, with one tied into the overall ZE plot and the other just being a decent character with good reasons for doing what he does.  A half point goes to a third that just has a really interesting story once it gets revealed, but the character is very generic up  till then. The other two, one feels like a retread of a character we've gotten at least twice before, and the other is just bland with nothing that really stands out about him even with tragic backstory. He just mostly seems along for the ride... \n\n\nIn the end, you're probably only going to really like this is your a fan of the Zero Escape series, I think anyone new to the series would end up gettign turned off by all the front loaded lore that gets put into here, even if its done by secondary characters.", "timestamp_created": 1493178424, "timestamp_updated": 1493178424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31354086": {"recommendationid": "31354086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198349400361", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493120574}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u5c31\u4e3a\u90a3\u4e9b\u5361\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\u63d0\u4e2a\u9192\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5361\u7684\u662f\u627e\u9f50\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u680f\u91cc\u53f3\u4e0b\u65b9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u70b9\u6210\u6309id\u6392\u5e8f\n\u4f60\u5c31\u80fd\u77e5\u9053\u5c11\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\u5566\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u518d\u53bb\u5168\u90fd\u4e00\u904d\u904d\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86~", "timestamp_created": 1493113736, "timestamp_updated": 1493113736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612903", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31345742": {"recommendationid": "31345742", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972223037", "num_games_owned": 779, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493009446}, "language": "english", "review": "and incredible--unforgettable experience.", "timestamp_created": 1493065766, "timestamp_updated": 1493065766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31336131": {"recommendationid": "31336131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030878029", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493025465}, "language": "english", "review": "The first two games (Especially the first) were brilliant.

It does shine during the occasional action filled cutscene though.\n\nThankfully, the Japanese voice acting is always excellent, and by focusing on the subtitles, one can still easily immerse themselves in the story.\n\nOn the puzzle side though, ZTD is a massive improvement over VLR thanks to smooth controls adapted to the PC screen, and there are fewer calculation based puzzles which were always a chore (remember the food one in the infirmary at VLR? Sigma even mentioned its difficulty). The graphics here are superb and quality.\n\nAs for the story, it takes an ambitious fragmented approach to storytelling. This works because the multiple returning characters gives us instant familiarity and attachment to their fates, so a slow buildup is unneccessary. As for the plot, by the time you've completed the previous two games, you are determined to see through the characters' fates, so explaining more here is unneccessary.\n", "timestamp_created":

The decision to use cutscenes instead of the standard visual novel format was good in places, but overall just didn't sit quite right. This is because you don't get in the mind of a single playable character, you feel seperate, as though you are an omnipotent force guiding groups rather than just one person. That takes away from character engagement.\n\nThat all said, the game itself is good, it just isn't as good as the other two.\n\nIn and of itself it is still enjoyable. The scenario is intriguing and keeps you interested for most of the game.

The fragment system which let's (forces) you play story fragments makes the whole story experience feel disconnected and while I realize that this was exactly the intention and might come together later on nicely at this points it hurts the story and immersion a lot.\nIt doesn't help that the characters feel very clich\u00e9d and the new 3D art style only deepens that problem. I feel like I have to watch a 3 second pan shot or a face close up after about every sentence. Some things which work fine in a 2D drawn visual novel just don't work out in a 3D environment at all.. Due to that and the mediocre dialog the conversations hardly ever feel not artificial and plastic. \n\nIf you haven't played 999 or Virtue's Last Reward, play them instead. Not only is the story of Zero Time Dilemma based on those, they are also way better than this title and an easy recommendation. If you did play them, then it really depends how desperate you are for the end of the story. I assume I'll finish it at some point for that reason.

that I have been a fan of the series for some time. I loved VLR and waited over a year to be able to play 999 (didn\u2019t have a DS or apple device). My love for the series has allowed me to overlook most of the faults in the previous games, but sadly it\u2019s not enough to approve this third title.\n\nIf you want a quick summary of my thoughts, here it goes:\nThis game is made for fans only. Almost all the drama comes from the previously established characters. The puzzles are easily the worst in the series. The graphics and animation are indefensible. The music and voice acting are great in some places and laughable in others. In fact the only thing I can praise this game on is the story and boy does it have a slow start and a poor end\u2026 Or lack there of\u2026\nOnly play this game is you absolutely need more Zero Escape in your life!\n\nIf you want an in depth review:\n\nGraphics, Animation, and Presentation: Everyone looks like a Hollister manikin being rendered on a Playstation 1. They\u2019re bad, moving on.\n\nPuzzles: The game has a few puzzles I promise. For me it took almost 6 hours before I found one\u2026 That was 6 hours of cut scenes with the occasional interaction before I found myself actually playing a game.\nWith each Zero Escape game I took it on myself to never use a guide, and save two rooms from VLR (if you played it you know which ones I\u2019m talking about) this worked out fine... Do not do this with Zero Time Dilemma! Not only are these puzzles the worst in the series, but they are also the hardest-No, not hard\u2026 Vague. Two rooms in particular kept me locked in for over an hour as I tried to figure out what it wanted me to do. So please, if you find yourself in the Transporter Room or the Rec Room look up the codes online and save yourself the mental torture.\n\nCharacters: Initially you are introduced to nine characters like in the other games. You will see the 4 remaining characters and then the quite bland looking new ones\u2026 And my God how they make you try to care about them. The first half of this game is an explanation on why you should care about these brand new people. And by the end? Well half of them fit in, the other 2 not only don\u2019t, but are the most annoying characters in the entire series with Eric being a whinny, oh so very whinny version of Dio with none of the sarcasm, and Mira being all the worst parts of Alice and Lotus, with none of the\u2026 Emotion of any kind.\nThe worst part is how the 9 characters are stuck in 3 groups of 3 that hardly ever interact except for at the end. It's essentially if they had a Marvel/DC/Darkhorse cross-over where each group of characters stayed miles apart except for the last issue... What would be the point? The two previous protagonists\u2019 spend a 20 hour game less than a foot ball field apart but have on one or two conversations... Why?!\n\nStory: First off it\u2019s only fair to say that he dead expressions of the characters, the God awful animation, and the low poly models made enjoying the story a trial of it\u2019s own. So many serious scenes had be laughing because of how they would play out on screen. The silly faces made. The constant clipping. The speaking through a closed mouth\u2026 Well, you\u2019ve been warned.\nThe story in the middle kept me hooked with constant twists and revelations; easily the best part of the game. The beginning is bogged down by being 10 hours of \u2018no no these people are cool I promise\u2019. And the last 4-5 hours fill you with questions and leave you with very few answers\u2026 Oh that\u2019s right. This series doesn\u2019t actually close itself off. I triple checked to make sure I have 100% the game, and yet I am left with dozens and dozens of questions, most of which pertaining to plot holes and potential plot holes. This has more plot holes than the rest of the series combined.\nAfter seeing the final scene the first thing out of my mouth was \u2018well then what was the point\u2019! If you were looking for closure this is not for you.\n\nGenerally stupid things in this game:\n-\u201c4 digit number using a 0-9 keypad. That\u2019s over 100,000 combinations!\u201d\n-If a room is dark everyone becomes blind, deaf, numb, and stupid.\n-Sneak attacks with a revved chainsaw.\n-Near point blank Mexican standoff with a grenade launcher\n-The Q reveal\n-The password entry screens\n-The Mouse and Keyboard Controls\n\nAll in all I'm glad I played it, and it was defiantly a ride. I liked some things they added (wont mention for spoiler reasons). I disliked some things they added (like how you are forced to play the game out of order or how characters are stuck in changing groups of 3). And I hate how it left off on such a giant middle finger to the fans... But I can't bring myself to hate the game.

You REALLY shouldn't play it before you've played other two games first, or you not only won't understand or feel complicity to much of the events and key scenes without knowing their background, you'll also will see lots of spoilers for those previous titles. It's not a big problem since first and second games are almost out in steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/477740/ \n\nNow, about ZTD - I liked it much. Combined with experience from all games of Zero Escape series, the last one provide tightly intertwined plot of mysteries which will reveal meanings of everything you thought was illogical of irrelevant and everything you haven't though of or haven't expected. You'll get lots of unpredictable turnarounds and twists where every detail from narrative to game design elements is thoroughly planned to fit into director's key ideas about overall plot.\n\nCharacters are deep and well-written despite being a bit overly fantastic at times. I could say same about whole story too - it feels sometimes too implausible and caught within it's own paradoxes, through I could never tell that director did a bad job there. Maybe that's just my natural reaction to it's overcomplicated nature (which in the end allows some events with most powerful impact on player even happen to begin with). I ended deeply impressed and interested in almost every character from the story.\n\nAlso, ZTD due to game fragmentary structure has most varying scenes and situations of all three games in the series, and those fragments are really interesting and very distinct from one and other. \nThe first drawback here is game structure itself: choice system is not like you've accustomed to in Telltale or other interactive movie genre games. Although lots of hard choices and dilemmas are present, due to the game core principles and main idea you'll end up replaying choices and picking out another solutions to them over again, even those ones you really don't like and wanted to avoid (imagine you've tried so hard to prevent horrible and agonizing death of some character and now game forces you to replay the episode and allow that death happen).\n\nZTD is weaker than it's predecessors in terms of puzzles which are easiest in the series, and will end up too early, leaving you with smth about 4 hrs interactive movie till the end. Some of them are really cool with unseen before features while some being sadly repetative and dull.\n\nDevelopers hadn't much funds so their first game not in VN-style but in interactive movies genre (or adventure, if you want) with lots of camera work, dynamic and animations - ZTD has visual drawbacks too. Guys were trying hard, but you'll still won't miss repetitive cameras, low graphics and poor animations. However, I got into the game and pass this drawback pretty quickly. \n\nIt's also a shocking and sometimes gory experience, so take care.\n\nThese sentences about drawbacks were warning for those, who could consider to buy this game or not. It was absolutely must play for me, and this game touched me to the heart in the end and I'm really recommending it to all Zero Escape series fans, Kotaro Uchikoshi really did amazing job here.

ZE:ZTD is fragmented and a piece of shit, there is 0 immersion, it is unclear and it is presented in the worst 3d garbage visuals I've ver seen, people talk without their mouths moving, people's hair move at random without them moving, full of other visual glitches and even when the visuals work, they look like complete dogshit.\n\n2. ZE:999 and ZE:VLR had 100x times better writing than this piece of shit ZE:ZTD. The characters are garbage, nothing like what they used to be, the conversations are shitty and make no sense, the atmosphere is crap, everything about it is crap.\n\nZE:ZTD is the worst selling game in the Zero Escape franchise and it killed this franchise for good, there will never be a Zero Escape 4 game. There tons of plotholes, the story didn't get a conclusion... \"make up your own conclusion\", lmao, get the fuck out you cancerous trash Kotaro Uchikoshi. He wrote ZE:999 and ZE:VLR so much better. I will never ever buy another Spike Chunsoft game, a cancerous company that didn't give enough funds and time to get a proper third ZE game and that cancerous trash Kotaro Uchikoshi obviously cared more about delivering a shitty product and make some little money than to give a proper conclusion to his story and creation, he is not a true artist, just a cheap human trash.\n\nI suggest all of you to either watch this garbage game on YouTube or get the game through \"other means\" (you know what I am talking about ;) hehe). Same for the upcoming \"The Nonary Games\" bundle, I will get that game, I will play that game, but I will make sure that Spike Chunsoft won't get any benefit or profit from it hehehehe ;)))\n\nAnyone

I will address each of you in this review. But first, for two of those groups of people, I am giving you a link to the first two games in this series, which at the time I am writing this review will be available on Steam in approximately three weeks. http://steamcommunity.com/app/477740 Indeed, this is the third game in an established series.\n\nSo! The first group. You haven't played any of the Zero Escape games before. If you want to get the greatest possible enjoyment out of this game, you really should play the first two installments. Honestly! But, let's say you won't do that. Alright, you strange person. Then you should at least play... oh, VLR first. Please! But, let's say you won't do that either. You are a very silly person indeed. Fine. What you will get is a wonderful visual novel with three characters to choose from, each going through rather different experiences as a result of who they are and who they are stuck with. You will triumph, fail, get blood on your hands, die, and be horrified. You will also be surprised and probably have your mind blown too, but not as much as it could have been. You will also not get the same sense of comraderie or horror that comes with already being quite familiar with the several characters that come from 999 and VLR. You will enjoy this game if you relish those experiences, but you could enjoy it more.\n\nNow, the second group. You actually have two variations among you. One variation has played 999 and not VLR, the other has played VLR and not 999. If you are the ones who played 999, I strongly urge you to play VLR before you play this game. If you are the ones who played VLR, I highly recommend playing 999. Either way, as one Zero Escape fan to another, I just want you to know that you should play the other game before this one. Need a reason? Plot. Need another? Better head explosion. Need another? Um, well, I don't want to risk spoilers. Alright, but let's say you don't intend to take my advice for you own unfortunate and unfathomable reasons. Those who have played 999 will enjoy the familiar company and the horror aspect that is much like what you found in 999. Those who have played VLR will enjoy the familiar company and the, um, stuff. You will enjoy this game, this I believe! But, you will be missing out. 999 players a bit more so than VLR players, because reasons.\n\nNow, the third group. Let's be honest: Most of you in this group probably don't care what we have to say. As long as you see that this game rightfully has very positive reviews, you are going to play this game. There are those of you however who want to be convinced. The short of it is that if you liked, especially if you loved, the first two games, you will be quite happy to play this game, and it is worth it. Still not convinced? Look, the story has been building up to this. There are still so many questions you need answered. You don't even know all of the questions that need answering. Face it: you need these answers. The formula is a little different in this one, and its not quite like the other two. This is good. It is something unique and special, and it will be a ride.\n\nThe fourth group. You know you don't need this review. You've already played this game! Unless you are here writing a review, I'm not certain why you're here...

I waited with bated breath for Zero Time Dilemma, but quickly discovered that I should not have held my expectations so high. The animation is janky, the dialogue is awkward, and the once interesting plot is bogged down by so many holes that the few clever reveals and twists are not enough to save it. Unless you can get this game for near free then I recommend you watch the cutscenes on YouTube because it will be a slog. What started as a series about time travelling consciousnesses has turned into a 20-hour trek through Wikipedia selecting related articles on parallel worlds, Sophistry, quantum theory, and fallacies. \n\nThe puzzles are few and far between and are remarkably simple. The ones that are more difficult basically require brute force to solve. Of course, puzzles are subjective, so it's fair to say for some they will be harder so I won't spend too much time here. The controls are a little broken so I often found myself clicking where I didn't want to click and zooming in or out when I wanted to look around or interact with something. \n\nWithout going into too much detail to avoid spoilers I will say that the biggest reveal is only possible because the game deliberately lies to and tricks you through omission. Think Heavy Rain here. If you don't mind spoilers then theseGame FAQ links will detail everything for you (although without context it might not make sense) https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/175993-zero-escape-zero-time-dilemma/74031394 \nhttps://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/175993-zero-escape-zero-time-dilemma/74019274?jumpto=60\n\nFinally, the game frequently breaks its own lore and logic and makes mistakes with its own assertions by ignoring the mathmatical and logical facts of things like the gambler's fallacy to make its timeline seem fair. And much like Mass Effect 3, it sets you up with a series of seemingly consequential choices that in the end only result in you playing to the result it wanted.\n\nGreat concept, poor execution.

I hate the game uses the \"cinematic\" style but Fails To understand the very basics of cinematic language itself (SHOW. DO. NOT. TELL.). I hate the games ending and its failure to decide if it wants to be a \"cliffhanger\" (Which, mind you IT CANT due to, you know... FINALE) or a \"happy\" ending. I hate the fact that MANY Gaming Journalist's have given this game \"Matsterpiece! 10/10\" \"9/10\" \"PERFECTION!\"  \"UCHIKOSHI'S DONE IT AGAIN!\" (Mind you the fact, you know, HE WROTE ONLY 1/3 OF THE ENTIRE GAME!) and other high scores the game does not deserve at all.\n\nAnd yet im not mad. Oh yeah i was mad when the game came out at first, but now  im dissapointed. Why?..... i just pity it for not being the zero escape i wanted, nor the community at large wants. if this came out in 2013, there would be alot of anger. Why? This is not the zero escape 3 WE wanted.  Operation Blue Bird did not fight for this mess. We did not deserve this garbage. yet the\"spike chunsoft wont let me make this\"  uchikosi message, made us fight. and then some spike chunsoft got the message and got an idea, to \"restart\" the game production, but only giving them a small budget and time constrats so they had to rush it. and so it was. in 2014 a cryptic teaser site called 4infinty debuted with a countdown  and words related to the game, and evrey gaming outlet reported it. Now, somewhere in america, a little boy heard that news too. and wondered.\"whats going on with this wierd site?\" and visted a fourm. it said it was related to a game called 999. he had heard of the game, but never really played it. so he got the ios version. and although confused at first by the games ending, he looked it up. and said \"ohhhhhh i get it :)\" then he played vlr next, after frustraion that the countdown ended with \"nothing\" he was VERY liking it. and while he was playing it, he got the news ther WOULD be a zero escape 3. He was happy in the knowlege that after he finished it, in a year, he play ze3 and have a satifying ending. Well..... SImply put That boy was ME. This is NOT ze3.\nThis is not the game OBB Expected to play.\nOperation blue bird did not win.\n\nin fact they , no me..., no... EVERY zero escape fan did not win.\n\nAll of us, were simply expolited. Even of Uchikosi, Who had a bad run of stupid mastakes, during \"resumed\" development.\n\nHe to, expoited us in some way with his poor choices\n\nThis is an expoitation of our money by spike chusoft after seeing that blue bird.\n\nI dont care about the release order, Play ZTD after 999, and after that play VLR. Then you A: Be more \"satifed\" and less angrier than me. B: end your experience with a WORTHWILE conclusion, Even though it was the inteded cliffhanger. Even though im not \"recommending\" this, your probaly gonna play this anyway. Because vlr ends on a cliffhanger that leads to this. Because YOU are easily exploitable puppet that just want's closure (that your not gonna get , BTW) To a once great series.\n\nAt Best, this was a 7. at worst, 5.\n\nNot 10's and 9 from easily expoited people. The only reason you like the game is because it got released in the first place. \n\nJust beacuse a game gets released, dosent mean it automaticlay gets perfect scores, just because producion was halted, delayed, was almost cancled, Whatever. (Duke nukem Forever everyone?) \n\nId had to wait a year, and IM pissed off and you should be to. Becasuse this is just pure, hard, EXPLOITAION.\n\nA Game comes out, you really love it, it sequel gets halted, you bitch and moan, some exec decides to exploit you, it gets released, its garbage, But you love it. because your hype has just been exploited, by greedy executives, and stupid writers, who just want your MONEY.\n\nLife is Simply Unfair, Don't You Think?", "timestamp_created": 1486955039, "timestamp_updated": 1486955057, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29751471": {"recommendationid": "29751471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204783811", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1472, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486541616}, "language": "english", "review": "*Finally, time to find out how the Zero Escape saga ends!\"\n\n*Starts game*\n\nRed or Blue?\n\n\"Err...

Expect lots of characters saying the same line they'd said a hundred times before and totally random pacing that is created by what scenes you pick.\nHowever, the real problem in my opinion is that someone dies in nearly every scene. You've given very little time to grow to like the characters before they start dying and as you go between the different routes and scenes you'll see them all die over and over, losing any impact the death would bring. This also hampers any kind of moral dilemma you might have. Will you save X or Y character? Who cares, you've seen them both die 10 times, what's another death?\nLastly, the actual plot sucks and it there is very little to it if you cut out the hours of pointless scenes of people dying.

Pick-up objects, manipulate items and combine them, push buttons, sorting, logic puzzles and (bad) mazes. Its all here.  Expect a couple of incoherent logical leaps, but these are few.  The game really does give a nice mix that never seems to overstay on one mechanic.\n\nThe story and characters are somewhat of a drag.  Many events feel (and are) very forced, and character motivations and arcs (what few there are) are vapid and usually without much meaning.  This is the third title in a triology, and as a game trading heavily on its story it really doesnt have a lot ot show for it.  There are some twists, but they arent mind blowing, or having much payoff.  They seem to only exist.  There are worse narratives take part of, but this game's lackluster storyline being so central to it certainly hurt it.\n\nThe visuals are tremendously dated.  This was a PS Vita port, and the upscale shows. Everything is cel shaded, and quizzically looks plastic and glossy.  Animations are reused to annoyance, and the colors clash.  The backgrounds for rooms are dingy and drab, but that is part of the overall aesthetic.  If you're ok with a game looking like a budget title, this isnt a deal breaker. \n\nThe sound doesnt standout, or get in the way. The game has its only atmosphere and the muted sound designs helps sell it.  \n\nOverall the game isnt bad, but its not great.

It's not even a game. Or if there is a game in there I couldn't stand it long enough to reach it. What I experienced was an incredibly poorly writen narrative, full of nonsensical lines, reptitive summations and insipid reactions. This god awful script was peformed at probably the single worst level of voice-acting that I have ever experienced. And I played games in the 90s. And then on top of this all, it was the dumbest incarnation of interactivity.\n\nWhy do people even pretend that this is interactive? When I am watching a narrative and then for no good reason the story stops and gives me three subject areas to learn more about... that's not interactivty... that's just the world's worst editing/UI. Like, I have to click all three of them. There's not a person on Earth playing a game like this that doesn't click all three. And so it begs the question: why am I the one choosing the order that this conversation happens in? I don't freakin' care what order they discuss these topics! Same thing happens with the so-called puzzles. The ones I made it through  - a Prisoner's Dilemma-esque situation - weren't even remotely puzzle-like. Sure, I was given a choice of where to put a vote but it was arbitrary. I was just picking a story branch. But who the hell thinks that is fun? Why am I picking the story branch? The writer's know what happens next. They should pick the narrative branch and give me interactivity through actual puzzles. \n\nThe pacing was painfully slow and the wrost part of all was that because they couldn't guarnatee what order we would see the clips, they had to include the same information over and over and over and over and over. No way to speed it up. No way to skip it. \n\nIt was literally... and I mean literally mean literally.... torture.", "timestamp_created": 1483868652, "timestamp_updated": 1483868652, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.333657", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29066403": {"recommendationid": "29066403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198241900514", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483552616}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh my, let's see where I should start. First of all, I am a big fan of the Zero Escape series! I fell in love with it when I played 999 and I still had a lot of fun with Virtue's Last Reward. And I really think you should play these two! So if you can, do it. Or just wait for them to be released on Steam.\n\nWell but sadly, I'm not sure what to think of Zero Time Dilemma. The title gives you the feeling that every decision is going to be really important and you have like no time to think about it.. but that's not the case. The decisions are just \"click or don't click\" or \"do this or don't do it\". Most of the puzzles are really easy and they do not take you long. What I think is worse, is that the puzzles repeat themselves. You just do the exact same thing over and over again, it gets boring. And the few special puzzles that actually take you time to solve were ridiculously hard (at least in my opinion.) The puzzles in 999 and VLR were harder, but not too hard and they were different every time. Also, there are so many plot holes and a lot of things are just not explained. \"Yeah, we're gonna explain everything we left open in VLR!\" Uhmmm no, you didn't, you only made everything we knew more confusing. But if you haven't played the games before, I guess you would be even more confused. Also, the models are not the highest quality and quite glitchy. The hair of the girls is the worst, it's almost always inside their bodies or the physics do funny stuff. But hey Miras boobs wiggle, that was important huh? They have just a few facial expressions which leads to some funny scenes, even in situations when it's not supposed to be funny. (But when it is, it really is hilarious!) One thing I quite enjoyed were the interactions between the characters and the (sadly almost non-existent) development of the relationships. It felt natural most of the time, at least when we're talking about Team-A and Team-D. But I also have to admit that the characters we already knew were very different and kind of out-of-character. And one last thing, we just pretend that the ending never happened. It was SO unsatisfying. In the end you always have to consider that this game wouldn't exist without the help of the fanbase and I'm pretty sure they didn't get as much money to create this one as they got when they made 999 or VLR.\n\nEven though there were so many flaws, I still enjoyed the 20h I put into this game and I don't regret it.

The psychological horror comes from the sub-Disney channel acting, where, at times of imminent death, the actors emote at the level of stress you'd expect if someone pushed in front of them in a queue. The writers fail to understand that it might be possible for someone to shut down - or at least go quiet - in a crisis, rather than Emote. As if! The Actors. Were Being. Paid By the time! They Take. To Say! Their Lines. The puzzles are fine, but given the first hour or so involved exactly four player choices, the pointless and frankly stupid deaths were almost a relief. At one point, two characters wake up in a room, missing a third, who is later found dead for plot reasons and the two original characters later fight to the death over who killed the third. Except... it doesn't occur to either of them that perhaps the sinister mastermind WHO MOVED THEM TO THE ROOM WHILE THEY WERE KNOCKED OUT may have been the killer. I mean, the plot is stupid enough for it to be one of the two, but if it was, and they did it because they wanted to be one of the survivors, why didn't they off the other (still knocked out) person at the same time as they killed the first? And then stage a hidden death tableau?\n\nThis game is not tense. It is not smart. It is not an exploration of human emotions. It is a series of things that happen for an audience.

review system used a scale from 1 through 5, I would give this game a 3/5.\nFor simplicty's sake, I will upvote it.\nI've been following this series since I purchased the first two titles which I loved so much I would drop everything and give them full attention; so that is why I would call this game an \"enjoyable disappointment\". While I did have fun, the flaws are too noticeable for me to ignore.\n\nImportant information:\n* The game was said to be spoiler friendly to people who never played the prequels but I disagree. Without playing them, you might be lost at some of the plot points used throughout the game.\n* I have the 3DS version (it came with the replica watch) and I would say the PC version is probably more preferable because you don't have to pixel hunt on a tiny 3DS screen. I believe it's also more stable.\n\nOpinions:\n* I felt that they should have kept the VN style used in the prequels; the visuals unfortunately work against the cinematics due to how low quality they are.\n* The puzzles are a little bit samey aside from one I thought was really clever (hint: I hope you're good at algebra).\n* I find half the cast likeable but the problem is four of them are returning characters so I was already invested in them. The other half are a mixed bag but not in a good way.\n\nBottom line: I recommend playing the first two games, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, first; both are coming to Steam in Spring 2017.\n\nEDIT: I would like to amend this review with a tl;dr:\n\nWhat I played: Zero Escape Volume 3: Zero Time Dilemma\nWhat I expected: Back to the Future Part 3\nWhat I got: The Matrix: Revolution", "timestamp_created": 1483360795, "timestamp_updated": 1483362147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28921282": {"recommendationid": "28921282", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960271994", "num_games_owned": 1085, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506621574}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Saw, Cube and Butterfly Effect mixed into a game.", "timestamp_created": 1483314787, "timestamp_updated": 1483314787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28861314": {"recommendationid": "28861314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026758906", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483496103}, "language": "english", "review": "game is called Zero Escape\nI escaped\ngg ez, not sure if it's worth 30 bucks though", "timestamp_created": 1483174938, "timestamp_updated": 1483174938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28856368": {"recommendationid": "28856368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046308793", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483159536}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked the other games in the Zero Escape series, 999: Nine Hours Nine Persons Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward, you will love this game. The story, the puzzles, the time travel-y philosophical bullshit, and even (spoiler) some of the characters are all there. Though I should mention that I have only played 999. \n\nTL;DR: good game mate 7.5/8\n\nThe puzzles range from easy to fantastically brilliant to frustrating at times. But overall they are easier than 999, but still pretty intelligent and they make sense. I never had to resort to a walkthrough to solve a puzzle. Though sometimes the last piece you need is either unnecessary and the game wonders why you didn't go find it, or it is difficult to find and you sit stuck at a point looking for the answer in vain.\n\nThe story does get off to a bit of a strange start. You get thrust into things with even less explanation or context than I remember from the previous games. Don't give up on it right away. Through playing you will find about the same depth as previous games in the series. The great part is that the game gives you a handy decision tree to keep track of your choices. You can reference this to find out which timeline you're on and which choices you've already made at a specific decision. I really like this feature. Sometimes though, the decisions don't feel like they have as much weight as they did in 999. You can simply go back right away through the decision tree and try the other choice. Nice for 100% and curiosity, but in 999 every choice you made felt important because if you really wanted to see the other result you had to play through from the beginnning again and that would take time. I understand why this happens though. the game is so heavily based on making lots of decisions that it really needs to be this way. \n\nIf you're worried about there being great reveals and hints to stuff that you need knowledge from other routes to figure out, don't worry it's all there. There's plenty of stuff to make you go: \"Oh that makes sense now\" or \"So THAT'S why that was going on.\" There is perhaps one reveal that I feel they cheated a bit, but it isn't that terrible considering the rest of the reveals and interlocking routes and decisions went so well.\n\nBeing a port from a 3DS title the graphics aren't exactly up to snuff, but I don't think the graphics should be what you play this game for. It's kind of like how people still love an old game like myst.\n\nOverall the puzzles are fun, and the story (while sometimes trope-y) is enjoyable especially in cinematics even if they don't look all that great.", "timestamp_created": 1483161197, "timestamp_updated": 1483161260, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28854001": {"recommendationid": "28854001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312127784", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483167399}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6c92\u73a9\u904e\u524d\u5169\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u904e\u9084\u662f\u5f88\u4eab\u53d7\u672c\u904a\u6232\u7684\u5287\u60c5\u53ca\u9ad4\u9a57\uff0c\u76f8\u7576\u63a8\u85a6\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1483155000, "timestamp_updated": 1483155000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28848425": {"recommendationid": "28848425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042295473", "num_games_owned": 1426, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483135972}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has me torn although I enjoy it as a fan of the series I do recognize it as the weakest link of the three.

But YOU NEED TO PLAY THE PRECEDING GAMES! It is absolutely obligatory for you if you want to glean any enjoyment from the story! So if you are curious about this game just because of it being a puzzle game/visual novel, stay away! Wait for the PC version of 999 and Virtues Last Reward, they are slated to come out in March 2017 on steam, so please, wait until then! Alternatively you can hunt down a 999 cart online, you can run it in a New 3DS no problem, and Virtues Last Reward is available on the nintendo E-shop as a downloadble title.\n\nSo first! Buy and play 999, if you like it; move on to Virtues Last Reward. ONLY after finishing those two, play Zero Time Dilemma. It's a fantastic series! With a pretty damn good story, with a quality set of puzzles set in a pretty damn original setting. \n\nOnly three issues: \n1. There is a metric craptonne of semi-believable psuedo science and as such big helping of disbelief-suspension will be required. Saying more than that would be saying to much however. \n2. While 999 was a pretty good looking DS game, and Virtues Last Reward was fine looking on the 3DS, Zero Time Dilemma can be pretty damn off-putting with it's presentation. \n3. It is certainly the weakest entry into the series, it is good and works pretty hard to tie up all the loose ends. But the story have some silly bits, and some of the plot points are very contrived in my oppinion, but it is not enough to bring down the thing entirely. \n\nAll in all, a fine game.

About that : this is one of those games where you definitely want to keep googling for answers to a minimum, as plot spoilers REALLY ruin the fun here. The puzzles in this game probably aren't as mindbending as the other ones either; however, I did have to bust out the pen and paper sometimes to write things down.

There were some storyline sequences that unlock only after you re-viewed certain early-game events, but there weren't any actual hints/clues or much logic as to why you had to revisit those scenes to unlock the subsequent ones. You also need to know to jump back into the game after you beat it to view the updated \"Files\" to get some end-game closure.

The resolution of the story didn't seem to carry as much weight as the previous entries either. \n\nHowever, the puzzles in the game felt like solid additions to the well established gameplay of the previous entries and they have added a new free roaming camera that makes exploring the rooms feel much easier. The segmented exploration of the timeline really felt like it belonged, especially as it is explained in the story.

Everything within Zero Time Dilemma follows up on the previous 2 games: 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, and in order to understand everything you have to play the series from the start (plus playing ZTD first would spoil the entire story of both 999 and VLR).\n\nEach game in this series plays quite similarly. Be ready for a whole lot of dialogue, because half your time will be spent reading novel sections that explain the story, characters, etc. This is the main focus and appeal of the series: listening to the crazy science and philosophy tangents that spring up and keep you interested, thinking, and always guessing \"Just who is Zero and what is going on?\" Plot twists galore.\n\nBack to gameplay, the only elements you get control over are: \n1) Certain choices that change the story branch.\n2) The escape sections. \nThese escape sections are the puzzle portions of the games where you have to look around rooms, find objects, combine items, enter codes, and play minigames to make progress and escape. There are several of these sections, but it is important to remember that the majority of this game is reading and you can't expect any sort of real action. All 3 games have multiple endings that require replaying to find different pathways and piece together every part of the story. \n\nIn comparison to 999 and VLR, I found this game to be the weakest in the series by a decent margin. The story makes some questionable choices and certain characters feel left out by the end [spoiler] Mira [/spoiler] or thrown in with little introduction [spoiler] Delta [/spoiler]. The music is great, but it is recycled AGAIN from the amazing 999 soundtrack and seems lazier than when this was done in VLR. \nAnd, let's face it, the graphics are pretty bad. As anyone can see from the trailers, character animations are stiff, awkward, and overall low budget. The main problem with this is how it can ruin the atmosphere in a scene that is supposed to be taken more seriously. I knew with this final game the developers would try to go further with the graphics, but it's no surprise that 999's simple 2D drawings look a whole lot better than ZTD's awkward models. All of this hurts the game, but in no way do I think it should condemn it. If you played 999 and VLR, you need to finish the series, and the ending was satisfying enough. [spoiler] Yes, it is another cliffhanger. We don't know what happens next, but all the pieces are set up for a successful future. The one thing I missed the most was what happened to Clover, Alice, Kyle, etc. stuck in the VLR timeline? [/spoiler]\n\nAs for the flow of gameplay, ZTD falls just behind VLR. It keeps the improvements made with replayability (999's biggest problem) and tries something different with the fragment system. With this new system, the timeline no longer follows chronological order or even the same world lines like VLR did. It can be more confusing, but adds to the satisfaction when you piece the story all together in the end.\n\nI think that what I said earlier summarizes it all best: you should play this game if and only if you have already played 999 and VLR. If you haven't, and the prospect of a long story revolving around time travel and death games sounds good (and several other things I can't mention  because spoilers), then I would highly recommend 999.

I was wrong.\n\nI never finished the Mass Effect series, but I heard all about its awful ending. Having played through Zero Time Dilemma, I think I understand how the fans of Mass Effect felt. Zero Time Dilemma, as a conclusion, is one of the most lazily written endings I've ever seen. The way that every major plot point in the series seems so downplayed is insulting. The game is full of Deus Ex Machina-style moments because apparently Uchikoshi wrote himself into a wall. It seems like he wrote the beginning and middle and didn't even know how to end it.\n\nHow did this happen? Here's my theory.\n\n9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors was never meant to have a sequel. Once it achieved a surprising amount of success, Uchikoshi extended the story. Virtue's Last Reward was a noticeable step down in quality when it came to the writing, most likely because it had to have ties to 999 (which is about as strong as a narrative as you can get, in my opinion), which limited its scope. However, for what it was, it did pretty well. 999 character arcs went nicely, the story still managed to be intriguing (though somewhat nonsensical), and the puzzles and atmosphere were amazing.\n\nEnter Zero Time Dilemma. VLR didn't sell well as they'd hoped. The budget was next to nothing. Uchikoshi knew he had to go back to D-Com for this last game, but had no other ideas as to what happened there when writing VLR (I hope). The development cycle was probably only a year or two, which left almost no time for editing the script. As a result, we get this mess. \n\nSome light spoilers ahead, but I figure I'd better close with the positives and negatives.\n\n+ Great atmosphere for most of the game.\n+ Some genuinely good moments.\n+ A few creative puzzles.\n+ Interesting narrative structure centered around playing things out of order.\n+ Puzzle room dialogue (always a highlight in this series)\n+ Includes a healthy selection of songs from 999 and VLR\n- Akane's personality does a complete 180, her actions and words completely contradict everything said in 999 and VLR.\n- Junpei's personality is the same way, to a certain extent. How he gets from here to VLR Junpei, I have no idea.\n- Clover and a bunch of other characters barely get a passing mention. Pretty disappointing seeing as this is the finale.\n- Repeating puzzles in every escape room.\n- Awful animations, some spotty English voice acting, and an overall lack of polish due to low budget.\n- Almost every major plot point from the previous game is downplayed and irrelevant.\n- Mira has one of the worst character arcs in anything ever.\n- Eric is a complete idiot, to the point where it breaks immersion.\n- Even though the 999 and VLR tracks are good, the game rarely brings any of its own music to the table.\n- Extremely rushed ending with awful closure, though at this point I wouldn't be surprised if they were lining up for yet another sequel.\n- Complex Motives ( you'll know what this means when you finish the game)\n\nI know you're going to finish the game regardless of what I say if you've beaten 999 and VLR. Who wouldn't? Those games are fantastic. However, be prepared to want to throw your computer away after you've finished this.

I found myself quite invested in a few of them by the end\n\nCons:\n-One or two of the puzzles use ridiculous moon logic, where twice I just resorted to rubbing items in my inentory on everything in the environment until something worked\n-The animation quality is absolutely terrible. I'm not sure what the budget was for this game or how it was allocated but it sure as hell didnt go to animation. They have to cut away and cut back every time anybody picks an object up in a cinematic for God's sake\n-I'm not sure if they were things established in previois games, but the plot does have a couple of total ass-pulls which dont do too much detriment to its overall impact, but when you have good writing surrounding these moments it makes them stand out more\n\nOverall it's an excellent narrative experience with fun, well made puzzles. The tone of the game is quite bleak for the most part and involves a similar type of premise to Danganronpa; several characters locked in a confined space, attempting to find a way out.

While there is some in-game context given to familiarize new players with the storyline, it is still highly recommended that you be familiar with the plot of the first two games in order to understand this one.\n\nWith that out of the way, this installment was a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, though I wouldn't say it was perfect by any means.  For example, if they wanted to transition from still images to animated cutscenes, they should have gone all out and fully animated every detail.  Instead, the camera often cuts away from the characters when a significant action is performed (such as one character attacking another) and we only hear a sound effect to signal that said action took place.  To me this signifies either a limited budget or a lack of effort.  However, the music was good, the dialogue/voice acting was entertaining, and the events of the game were presented in a coherent manner.  The room escape puzzles were the perfect level of difficulty; they were challenging enough to require some thought, but not so difficult that I was stuck for hours on a single puzzle.\n\nBut let's talk about the one aspect that the Zero Escape series is known for: the story.  You can expect the same sort of mind-blowing, alternate timeline laden story in this game as you experienced in the previous two.  While I wouldn't say that this game introduces any ingenious new concepts to the overarching mythos of the series, it takes what made the other two games so awesome and cranks it all up several notches.  More death, more violence, more paranoia and backstabbing, more alternate timelines, more time-loop miracles that completely screw with your brain.  Killing off other characters is not just something that happens to take place in certain timelines, but is now a requirement for the remaining characters to escape the facility they are trapped in.  A group of characters can seem completely peaceful and cooperative at one moment and then suddenly proceed to turn on each other in a matter of minutes.  Needless to say, I was thoroughly entertained throughout the whole game.\n\nThe one part that did leave me scratching my head a little was the ending.  While many old questions are answered, new ones are raised - and therefore left open to interpretation because the developers have apparently stated that this is the last game in the series.  While it wouldn't necessarily be unfitting to end it right here, I certainly hope they reconsider, since this game's ending leaves open the possibility for a fourth installment.

has jugado antes al [b]999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors[/b]  (DS) y [b] Virtue\u2019s Last Reward[/b]  (3DS y Vita) no recomiendo que lo juegues sin haberlos jugado. Dentro de poco van a sacar ambos para PC.\n\nSi has jugado a los dos anteriores desde luego te recomiendo que lo compres para conocer el final de la saga y todos sus secretos.\nPero si aun as\u00ed quieres saber que te puedes esperar, te dejo un peque\u00f1o an\u00e1lisis en el que no har\u00e9 spoiler (cuanto menos sepas del juego mejor):\n\n[h1]Historia:[/h1]\nEste juego se sit\u00faa temporalmente entre los dos anteriores, situ\u00e1ndose en medio del [b] Nonary Game[/b]  del que se comenta que esparce el Radical 6 en [b] Virtue's Last Reward[/b]. El resto de detalles puedes leerlos de la descripci\u00f3n del juego. \nA mi parecer sigue en la l\u00ednea de la saga en cuanto a calidad de la historia narrada dando unos giros de argumento que no te esperas. El m\u00e9todo de avanzar en la historia ha cambiado, ahora vas jugando segmentos del juego sin orden temporal (sirve para crear una sensaci\u00f3n de estar perdido al igual que lo sufren los protagonistas). El elenco de personajes es una mezcla entre desconocidos y otros ya conocidos (o eso es lo que cre\u00edas).\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad:[/h1]\nSigue en la l\u00ednea de los dos anteriores, puzles de escapar que tendr\u00e1s que resolver, escenas de dialogo y decisiones dif\u00edciles que tomar. Si te gustaron los puzles de los dos anteriores seguramente te gustaran estos nuevos. En mi opini\u00f3n no llegan a ser tan buenos como los del [b] Virtue's Last Reward[/b]  y deja la sensaci\u00f3n de que hay m\u00e1s decisiones y dialogo que puzles, eso s\u00ed, las decisiones son m\u00e1s variadas y dan lugar a muchos cambios en la trama.\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos:[/h1]\nEste yo creo que es el punto que m\u00e1s flojea, han decidido dar un salto del estilo novela gr\u00e1fica a animaci\u00f3n 3D, como si se tratase de una pel\u00edcula. Aunque el planteamiento de las escenas y el dise\u00f1o est\u00e1n logrados, la animaci\u00f3n de los modelos es muy pobre al no tener tanta experiencia en este campo (tampoco se puede pedir mucho de un estudio peque\u00f1o). Probablemente habr\u00eda quedado mejor de seguir con el estilo novela. Aun as\u00ed, en esta saga los gr\u00e1ficos no son la parte importante, de manera que salvo alg\u00fan detalle molesto se disfruta igualmente.\n\n[h1]Opini\u00f3n final:[/h1]\n\nEste apartado aviso de que es muy subjetivo y voy a dar mi opini\u00f3n personal.\n\nRespecto a la calidad global yo dir\u00eda que es un juego muy bueno dentro del g\u00e9nero aunque el precio sea demasiado alto.

It paired room escape puzzles with deeply anime visual novel sequences and plenty of weird random pseudoscientific nonsense, and that's probably about as much as many people got out of it because it was structured in such a way that you didn't get the really amazing, mind-bending twists and revelations until you'd finished it a couple times, which meant repeating at least some of the room escapes and sitting through repeated visual novel bits over and over. And ultimately to really experience the whole thing and get the True Ending (tm) you had to hit all the major permutations.  If you did that, it was a heck of a ride. But you really had to work at it to get there.\n\nThen it got a sequel called Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. Similar formula, but this time it exposed the decision flowchart from the get go and let you jump around it at will. And the ways it played with this ability in the actual fiction, as well as the ways it called back to 999 and generally messed with all your expectations were frankly incredible. I could forgive people for being unenthusiastic about 999 because of how many obstacles it put between you and the good stuff, but Virtue's Last Reward was pretty much impeccable. Oh, and the True End? A giant, horrifying, agonizing cliffhanger reveal you almost certainly wouldn't have guessed. But then sales were not great, and every indication was the planned third game in the trilogy wouldn't be made.\n\nWell, here it is. Zero Time Dilemma. If you've played the first two games, you need to play this. That's all there is to it. And if you haven't, you absolutely should not play this until you do, because it is the culmination of two games worth of story. You don't -have- to know this stuff going in - mostly the characters don't - but it will make a world of difference in the impact of what happens in the course of the game, and your familiarity with the returning characters will help parse their motivations and actions in this. But also, frankly...not gonna lie...Zero Time Dilemma is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy and it has some incredible twists. But it isn't the best game in the series. That's still VLR. You can unfortunately tell that Zero Time Dilemma was made on a shoestring budget and so the cutscenes are pretty awkwardly rendered, there's a lot of telling and not showing, and the pacing and format are a bit strange for the game overall. This by no means spoiled the game for me and I certainly wouldn't have been willing to leave it at VLR's cliffhanger ending.

The formula is always the same: a cast of stereotypical characters tries to find their way out from an enclosed location where they\u2019ve been forced to play a game to achieve their freedom. This is the set up to tell a story with Sci-Fi themes that goes far beyond the mere concept of escaping, with plot twists and character development that defies the initial premise of the formula.\n\nAs the author stated, the Visual Novel tries to use and abuse the media to tell its story, truly integrating the decisions of the player. This is made possible through the Flowchart: a tree of choices that leads from the beginning of the game to the multiple endings it bears. This, however, doesn\u2019t expect any one player to choose its own singular ending, but rather invites everyone to explore the various branches of the tree to discover the mysteries hidden behind your decisions and reach the True Ending of the game.\n\nThe Flowchart takes on a new form in this title, appearing in two separate versions: the classic one and a second, where the scenes appeared group and inconsequential. This is made so that the player can experience the events of the game without knowing their placement in time, leading to the need to reconstruct the story piece by piece. This, coupled with the three POV the game gives, makes for multiple ways to experience the story of the game, leading to different decisions and results. \n\nThis mechanics thus define the experience of the game, leading to a story that is bit by bit revealed with multiple scenes dedicate to the development of its characters and twists that make for a truly interesting story. The decisions made in the game also have the intention of making the player think about their true opinion on them, rather than roleplay the character they are playing as, with the intentions to subvert one\u2019s beliefs as the information piles and on and the situation becomes clearer. \n\nThe game was designed to fit the needs of both new players and fan of the series, especially since it\u2019s the first released on Steam and the upcoming ports for the same platform. The first two titles of Zero Escape worked easily as a standalone game, but this one is the end of a trilogy and therefore it works less as one. Nonetheless it could easily be played as entry point, with new players feeling both confused and intrigued by the information revealed early in the game. \n\nTaking a different approach from the previous titles, the game seems to be more focused on the freedom of choice and sense of discovery correlated with the middle part of the game. With the new fragment system for the timeline probably influencing that result, feels less ramping up to a huge twist revelation at its end and rather focuses on the truths that you might discover during your experience. This however leads to a less impactful ending, by some defined weak and unclear. As most Sci-Fi stories a few holes are inevitably left, but most are probably wanted.\n\nAs it was the case in previous titles, some questions weren\u2019t answered fully or directly, while some were probably scrapped during production. This inevitably leads to open ended situations, but this aren\u2019t inherently bad. The Zero Escape series was intended for players to make ponder about some questions posed during the game and finding their own answer to them.", "timestamp_created": 1479995876, "timestamp_updated": 1479995969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27158313": {"recommendationid": "27158313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007671786", "num_games_owned": 503, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478298748}, "language": "german", "review": "Erst einmal: dieses Spiel habe ich echt durchgesuchtet.

I would almost go as far as saying it was faultless - but to absolutely scrape the barrel, when skipping dialogue, if would occassionally skip something you hadn't read. This was solveable by viewing the dialogue log (which you could pause and do at any point - even mid way through dialogue) and was by no means a deal breaker. \n\nTellTale could really take a leaf out of their books - this is how decision based games should be made. The puzzles are challenging at times, but fun. Each puzzle being based in a single room, it also avoided the traps of games like Myst where you find yourself running around a large world trying to get the clues required. There is no walking at all.\n\nIn the end, everything is wrapped up wonderfully, with no disappointment and you'll likely have an existential crisis on your hands to boot. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.\n\nUPDATE: I decided to go and read some of the other reviews of this game - especially the negative ones. There was a strong theme that you can't enjoy this game unless you have played the two preceding games. I have not played them and had no problems at all picking up the concepts and definitely enjoyed it - so, give people some credit. \n\nUPDATE 2: Having now gone back and played the previous games, I believe this to be the weakest of the three games. The plot is not as well thought through, with clear holes that are frustrating. The puzzles are shorter and not as satisfying. \n\nBut the biggest annoyance, coming from the previous games was the dialogue skipping, which I had already been annoyed with. The whole game moved slower because you couldn't click to reveal and then skip to the next section once you'd read it twice as fast as the diaglogue was being read to you.\n\nIt's still a good game, and you'll likely want to play all 3 - but if you had to pick one, don't pick this one.", "timestamp_created": 1479866932, "timestamp_updated": 1494366838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26733893": {"recommendationid": "26733893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106486025", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480006064}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful game with a beautiful story.

Zero Time Dilemma itself. I have only played Virtue's Last Reward/VLR (the second game) and then Zero Time Dilemma. While you can understand most (but not all) of VLR without playing 999 (the first game), I don't think you can play Zero Time Dilemma quite as easily because the story is going to assume you know a lot more about the past titles than Virtu's Last Reward.\nZero Time Dilemma is very different from the past two games in the Zero Escape series, and I would say it isn't quite as good as a result. But the \"least good Zero Escape game\" is as not a bad title as it sounds, it is still better than many other story based games and visual novels you could play. Its disappointing in the same sense when a straight A student gets a B-, not bad just not as great as what came before. So the review might sound negative, but its really just me feeling that some efforts to make things different didn't work as well as one might have wanted to it work.\n\nInstead of Visual Novel sequences, cinematic cutscenes play out. The visual approach is interesting and the camera is dynamic. But once in a while it doesn't always flow well or the camera angle will show clipping or awkward movements. On a more positive note for the style, the character models are rendered well with interesting shading that make the game visually distinctive. \nThe characters are pretty solid overall, the puzzle are pretty solid (though there are a bit less than usual), having to enter keywords to advance the plot made for a more creative option than dialogue choices and the scenario is pretty interesting as far as the specifics of the death game the players are put into. \nThe way you progress through the story is nonlinear, and based around 3 separated teams rather than a single protagonist pairing up with different members of the cast. I do think the change was interesting and I appreciate the risk taken, but sometimes the non-linear aspect makes it hard to follow the story events, and Virtue's Last Reward gave every character a lot more character development.\nThe story was very engaging, which is the core appeal of the title, and as a consequence I played through the game more intensely than I've played any game in a while in order to experience the full story. It isn't as long as the past titles (about 20 hours instead of 40 hours), but it is not a short game by any means either.\n\nSome twists and puzzles were very interesting. However, while clever, a felt that one of the bigger twists near the end was a bit of an asspull (even though there are legitimate but subtle hints throughout the game), and that the science-fiction elements where stretched a bit too far with two of the rooms. The story does not fall apart or become bad, but the ending is not as satisfying as it was for Virtue's Last Reward. Which is likely just an issue of the difficulty of having to wrap up a series with so much story, lore, twists and turns instead of ending with a cliffhanging like in VLR.", "timestamp_created":

Hinzugemixt werden R\u00e4tselpassagen und Entscheidungsm\u00f6glichkeiten, welche essentiell f\u00fcr die Story sind. Die R\u00e4tsel sollten f\u00fcr alle l\u00f6sbar sein, sind aber teilweise auch etwas anspruchsvoller. Notfalls einfach zu einer L\u00f6sung im Netz greifen.\n\nDas Spiel ging leider ein wenig an meinen Erwartungen vorbei und stimmungsm\u00e4\u00dfig wird das d\u00fcstere Setting von den Charakt\u00e4ren gest\u00f6rt, die ihre Lage nicht so ernst nehmen in einigen Dialogen. Beim Soundtrack h\u00e4tte man da auch nochmal ansetzen k\u00f6nnen. Die Atmosph\u00e4re h\u00e4tte auf jeden Fall gr\u00f6\u00dferes Potential gehabt.\n\nDadurch, dass man auch die ganzen Entscheidungen in den n\u00e4chsten Minuten nochmal ausprobieren kann, hat man auch nie das Gef\u00fchl, dass man sich jetzt unbedingt entscheiden m\u00fcsste und es belanglos ist. Zwar ist das f\u00fcr die Geschichte sinnvoll, aber dadurch klickt man sich oft einfach durch die Entscheidungen durch und denkt nicht wirklich dar\u00fcber nach,egal ob einige Male zeitdruck herrscht oder nicht.\n\nDas Pacing ist auch etwas zu langsam um st\u00e4ndig fesseln zu k\u00f6nnen.\n\n\nZuletzt kommt ein SPOILER(!!!) der f\u00fcr mein Bewertung zwar wichtig ist, aber auch schon einiges vom Spiel vorwegnimmt.\n\n[spoiler] Das dann ab viele Physikalische Theorien dazu kommen und es im Grunde auf etwas wie Zeit- und Dimensionsreisen hinausl\u00e4uft war f\u00fcr mich extrem entt\u00e4uschend und ist heutzutage einfach zu ausgelutscht. DEUS EX MACHINA. Man erwartet ab diesem Punkt eh schon, was dann ungef\u00e4hr kommt die Entscheidungen wirken noch unrelevanter.\t[/spoiler]\n\n\nDie R\u00e4tselpassagen waren soweit ganz spa\u00dfig (meistens) und die Unterhaltungen waren okay. Interessante Stellen, wo man wirklich viel \u00fcber die Charakt\u00e4re und deren Beziehung zueinander erh\u00e4lt, gibt es leider zu wenige. Wenn man dann was erf\u00e4hrt, dann ist es aber auch immerhin wirklich sehr interessant. H\u00e4tte auch mehr Potential gehabt.\n\nF\u00fcr Freunde von Visual Novels und Puzzlespielen ist das Spiel gut geeignet. Die Story und die Atmosph\u00e4re ist leider dann doch zu entt\u00e4uschend und nur okay, um alleine den Spieler bis zum Ende tragen zu k\u00f6nnen.

The puzzles are hard as hell but really make you think and there's so many endings it's difficult to keep track. I've played the previous two games and have to say this one is my least favorite. \n\nBut to those of you who are brand-new to the series and want to play this one first-- don't.\n\nI'm serious. You will miss out on so many key hints and tossbacks it would be blasphemous, like playing Bioshock Infinite without playing the first game (you can actually just skip the second) and you would be doing yourself and this series a great disservice. Trust me, the PC version of the first two games are coming to Steam next year but if you really can't wait then you should at least watch some playthroughs on YouTube to get the full experience. \n\nI have to say Zero Time Dilemma (the third game of the series) ties up the story pretty nicely. It's not like so many other series that never got a third installment (talking to you, Valve) and there's some real mind-fuck moments in here. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great game and it really had me guessing the whole time on how the hell any of it was going to relate but it just didn't have...I guess you could say \"flair\".\n\nI say that because the first game was so uniquely amazing that they had to make a sequel and the second game was so colorful and fast-paced that I felt really slowed down and bored coming to the third game. Have you seen the cover art of the second game? You should look at it and compare it to the rusted, watered-down look of this game's cover.\n\nAlso, the character's designs are a lot more intersting in the second game and I expected the interest and \"flair\" to come back much the same but it didn't. This a good game but man are the character designs boring. \n\nAnd the gameplay wasn't bumped up either. That's what was so great about Virtue's Last Reward (the second game). It took what made the first game great and made it brighter and wilder (if not better) and really hooked me. \n\nZero Time Dilemma is just lacking individuality and does a similar thing of the second game by jumping fragments but in a much blander, more drawn-out way that had me sighing.\n\nI really wish this game had something more to add to the series than just drawing on the other two and making it bleh. \n\nYeah, that's what this game is. It's good but it's bleh (compared to the other two).\n\nJust...bleh.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478627614, "timestamp_updated": 1478627614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26484512": {"recommendationid": "26484512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042208543", "num_games_owned": 2081, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478560119}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like escape rooms with a sense of actual danger, this game is the game for you.

The Zero Escape series, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, has been one of my favorite games series of all time.  Virtue's Last Reward, while not quite as good as 999 was, opened up the story massively.  It created so many interesting questions about where this story was going to go.  And since it pretty much left off on a cliff-hanger, I was immensly looking forwards to this game.  What a dissappointment.  This game was almost not made as the Zero Escape series was never a very profitable series of games.  Understandably so, its a very niche market for escape the room puzzle visual novel games.  So in order to get this game made in the first place, they had to do so with a significantly reduced budget.  And it shows in every aspect of the game.  The graphics are horrendous.  I imagine they switched to the 3D animated style because it was cheaper and easier to put together, but it really takes you out of the story when the characters mouths flap around durring dialogue and you can so clearly see the low quality of the character models.  Another aspect in which the reduced budget really shows is in how short this game feels.  Its largely exacerbated by the way they decided to tell this game's story.  Instead of letting you make a series of choices and see how they play out to the end, you instead play through a series story pieces between which your character's memories are erased.  So you never know the consequences of your choices and there can be little to no character development until half way thorugh the game when the mechanic is dropped like the sack of rocks it is.  While it is a cool idea, it ends up being largely frustrating and confusing.  And since the game is fairly short they aren't able to capitalize on this mechanic very well.  There just aren't enough story threads make you truly wonder where you are in the timeline effectively.  The puzzles and choices you get to make throughout the game are pretty solid and about what we've come to expect from the Zero Escape series.  However the story and characters is where the game truly falls on its face.  Let's start with the characters.  Boy oh boy did they ruin the characters of this series.  The game consists of three groups of three characters.  In one group we have two of the protagonists of 999, Akane and Junpei.  These characters and their story form one of the major threads of this series.  And they absolutely destroy their characters in this game.  Junpei has effectively become a whiney disaffected teenager.  He is so absurdly unlikeable and it just kills me as someone who has played the other games in this series and come to love his character so much.  They eventually give a reason for this, but it is very unsatisfactory and largely unnecessary for it to have happened in the first place.  Another group contains two more returning characters.  Phi and Sigma.  Of course because of the way Virtue's Last Reward ended, this is not the same Sigma that we came to know in the previous game.  Its just a boring and stern nothing of a character who pairs very well with Phi's also complete lack of interesting character in this game.  The third group isn't even worth talking about.  They are crap filler characters that no one likes and have no relevance to the overarching story.  So yes, that does make 1/3 of this game pointless and annoying to play through.  The overall plot starts out alright, but the ending is so terrible that it legit almost ruins the entire series.  It breaks the series' own rules for how the jumping and shifting stuff works and leaves almost every plot thread from the previous games unanswered.  They try to cover some of the lack of an ending with little text cutscenes to cover what happened to the characters after the story concluded but even those failed.  They were way too short and covered almost nothing of value.  In the end we are left with an ending to a great series that is so unsatisfactory that it almost makes me regret loving the series in the first place.", "timestamp_created": 1478377406, "timestamp_updated": 1478377406, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26437148": {"recommendationid": "26437148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024690412", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478358036}, "language": "english", "review": "A really good conclusion to the trilogy.\n\nThank you Uchikoshi and your team for all this hard work on this exceptional game series that Zero Escape is.", "timestamp_created": 1478358652, "timestamp_updated": 1478358652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548336", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26434698": {"recommendationid": "26434698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014392136", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467697320}, "language": "english", "review": "999 > VLR > ZTD \n\nNothing will ever top 999, but you might as well play this if you've already played the other two games.\n\nBuy this and play it when it's out before you play ZTD. \n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/477740", "timestamp_created": 1478350508, "timestamp_updated": 1478350644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26433761": {"recommendationid": "26433761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098651473", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478358311}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6e38\u620f,\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6574\u4f53\u73a9\u4e0b\u6765\u611f\u89c9\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u5f71\u54cd.. \n\u8fd9\u79cd\u89e3\u5bc6\u7c7b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4e5f\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u73a9\n\u611f\u89c9\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u6ca1\u600e\u4e48\u770b\u653b\u7565,\u81ea\u5df1\u6478\u7d22\u7740\u8fc7\u4e86..\n\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6a21\u578b...\u8bf4\u4ed6\u662f10\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u70b9\u90fd\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5206(\u6bcf\u6b21\u770b\u5230\u90a3\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u7279\u522b\u51fa\u620f\u554a)...\n\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ee1\u520610\u5206\u7684\u8bdd:\n\u6a21\u578b\u592a\u6e23\u51cf3\u5206,\u4eba\u7269\u52a8\u4f5c\u592a\u50f5\u786c(\u53e3\u578b\u8fd8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u4e0a)\u51cf1\u5206\n\u6240\u4ee5\u7ed96\u5206\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1478346914, "timestamp_updated": 1478346914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26433676": {"recommendationid": "26433676", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016690091", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478346368}, "language": "english", "review": "In some histories, you don't have the game.\nIn some histories, you don't have time.\nIn some histories, you don't have any ideas to solve puzzles.\nLife is simply unfair.

Chunsoft  definitely has created a major success in this series. I have played both 999, Zero Time Dilemma and watched the playthrough of Virtue's Last Reward. When this game came out, I bought it straight away in the first week since it definitely is worth the price. It is completely worth it.\n\nDefinitely gonna have to recommend anyone wanting to play this game that you have to play for watch the walkthroughs of the other two games to understand all that stories on this series. Because it is completely crucial to understand the mechanisms and plot twists.\n\nThis may not be a TL;DR review from me, since I wrote this review 4 months after finishing the game.\n\n1/ Story: Hmm, hard to make a concise version of the story. However, I can say this is the missing link between 999 - the point where Akane Kuroshiki has finished orchestraing her plan together with her brother San, and Virtue's Last Reward - the point where Akane creates a major plan to stop the virus from spreading together with Sigma and Phi. Zero Time Dilemma answers all the questions I had from the other two games, making it a complete finished story for me after playing. I understood so much after playing the game. \n\nThe game definitely has plot twists, it really does. But I'm really glad at the fact no plot hole was missed and not thought of.\n\n2/ Gameplay: The game now is a bit different from the other two games, as it does not allow the players to have one playthrough with different choices like the other two. It did created some confusion for me at first, but as I kept on playing through, I understood that the confusion in selecting different paths does has its goal to allow the players to see one huge picture behind every choice the players make . It is actually pretty rewarding in the end. \n\nThe puzzles mechanism in this game , for me, is much easier to grasp than in the other two games. It does requires thinking as well, but it does gives me better hints than in the other two games. I love it. \n\nI like the fact that Chunsoft kept the notes section and dialogues section in order for me to keep track of everything. I really like that. Sometimes you may get back to the game after a long time. Those are the things that keep you continue going forward easily.\n\n3/ The music: The Zero Escape series definitely has great soundtracks. I love them all. \n\nOverall Score: 10/10 for me. \n\nIt's a must-have for novel stories lovers like me. I have always loved the quantum physics theories and thought experiments. They are something to think about and this series does opens my eyes in a lot of ways. \n\nThank you Chunsoft for creating such a great game as the missing link between 999 and Virtue's Last Reward!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1478157812, "timestamp_updated": 1480074714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544125", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26378226": {"recommendationid": "26378226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173981665", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480198262}, "language": "english", "review": "Story is very interesting so far\nPuzzles are smart and fun (Though a little bit too tricky for my dumb brain)\n\nThe only thing to be wary of in my opinion:\nI know the game was originally released on 3DS and Vita, but I can't help but mention the\nterrible animation and lip syncing.

More than the 2nd, in fact. (I'd still ask you to play the first two though, it's almost mandatory to understand this one) \nAssuming you have played them:\n\n-The puzzles are the best in the series by far, and thay always give you JUST enough hints to feel smart and not coddled. It's weird people seem to forget there is a game attached to this book, but it's a good one. (check out the bonus riddles in the art book, they're cool)\n\n-It brought back the sense of tension that was missing in the 2nd game and you never know when the next puzzle will force someone to murder you to save themselves. Some end plot twists were rather silly, but they were in VLR as well (you know shrodinger's cat was originally written as a joke, right?), so whatever.\n\n-I was expecting not to like new characters just joining us just this game, but I ended up loving them, particularly the couple on green team. They wound up being as if not more interesting than our returning cast (Akane is such a nagging old lady in this one).\n\n-The ending is so dumb. It is so laughably dumb, I can not even get angry at it. I found it genuinely hilarious. Other people did get real mad though, so be warned.\n\nOVERALL: 7/10\nWould not avoid gatling guns that way again.", "timestamp_created": 1477944060, "timestamp_updated": 1477944060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505234", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26340276": {"recommendationid": "26340276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055635434", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477925144}, "language": "english", "review": "In every single way I believe that I could say that Zero Time Dilemma is the worst game in the series, but to be honest it would be really hard to keep the quality of its precedents and while ZTD isn't better than 2009's 999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors and the following 2011's Virtue's Last Reward it is really, really good!  I'll keep this recommendation spoiler free but it must be said right now that you shouldn't play this game without playing the other two before.\n\nTechnically speaking I should be honest and just say that it would be hard to get worse than it is. Going against the visual novel style the previous games had, it adopts interactive cinematics, sort of simulating the recent Telltale hits like The Walking Dead, Wolf Among Us and et cetera. I truly believe this was the worst possible choice the director could have made. We all know that the Zero Escape series isn't really rentable and the simple fact that this game was made is almost a miracle. The production value must have been low and it really transpires in these cinematics. The animation is really, really sloppy and most of the action happens off-screen and those that doesn't really look terrible, almost making me wish the game wasn't animated at all because the 3D models of the characters doesn't really look that bad. Not only that but one of the ways you could experience Uchikochi's writing brilliance was through the way he would use the main character to describe action and scenes with details and it all was lost to some badly executed cinema tricks with crappy animation. I was already against the 3D models and animations on Virtue's Last Reward because the series would be far more visually appealing if they had just kept the 2D aspects of 999. Life is simply unfair, isn't?\n\nSo, now that I've put aside all the bad stuff I had about the game I must talk about the the good ones: the plot. It may look not worth for some people after reading my rant about the animation but if you're into Zero Escape, the plot is pretty much all you want in the game and every other thing is banal.\n\nI must start with the cast, that is really diversified and less Danganronpa-ish design and plot wise. The character design made sure you got some information through the way the characters look and some of them are misleading. Like before in the series, not everything is clear about the participants in the Decision Game and discovering about them is really interesting. I must say though that twice they pulled old plot cards about the characters and it didn't hit like before.\n\nAs a sequel Zero Time Dilemma delivers good shout outs to the last two games and it finishes the arc created in Virtue's Last Reward in a way that almost all points meet ends. Through the middle of the game until the end it got me really hooked. It is good to see old friends again and the new cast is better than VLR's (Dio, Quark and Alice kinda sucked to be honest).\n\nOh, good thing I told you people about the beginning of the game because I didn't quite like it. The game now works with fragments that are all out of order so before stuff start making sense you might feel lost but please, persist. Like pretty much everything in the series things usually have some meaning to them.\n\nIt is quite dumb to recommend the last iteration in a series, if you played the first two you are going to play this anyway but I really felt like writing this because I'm really passionate about Zero Escape and had to express my opinion about the series \"end\".\n\nI hope everyone enjoy Zero Time Dilemma like I did!\nSeek a way out.", "timestamp_created": 1477935737, "timestamp_updated": 1480627059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604663", "comment_count": "1",

probably questioning yourself, what sort of game you should expect, while looking at this store page. \n\nEssentially, it is a mixture which consists of:\n\nThe atmosphere of SAW\nThe soundtrack of Silent Hill\nThe amount of blood of Resident Evil\nThe logic of philosophy\nThe fiction of physics\n\nAnd all of this garnished with fiction I cannot explain without spoiling the game.\n\nI definitely recommend playing this game, but if you have the chance, play the first two parts! The story will get a lot clearer, funnier and more enjoyable.\n\nLast thing: Thank you so much Devs, I do remember all those headlines saying there wont be a sequal or third part to the 'Zero' series. I am really happy to know the story came to an end (or did it?) now. Thank you for the amazing experiences I had playing those 3 parts.\n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1477840541, "timestamp_updated": 1477840541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0,

Being a fan of the Zero Escape series I kept on hearing that they wouldn't come out with a 3rd installement due to poor sales, not enough interest, etc. \nSo when I was thinking of 999 and Virtues Last Reward one day, like I do. I decided to look up their page, and I was pleasently surprised to find that the third instalement showed up on Steam a month prior. I bought it right then and there. \n\nUnfortunetly I was a little dissapointed with the art style they went for, breaking a little of my nostagia. But that's okay, This was the 3rd of the series! I was so happy when I saw Sigma's arms blown off thinking \"That's how it happens!!!!\". But the excitement quickly faded, the depth of the conclusion was lacking. I was expecting a more, but I got fluff... \n\nI in no way regret buying it or playing it...

I recommend this game if you like puzzles, dark themes, scientific/mathematical/psychological theories, and above all, time travel. As others have mentioned, if you are interested in playing this game without having played the first two, I think they definitely should be played (or watched via Let's Play) first.\n\nZTD provides what I think is a fitting conclusion to the series. Sure, it could have used another hour or two of gameplay and cutscenes, but there clearly were budget and, well, time restraints.  This is the most flawed of the 3 games, but it is still head and shoulders above many other games I have played. ZTD made me laugh, cry, and think. It has what I think are some of the best moments in the series, and it justifies the 3D graphics, much like how the previous two games utilize their 3DS/VN mechanics in interesting ways.\n\nThere's a lot of detail put into this game that I didn't realize until re-playing and checking out trivia. Overall, despite the shortcomings, there are many things I love about this game: cast, writing, VA, music, the fragment system, humor, puzzles, decisions, emotional moments, etc. While I think 999 has the best climax and art design and VLR has the best plot twists and dialogue, ZTD has, in my opinion, the best emotional moments and atmosphere. \n\nIn terms of my enjoyment and investment, I'd rank the game as VLR > ZTD >>>> 999.", "timestamp_created": 1476417076, "timestamp_updated": 1479786446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26021354": {"recommendationid": "26021354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118736505", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476478906}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved the first one,\nAdored the second.\nLike the third\n\nIt's pretty good, but i have to admit that the second one left more of an impression.

It's good, serviceable but it lacks a strong, choking moment to really last in my mind, like the alice or the submarine ending of the first... It's good but the 3d didn't had much going for it because of how simple it looked, cranky animation, funny sound effect (i mean the sound for crouching, sitting or touching the ground is the same as when a dead body hit the floor,  not really the same thing) It's a good game but i will think of it more as a passage to a different style of zero escape that with time will get their strengh back.

I thought 999 was a stellar game, and although VLR wasn't as good in my mind, it was still great in its own right. However, it seems like a lot of puzzling creative decisions were made for ZTD, losing what made the other games special.\n\nTo get surface level stuff out of the way, the presentation is poor. The switch from classic visual novel static-models-and-text-boxes to fully animated cutscenes was a bold move, but it ultimately didn't pay off. I understand that the team working on this game had a tight budget, but it doesn't excuse laughable, janky animation and terrible lip syncing. A better alternative would have been to stick with what worked in the previous two games. Also, sound design left much to be desired; sound effects were very poor. In fact, the sound effects might not have been jarring in a traditional visual novel format, but the juxtaposition of animated cutscenes and garbage audio clips was annoying. As far as the OST is concerned, Hosoe's work is great as always.\n\n\"But,\" I hear you say. \"This is a visual novel after all, so none of the above should be a huge problem as long as the story impresses, right?\" And you would be right in saying that, except the writing in this game is a huge letdown. See, in 999 the story was grounded - the pseudoscientific, out-there plot points were limited to [spoiler]the morphogenetic field and a little bit of time loop screwery[/spoiler]. And I thought those plot points were great. However, too many cooks spoil the broth. With each subsequent iteration of the series, Uchikoshi (director and lead writer) tries to one up the last, adding more and more crazy plot points as if it makes the game better somehow. In ZTD, there's [spoiler]time loops, timeline jumping, teleportation, MIND HACKING, 4th wall breaking?, and more[/spoiler]. Christ, I feel like I'm watching one of those bad soap operas where the evil twin brother comes back from the dead to have sex with the main characters' wife ([spoiler]and don't worry, there are plenty of \"Suprise! I'm related to you!\" moments in the game[/spoiler]). It all comes off as contrived and unnecessary. From this muddled plot comes a few plot holes that were enough to take me out of the game as well as a bunch of unanswered questions that the first two games set up. When I'm playing a game like this, I like to have a notepad I fill with questions I have about the plot in the hopes I can cross them out when they are revealed. Needless to say, there were many things in that notebook that weren't crossed out, either by the plot omitting them entirely or simply not explaining them all that well. Oh, and don't forget about [spoiler]Delta's   C O M P L E X   M O T I V E S[/spoiler].Furthermore, in the previous games, the characters would talk about studies or other little stories that would play into the plot as a whole ([spoiler]think Ice9 or Schrodinger's cat[/spoiler]). In ZTD, the stories were there as philosophical thought experiments, which I really, really enjoyed, but they never really played into the plot.\n\nIn the end, I don't think this game was worth my time.

Expect a lot of text and movies and fairly little gameplay. All the gameplay is in the form of dialogue decisions and 'escape rooms'. So clearly not a regular game already.\nSecond, this game is the conclusion to the Zero Escape series and most of the story will not make sense without playing the first two games, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. \n\nIf you're somehow still interested after all this, you've got a real gem on your hands here. The story of this game is both more convoluted, more messed up, more ridiculous and more awesome than the previous two games (which I would say are already 'pretty out there'), it is also incredibly satisfying to figure everything out by yourself or with friends while streaming. The story even teaches you some fun historical facts that might interest you.\n\nAnd then there are the escape rooms. These are definitely easier than in 999 and VLR, but they are still so much fun to do and, again, satisfying to complete.\n\nThe one downside is the way the story-branching of the game works. Since you probably want to learn everything once you're invested enough, the \"branching\" is not much of a choice anymore; you're going to check out all outcomes because you're curious. And rightly so, since there are some clever hidden endings hidden here and there as well.\n\nAll in all, you're looking to enjoy about 20 hours of a really good book, since there's not so much a lot of gaming to be done here. But if you're into that sort of thing, go buy this immediately (but first play the other 2 games, you won't regret it).", "timestamp_created": 1475435875, "timestamp_updated": 1475435875, "voted_up":

The story is interesting, if you don\u2019t mind a little crazy. Most of the puzzles are tightly designed to leave little room for not being able to find the next step, but occasionally they can frustrate with an exceedingly inconspicuous clue or item placement. The Transporter room is an especially odd duck in terms of difficulty, but that\u2019s technically \u201cend game\u201d (regardless of how early you CAN play it). \n\nI was unsold on the \u201cfragments\u201d mechanic (which allows you to play sequences of the game in almost any order you want to), and still think I would have enjoyed the more traditional Zero Escape structure more, but once you get to the \u201cevent horizon\u201d and all of the pieces begin to fall into place, it\u2019s very satisfying\u2026 just don\u2019t take extended time off from this game before you complete it, especially if you\u2019re new to the series; forgetting details will lessen the impact of certain revelations. \n\nI do wish there were a harder difficulty option for series veterans that concealed additional information and made entering ALL of the \u201cdecisions\u201d manual and required you to keep notes in lieu of a log being available\u2026 but that\u2019s ridiculous and not useful to someone who needs to read a review to know if they\u2019d want to play this.\n\n[b] About the series [/b] : This series started under the pretense of a \"locked room\" murder mystery, but at this point in the series its crazy flag is flying proud immediately. I wouldn't say it's absolutely vital you've played the other two in order to enjoy this one (like some of the other purist reviews here), but it's highly recommended that you do because they're both great games and it's doubtful you will care much about some of the characters without that foreknowledge. The only real downside to having played both of the previous entries is that you will likely figure out a lot of the \u201cmysteries\u201d here a lot sooner than the game intends that you do.\n\nThe story is less tight than 999 (which, like I mentioned, has the pretense of a more traditional locked room story with some weird philosophy for the first 75% of the game before going off the deep end) but is way more cohesive than VLR, which is probably the height of this series\u2019 insanity. There\u2019s a similarly \u201ccheap\u201d revelation toward the end of this game to the ultimate identity of \u201cZero\u201d was in VLR, but it\u2019s less egregious than that one was in my opinion.\n\nPlaying Virtue's Last Reward is arguably a lot more important than playing 999 if you want to understand the PLOT in this one, though.

I was super excited for the conclusion to the trilogy, as it seemed as if this game wouldn't be made due to poor sales. After the long wait, I can safely say it lived up to my expectations.\n\nSome plot points (and holes) seemed really strange to me coming from playing the other two in the series, but I could overlook them pretty easily considering the rest of the game is excellent. Also, it feels as if a lot of the BGM is reused from the other two games, but the music is good and there are some new tracks that I really liked as well.\n\nI'm still not sure how I feel about the ending (it was a little weird to me), but I personally feel as if a game is about the entire experience, not just the ending.\n\nIt was a very enjoyable game, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who may be on the fence about buying it. Just make sure to play the other two games in the series first, or you may be a bit lost on some of the plot and miss out on backstory with some returning characters.\n\nThe first game in the series is 999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, and the second is Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. 999 is available on Nintendo DS and as a visual novel with the gameplay elements removed on iOS.

Where to even begin. It's a rather [i]complex[/i] game. ;)\nBefore you even read this, I really would reccomend playing the earlier games, 999 (9 hours, 9 doors, 9 persons) and VLR (Virtues Last Reward). Although they say that you can play this game without having played the others, the story is going to make a whole lot more sense to you and have a lot more impact on you if you have played the other two. There were certainly a few things revealed to me in this game which I probably wouldn't have been so shocked by if I had not played the other two. If you can't get your hands on 999, try VLR at least. I would hate for you to enjoy this game and then go on to play the others afterwards, having learned things from this game that you wouldn't be able to unsee!\n\nOnto the review...\n\nOnce again Uchikoshi has crafted a wonderful narrative for us. If you are unfamiliar to the series, the gist is that 9 people get trapped somewhere (this time in a mars mission test site) and have to figure out why they are there and how they can get out. While 999 and VLR have slightly more linear storylines (you'll understand what I mean if you have played this series before), ZTD introduces fragments, short parts of the story which are given to you without you knowing what order they are in. Part of the game is trying to piece these parts together to see what happens when and what choices influence what. I have to say that I do prefer the more structured ways of navigating in 999 and VLR, but the fragments were fun because if a part of the story was getting tricky or boring you could always try something else. ZTD brings together main characters from both previous games as well as a few new extras, and the story is really riveting. I was always jumping for chances to get back on my laptop and find out more. My only complaints would be sometimes that it is hard to figure out what needs to happen for a shard to unlock, which can leave you feeling a bit helpless and stuck. And also,I won't say too much on this but all three games have a twist of some kind in their stories, and I feel like the twist in ZTD was a little cheap.\n\nThe game is reaaaalllly good. But don't get it if you arent into novels or very story focused games. Long novel sections are contrasted with escape the room type puzzles, and ZTD sports some of the best puzzles in the franchise. This game has shifted to cinematics to show the action happening rather than being inside the head of a character and having them described to you like in the previous games. I think this defintely was a good choice for this game, as the descisions you have to make are really hightened by being able to see the action in front of you rather than just imagining it. However, the animations are *not* great. I can't complain too much considering that this game almost never happened, but they aren't wonderful. I always found the mouth movements to be a little off, but it's a pretty minor thing all in all. Be warned though, it is a lot more graphic than the previous games - you see the nasty things happening rather than just having them described to you. I played through the Japanese audio as that was my preference, voice acting was very good. Have seen a little of the English dub and while it isn't bad, I think some of the characters are defo better in Japanese. But do try both!\n\nAll in all, I think it was a good end(?) for the trilogy. Though a little more pricey than previous games, I was willing to pay knowing that it goes towards a wonderful development team. If you have played the previous games, I think ZTD is a must-play. If you haven't played the others yet, please do! They are coming to steam soon but there are other ways to play it.

This trilogy is made to be played one after the other, with everything fresh on your mind, making the experience completely amazing.\n\nGAMEPLAY - 8\n\nAs a visual novel, it goes exactly as you'd think: walls of text to be read, and lots of options that change what happens next. The unique part of the Zero Escape series is the fact that you can \"jump\" from one story to another, and instantly see what happens if you'd chosen the other option, so no remorse in choosing the unethical answer. Hooray!\nAs an Escape the Room, the game is mostly simple, but now and then throwing an extremely complicated puzzle on the players face out of nowhere (I'm looking at you, Transporter Room). I felt like Virtue's last reward had a better balance of dificulty overall.\n\nSTORY -  9\n\nBeing a visual novel, if the story was bad, the game would be bad. fortunately, that's not the case. The plot twists were really well made and unexpected, and the game did a fine job explaining what VLR didn't. I did feel that some plots were abandoned (Kyle and ? from VLR, for example), but there were not any blatantly obvious holes. That's the advantage of having an extremely complicated story full of time travel and paradoxes, I guess. \nAgain, however, I'll warn new players to wait and play ZTD ONLY AFTER playing the other two games, as both of them will be on Steam soon enough. This game references the other ones A LOT, and although you end up understanding some stuff, the story is not remotely as rich as it really is if you don't know anything about Zero Escape. Including the inside jokes. So go play 999 and VLR right meow. \n\nCHARACTERS - 9.5\n\nThe game gets the two likeable main characters from 999, the two likeable main characters from VLR, and put them all together to wrap things up. And then introduce more likeable characters. Joyful. \nI'd say the cast of ZTD outshines the ones from VLR and 999, as I pretty much liked all of them (except Eric, he's an idiot). They all have their distinct personality and you end up caring about them. Even though they just keep dying. Over and over again. \n\nOVERALL - 8,8\n\nI simply loved this trilogy. Extremely well made and it should really deserve more attention than it does. It's outraging to think that this game almost didn't exist because the producers didn't have the money to do it. I think every penny I've put into it was really well spent.

Daher ist es ratsam vorher die ersten beiden Teile zu spielen, diese werden wahrscheinlich in naher Zukunft ebenfalls auf den PC geportet. Das f\u00fchrt mich zu meinem n\u00e4chsten Kritikpunkt. Die Zero Escape Spiele sind f\u00fcr mobile Konsolen und nicht f\u00fcr den PC konzipiert worden, daher sollte man keine zu hohen Erwartungen an die Grafik haben. Die Animationen sind teilweise ein wenig zu schlicht so dass man ein wenig aus der Atmosph\u00e4re, welche das Spiel zu erzeugen versucht hinausgeworfen wird. Besonders deutlich wird dies bei den Animationen f\u00fcr die Haare. Diese bewegen sich teilweise ruckartig und ohne Grund und ragen Teilweise durch Gegenst\u00e4nde oder K\u00f6rper hindurch. Ein weiterer negativer Faktor ist, dass die Steuerung nicht optimal ist. Man kann die Tastatur zwar benutzen um Texte und Zahlen einzugeben, allerdings ersetzt sie dabei nur die Tasten einer mobilen Konsole, dh. dass man jedes Zeichen einzeln anw\u00e4hlen und best\u00e4tigen muss. \u00c4hnlich ist es auch bei den Notizen, die man sich innerhalb des Spiels machen kann. Hier muss man mit der Maus alles aufmalen. Aber das meiner Meinung nach gr\u00f6\u00dfte Problem ist, dass man aufgrund des komplexen Aufbaus sehr leicht im Spiel stecken bleiben kann, was sehr frustrierend ist. Dies liegt vor allem daran, dass manche Ereignisse zuf\u00e4llig passieren und man Abschnitte daher mehrmals spielen muss um das gew\u00fcnschte Ereignis zuf\u00e4llig auszul\u00f6sen. Bei anderen Abschnitten kann es passieren, dass man zum Anfang des Spiels zur\u00fcckkehren muss, um Abschnitte in einer bestimmten Reihenfolge zu wiederholen. Aber trotz all dieser Makel kann ich das Spiel nur Empfehlen. Es erz\u00e4hlt eine massive, spannende Story, bei der man sich stets mit den Charakteren verbunden f\u00fchlt. Die R\u00e4tsel sind fordernd und abwechslungsreich und diejenigen die die vorherigen Teile gespielt haben werden umso mehr auf ihre Kosten kommen. Je l\u00e4nger man spielt, desto mehr wird einem das Spiel gefallen. Ich kann leider nicht viel mehr \u00fcber das Spiel selbst sagen, da man es am besten genie\u00dfen kann, wenn man so wenig, wie m\u00f6glich \u00fcber seinen Inhalt wei\u00df.\n\nFazit: Das Spiel hat viele Macken, welche aber von dem einzigartigen Erlebnis, welches es bietet meilenweit in den Schatten gestellt werden.", "timestamp_created": 1473325042, "timestamp_updated": 1473325042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546329", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25397820": {"recommendationid": "25397820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003832295", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473196883}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend you play the two previous games before this one, as it is by far the weakest title in the series.

As to whether I think you should play it, it depends on whether you've played the earlier games.\n\nIf you have, then you should definitely finish the series.  I wasn't completely sold on the art style of the game when I was looking to buy it, but I have to admit it grew on me as the game went on and by no means was a negative.  The room puzzle difficulty falls somewhere between the first two games.  Significantly easier than the 2nd game, maybe a touch more difficult than the first.  The addition of some plot puzzles (answers needed to advance the story) is welcome, and I think they hit the right difficulty here.  Some are just hard enough to feel some accomplishment for figuring them out while being just shy of getting frustrated and looking up the answer on-line.  I think the storyline was on-par and maybe slightly better than the previous games though the zero for this game isn't as good as the one from VLR.  Ultimately I think this was a significantly better game than 999, and slightly worse than VLR... though maybe I didn't like it as much because I miss the rabbit puns more than you will.  \n\nIf you haven't played the first two...  Wait to play this one, and go play the first two.  Really, it's a wonderfully written series with twisting plot lines and great memorable characters.  While 999 shows a bit of its age, VLR was easily the best game I played on the Vita, and good enough to make me go out and buy a DS so I could play 999.  Hopefully you wont have to, and they will bring both games to Steam.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1472826970, "timestamp_updated": 1472826970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25301573": {"recommendationid": "25301573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271318651", "num_games_owned": 734, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487745541}, "language": "schinese", "review": "ACG\u6c49\u5316\u7ec4\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u7ec8\u4e8e\u51fa\u5566\uff0c\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\uff0c\u611f\u8c22\u6c49\u5316\u7ec4\uff01\n\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u9996\u5148\u6253\u5f00\u6e38\u620f\u5b89\u88c5\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u4e00\u822c\u662f\u5728Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Zero Escape\u8fd9\u4e2a\u76ee\u5f55\u4e0b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u91cc\u9762\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb00000000.cfsi\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u628a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6587\u4ef6\u62d6\u5230\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u4e0a\u6c49\u5316\u5c31\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\uff0c\u4e4b\u540e\u5728Steam\u91cc\u7684\u6781\u9650\u8131\u51fa3\u4e0a\u6309\u53f3\u952e\u9009\u62e9\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u628a\u5c5e\u6027\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8bed\u8a00\u9009\u4e3a\u65e5\u8bed\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u6e38\u620f\u540e\u5c31\u662f\u6c49\u5316\u7248\u4e86\u3002\u53e6\u5916ACG\u6c49\u5316\u7ec4\u8fd8\u5f04\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd8\u539f\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u6c49\u5316\u7248\u8fd8\u539f\u6210\u539f\u7248\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n\u539f\u5e16\u5730\u5740\uff1a[url=http://bbs.tgbus.com/thread-6435537-1-1.html]http://bbs.tgbus.com/thread-6435537-1-1.html\t [/url]\n\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u5730\u5740\uff1a[url=https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dFE4Y1j]https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dFE4Y1j\t [/url]\n\u8fd8\u539f\u8865\u4e01\u5730\u5740\uff1a[url=https://pan.baidu.com/s/1boM0vDl]https://pan.baidu.com/s/1boM0vDl\t [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1472809611, "timestamp_updated": 1472809651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 143, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.921062", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25300323": {"recommendationid": "25300323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060844392", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472800623}, "language": "english", "review": "No funyarinpa's.... but still a 9.3/10 (.3 because Junpei was sarcastic a few times( \n\nNote: Please for the love of Funyarinpa play or watch the 1st and 2nd game.

I found myself just jumping around following the timeline instead of figuring out the story on my own. \n- Lack of Funyanarinpa\n- Cannot friendzone Akane \n- Important objects are sometimes sparkle so you find things too easily... which is a shame.\n- Animations for characters where.. lazy I did a ton of animation a few years ago.

Movement, UGHH THIS BUGGED ME. So lazy so so so lazy. I know its out of their comfort zone but c'mon a no life scrub like me can do and have done better.\n\nNeutral\n- Akane is kinda likable... 999 Akane is better.\n- I like Siggy, Junpei, Carlos, Q (shhh I know his name > - >), and Dianna.\n- Mira didn't strike me as interesting and her character devolpment didn't phase me.\n- Akane didn't develop, if anything she stayed the same but they removed the things that made Akane great. She was cute and shy, she could speak her mind if somebody said the wrong thing, you could interact with Akane and choose to Friendzone her or hit on her like there was no tomorrow.\n- The thing says something along the line of \"If you didn't play the second or first game it's fine you'll get the story\" Yeah you'll get the story but miss out on like 99.95% of everything that just went down. Hell I played the 1st and 2nd game multiple times and I found myself lost at parts. I found myself feeling like theres a hole where my favorite characters were. Junpei is still a sarcastic asshole at times, but not as much as before (which I get he's a man now). Akane I feel is just there to make Junpei look good.

I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It's painful to watch, It's painful to listen to the bad voice acting, and the \"payoff\" at the end of the game felt contrived and flat.\n\nI have loved the prior two Zero Escape games, completing them both 100%. This, however, is not the same quality as the prior two on the 3DS.\n\nGraphics - 3/10 Horrible character 3D animations. There is no motion capture movement here, it's all via stiff animation techniques. It felt like a game from the early 1990's before motion capture was implemented. If a scene is too difficult to animate? Show a picture of the ceiling, or the wall and play a sound effect. Then show the animatronic characters again. The artists did a decent job with most of the models themselves, except with the dead fish-eyes everyone has. The one really bad character model is Mira. She's supposed to look sexy, with her oversized chest. Unfortunately she looks like a teenage boy's drawing of a hooker. Because all of the characters are more cartoon than real, it just looks sad. This cartoon isn't sexy, just comically bad to the point of being unintentionally funny. Overall, I think the game may look better on the low-resolution 3DS vs the PC. The PC just exacerbates the low quality graphics and empty environments.\n\nSound - 3/10 English voice-overs are beyond cringe-worthy. They don't fit the characters at all. And the dialog doesn't match the emotion, or lack of emotion. Junpei sounds awful, and Zero's English voice is too low to hear. I ended up changing the voice overs to Japanese, who did a great job providing much needed drama, with English subtitles. Sound effects were often amateurish, sounding out of place and just wrong.\n\nDialog: This has always been a problem with the Zero Escape series. Most of the time the dialog is okay with the occasionally painful banter. This game is mostly cringe-worthy. There are several times when a conversation is hijacked by a character so the science-fiction explanations are presented to the player. It's also common for characters to repeat confirmations to ensure the play knows what to do next. (Yes, you can skip any dialog IF you enable the feature in the options menu.) Eric, one of the most irrational and irritating characters in the game, inspired me to find this solution. Another problem is unnecessary cursing when it didn't make sense. Again, it's an attempt by the developer to sound more mature--only to end up sounding like a 13-year old who's angry with the world.\n\nGameplay is divided into two styles - story and room escape. Considering how badly the animations were, and how slowly the dialog was going, I often skipped people's dialog. I would then click the Dialog Review button and read it instead. This was much faster, as the pacing sometimes ground to a halt. I really wanted to enjoy the experience and kept looking for a silver lining--I didn't find one. Instead, I simply got bored with it.\n\nThe room escapes kept me going. None of the rooms were terribly difficult, though I was hoping for a bigger challenge.\n\nThe biggest change for the series is how fragmented the storyline is. It makes sense near the end of the game why it was done this way, but it makes for a very disjointed experience. I didn't care for it. Especially 3/4 of the way through the game--you'll get stuck. The flowchart provided typically shows exclamation marks (!), but there won't be any. Because I don't play \"Find the Pixel\" to prod a game to continue the gameplay, I checked online. It turned out to be a choice I had not considered.\n\nI feel very let down by this game. I had such a great time with the prior games on the 3DS. The 2D graphics, while basic, were charming and required more of my imagination. The 3D models and environment felt like it was too much for the studio. A feeling that carried into the end of the game.\n\nSpeaking of the end of the game... No spoilers here -- The story scene at the end of the game simply stops when you don't expect it. The game then starts rolling the credits that you CANNOT skip. Bad move. Unless you look for them, you'd miss the epilogue notes for the various characters.\n\nAs I said at the start of this review: I cannot recommend this game to anyone. It's painful to watch, It's painful to listen to the bad voice acting, and the \"payoff\" at the end of the game felt contrived and flat.

ZTD is okay, but considering the rest of the series, that's probably the worst thing a Zero Escape title can be.\n\n[b]Long Version:[/b] Unlike the other games in the series, ZTD is not a visual novel. It's a series of long cutscenes, interspersed with the usual puzzle rooms and choices. This method of narrative presentation baffles me, as it essentially removes the charming internal monologue of the POV characters while accentuating just how much standing around and talking there is in these games.\n\nCutscenes are unskippable when you first view them. Unfortunately, this goes by a fragment-by-fragment basis, so if three fragments have the exact same tutorial cutscene... then you're gonna have to sit through it every single time.\n\nThe modular method of storytelling is a huge missed opportunity and only serves to drag down the pacing of the story. The very basics of the scenario have to be repeated in unskippable cutscenes at the beginning of each fragment. Presumably, the meta reason for this was so players wouldn't get confused or feel compelled to play the fragments in a certain order, but after the third time you hear somebody explain the memory wipe drug, you start to see the problem.\n\nThere's no incentive to try and make sense of how the timeline fits together, because characters have their memories wiped at the end of nearly every fragment so it ultimately doesn't mean jack shit. It's also blatantly displayed on a flowchart. What could have been a fascinating storytelling lense is instead one of the game's biggest flaws.\n\nI'm not gonna touch on the story's actual content much because I'm trying to keep this spoiler free, but the new characters are nothing interesting, and if you're familiar with the director's work you probably already know what their Character Twists are just by looking at them. Also Junpei's bizarre personality change is so cheesy, it wouldn't be out of place in the film noir episode of Sam & Max.\n\nI am bitter.\n\nLife is simply unfair.", "timestamp_created": 1472214006, "timestamp_updated": 1472214006, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25138505": {"recommendationid": "25138505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168577618", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1075, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471900846}, "language": "english", "review": "If you expect this to be like the previous games, don't.

This is the largest timeflow chart I've ever seen, with so many decisions and corresponding consequences. really had a great time going through all these pieces of \"clips\" to find clues of the truth.\n\nThe story is fantastic, with all those vivid characters and thrilling plots. As a sci-fi fan, I enjoyed going from a timeline to another, experiencing the \"butterfly effect\".  I actually solved all the room escapes when my game time reached 18 hours, but end up spending another 10 hours watching those clips, so that I can get the full view of the story. The Biggest Puzzle in this story is not one of those room escapes, but the STORY ITSELF.\n\nThe room escapes are challenging yet interesting. Get ready for a hard fight, since a few brain teasers are involved. I enjoyed the sense of satisfactory after each success. \n\nOne thing that makes me feel disappointed is, that I realized that I've spent 20+ hours on this game these days. God I wish I were able to Transport to the past... 12/10.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1471874247, "timestamp_updated": 1471874247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25070000": {"recommendationid": "25070000", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979168545", "num_games_owned": 449, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490514977}, "language": "english", "review": "After finishing Virtue's Last Reward, one may start to question whether or not the writers could ever conclude or even make every moving piece work.

This game did just that.\n\nThis game most certainly has it's flaws. And were it any other stlye of game I'd probably give it a much lower rating, but this game is a Visual Novel at heart, and we need to remember that it didn't get a huge amount of funding.\n\nLet's talk about the good points first:\n\nSTORY:\nThe story for Zero Excape: Zero Time Dilemma is a continuation of the first two games: 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors (Nintendo DS), and Virtue's Last Reward (Nintendo 3DS and Playstation Vita). 9 people who had initally signed up for a government experiment testing whether people could live on mars or not, are captured by the mysterious \"Zero\" and forced to Decide whether the result of a coinflip would land on Red or Blue. IF they choose correctly: They free. If they choose incorrectly, though, they have to take part in Zero's Decision game until at least 6 of them are dead.\n\nThe story is basically what got me hooked on the game, it's extremely story-driven; as were the previous two games. It does get a little confusing at times though. 9/10\n\nGAMEPLAY/CONTROLS:\nThe game is more of a Visual Novel with Room Escape sequences every now and again. The controls are what you'd expect from a Room Escape game really, though it seems like it would be much easier to control with a controller. With a mouse I found myself accidentally clicking things when screen transitions happened, or being unable to drag the camera the way I wanted. With a controller those things would be nullified. Also the in game buttons have controller buttons shown on them, but no Keyboard Hotkeys.\n\nThere are also times where the game doesn't tell you if you're missing something you need, so you have to either manually search for the part you're missing, or google it.\n\nOverall, it gave me some frustrations every now and then, but nothing major. 8/10\n\nSOUND:\nThe music in this game is very, very good. It uses the same music from the previous two games, which brings back memories and can make you feel what you felt at those times. They music is also very good at evoking emotions, it's constructed in such a way that when the game wants you to feel tense, happy, sad, etc. You will.\n\nPersonally I didn't try out the English voice acting, as usually it's fairly bad. English speaking people never seem to get inflections correct, and things that should sound one way end up sounding really cartoony, or just completely different. I may try out a few scenes with the english language on just to update this review, but it's not certain. As for the Japanese voice acting, I can't fault it really. A lot of the words that are said are in English though, and Japanese pronunciation of English words can be pretty lackluster. The subtitles also don't help, as they're subtitling the English dialogue, not the Japanese dialogue. This means that some translations are incorrect, and the way you read something might be said and toned completely differently.\n\nOverall, the music is amazing, as is the japanese dialogue, held back only by English words and the subtitling. 9/10\n\nGRAPHICS:\nThe graphics in this game are fairly basic. The character models have obviously been worked on harder, or longer that the rest of the game models, they feel somewhat out of place at times when compared with their surroundings, or other 3D aspects/items. A lot of the textures look (and are) flat in a lot of cases, which leads to some things looking slightly weird and low rez.\n\nThe animation in the game is.. pretty bad. The characters move stiffly, or not at all, and the lip synching is terrible in both Japanese and English languages. it never quite matches what the characters are saying. The animations basically just feel very rushed.\n\nOverall, I'd say the game lookes fine visually. The animations are sometimes painful to watch and the textures look flat and drab. 5/10\n\nIn conclusion, despite it's flaws I think it's a great game, especially so if you've played the two previous.\n\nIn total I'd score this game 85/100", "timestamp_created": 1471609714, "timestamp_updated": 1471609714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24994725": {"recommendationid": "24994725", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982938152", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 949, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467914426}, "language": "english", "review": "C O M P L E X\nM O T I V E S", "timestamp_created": 1471535565, "timestamp_updated": 1471535565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24980786": {"recommendationid": "24980786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053844275", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493825127}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, it's the third Zero Escape game.  In case you haven't played the past games, it's still the same basic premise as the first two games of the series: You and 8 other people find yourself locked in a building, playing a game being run by someone calling themselves \"Zero\".  Much like Saw, (with Zero mimicking the role of Jigsaw, obviously) this game has many deadly \"traps\" in it, which you must avoid while solving puzzles.  However, the Zero Escape series turns this into a sort of visual novel/choose your own adventure game, with cryptic riddles and puzzles in the style of escape-the-room games.  Combine this with a story containing time-travel, moral dilemmas, and stange science and psycology tidbits, and you get this...  But is it good?\n\nThe first two games?  Absolutely.  The third game, Zero Time Dilemma?  Not so much.\n\nI don't know where this whole \"you can play this game without playing the first two\" mentality is coming from.  Having played all three in order, I can tell you that's absolutely false.  I mean yeah, you can [i] technically [/i] play them out of order, but you can also [i] technically [/i] watch the seasons of Breaking Bad out of order too.  That doesn't make it better, though.  The other two games will be coming to Steam though (although nobody knows when), and I HIGHLY recommend them, regardless of whether you play this one or not.  I'd wait to purchase this until playing both of those.\n\nHowever, if you've already played those, or if you really just don't care about order, then I'd still wait until purchasing this.  Why?  Well, here's the pros and cons...\n\nPros:\n-Voice acting is good, for the most part.  There are some parts where it doesn't quite work, but overall it's okay.\n-Puzzle design is, again, good for the most part.  Yes, just like the voice acting, the puzzles have some good and bad elements.  They aren't as hard as \"Virtue's Last Reward\"s puzzles, but definitely more difficult than 999's.  Some of them are just downright confusing, though.  Hopefully you like converting between base-10 and base-13...  If you don't know what that means, you're gonna have trouble.\n-References to past games.  Maybe there's too much of it, but it's nice to check up on characters and see what they've been up to.\n\nNot too many pros, but now it's time for now..\n\nCons:\n-Plot.  It's all over the place.  I get what they were going for, but it feels less like the past games and more like The Matrix.  And not in a good way.\n-Music.  I think almost all of it was reused.  If there were any new tracks, I barely noticed them, which I think speaks for itself.  I'm not saying the music in here was bad, but it's not used well.\n-Animation.  This is a big one.  If you don't like how the trailers look, you'll like it even less when you get in the game.  Animations are stiff and clunky, and at times they're outright laughable.  Not exactly what you want to go for when you're trying to portray a deep story.  I have no idea why they went with this style over what they had in the past.\n-Characters.  Two of them are inherently unlikeable [spoiler] (Eric and Mira) [/spoiler] and the rest are either one-dimensional, or returning characters from past games.  They don't get along well, either.  Plus, you don't get to really ever see them interact with each other, since for 95% of the game, they're stuck in groups of 3.\n\nAnd now the big one:\n-Structure.\n\nIt's rare a game has such trouble structurally.  Normally, a game just tells you its story, and then everyone happily moves on.  But noooooo...  not ZTD.  ZTD uses the \"fragment\" system, and WOW it's a mess.  (Again, why couldn't they just use what they already had!?)  Instead, the 9 characters are split into 3 groups of 3, and each group has their own screen of seperate \"fragments\", in which you play through the story somewhat anachronistically. In a fragment, you see the teammates of your choice go through a puzzle, make a choice in a \"decision game\", and then have their memories wiped and you get booted out back to the fragment selection screen.  Oh, what's that?  You're confused as to why their memories get wiped?  Yep, me too.  I understand why after beating the game, but only slightly.  Plus, the game introduces and explains this concept about as well as I just did here in this review.  In fact, I probably did it better.\n\nHowever, the BIGGEST problem?  It's the decision game.  Most of them take the form of a moral dilemma or probablity theory question.  For example, one decision game asks you if you want to shoot a gun with a 50% chance of firing at one character, in order to save another.  Another game requires you to know how the monty hall problem works.  However, tell me this...  How can your choices mean anything if you can simply reset and try again, until you get the result you want?  The game tries its best to make you feel bad for certain choices, but ultimately it can't, because it never locks you into anything.  Plus, you pretty much have to see all the results of all the choices anyways, so at the end of it all it basically becomes meaningless.  \"Oh, sure, this character died and now I'm being framed as a murderer, but it doesn't matter because I had to make this choice anyways to move the story along.\"\n\nSpeaking of moving the story along...  There was one point I got stuck because I didn't do some specific thing in the beginning of the game.  Actually, I HAD done it, but it didn't count because I didn't do it the specific way it wanted.  And there was no clue I needed to do this either, no mention that it would change anything.  If anything, I had been given evidence that it [i] wouldn't [/i] change anything.  I ended up using a walkthrough to figure this out, but I didn't use it for any other part of the game.  For those curious, the part was [spoiler] voting each team off in the decontamination rooms [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, the story just doesn't come together in a good way.  It resembles something more of an action movie, like The Matrix, or X-Men or something.  It doesn't feel satisfying, and just leaves you with a sour feeling at the end of all of it.\n\nSorry, but I wouldn't recommend this.  It just doesn't feel right.  I WOULD however recommend:\n-The first game, \"9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors\".  Currently on the Nintendo DS, but it should hopefully come to Steam in not too long.  Pick it up then.\n-The second game, \"Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward\".  Currently on Nintendo 3ds, and PS Vita, but should also come to Steam sometime.  I can't recommend this one higher.  It's fantastic.\n\n\"It's time for the Decision Game.

It is, but please, PLEASE do not play it without having played the second one, or at least watched a let's play of it. All 3 are connected, and while you can play each one separately, you miss out a lot, especially on this one. A LOT.\nThe first one, 999, is great as well, but for me virtue's last reward is the best game I've ever played and is a must if you're going to play this one. I'm sure the emotions you'll go through once you see or realise some of the plot twists cannot be compared to what you'll feel if you've played the last game.(that goes for all of the series. Fingers crossed they're already working on making the other 2 available on steam at some point)\n\nAbout the game itself now, it has a few small flaws but was generally great. Compared to the previous one, which I consider a masterpiece, the puzzles are not as challenging(I have to say, there are too many hints, I'd rather have the option to choose easy/hard and be able to figure more stuff alone), yet some were still pretty interesting, the plot was weird, but it was again pretty well written. One thing that felt bad was the duration of the game, it was quite shorter than the previous one. The animation also felt strange.\n\nThe series' main characteristics, though, are there.

Dieses Spiel hat mich allerdings dazu gebracht, das auf jeden Fall nachholen zu wollen, sobald diese auf dem PC erscheinen.\n\n\nZur Story:\nDie Handlung beginnt damit, dass neun Charaktere in einer Zelle aufwachen und vom \"gro\u00dfen B\u00f6sen\" mit einer Vorliebe f\u00fcr Latein zu einem Spiel herausgefordert werden. Bereits hier wird die Wichtigkeit getroffener Entscheidungen klar.\nSchlie\u00dflich beginnt ein grausames Spiel. Die Charaktere werden in drei Gruppen a drei Personen aufgeteilt und in getrennten Bunkern untergebracht. Die einzige M\u00f6glichkeit, zu entkommen: Es m\u00fcssen sechs Leute sterben. So werden die Charaktere durch unterschiedliche, teils sehr gef\u00e4hrliche Situationen gejagt, bis wieder ein Fragment abgeschlossen ist.\nEin Fragment? Richtig gelesen. Die Story wird nicht linear erz\u00e4hlt, sondern in einzelnen Schnipseln, bei denen man zuerst nicht wei\u00df, was vorher geschehen ist. Da den Charakteren regelm\u00e4\u00dfig die letzten Ereignisse aus dem Ged\u00e4chtnis gel\u00f6scht werden, sind auch sie erst einmal ratlos. Wenn allerdings ein Fragment mal nur mit zwei statt drei Charakteren startet, beginnt man schon mit einem gewissen Klo\u00df im Hals.\nDabei w\u00e4ren wir auch schon bei der Stimmung und egal welche Stimmung das Spiel vermitteln will, es schafft es recht gut. Der Soundtrack ist gut, die Charaktere vielleicht optisch nicht f\u00fcr jeden was, aber die Gespr\u00e4che und Gedanken f\u00fchren einen gut in die Psyche der einzelnen Charaktere, sei es nun der zynische Junpei, der labile Eric oder das seltsame Kind mit Amnesie.\nNoch etwas abschlie\u00dfendes zur Story: F\u00fcr den Verlauf der sehr verzweigten Story ist es wichtig, dass dem Spieler am Anfang Informationen vorenthalten werden oder er sogar zu falschen Schl\u00fcssen verleitet wird. Gerade im letzten Drittel h\u00e4ufen sich Enth\u00fcllungen und Twists und es wird ein tieferer Sinn hinter dem grausamen Spiel klar.\n\n\nZum Gameplay:\nStreng genommen gibt es drei Arten von Spielsituationen.\n\n1. Filmsequenzen:\nHierbei handelt es sich um animierte Sequenzen, die die Story und oder/Situation erl\u00e4utern. Da das Spiel f\u00fcr den 3DS gemacht wurde, sind sie grafisch nat\u00fcrlich nicht der Kn\u00fcller, aber wer sich nicht an staksigen Anime-Charakteren in Cell Shading Optik st\u00f6rt, der wird mit zum Teil sehr spannenden und emotionalen Momenten konfrontiert.\n\n2. Escape Room:\nJepp, genau das, wonach es klingt. H\u00e4ufig steckt die gerade gesteuerte Gruppe irgendwo fest und muss versuchen, sich aus ihrer Lage zu befreien und beispielsweise den Raum zu verlassen oder neue Interaktionsm\u00f6glichkeiten zu finden. Dabei sind die R\u00e4tsel manchmal etwas verwirrend, aber mit gen\u00fcgend logischem Denken recht gut l\u00f6sbar.\n\n3. Entscheidungen:\nDer wohl essentielle Bestandteil der Story. Meist durch eine Sequenz eingeleitet, wird vom Spieler h\u00e4ufig eine Entscheidung verlangt. Oft sind diese sehr bin\u00e4r, wie die Frage, ob man einen Knopf dr\u00fccken soll oder nicht. Allerdings gibt es auch Punkte, an denen drei oder mehr Entscheidungen m\u00f6glich sind. Au\u00dferdem sind viele Entscheidungen sehr emotional aufgeladen. Riskiere ich, meinen eigentlich sicheren Gef\u00e4hrten umzubringen, um meine sonst sicher tote Freundin zu retten? Wen greife ich in einer Gefahrensituation an oder versuche ich sogar, eine friedliche L\u00f6sung zu finden?\nAllerdings l\u00e4sst sich nicht jede Entscheidung ohne Vorwissen treffen. An einigen Stellen werden Codes verlangt, die erst an anderen Stellen der Story auftauchen oder Namen, die man normalerweise noch nicht kennen kann. Es sei dabei auch gesagt, dass die Story dennoch halbwegs logisch erkl\u00e4rt, warum die Charaktere auf einmal die n\u00f6tige Info haben.\n\n\nWem w\u00fcrde ich das Spiel nicht empfehlen:\n-Leute, die keine langwierigen R\u00e4tsel im Stil klassischer Adventures m\u00f6gen\n-Grafikfanatiker\n-Menschen, die zu zart besaitet sind, und mit psychisch belastenden Situationen nicht gut klarkommen\n-Leute, die immer Kn\u00f6pfe dr\u00fccken m\u00fcssen und lange Sequenzen nicht abk\u00f6nnen\n\nWem w\u00fcrde ich das Spiel empfehlen:\n-Liebhaber von Adventures und vertrakten Handlungen\n-Leute, die kein Problem mit etwas unbeholfener Animation haben, solange die Story gut ist\n-Jedem, der Szenen mag, die wirklich an die Nieren gehen\n-Filmliebhaber, denn h\u00e4ufig arten Zwischensequenzen in eine Art Kurzfilm aus", "timestamp_created": 1470776184, "timestamp_updated": 1470776184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660112", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24798635": {"recommendationid": "24798635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198284735227", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471124429}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u611f\u89c9\u6ca1\u6709\u524d\u4e24\u4f5c\u7cbe\u5f69\u5462\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6211\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u73a9\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u7ed3\u5c40\u4f1a\u7ed9\u6211\u4e00\u4e2a\u60ca\u559c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1470770491, "timestamp_updated": 1470770491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24798498": {"recommendationid": "24798498", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973761097", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470280438}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzles are average but fun.

This game is just amazing in all points.\nBut Should I write a really long, extensive review or leave it at that?\n\nLet me flip a coun. If I win that toss, I'll leave it at that. If I lose - more review.\n\nDamn. Okay, here we go. Let us embark into a 20 hour [strike]review[/strike] Decision Game!\n\nFirst of all: I have no prior knowledge or Experience with the Zero Escape Series. Say: 999 and VLR.\n\nThis gamme is a Puzzle Game / Visual Novel, but unlike your average visual Novel all dialoge is voiced and acted by character models in the respective rooms. So, in Game Cutscenes pretty much.\nThe Story is pretty simple (and might be known from a certain other Spike Chunsoft game involving a killing game)\n9 people are trapped in an underground shelter. They are split in groups of 3 and awake for 90 minutes at a time. After that their memories of those 90 minutes are erased. To get out of the shelter they need six Passwords. A Password is revealed once a person dies. If you did the math, then six of the nine people (at least) have to die so the rest could escape. \nAnd here is where the game starts to shine: You dont play the stories of the 3 teams in a linear fashion. Rather than this, you have a global flowchart, based on a decision made by the 3 teams which splits the timeline into 4 different ones. You pick those 90 minute, amnesia ending snippets (called Fragments in game) and play through it. Some require you to make a Decision which might end up causing deaths or other bad (or good) things to happen. You are able to jump in and out of completed Fragments to see different outcomes or to just check what the devs came up with for text entering possibilities.\n\nFor example - I keep this part as vague as possible but still, Spoiler tags\n\n[spoiler] One character from a team ends up dead at the beginning of a fragment. Another character aquires a weapon and believes you (the player controlled character) did it and threatens you to spit out the name. I have tried a lot of names that come up in the game, including end game very spoilery ones and I got different responses such as \"You say it was ME? Stop prouting Bullshit!\" upon entering the gun wielders name, \"I can see that, but you are probably acting for him\" upon entering Zero, the name the game master calls himself and \"Interesting, But I dont know where that is\" with the super duper spoilery name[/spoiler]\n\nThis also happened with another whudunnit text entry, but in textbox form. \n\nThe VN Action is Broken by Escape the Room-Style Puzzle games. Those arent too hard or require you to have extensive knowledge about a lot of things (since usually upon checking a puzzle long enough, they will give you hints that become less subtile). I stopped the time on one I thought was going rather fast, and it took me about 20 minutes.\n\nIf there is one thing I have to complain, its that the voices, especially the voice of Zero, was very quiet and with a fan running next to me, I could barely understand what he said. This might have been due to my Laptops crappy sound output, but still, even with headphones it was hard to make out what he was saying.\n\nMusic is wonderful and fitting to the situation, the Puzzles are very well crafted and the Story is just [i] Woah [/i]\n\nOverall, a good solid recomendation", "timestamp_created": 1469967602, "timestamp_updated": 1469967612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562045", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24630060": {"recommendationid": "24630060", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965957763", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469953136}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been a long time since I\u2019ve played a game nonstop for many hours.

This series have one of the best story and a nice atmosphere I ever played, especially in the first game, the feeling of satisfaction to discover what's behind each numbered door is the best. To absolutely NOT miss.\n\nCompared to the two previous game, Zero Time Dilemma seems a bit odd as we actually follow the story by pieces and with the point of view of multiple persons which actually make the game slightly different from 999 or VLR. So the notion of doubt between the players would be mostly gone, right? Well, not really, the author still found a way to spice it up, and make the players still doubt each other\u2019s. \n\nOne of the change that I like is the animation of the story (not the animation itself, it's actually not that good). Before in 999 and VLR, we had to read the story with a plain background. Now in ZTD, we just have to follow the story by watching the animation, just like a movie.\n\nYet, I still find some decisions made by the characters a bit weird or exagerate which sometime make me question their logic, but why not, they experienced things I didn't.\n\nTo fully enjoy ZTD, it is more than recommended to play 999 and VLR, otherwise it would be quite confusing and you would just spoil some parts of the two previous amazing games, which would be not wise.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this last installation of the Zero Escape trilogy, well, not as much as VLR but It still deserve its place as a Zero escape game in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1469466111, "timestamp_updated": 1469466111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24517600": {"recommendationid": "24517600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198835342", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479288239}, "language": "english", "review": "This game made me contemplate my mortality.", "timestamp_created": 1469450040, "timestamp_updated": 1469450040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24515861": {"recommendationid": "24515861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025119453", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468354375}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si hab\u00e9is tenido ocasi\u00f3n de jugar a los dos juegos anteriores de la saga os recomiendo adquirir la tercera parte.

This game largely is non-linear, which is awesome, but can be potentially random and confusing due to the story jumping all over the place. In saying that the game works well by doing just that because you are trying to piece together all the threads of a story that takes many twists and turns throughout. I was impressed by how everything came together and take my hat off to the developers for creating quite a complex tree of decisions and plot branches to get to the end. Next point of warning relates to the story being told: there is a HUGE number of cutscenes which cannot be skipped or fast forwarded. I love a good cutscene but I do believe this game could have snipped a fair few of them out of the game. I found myself not having touched mouse/keyboard in upwards of an hour at some points. They do serve character development, of course, but when the ratio of interactive gameplay and cutscenes is out of whack and is noticeable then there may be a problem. Perhaps a few more puzzles scattered through the ending may have broken up the long videos. Hence why by the end of the game I was quite relieved that the story was done. But, why the thumbs up? This game does have a very addictive knack of creating mystery, having some challenging puzzles and having some of the solutions to those puzzles requiring a lot of pen and paper notes plus scattering answers throughout other scenes that pushes this beyond a hidden object game. If you don't like a challenge, don't like puzzles, or like to use a hint function within a game then don't play this. The mood of this game does replicate any 'escape room' scenarios ala 'Saw' and is 110% not suitable for children. There is a lot of death in the game, some very strong adult themes, and terminology that is going to fly straight over most  younger people's heads but for the adult audience this is very much a Japanese style game that is very familiar to anyone who's watched most Japanese extreme cinema or watched a bit of Anime.

Although I'd have to admit all games in the series are pretty flawed in one way or another, I'd still recommend giving these a look if you're down for a pretty well written mystery/thriller with an unmistakably Japanese flavor. So before we go any further, know that THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN LIGHT SPOILERS FOR 999 AND VIRTUE'S LAST REWARD because I have no idea how to discuss this series' convoluted plot otherwise\n\nZero Time Dilemma begins in December of 2028 at the Dcom facility in Nevada and takes place after the events of 999, but before the events of Virtue's Last Reward. Sigma and Phi have traveled back in time and joined what is known as \"The Dcom experiment\" in order to prevent the outbreak of the Radical-6 virus which has killed most of Earth's population in the future. They are joined by Junpei and Akane from 999 who have been tracking the movements of a terrorist organization known as \"Free the Soul\" whose objectives also include destroying humanity. They are joined by heroic firefighter Carlos, sad sack Eric, seductive Mira, a somehow familiar looking girl named Diana, and a young boy boy has no memory and wears a strange capsule on his head. As part of the Dcom experiment, the group of them are (of course) locked in a facility and forced to play a deadly \"decision game\". The group is forced to split into 3 teams and told that at any point if 6 people are dead, the remaining survivors will be allowed to escape. Additionally, every 90 minutes a drug from the participants bracelets is injected which puts them to sleep and wipes their short term memories. Pretty crazy stuff\n\nThe story of Zero Time Dilemma is told in 90 minute \"fragments\" where you choose what team you'd like to follow and watch what events play out over the next 90 minutes. Only you initially have no idea where those 90 minutes fit into the grand timeline of the game. Sometimes you'll start a fragment and half of the group will be already dead and you'll have no idea why. I actually found this approach to storytelling a little annoying and hard to follow as I never knew where in the timeline I was and near the end I couldn't keep track of all the reveals of who was dead and who was alive and why.\n\nAfter 999's static images and fixed camera, Virtue's Last Reward introduced voice acting and full 3d models with moderately successful results. Zero Time Dilemma takes it even farther with a much more distinctly cinematic approach to portraying its story. Zero Time Dilemma uses much more camera panning and animations during cutscenes. This is a slightly less successful transition unfortunately. It was pretty clear that the animation team was either rushed or not very experienced. Animations are jerky and forced and the lip sync is pretty questionable. It personally didn't bother me too much, but it was certainly notable and I know a lot of people will find the stiff animations a distracting drawback\n\nI thought the puzzles in Zero Time Dilemma were some of the best of the series. They were varied, interesting and had me pulling out actual pen and paper to work through problems. Depending on the order of the fragments you play, the pacing of the puzzle rooms can be a little weird though. In my experience, I had tons of puzzle rooms in the beginning and middle of the game, but almost none near the end which made playing through the end of the game more like watching a movie. Speaking of the end... it was kind of a let down. Without discussing any spoilers, the ending was sort of plain and disappointing which was a surprise in of itself since 999 and Virtue's Last Reward had such huge reveals and shocking twists. Ahh well, it was still nice to finally have some sort of closure for this series.\n\nRegardless of what the marketing of this game wants you to believe, you can't play it without playing the first two games first. Or at least you shouldn't. Start there first or else you'll likely be massively confused. For veterans of the series, this game will offer some closure for the story, albeit a slightly disappointing one. I still must admit I enjoyed this game a lot as it features some of the strongest puzzle rooms in the series.

Wait for it to go on sale, even if you're a fan of the series. \n\n6/10\n\nMore below.\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nA valid and passionate attempt to finish out the Zero Escape series that falls flat in puzzle challenge and curve, character development, and an enormous amount of unsolved questions. \n\nIt had a lot of potential - the voice acting is decent, the musical remixes and new tracks are on par with the rest of the series, and while most of the story's twists were predictable after a point, some DID leave me impressed at the amount of hidden foreshadowing and Uchikoshi's general ability to blow the player away. Given a few more months minimum of polishing the story and gameplay, this could have been an outstanding game to end the series with a bang. As it is, it sends the series out with a thousand more question marks and a wet, sad fizzle. \n\nReturning characters' consistency is all over the place, while new characters are flat and dull. Puzzle rooms are surprisingly empty in challenge for an M-label audience - outside two INCREDIBLY hard ones, most puzzles presented are either boring, extremely repetitive, or both, requiring less of the logic that other ZE titles favor and more just a pair of working eyes and an ability to see that \"X goes into Y\". When I become less excited for puzzles in favor of frustration over a third \"fit all the items in the box\" minigame with no change in difficulty, it speaks for how much fun I as a player am having and how much I want to continue the game for the sake of finding new things. And while the story had its moments, most of it felt like the writers were dragging their feet. Dialogue was stale, character chemistry was awkward, various points unresolved from 999 and VLR were not addressed even in passing, and (my biggest complaint) one particular twist anchoring much of the end of the game felt completely out of genre - a deus ex machina that tried to explain a lot but felt thrown in as an afterthought, not even touching the ideas of Quantum Theory and the possibilities of the human mind and body that existed in other games. It made the rushed ending even less enjoyable. Even the addition of epilogue files to try and wrap things up after the cinematics end falls short, several characters not even making an appearance for a \"happy ending\".\n\nTHAT ALL SAID, THOUGH: I'm still a fan of the series, and I still do have a fondness for the purpose of this title, even if this game is on the bottom of the trilogy by a long shot for me. If you have played the other two Zero Escape titles (and you should - much of this game won't strike as hard if you're playing it blind), then I'd recommend getting this for the sake of completion and some manner of story resolution... but NOT full price. Lack of engaging puzzles, a 20-hour-max play time and no major replayability afterwards really makes it hard to defend the $40 USD price tag.\n\nWait until a good Steam Sale if you're that desperate to pick it up.", "timestamp_created": 1468993936, "timestamp_updated": 1468994269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24419342": {"recommendationid": "24419342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308636619", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510795539}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u63d0\u524d\u73a9\u4e8612\u4ee3\uff0c\u5bf93\u4ee3\u66f4\u671f\u5f85\u4e86\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u8111\u6d1e\u5f00\u5f97\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u63a8\u8350", "timestamp_created": 1468987735, "timestamp_updated": 1468987735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24416838": {"recommendationid": "24416838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055792982", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468970473}, "language": "english", "review": "As an avid fan of the Zero Escape series i was overjoyed to find out that Zero Time Dilemma would be released on Steam as i currently dont own a handheld.

You will not enjoy this game nearly as much if you have no idea what's going on, and this game is competly story reliant.  There will apparently be a pc release for both prequels at some point, so fear not.\n\nZero time dilemma took what may be called a risk; they departed from the visual novel style that the first 2 game utilized, and instead adopted a more cinematic style when presenting the story.  At first I was skeptical of this decision, and feared that it would tarnish the 2 previous games I had come to love, but I find the decision really had no ill effects on the game at all, and doing away with all the clicking may even be considered a positive.  One negative, may be that important information could potentially slip by you if you aren't giving the game your complete attention, but there is a log you can check in that case for any miseed dialogue, but really if you aren't giving a story focused game your complete attention then why are you even playing it.\n\nThe puzzles in this game I consider to be easier than the first 2 games, though not by a massive amount; perhaps I am just so used to the way puzzles are done in this series after playing the first 2.  There were only a couple of moments that I found myself not knowing what to do, and it was usually just because I hadn't clicked a specific place below some floating symbols or something similar.  \n\nThe second game (virtue's last reward) had you navigate a flowchart to move between different storylines, and this game does the same while adding a few new complexities to the equation, such as 3 point of view characters and the story fragment system. These new features aren't just gimmicks either and play an important role in the way the narrative is told.\n\nI won't speak much on the story, because spoilers for a game this story focused, and a game with so many twists and turns would be a disservice to anyone reading this.  All I will say is that everything is wrapped up nicely, I am satisfyed with this conclusion to the series, and this is probably my favourite of the 3 games in the series, though time will tell if I will change my mind, since I only just finished this game.  \n\ntl;dr: IF YOU ENJOY STORIES IN YOUR GAMES, LIKE ADVENTURE GAMES, LIKE VISUAL NOVELS, LIKE SFI-FI OR HORROR, THEN I SUGGEST YOU TRY THE ZERO ESCAPE SERIES.", "timestamp_created": 1468962322, "timestamp_updated": 1468967084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24413518": {"recommendationid": "24413518", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983462503", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468958692}, "language": "english", "review": "It is completely awesome and mind-blowing as always.

played 999 and Virtue's Last Reward.

I know the animation may not click with some, but I enjoyed it\n[*]Really good PC edition, everything ran smoothly and I never had any frame drops\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]A few issues with the story, but I won't list them because spoilers\n[*]It may have been just me, but there were times where the story felt way more linear that what I'm used to with Zero Escape games, which I guess worked out well for this particalar game, but it just felt kind of weird to me\n[*]As with most Zero Escape games, it takes a little while for the story to pick up, but this may not be that big of an issue for some\n[/list]\n\nIf you played and enjoyed 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, then you'll definitely enjoy Zero Time Dilemma.

I've missed you.\n\nWell, sort of. You've never been the same person twice, have you?\n\nYet here you are, with two previous Zeroes under your thumb, and a rogue's gallery of nine people, some familiar-- some not. What vile scheme have you cooked up this time?\n\nThree teams of three, plus Gab. He carries notes and stuff. Incredibly old, and adores his cheese. \n\nThere are a couple of changes that were made from the other games, but only a small handful of them bear mentioning: \n\nFirst, the visual novel sections have been cut out, and replaced with fully voiced and animated cutscenes. There are some upsides to this, as the need for tedious button presses every few seconds goes away, which does wonders for the pacing. You can turn the skip off and on in the configuration tool (which also has the video and audio settings). \n\nNext, the Nonary game has been replaced by the Decision Game. Unlike previous games, the teams are set from the word go, and don't change. At least not until things start going sideways in Act III. People live, people die, and what happens in every ending is important to the final resolution. Good or bad, every one. This is one of the few games where ti counts to see everything the game has to offer. \n\nIf you've played the first two games all the way through, you'll know what's coming. If not, you're in for a wild ride. You won't get some of the more obscure plot points until late in the game, but it'll be worth it when you do. My suggestion, if you have the hardware-- buy the previous two games, and play them. 9 Persons, 9 hours, 9 Doors is the very basics, and while it explains the events within the game, it leaves far more questions. \n\nVirtue's Last Reward, on the other hand, ends on a sort of cliffhanger, which is answered in this last game, and you finally get the answers to all the other questions that have been hanging around since the opening of the series...\n\nIncluding some you may not have thought to ask. \n\nYou see, it's all about a snail... A single snail that changes everything.

(I don't know if this was scripted or my game glitched but i pressed all the buttons of my controller and all the keys on my keyboard and nothing happened)\n\nThe \"gameplay\" in this game consist on making choices (A or B), and puzzles about escaping a room you're trapped in, this last one i have to admit is pretty cool but sometimes the puzzles are really ambiguous.\n\nAnother interesting thing is that the game is not linear and this makes the game a puzzle itself because you will need to know the real order of events that occur in the game in order to understand what's happening, this means that in your first time you will end up playing \"fragments\" of the story way ahead of your time or way behind, unfortunately to me i solved some of the first order of events but my choices didn't carry up in the story at all, leaving certain characters or teams dead when i clearly made some choices that will not lead up to that event.\n\nAt that point i got frustrated and i lost all my interest in this game after waiting the release date since the day the said it was coming to steam.\n\nI'll update this review after i make sure of a few things, if the game hasn't change my mind i'll leave it as it is.\n\n\n\nTLDR; It's a visual novel with 3d models instead of sprites, those models are like robots instead of resembling real people with real emotions, there are choices to be made but they don't matter at all because the game wants to be beated at a certain way, the puzzles are fun but ambiguous at the same time, the story is really convoluted so you need to play the prequels", "timestamp_created": 1468716220, "timestamp_updated": 1468830002, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.338851", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24358930": {"recommendationid": "24358930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041372203", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469204155}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubb50 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\uac00 \uc548\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294\uac70\uc5d0\uc11c\uc880 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \ub290\ub07c\uc2e4\uc218\ub294 \uc788\uaca0\uc9c0\ub9cc\ubb50 \uc800\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud559\uc744 \ub098\uc628\uc0ac\ub78c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368\uc5b4 \uc608 \uc815\ub9d0 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uac8c\ud5f8\ub124\uc694 \u314b\u314b\u314b\uac15\ucd94\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 !! \ud574\uc11d\ubcf8 \ubb50 \uc720\ud23d\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub9b4\uc218\uc788\uc73c\uba74 \uc62c\ub9ac\uaca0\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\uc7bc\uc788\uc5b4\uc694 ! \ud574\ubcf4\uc138\uc694 !!", "timestamp_created": 1468696133, "timestamp_updated": 1468696133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485789", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24357957": {"recommendationid": "24357957", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004921740", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1728, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468691971}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzle-game with amazing story.\nPrepare to have your mind blown a couple of times.", "timestamp_created": 1468692678, "timestamp_updated": 1468692678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24355496": {"recommendationid": "24355496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280619572", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497566776}, "language": "english", "review": "I recommend this game for those who has played Zero escape: 999 and VLR.\nLike many people have said, I think the soundtrack is amazing but 3D models are not great but still made me fully engaged in the story.\nHowever, I would say the time of playing (23 hours to beat the game) is a little bit short for 40 bucks. But then again, the story is almost always fully engaging so I wouldn't blame that. And I know the money needed to hire voice actor must be a lot for games like this.\n\nThere is one improvement I would like to ask for though, and it is one of the biggest disappointments I have for this game:\n****************MAJOR SPOILER ALERT********************\n\n[spoiler] It is that the flow chart is actually well organized at the beginning. To be more specific, the fragments were already in mostly correct order from the very beginning. If you really want to bring out more surprises for the play, I recommend you guys put fragments parallel to each other at first before truth is revealed. (For example, if Q-team is executed in the first round, the fragments for C-team and D-team will be revealed and placed in completely random position below the first round. To make it even more interesting, a decision should be made at that point, and the player can only choose to play as either one of the two teams. Another team can only be unlocked after all teams have been executed in the first round. And at the very beginning there can be a bunch of grey fragments, all scattered randomly under the first round and they can only be unlocked once one team is executed in first round.) However, such confusing element is not found in this game. When I saw the already organized flow chart, I immediately thought one team's game might occur after another team, and as a result I was not so surprised afterwards by the fact that three wards are actually one ward since it is possible if one fragment is after another. I think redoing the flowchart is not that big of an effort and it is really something developers should consider.

I don't know why they thought the mobile crowd was dumb enough to not be able to solve sudokus, but adding visual novel sections was necessary because in the first game, they would often scatter relevant story bits throughout the puzzles, and even in some cases you'd learn more information by doing the puzzles in a certain way. They stopped doing that in VLR, and it continues in this game, making the puzzles feel more and more insignificant.\n\nThe story is cool, the links to the other games are *really* cool, and the tweeeeest at the end is neat, although less impactful than the twists in 999 and VLR because it doesn't directly involve our main cast like it did in those games, The handling of the main gimmick (the characters' minds being wiped every 90 minutes) is done quite well with the fragment mechanic, where you jump around in time, not knowing what comes after what, much like the characters. \n\nThose characters are fun, and it's good to see a return to the characters we know and tolerate from the first two games. The voice acting isn't awesome, but you're probably going to just listen to the Japanese vocal track like the weeb you are. Of course that's what I did, except for during Sigma and Phi's parts, because I already knew their English voices from VLR, and it was weird not hearing those, so get used to switching back and forth! The game graciously lets you switch voice tracks midgame.\n\nOverall this is a visual novel throughout. If you come to this game expecting Professor Layton, you'll be disappointed when you find all of the puzzles are linear do THIS then THIS then THAT affairs with WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO CLICK NEXT scattered throughout. You'll also be really confused, because you probably haven't played the other two games, and you really should because this game spoilers the other two pretty majorly right from the beginning, and it makes constant reference to the past games without spelling it out clearly enough to serve as a standalone.\n\nPlay this game if you're a fan of the first two, and you already know what to expect (i.e. hours of im14andthisisdeep droning on about philosophy and quantum mechanics).

If you [i]did[/i] play VLR, prepare to be force-fed even more of the [b]exact same[/b] droning explanations of quantum mechanics, multiverse theory, and existential quandaries that you were already sick of by the end of that game.\n\nMost of the cast both look and sound like budget anime knockoffs of their former selves. (Junpei dyed his hair purple and started wearing blood-red contacts I guess??) The animation is more stilted than a sideshow performance, and most of the voice acting isn't great either. Knowing as much about the past and future as you should already by this point in the series, there are very few \"ah-ha\" moments except where events directly tie into VLR. The puzzles are definitely the sparsest and weakest they've ever been in the series, with several of them repeated ad nauseum but also a few genuinely entertaining ones.\n\nThe new fragment-based arrangement of the game's scenes is in theory the most convenient they've ever been and do cut down on having to repeat scenes too often, but the unlock conditions to progress through events are outstandingly obtuse at times. As others have said, there are one or two deus ex machinae that are not only outrageously convenient but feel [i]extremely[/i] out of place given the timeframe in which this takes place, but you know what, after everything that went down in VLR I'm kind of numb to it. Time to play fast and loose with the fabric of space and time like never before.\n\nI will say... I liked it. Quite a bit.

These games are some of the few that I would with no exageration in my say are genious. Evreything about them is purposeful and they somehow answer all of the questions that they raise in such a uniqe, clever and shocking way it is hard not to be at awe at times. I remember that personaly in 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors there was a scene that I was so shocked I litteraly froze for a minute and dropped my DS, this has never happened in a game before and it has only occured again with \"Vitrues Last Reward\" and thankfuly  \"Zero Time Dilemma\" continues evreything that made the original two games so great and they did something that I never in my wildiest dreams thought that Spike Chunsoft could do, they met my ridiculously high exectations and did not let me down at all.\n\n[b] Story [/b]\nThe story of essentialy all of the zero escape games start with the base concept of this: 9 people are trapped in a enclosed space by a mysterious person calling themselves \"Zero\", their objective is to escape the area without dying. It seems simple enough but there is always a catch to it that changes with each game. I would explain the catch for Zero Time Dilemma but the problem is that its hard to explain without spoiling anything so the best I can say is that you are split up into 3 different groups consisting of 3 different people in each. Your overal objective is to open up the X door and escape, to do this you need at least of what are called X passes, the problem here is that a X pass is only revealed if somebody dies meaning at  least 6 people have to die to make your escape. The game is also broken up into different sections in a \"Beyond Two Souls\" kind of way where the time line is intentionaly out of order, the big thing here though is that for the most part characters do not know what happens in other secions due to a amnesia enducing drug that they are given to make them forget each secion. Make sence? No of course it dosent its not supposed to make any sence thats the whole idea around it but just trust me when I say that all of the questions that can be raised by this are all resolved in the ending. \n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nThis is a game that is hard to describe on a gameplay standpoint because alot of it is just kind of watching cutscenes, however that is not all that you do. There is alot of escape room puzzles that you must complete a series of puzzles to get the key that will lead you to an escape. These puzzles are usualy followed up with a difficult choice at the end of it that the player has to chose between one of two outcomes. Some times it goes into knowing a certain event, sometimes its just on assumptions of what happens or sometimes it is just plain luck that the player has to take a guess and hope for the best. Again this may not seem like it makes sence but it really does make a huge impact to alot of events near the end of the game\n\n[b] Music [/b]\nIf you have played any of the zero escape games before this dont be expecting anything really new. While the old tracks are incredibly effective and always set a uneasy and atmospheric vibe to the area. But this still unfourtunatley means that there was only a handful of new tracks that were put into the mix, while again effective they lack in variety.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nWhile the character designes are surley a step up from the characters in Virtues Last Reward the animations are just unforgivabley bad. They look like if the animatior was told what people looked like while they moved but they had never actually experienced it for themselves before. And for some reason the way that the characters move their mouth are very off, the best way I could describe it is saying that they look like they are trying to get out peanut butter that was stuck to the roof and sides of their mouth, it just kinda moves to much and to jarringly. But other than that the enviroments look nice and the cell shading really does suit the game well\n\n[b] Optimization [/b]\nJust thought I would throw in this quick note here I was very supprised by the optimization due to alot of options being realized and put into the game, even a option for widescreen displays which almost nothing has\n\n[b] Verdict [/b]\nOverall Zero Time Dilemma was my biggest shock of the year so far, not because I expected it to be bad but because I thought it could never live up to what I was hoping it would be. What I was hoping for a satisfying ending to my faverioute obscure franchise. If you are reading this and are still unsure please do yourself a favour and buy 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors , to start, it will be out on steam soon, the developers really do deserve more money and more credit for making what is at least for me, the best game of the year so far.\n\n[b] Final Score [/b]\n9/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1468474800, "timestamp_updated": 1468474800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24308460": {"recommendationid": "24308460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039682703", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468472198}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic game, answers almost all of the questions presented by the previous two.\n\nIf you have not played 9 Persons, 9 Hours, 9 Doors and then the sequel Virtue's Last Reward, DO NOT play this game under any circumstances.

Also, with the PC release of 999 and VLR coming up no one has an excuse to not play this phenomenal series.\n\nZero Time Dilemma keeps up the quality of its predecessors while mixing some things up. It's still the well-paced and refreshing alternation between story segments (this time fully voiced) and puzzle rooms. The puzzles are once again at that sweet spot between challenging but not too challenging. I did get stuck couple of times but never needed to consult a walkthrough.\n\nThe story is again very captivating. Especially if you're into time travel, multi-verses and such. Only in a video game you can tell those kind of stories while at the same time making the player feel being a part of it by means of interaction.\n\nThe english dubbing was a nice addition although I felt they didn't get it right all the time. There were some confusing translations which made some puzzles more difficult than intended. The voice actors though were generally solid.\n\nHowever, I will say that the flow chart that is used in ZTD similarly to VLR felt not quite as organic as in VLR. I think the AB-game from VLR fit this style better than this game's Decision Game. I often found myself just cycling through all outcomes to \"clear the chart\" whereas in VLR you were brought back to those decision points more naturally.\n\nThe series is a must buy for anyone enjoying dark time travel stories and  high quality puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1468405704, "timestamp_updated": 1480014205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531867", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24291810": {"recommendationid": "24291810", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998601671", "num_games_owned": 458, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468091293}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally the third game in this awesome series and it sure didn't disappoint.

I'll skip to the end and say that Zero Time Dilemma was not a satisfying experience for me, and I wouldn't recommend buying it at it's current price (40 USD). Buy it when it's on sale, though, and see if you like what it's got, especially if you played the previous Zero Escape games.\n\nI should note that this review is coming from someone who played 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors and Virtue's Last Reward and enjoyed both games, but thought each had room for improvement in gameplay at the very least. I've been waiting 4+ years for this game - I certainly went into it with some expectation that I'd like it in some capacity, but I don't think that made much of a difference in this case.\n\nThe main problem I have with Zero Time Dilemma is that it feels...lost. And I don't mean just in the story, although I certainly got that vibe during many of the cutscenes with regards to characterization (more on that later). As a whole game, it's not cohesive. It lacks what I think of as the primary thing a game needs to have for me as a player - the engagement to have me keep going. And, more importantly, not resort to a guide because I wasn't invested enough in either my time or the story to give an attempt at That One Puzzle one last time.\n\nZTD feeds the story to the player in fragments. This is a departure from the previous entries in that you never really experience a linear storyline and you can't spoil yourself in the interface to judge what happens next. It's an interesting idea in concept and makes for a lot of cool \"What in the seven hells is even going on\" moments in the early parts of the game.\n\nYou also have a flowchart. Let's talk about the flowchart.\n\nI assume that the flowchart was added as an anti-frustration feature for players that would be confused by the non-linear narrative. Which is perfectly understandable, but in execution it backfires tremendously. It points to all the endings, which should be helpful, but it also encourages binary thinking. For example, if I'm at a decision point, and the decision is asking me to decide who killed XYZ, and I can see that there are only 2 branching paths, my train of thought isn't going to be \"Who is most likely to be the killer?\" it's \"Who is most likely to fit into one of those 2 branching paths?\" Which, considering the game is trying to be as non-linear as possible, is not helpful in the slightest, especially when many of the answers to these scenarios rely on thinking outside the box. I like when solutions to dialogue trees aren't cookie-cutter A or B choices, but not when the game's interface discourages me from approaching a mindset that considers choice C.\n\nSome fragments will also only be available after you clear a certain number of events, which would be fine, except [i]how[/i] you obtain new fragments is never explained anywhere in the context of the game. Many, many people have gotten stuck because of this, myself included. And while I don't mind having to look up a guide to get the endings because I couldn't figure out the one path of the tree I hadn't taken yet (see 999), I don't really like having to look up a guide because I wasn't aware of the conditions to obtain those endings in the first place.\n\nAlso, this game is not configured for PC. I noticed when I booted it up the first time that it lacks options to configure graphics and sound settings, but didn't think anything of it until the cutscenes actually started playing. I understand that this was primarily meant to be a 3DS release, but if I'm playing on PC I'd at least like the [i]option[/i] to configure the game so that my incredibly beat up laptop can handle it. Never mind having to keep the game open in a 800 x 600 window just for the cutscenes to not lag and look horrendously janky, and I didn't figure that out until I was about 18 hours in.\n\nThat said, when it comes to the graphics and gameplay, I was willing to overlook it because those have never been the Zero Escape series' best points. So. The story. What about it?\n\nHonestly, I feel like the writers got switched somewhere along the line, because a lot of the characterization in this game is just...weird. For both new and returning characters. New characters aren't consistent and there's a lot of nonchalant behavior about some of the things that are revealed, like [spoiler] Mira being a serial killer[/spoiler] is addressed in maybe 3 timelines and never brought up again, not even in the true ending (if you don't count the additional files that are revealed post-ending). I would think that would be significantly more important than a shrug and a hand wave, especially in a life or death situation, but none of the other characters seem to care.\n\nThat's just one example. Many of the relationships between the characters, both pre-established and otherwise, feel like they're...flopping around awkwardly, maybe not quite working the way they're supposed to but hey, if the writing can fake it then it works, right? Except this time around it couldn't and the end result is...Well, this game.\n\nSome plot points that especially stretched (and even broke) my suspension of disbelief, which you can come back to after you've played the game or don't mind being spoiled:\n\n[spoiler]\n[list]\n[*]The transporter pods. Seriously, [i]the transporter pods[/i]. Whose idea was this? What kind of whacked up timey-wimey sci-fi novels have you been reading!? (Or alternatively: was this seriously the best you could do?)\n\n[*]Sigma and Diana's relationship. I sort of get this one, but it's still weird, mostly because one the consenting parties is actually a 67 year-old man...and that they also consummate their speedy relationship on one of those freaking transporter pods.\n\n[*]Mira being a serial killer, as mentioned above.\n\n[*]Left/Free the Soul. Considering their importance and the number of supplementary materials about them in VLR, there could have been a lot more done with this, but it was swept under the rug.\n\n[*]Junpei and Akane's relationship. Actually, Junpei's character in general. Working as a detective must be really difficult in 2028 if he ends up that bitter after only working at it for a year.\n\n[*]Mind-hacking. Might have been cool, but when stacked up on everything else, it makes the pile crumple faster. \n[/list]\n[/spoiler]\n\nThe most important thing, though, is The Twist. 999 and VLR each had their own Twist, and each was mind-numbingly awesome (VLR's required a bit of suspension of disbelief, but not too much). This game's Twist...is not really like those Twists. The message delivered by the Twist is also not like the previous Twists. In fact, the message I came away with from this game is that horrible people can do awful things, but as long as it was all in another timeline, who cares? And I feel like that wasn't what the writers wanted to say, but the way everything was executed, I can't help but think that they wrote the story of this game by following that theme. And that makes me sad and disappointed. The Zero Escape games have always carried this underlying message of \"light at the end of the tunnel\", and although that stretched to \"light at the end of a really, really [i]long[/i] tunnel\" in the second installment, I never felt like the endings were a departure from the message of the overarching plot.\n\nZero Time Dilemma's ending is. If you're okay with that, then maybe this is a good game for you and you'll enjoy it immensely, but as for me, I think I'd just like to close the book on this particular story and move on to better things.", "timestamp_created": 1468371016, "timestamp_updated": 1468463773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24280584": {"recommendationid": "24280584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074789709", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486289745}, "language": "english", "review": "The long awaited final episode of one of the best trilogies in videogames.

Thankfully it doesn't take away from the voice acting and story. But man, they're truly awful.\n-Lip-synching is off. Not a huge deal, but still.\n-Graphics aren't very detailed.

Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma, The third and final game for the Zero Escape series. For this to be the final game in the series... They went all the **** out! \n\nNow I won't go into too much detail about the story, but if you played the other 2 games 999 and Virtue Last Reward (Both coming to steam so you can play those later) then you know some things for this story, while if this is your first game playing one of the Zero Escape games then no need to worry, the help explain some things so you know just what you need between all of the characters. \n\nNow... Lets go over the characters, Story, Gameplay, and my final thoughts on this alright? So kinda bear with me...\n\nCharacters!\nYou start with 3 characters in 3 different groups, My personal favorite group is C team, led by Carlos and have Akane and Junpei, characters from 999. Akane mostly knows a lot of information and different subjects so she helps explains some of the terms in the game. Junpei is a jerk mostly who doesn't really seem to care about much, which is a LOT different than what he acts like in 999, but if you get into the backstory of Junpei, then you kinda know how he became what he is in this game. Carlos is amazing for being a new character to be introduced, a fire fighter who became part of this game just to save his little sister.  \n\n D team! Led by Diana with Sigma and Phi.  Now if you played VLR, then you know who Sigma and Phi are, and if you payed attention then you know who Diana looks a lot like of. Now I won't say much about Sigma and Phi besides that they seem to know something of what happens in the future and are trying to stop it by going to the place where Zero Escape ZTD takes place. Diana is a head nurse who works at a hospital and came to D com (The Place where ZTD takes place, to send people to Mars.) because of a suggestion from one of her friends.\nQ team! Possibly the team that I didn't really like that much until I got more information about all 3 of them. Q, The leader with Mira and Eric, boyfriend and girlfriend, I think... Now Q is a young boy who has a wierd thing on his head, so you can't see his face, he does seem to know a lot of things. Eric! He is a mixed guy for me, I feel sorry for him at times and others I'm like \"YOU ****ING JACK***!\". He also works at an ice cream shop and have it seems to have a complex with Mira his \"Angel\" ... Angle? You know... the one with wings. Mira you don't really get into too much stuff with her until you look at Q teams and see her backstory... and DAMN do I like her... she is just... Yeah I can't say much more otherwise I'll ruin something...\n\nStory time... 9 participants are met with a man/woman who calls themself \"Zero the 2nd\". First, the person offers them a choice and flips a coin, If they get it right, then they will allow all 9 to leave and continue with their lives, but if they get it wrong... then they are force to play the \"Decision game\", and can only escape when at least 6 people have died, to get passwords to escape from the shelter. Now if you played Zero escape, then you know this game is HEAVILY story based and a LOT of information is given and you need to pay attention to understand how everything works. In fact its a good thing it is, because sometimes you will forget something, and have no clue how it ties in, but Spike Chunsoft did it perfectly where EVERYTHING you don't understand will fit perfectly. \n\nGameplay! Think of this like a virtual novel, with you doing puzzles once in a while and solving riddles that will help you decide your ending. Even if you die in 1 path, you can go back in a different path and what you have learned in 1 path may help you in a different path. Like for example, Q team had something to do with a door and it had a hint, However they couldn't do anything with the door as it had nothing on their side. However, D team had a door and a place to enter a code, And they had no clue what they need. Hence how you need to switch between paths to get the answers you need to beat this game.\n\nLets see... My final thoughts on this... \n\nIt's a good series, I watched 999 as I didn't have a DS and had no clue about it until I watched a lets play of it, after that I found out that VLR was on the 3DS so I went and played that and enjoyed it with loving how the story happens. I'm sad and happy that this series is over, but ZTD met my expectations, tied up all of the loose ends, and it still meets how a ZE game is... it makes you think you know the ending, but it's up to your own interpretation... and dang do I recommend this game, If you have or haven't played the other 2, you will understand this game, and enjoy the puzzles, the riddles, and the characters. The only thing I didn't really like is how the 3D models look somewhat... lifeless at times, while in the other 2 games with sprites, they seemed more alive. But besides that...\n\nTL;DR: Good Game, Good Story, Good Characters, I give it a 9.5/10\nThe .5 is because of the models, but yeah, slight nit pick.", "timestamp_created": 1468217002, "timestamp_updated": 1468217002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498084", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24246530": {"recommendationid": "24246530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010909051", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468212706}, "language": "english", "review": "A largely phenomenal series comes to a mostly satisfying conclusion.

Donc apres avoir complete le tuto qui consiste a faire un petit bout de branche avec chaque team, on se retrouve avec.. un tas de branches differentes, sans vraiment d'explication a part une image, on peut selectionner une branche , faire so histoire, tomber sur un game over + un blocage et... on recommence. c'est un peu dommage car on a plus limpression d'assister a plein de petites histoires plutot qun gros truc.\n\nCote puzzle c'est assez sympa, ca demande de la reflexion et on est jamais reelement bloque (enfin si un peu dsfois , surtout car on a pas inspecte un petit element de decor...) mais les enigmes restent assez logiques, meme si certaines sont vraiment tordues.\n\nLes d\u00e9fauts du jeu sont les crashs (jen ai deja eu 2 pour l'instant, je conseille vivement de save apres chaque puzzle pour eviter de tout vous retaper) car il n'y a pas pratiquement PAS de sauvegarde automatique excepte apres une fin de branche... et aussi l'autre d\u00e9faut est que l'histoire part VRAIMENT en couille total, et jai parfois limpression que mon cerveau part loin quand je joue au jeu..\n\nDans l'ensemble c'est un bon jeu, une excellente duree de vie a prevoir et de tres bon rebondissements, avec une histoire farfelue mais interessante.

ZTD is a visual novel mystery game with some occasional puzzles, that never quite nails the experience it's trying to accomplish, but is still strong enough in the parts that matter to keep you engrossed all the way to the end. The unique draw of the game comes from the non-linear storyline, the mind-bending sci-fi concepts the game throws at you and the splendid puzzle-design. \n\nThe game is the final part of an existing trilogy previously released on the handheld consoles. Though the story is relatively self-contained, the set up is so deeply entrenched in the previous stories that I would recommend playing the previous two games before this one. Play them on an emulator or wait for their upcoming Steam-remasters. That said, though, I can't think of a single game on PC that is quite like this one, so if you are a big fan of visual novels and sci-fi, you could also enjoy this even without knowing the first two games. \n\nBut I did mention flaws, didn't I? The first thing that stands out is the rather choppy animation quality. The game goes for a more cinematic feel from the previous games, with full 3D graphics and changing camera angles, but for the most part the janky animations just cannot be made to look good. To the credit of the game's writing, it actually doesn't matter *that* much because the story and voice acting are so good, but it still ruined a couple of the more emotional scenes for me. \n\nThe second biggest flaw matters mostly when compared to the previous installments: The visual style and localisation quality have suffered a downgrade. Character designes for Junpei and Akane look very different from the previous games, and the english translation has quite a few awkward phrases and bad voice direction. I really don't want to put it on the VA's, though. Despite the higher detail, ZTD is far from the best looking anime-games. \n\nLastly, there are some weaknesses in the story. One twist near the end in particular felt stupid, and though the characters are the driving force of the story, it's really not *them* that are the hook. The mysteries and the events are the interesting part, and the characters (and by extention, drama) suffer from being left feeling a bit flat. But, again, these weaknesses don't ruin the story or the game as a whole. \n\nI like Zero Time Dilemma. I liked it a lot.

Without playing the other two games in the series, it will be hard to understand some of the plot that lies in Zero Time Dilemma.\n\nZero Time Dilemma is not what I expected, at all, and that's not in a good way. I've been waiting for this game since the release of Virtue's Last Reward, and unfortunately, I was highly disappointed by the results. There are a lot of questions from the last two games that go unanswered and ignored, when it was stated in an interview with the creator that all questions that fans had would be answered in the third game.\n\nFrom my understanding, this game was made during a short amount of time, and the resources were very limited, and for a game that had little time to develop, I can honestly say that this game is amazing. But if it were given more time to develop, the game could have been even better. I feel like, in a way, this game was rushed, and a lot of the story elements aren't explained very well. Zero Time Dilemma presents more questions to the player instead of answering the questions that players had been wondering since the beginning of the Zero Escape series.\n\nThe puzzles weren't very well explained, I had to resort to the internet for a lot of them, and the flowchart for events was very confusing. If you don't know what you're doing, you're going to get stuck in this game, a lot. And if certain things aren't explained to you, you may not know what to do to acheive certain endings (for example: having to replay a segment over and over until you receive a better outcome)\n\nFrom a personal standpoint, I would recommend this game for the sole purpose of it being the possible final addition to the Zero Escape series.", "timestamp_created": 1468049576, "timestamp_updated": 1468049650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24200595": {"recommendationid": "24200595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063942011", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471764137}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e45\u6ca1\u6709\u9047\u5230\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e00\u8fb9\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u800c\u6293\u72c2\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e00\u8fb9\u4e0d\u4e00\u53e3\u6c14\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e0d\u8212\u670d\u65af\u57fa\u7684\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u4e86\n\nChunsoft\u592a\u5e94\u8be5\u628a\u524d\u4f5c999\u548c\u5584\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1\u653e\u4e0a\u6765\u4e86\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ca1\u73a9\u8fc7\u524d\u4f5c\u7684\u4eba\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0b\u5b50\u5c31\u900f\u5149\u4e86\u524d\u4e24\u4f5c\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u5c11\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\u5b98\u65b9\u4e2d\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u4e2d\uff0c\u67d0\u5927\u5988\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u88c5\u5b8c\u8fc7\u4e865\u5206\u949f\u6211\u5c31\u5220\u4e86\uff0c\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u51c6\u5ea6\u592a\u5dee\n", "timestamp_created": 1468048167, "timestamp_updated": 1468048167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24197180": {"recommendationid": "24197180", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978273353", "num_games_owned": 636, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1864, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468032868}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game in another story, so go there to see my review.

Play those first or wait for the remasters before playing Zero Time Dilemma.\n\nFor those that haven't played any of the games, here's an example used in the third game that I believe helps encapsulate one of this series' biggest themes:\n\nAt the end of Back to the Future, Marty changes history and wakes up in another timeline where his father is successful and his family is rich. This is Future 2. But, Marty has no recollection of his life in this timeline, all of his memories are when he was poor or from Future 1; He's clearly not the Marty from Future 2, so what happened to the original Marty of this Future 2? Did Marty 1 completely replace the Marty of this new future? What if Marty from Future 2 had a girlfriend or has won contests? All those memories, accomplishments, and experiences are replaced as soon as Marty from Future 1 takes over. Does that mean Marty 2 is essentially killed? Murdered by Marty from Future 1? Where is the rich Marty from Future 2?\n\nI did my best to phrase this example, but one of the best things about this series is that it deals with time and space. It's quite a complex narrative.\n\nOverall, this game series is one of the most well written series ever created; masterfully crafted and beautifully interconnected across all three games, the story is a true spectacle to witness and experience. All three games feature great characters, difficult puzzles, amazing tension, haunting atmosphere, and of course, brilliant twists. This series is a masterpiece. \n\nAs for the third game, it's charming, gut-wrenching, tear-jerking, and complex just like the others; it too delivers an amazing experience and narrative. It keeps you constantly wanting to know more, and the game truly delivers, as twists and turns are found aplenty. As a culmination of the events of the other two games, this is one damn fine crescendo for the series, with the dark themes and stakes being turned all the way up.\n\nThis game is a true treat for fans and I highly recommend the series to newcomers.\n\nA GOOD ASS GAME / 10\n\nA GOOD ASS SERIES / 100", "timestamp_created": 1468018689, "timestamp_updated": 1468520627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734170", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24191673": {"recommendationid": "24191673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022293035", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494987298}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a great addition to the series.

Admittedly, it is the first ZE game I had to wait for, and so perhaps I hyped it up too much in my head. \n\nThe writing, as always, was glorious and to the high standard that was praised with 999 and VLR. Definitely a few \"oh my GOD\" scenes, and once again the writing fitted perfectly together. I feel the ending was a little... eh... (I don't know, it just didn't have the biggest impact for me?) but I still massively enjoyed the game. I do feel that it doesn't have a \"Zero Escape\" feel to it - perhaps the lack of getting to choose the rooms? Also, the timelines didn't really feel like timelines because they were in fragments. I'm not criticizing the production team as I know creating this game was a dream come true for them, and I'm glad they were able to add new aspects into this game that they weren't able to last time. Overall, what I'm saying is: I understand why there was big changes compared to 999/VLR, but this did impact the game for me.\n\nSadly, the graphics were a massive letdown to me personally: the girls' hair was flying randomly in various scenes, and scenes were characters were panicking just looked... awful. There was little fluidity in the animation.

Por mais que \u00f3timo como stand-alone, pois explica toda a hist\u00f3ria, a sua jogatina fica muito mais rica, muito mais emocionante. Ent\u00e3o se quiser dar uma olhada, os jogos s\u00e3o: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors (DS/iOS/Futuramente STEAM), e Virtue's Last Reward (3DS/Vita/N\u00e3o se sabe sobre Steam). Recomendo jogar ambos, mas n\u00e3o precisa caso n\u00e3o tenha tais plataformas. \n\nO problema do jogo, para quem n\u00e3o jogou nenhum \u00e9 simplesmente entender a hist\u00f3ria. Ele cita e usa f\u00edsica quantica para explicar algumas coisas, que mesmo mastigado, fica meio complicado de entender. Simplesmente uma pesquisa r\u00e1pida na wikip\u00e9dia pode te ajudar a entender melhor. Como ele cita informa\u00e7\u00f5es dos dois jogos anteriores, fica meio complicado. Principalmente para pessoas que nunca se quer ouviram sobre a teoria do Gato de Schr\u00f6dinger. E sem contar as v\u00e1rias vezes que voc\u00ea tem que jogar com um papel ou bloco do lado. Muitas senhas s\u00e3o ditas e o jogo pede para voc\u00ea colocar, ent\u00e3o anote sempre algo. Sem contar para as escape rooms, que voc\u00ea VAI precisar.\n\nBem, o jogo usa um mecanismo de fragmentos. Por motivos dentro da hist\u00f3ria voc\u00ea nunca sabe aonde est\u00e1 no flowchart. Que \u00e9 bem \u00fatil para se entender. Mas por ser via fragmentos e ter um flowchart, ele tem v\u00e1rios caminhos diferentes (Sim, voc\u00ea tem que passar por todos eles para completar o jogo) e transforma o jogo em um jogo que at\u00e9 a metade dele, voc\u00ea s\u00f3 vai entender os personagens e as salas. Por que a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 uma completa confus\u00e3o, e come\u00e7a a fazer sentido depois de fazer v\u00e1rios fragmentos, ent\u00e3o jogar o jogo por uma ou duas horas n\u00e3o \u00e9 o mesmo que mais pra frente.\n\nAs 'Escape Rooms', s\u00e3o apenas salas que voc\u00ea \u00e9 posto dentro, e que por algum motivo voc\u00ea precisa completar ela. Ela \u00e9 famosa na s\u00e9rie e tem em todos os jogos. ZTD n\u00e3o seria diferente. As salas n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o complicadas de se fazer, pode empacar aqui ou ali mas apenas apertar em tudo j\u00e1 te faz fazer ela. Lembrando que tamb\u00e9m existe exerc\u00edcios de matem\u00e1tica intermedi\u00e1rios. Pode ser um problema mas nada imposs\u00edvel. E creio que a sala mais dif\u00edcil, ainda est\u00e1 no VLR. Enquanto no ZTD elas tem suas peculiaridades, mas n\u00e3o fazem o jogo ser t\u00e3o chato a ponto de dar um tempo de jogar.\n\nPor mais que o jogo seja o \u00faltimo, e fora dito que responderia quest\u00f5es do jogo, ele deixou bastante coisas em aberto. Bastante buracos e paradoxos. Ou simplesmente \u00e9 complicado pensar e ver l\u00f3gica. Mas respondeu todas as perguntas, principalmente as hist\u00f3rias dos personagens.\n\nSua trilha sonora \u00e9 incr\u00edvel, feita pelo compositor Shinji Hosoe, faz cada momento ser um cl\u00edmax. Momentos s\u00e9rios e tristes realmente marcam voc\u00ea. At\u00e9 mesmo uma sala que tem um cora\u00e7\u00e3o batendo, que lhe d\u00e1 calafrios e desconforto que ajudam a entrar na atmosfera do jogo. \n\nZTD \u00e9 um jogo incr\u00edvel, com uma hist\u00f3ria surpreendente e v\u00e1rios turnos. Ficar de boquiaberto e gritar 'N\u00e3o! N\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel! Ah n\u00e3o por que?!' \u00e9 algo comum aqui. Suas anima\u00e7\u00f5es deixam a desejar, mas o jogo continua lindo. Sua m\u00fasica que merge bem com a atmosfera, e seus personagens cativantes. Um pouco confuso no in\u00edcio mas se desenrola perfeitamente.\n\n\u00c9 um jogo que \u00e9 muito bom, talvez para voc\u00ea, valha apena apenas na promo\u00e7\u00e3o. Mas se estiver, compre. Pois \u00e9 uma das melhores s\u00e9ries no mercado.\n\n(Lembre-se de avaliar an\u00e1lises, me ajuda a saber se estou falando no caminho certo :) )", "timestamp_created": 1468001429, "timestamp_updated": 1468001512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24186326": {"recommendationid": "24186326", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998427089", "num_games_owned": 688, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496269487}, "language": "english", "review": "A great conclusion to one of my favourite series' of all time.

By no means is this game [i]bad[/i], but if you're someone who played the previous two entries in the series (999 and VLR) and was expecting the same quality in Zero Time Dilemma you're out of luck.\n\nIf you're new to Zero Escape the basic story of ZTD is that nine people are trapped in a bomb shelter and the three groups of three that they're seperated into must work together in order to escape. Each group has their own story and a leader that you \"control.\" There are heavy Sci-Fi elements and psychological horror (but only if you're new to the series). There are two distinct parts of the game. The story or \"Cinema\" section is what you spend the majority of your time playing, and it consists entirely of cinematics and the occasional Choose-your-own-adventure-esque choices. The actual gameplay or \"Quest\" section consists of solving various kinds of puzzles in order to escape from your current room\n\nPros:\n[list]\n    [*]Concludes an amazing series.\n    [*]Controls. Being able to use a mouse to pan the camera is much faster and more convenient than it was in VLR.\n[/list]\n\nCons: \n[list]\n    [*]Animation. ZTD ditches the usual visual novel 2D or 3D sprites in favor of 3D models that unfortunately venture into the uncanny valley with their stiff movements and lack of proper emoting. It is hard to empathize (or even sympathize) with the characters when their faces don't match the horrors they are experiencing.\n    [*]Story. I can't say much on this topic without massive spoilers from the previous entries in the series, but I [i]can[/i] tell you that dialogue involves a lot of retconning and exposition, which is fine for new players but not for veterans of the series. There was also multiple plotholes (even more if you played the first two games) that reduced my engagement with the story even further. I feel like the story could have been better if they took all the time they spent on exposition to further flesh out the relationships between the characters.\n    [*]Gameplay: The puzzles in this game are much simpler than the ones in the previous entries, and involve more repetition. After finishing a particularly tough room, there was less of a \"Yes! I did it!\" and more of a \"Finallly, it's over.\"\n[/list]\n\nUltimately, this game was a disappointment for me. I absolutely loved VLR, and was extremely excited about playing ZTD, but the game fell short of my expectations in almost every category. But, like I said at the beginning of this review, the game isn't bad, especially when you consider the fact that we almost didn't get this game at all. The previous entries in the seties had amazing reception but not sales, so this game was originally scrapped until an outcry on social networks convinced the higher ups to back this game. If this game had a better budget I would imagine most (if not all) of my complaints about this game would go away, but this is what we got, so I'll take it.\n\nTL;DR: I give this game a superposition of my thumbs being both up and down.", "timestamp_created": 1467965492, "timestamp_updated": 1467965611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24175323": {"recommendationid": "24175323", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999309428", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468170214}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent game, will keep you on your toes until the very end", "timestamp_created": 1467959042, "timestamp_updated": 1467959042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24173793": {"recommendationid": "24173793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118460174", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469595084}, "language": "english", "review": "Your mind will be ****ed so hard, so many times, you'll think that your brain processing speed has increased by a rate of \u221a6.\n\nSeriously, if you've played 999 and VLR and you haven't played this yet... you're missing out.\n\n10/10,  would deal with edgy emo Junpei again.", "timestamp_created": 1467952127, "timestamp_updated": 1467952127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24173156": {"recommendationid": "24173156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154545285", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 1718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504885271}, "language": "english", "review": "[url=https://azusantiara.com/2016/07/08/zero-escape-zero-time-dilemma-review/]If you want a review review with images etc click here[/url]\n\nZero Time Dilemma is the third and final game of Kotaro Uchikoshi\u2019s in the Zero Escape visual novel series developed by Spike Chunsoft and published by Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd. themselves. Players will take control of nine participants, that has been split into three teams. C Team \u2013 Carlos, Akane, and Junpei. Q Team \u2013 Q, Mira, and Eric; and finally D Team \u2013 Diana, Phi, and Sigma. You\u2019ll have to play the Decision Game and put your life, and everyone  lives on the line. Every choice has a consequences\u2026 Players will get to seek a way out of various puzzle rooms filled with mini games that may or may not crack your skull with their difficulty.\n\nThe puzzle rooms are an important element of the Zero Escape series in fact without them the game feels incomplete. I will be honest here that some of the puzzles are really tough in fact I hated a couple of them. Those type in particular where you would have to fit in all of them onto the board. Well as for that I only have myself to blame since I am not a fan of puzzle games and I do not like  to use my brains that much.\n\nI really love how there is no \u201cenforced playing order\u201d. The user interface is filled with memory fragments, and you can experience the story completely out of order at your own pace and choice. In the story after every 90 minutes, the participants will be injected with a drug from their bracelet that is attached on their left hands, putting them to sleep and causing them to forget everything of they have experienced in when they were awake. This means that every memory fragment you jump to it is essentially a new \u201cstory\u201d because they have no clue about the events that just occurred before this, or how they even ended up there at that time. It can feel a little annoying in a sense that many things does not seem logical at all, but all the puzzle pieces fall into place as you continue on in the story and slowly discover the plot that ties everything together.\n\nThe mystery of who Zero really is, alongside with the reasons behind why these nine people have been chosen to play the Decision Game is well hidden and it keeps the reader hooked onto the story with the feeling of wanting more. Zero Time Dilemma is one of those games that will keep you reading through non stop once it gets hooked onto you. Well that is for my case.\n\nTo sum the story in 1 word I won\u2019t say perfect but I would say it\u2019s magnificent. It ties up loose ends from Virtue\u2019s Last Reward answering most questions you provably have after completing Virtue\u2019s Last Reward.\n\nThe writing in Zero Time Dilemma is top notch, it weaves perfectly between tense, logical debates about Alien Hand Syndrome, morphogenetic field theory, funyarinpa [reference to 999], and of course Phi\u2019s chest size. I mean who does not love Phi?\ud83d\ude00\n\nThe new characters introduced in Zero Time Dilemma are very unique as each of them have quite a unique past before I start spewing out spoilers lets stop it there for now. When I first saw the new character Q, I honestly thought he is the evil character here for sure based on previous Zero Escape games but I was so wrong, Q ended up being one of my favorite characters in the cast after some mind-blowing reveals. Similarly with Eric, Mira and Carlos they all at first glance seems like stereotypes 1 would get from a typical game of life and death, but the story quickly changes the players view of them as the player learn more about them.\n\nSome of you that have played 999 and Virtue\u2019s Last Reward you would realize it follows more of a visual novel format where you have to click throughout the game to advance the story, Zero Time Dilemma takes a different approach that ditches clicking through text completely and presents its story in fully voiced 3D cut-scenes which I like. But 1 issue I had is that the animation is bad, well not bad to the point that it is unbearable but bad that some scenes looks really weird [in a funny way] and rough.\n\nSome notable things I would like to also mention that Zero Time Dilemma is probably the darkest the series has ever been. 999 and Virtue\u2019s Last Reward had their fair share of violent deaths and gore, but Zero Time Dilemma does all of that even more. I loved how the psychological elements comes into play and shows the true side of human nature.\nZero Time Dilemma isn\u2019t afraid to show just how disgusting and depraved human beings can get when they\u2019re being pushed into a corner and into despair.\n\nThe game\u2019s soundtrack is absolutely awesome. Some old tracks came back, both in their original and remixed versions. Shinji Hosoe the composer also returns with a new tracks that fits in perfectly with the game\u2019s puzzle rooms and narratives. Music to me is the most important aspect of any visual novel, and the soundtrack for Zero Time Dilemma is just perfect.\n\nAs for the port of PC mine runs smoothly at 60 FPS with no form of performance issue. I do not have much to say here other than the port is runs perfectly for me and I did not run into any bugs.\n\n[h1]To Sum Up[/h1]\nDo I recommend Zero Time Dilemma? Yes definitely though I do recommend you to play through 999 and Virtue\u2019s Last Reward first before Zero Time Dilemma. Zero Time Dilemma tells a compelling story and It knows when to be dark, when to be funny. It also shares some interesting theories which piqued my interest about time travel. Though the ending felt a little vague in my opinion as there are some questions still left unanswered for the Zero Escape Series in regards to Zero Time Dilemma ending.", "timestamp_created": 1467949177, "timestamp_updated": 1488461357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663978", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24171946": {"recommendationid": "24171946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256719446", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467864871}, "language": "english", "review": "As most will agree, it's best of you played the previous two games, 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors, and Virtue's Last Reward, before starting this one.

You CAN play this one first, but know that you will be largely out of the loop for a while (which might not necessarily be so bad, since it would keep one of the major gimmicks of the game alive,) AND will spoil many of the big twists from the rest of the series. This is meant to close the series.\n\n\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll go ahead and say that if you're already a fan of Zero Escape games, then this game should prove no different for you. Good puzzles (and thankfully nothing like the Q room), much death, and many interesting braching decisions to make. Also many answers to questions you might have had from previous games (though there are a lot of things left unanswered, too, unfortunately).\n\n\nI will spoil one thing, and I do feel this is completely necessary for anyone who might be buying the game specifically for an answer to this: [spoiler]For whatever reason, Kyle isn't even mentioned once in the game, which was a huuuge letdown for me, since we never found out who ??? was supposed to be.[/spoiler]\n\nThe biggest problem with this game, and Zero Escape in general, is that it relies far too much on boot strap paradoxes and other impossible things for the sake of moving the plot along. While it's interesting in the moment, it makes things needlessly complicated in the long run. On another note, I wish the team with Sigma and Phi had a much bigger role to play, considering the events of VLR. But maybe that's just because I loved VLR so much.\n\n\nAnyways, I'm rambling on.

The animation is a bit wonky, which is slightly forgivable considering it is a port of a game for the 3DS. The story does feel a lot less wordy and a lot more enjoyably dynamic than the previous two prequels, which were essentially visual novels with puzzle sections thrown in.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of the first two games, get it.

The previous game, Virtue's Last Reward is as close to a 10/10 as a visual novel can get while Zero Time Dilemma is more of a 6. It's just OK. The decision to tell the story in the way that they did significantly hurt the narrative. All the banter and discovery in VLR is replaced by a series of vignettes that can be played in any order, from multiple point of views. The tension over voting in the AB game, seeing the results and subsequent fallout is absent from this game. The English dub in VLR is surprisingly good, while ZTD is more mediocre to bad. The transition to fully 3d environments for the conversations was definitely the wrong choice. Their faces are not nearly expressive enough and everyone comes off as flat as their voice acting. I found myself looking offscreen so as not to be distracted by their appearance and to better focus on what is being said.

Inoltre, l'atmosfera e il fascino del Decision Game ha lasciato pienamente il segno e ritrovarsi nuovamente intrappolati in un bunker a tenuta stagna \u00e8 un p\u00f2 come ritornare a rivivere quei momenti che mi hanno fatto davvero apprezzare VLR. Ebbene, ZTD di certo non delude, ma l'impressione \u00e8 che questo terzo capitolo della saga di Zero Escape abbia rappresentato un passo indietro rispetto ai due precedenti 999 e VLR. \nIn primis, i dialoghi sono di qualit\u00e0 davvero altalenante, si passa da attimi di puro genio a momenti in cui viene voglia di tagliarsi le vene per non soffrire pi\u00f9 e il plot, a volte confusionario da seguire, mostra il fianco a plothole e spiegazioni bizzare messe l\u00ec giusto per fare il colpo di scena gratuito. La trama \u00e8 grossomodo quello che ti aspetteresti dal seguito di VLR e l'intreccio \u00e8 molto gradevole da seguire, ma la qualit\u00e0 non rimane costante nelle venti ore di gioco. Non aiuta il fatto che, un p\u00f2 per i limiti del 3DS e un p\u00f2 per limiti di budget, al posto di utilizzare la classica interfaccia alla visual novel con riquadro del testo da seguire, siano state utilizzate delle classiche cutscene fatte col motore del gioco e doppiate in giapponese o inglese in maniera non proprio ottimale. Orrende le animazioni e sorpassata la grafica, col risultato che magari queste cutscene non sono francamente un granch\u00e8 da seguire e non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 possibile gestirsi il ritmo dell'avventura mandando avanti il testo premendo un pulsante. \nDiversamente da VLR i rami che portano ai vari eventi di gioco non sono sequenziali, ma si usa un nuovo sistema in cui \u00e8 possibile guardare dei frammenti delle timeline scegliendo tra quelli sbloccati, giustificando questa scelta col fatto che i protagonisti ogni 90 minuti vengono addormentati e cancellate le memorie. Ci\u00f2 fa s\u00ec che la trama a volte sia piuttosto confusionaria, specialmente all'inizio dove si cerca di capire in quale punto di quale timeline si mette un determinato frammento. Nulla che pregiudichi sul serio la fruibilit\u00e0 del plot, che rimane grossomodo interessante salvo particolari scivoloni, ma \u00e8 un dettaglio che pu\u00f2 dare fastidio. \nPu\u00f2 dare fastidio anche il fatto che le prime ore non sono poi cos\u00ec interessanti a causa di un insieme di cattive scelte di design. Il ritmo \u00e8 lento, non c'\u00e8 un puzzle per frammentare le prime cutscene, ci sono spiegoni anche piuttosto logorroici, insomma almeno inizialmente il gioco non fa molto per farsi piacere. Devo ammettere che se non fossi stato un grande fan di Zero Escape avrei avuto davvero poche motivazioni a continuare.\nNiente male il finale che lascia con pochi plot point per sviluppare un seguito che probabilmente non vedremo mai, ma personalmente mi ritengo soddisfatto con la saga nel suo complesso e non sento particolarmente la necessit\u00e0 di giocare un altro capitolo.\nErgo, \u00e8 una visual novel che ha i suoi difetti che di sicuro non la rendono per tutti, diciamo che la sua colpa pi\u00f9 grande \u00e8 semplicemente quella di non essere allo stesso livello di VLR, ma non mi sento di darci troppo peso. I fan che vogliono ritornare a giocare con Zero possono senza dubbio considerare l'acquisto a un prezzo scontato dei 37 euro necessari.

elements and themes directly continue on from the previous two games, [i] 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors [/i] and  [i] Virtue's Last Reward [/i] . It's suggested you play or read up on both before considering Zero Time Dilemma, although as a game by itself it functions perfectly fine.\n\n[i] Zero Time Dilemma[/i]  is a 50% horror/ mystery visual novel, and 50% an escape-the-room game. 9 participants from different walks of life, split into 3 teams, are trapped in an unfamiliar facility and forced to play the 'Decision Game'- a game about fate that incorporates elements of moral dilemmas and consequences of your actions. Players familiar with the 'feel' and style of 999 and VLR will quickly find themselves at home with the non-linear style of storytelling that incorporates elements of quantum mechanics and the multiverse theory. Players navigate the narratives by choosing a team to follow and a 'fragment' of story to experience, with how the fragment ends dependent on choices the player makes. This gameplay mechanic segues nicely into a somewhat spoiler-y plot point to mirror the experience of the participants of the game, and the player will slowly progress through these 'fragments' of gameplay, gathering information from different timelines and exploring possibilities to solve the mysteries of the game. \n\n+ The nature of how the game is played is refreshing and non-linear\n+ Atmospheric soundtrack that enforces feelings of claustrophobia or apprehension\n+ Gripping story involving time travel, quantum mechanics and moral dilemmas\n+ Characters are memorable and all play a part in the interlocking narrative\n+ Rotatable camera and 3D models in escape-the-room segments create a satisfying puzzle solving experience\n\n- Low budget resulted in somewhat janky model animations and poor lip-sync\n- Pacing of some individual story 'fragments' and instances of dialogue are slow, or poorly written\n\n\n\n[i] Plaudite, acta est fabula.

Back then, it was before Virtue's Last Reward was even announced,, before the Zero Escape tagline was introduced.  After Virtue's Last Reward left off on a cliffhanger, I waited and hoped that Zero Escape 3 would manage to break out of development hell and be released to us.  Finally, after several years of waiting, it arrived.\n\nIt wasn't entirely worth the wait.\n\nFirst, a warning.  You will not get the most out of Zero Time Dilemma if you haven't played Virtue's Last Reward at the very least, and I would advise playing 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors as well.  I cannot recommend this game if you haven't played the previous installments.  Thankfully, they have been announced to be ported to PC and other systems, so keep an eye out for them in the future if Zero Time Dilemma interests you in the least.\n\nZero Time Dilemma is the third in the Zero Escape trilogy, a visual novel series that includes \"rooms\" where you solve puzzles to progress to more storylines.  Pathways branch out based on your choices, and every single decision matters.  Will you press the shiny button that has a large warning, telling you not to do so?  Will you betray your fellow teams to escape from your prison early?  Or will you sacrifice yourself so that someone else may live?  All of these are staples of the game series, and you will see the results of your actions over and over.\n\nThe game, however, allows you to use a flowchart to go through the story without having to replay the entire pathline when you hit a point where you lack information, or meet a gruesome end.  This is both a godsend and a curse, as you can see that some paths clearly end, taking away some of the thrill that comes with making a difficult decision.  Given how the storyline is presented in 'fragments', or bits and pieces at a time, it can be confusing to someone who doesn't understand how it works.  I assure you, it will make sense as you continue on and hit key plot points.\n\nYou will experience the story of Zero Time Dilemma through three groups of characters, in three per group - Nine people, a series staple.  You will get to see their pasts, get to know them, only to see horrible fates befall each and every one.  Remember, these people are relying on your decisions to escape, or to endure terrible things.\n\nI enjoyed Zero Time Dilemma, and while it isn't a horrible game, however it falls flat on far too many things to -not- bring up.  While it does give information and some satisfaction to series' fans, as a stand alone game, it has also given me a few plotlines that made me scratch my head in confusion, or be utterly baffled when several key points were simply not brought up again, or glossed over.  I can recommend it to people who've played the other installments, but if not, I would probably avoid it.

games in the franchise and thouroughly enjoying them.  \n\n  To begin, this isn't a horrible game in and of itself.  But it suffers, struggling in almost every area.\n\n  1. New people are going to have an impossible time getting in to it.  It starts slow out of the gate  just trying to catch up newbies with a massive information dump, and it's going to create a lot of head scratching.  There is some dense dialogue about premises from the previous games that is hard to swallow.  Its still possible to approach for new players, but I can't possibly see it being as enjoyable for the first hour.\n\n  2.  For fans of the series, there are some red flags for you as well.  The presentation completely restricts the narrative and makes no sense.  Unlike the previous two games, this isn't strictly a choose your own adeventure story.  By adopting what the game calls \"fragments\", you basically play only snippets of a story, before jumping to another line of the story.  Your choices don't result in a feeling of accomplishment or weight.  Instead of encouraging choices about how to progress through the story, its really just an inane system where you put check marks in a box as you move along.\n\n  3.  And the story.  \n\n  Don't get these games wrong.  There are always puzzles, but the puzzles always play fiddle to the story.  There aren't very many and they aren't hard enough to challenge someone who likes puzzle games.  In the past, this has been okay because the story was so good.  But the story is lacking in this installment.\n\n     The first half is addled by the presentation like I've already said.  The elements are all present to be interesting, but its a slog; however, the third quarter is where this game shines.  For a brief moment, it gains some direction and feels like its headed somewhere big, and the excitement is there.\n\n   But then.  Without spoiling anything.  The home stretch of the story is the most ridiculous series of deus-ex-machinas that I have ever seen.  There are huge concepts that are introduced at the very end with basically zero set up, and, somehow, even less explanation.  \n\n  Its borderline offensive how stupid it becomes.\n\n\n  In summary.  There are moments of greatness, but most of it is a slog.  The puzzles are fine and the story is a slow build that nose dives just as it becomes satisfying.  Players of the first two will inevitably play this, but it won't live up to the previous installments.\n\n  New players?  Just go play the first two games (999 and VLR) if you can get your hands on them.  They are fantastic.\n\n  I was excited to play this game. I loved the first two.  But I am extremely conflicted about this one.

What can I say about it that people haven't already?  Between intriguing mystery, exploring the hidden depths and quirks to the colorful characters, and genuinely challenging puzzles I legitimately fell in love with this series from my first play through 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors.\n\nAll that being said, while this game is a very nice capstone to the series, it feels just a bit lacking.\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with the shift from visual-novel style to a more Tell Tale Games-esque interactive movie.  Only problem is, unlike TTG there's no quick-time events and (whether you love or hate QTE's) that removes a level of immersion from the game.  When you're reading the events visual novel style in the first two you can't help but be drawn in, and with TTG knowing that a dialogue choice or QTE waits around every corner means you're constantly on the edge of your seat.\n\nZTD, however, lacks both of those.  You still make choices and explore the consequences that unfold, but it's always after watching a scripted sequence that, admittedly, can run a bit long.  The puzzles also feel just a bit less challenging than I'm used to from this series, and the fact that the gameplay is broken up into multiple \"Fragments\" means that the story has a disjointed feel to it while trying to play since after each big decision you're getting booted back to the menu to pick a new memory to play out.\n\nOf course, those complaints are middling compared to the fact that this is a worthy conclusion for the Zero Escape Trilogy.  Any complaints I may have are pointless since if you're already a fan you've probably already got it and if you aren't you're doing yourself a disservice trying to skip the first two and jump into this.\n\nMy overall opinion?  A good game, nice way to end the series, but it unfortunately feels like this all really peaked back in Virtue's Last Reward.", "timestamp_created": 1467858158, "timestamp_updated": 1467858158, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24147504": {"recommendationid": "24147504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036737964", "num_games_owned": 551, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 1609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467855780}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] \u0412\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435! \u042d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0438!

I loved 999. I didn't really like VLR because it rehashed a lot of things from the Infinity series and expanded the story to what I believe was a very forced conclusion (so suddenly the entire world perished due to a never before mentioned deadly virus, huh? Okay...)\n\nBut I still believed in this third installment and honestly thought something amazing like Ever17 or 999 could come of it.\nIt didn't.\n\nI'm sure you're now wondering \"wait, why is his review positive then?\"\n\nTruth be told, as a puzzle game, ZTD is very solid. Some ideas for puzzles were overused, but outside of that it's pretty good.\nAs a story-driven game, I was actually rather pleased with it until it's later parts. It had a generally strong narrative that kept you interested and many nice ideas: the fragment system is confusing at first, but a very nice system because it allows for the player to experience the story in different ways and slowly fit up the pieces him/herself. The idea of hopping through timelines with codes and passwords also comes back, though as with VLR it could've been implemented better, I think. The Decision Game was also quite interesting with all the dilemmas piling up.\n\nSo, why did I say I was disappointed? Well, the central twist over Zero's identity and the ending.\n\nI'm sorry to say, but that was just completely stupid. It was a twist so absurd that any sort of sense of desbelief is thrown away through the window. You have to experience it to believe it. That one single thing brought the entire game crashing down for me. And the ending that followed was alright, but weak and full of plotholes. Ever since VLR, the Zero Escape series is full of plotholes, but ZTD promised to adress those. Not only did it not offer any satisfying explanations, it created even bigger holes that I believe will never be adressed. The mechanics on how the science works in the story just make no sense at all and are inconsistent from game to game. There is one particular ending (you'll know which one) where one of the characters could've actually resolved the whole problem, but that character is so incredibly dumb that he doesn't. Trust me, you'll know what I mean.\n\nWith that said, this is a positive review.

I mean, I liked it all the mystery and suspense in some points. [spoiler]And at D-Team End 2, I legit cried.[/spoiler]\n- IQ is good, even with some lowres textures here and there. Got no crashes, only a minor sound bug.\n- [spoiler]The ward twist was really well played, I didn't make the connection until the game told me so, because I thought it was the same case with VLR, 2 floors. Well played, game.[/spoiler]\n- Diana is the best character on this game IMO, [spoiler]having to see her breakdown on the path to end D-2 was really hard on me.[/spoiler]\n- This game is so gory, like, holy crap. They weren't kidding when they said wanted a higher rating. The pictures in the screenshots don't do justice to the game proper.\n- English voices are top notch. [spoiler]DC Douglas (Wesker in RE5) as Zero? Yes please.[/spoiler] Haven't played in Japanese, so I won't comment on that.\n- [spoiler]The ending was definitely... something. I have to say I wasn't expecting it but at least it worked and made tons of sense. I'm more surprised than anything.[/spoiler]\n\nThe bad:\n- The fragments system. I missed one scene and for God knows how long, I was stuck on the game, unable to progress further. A large punishment for a single mistake.\n- The stiff animations and horrible lipsyncing do not improve as the game progresses, some scenes are so awkward because of them. It is a port of a handheld game, but still.\n- [spoiler]The 'Who is Zero II?' twist was so awkward, I mean, you can make a deduction way before he appears, and know his identity, like in half game, even before that.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It was very hard to me to like Eric (I guess that is the same to anyone), a guy that panics over every single damn thing. I mean, he is supposed a 'regular' guy, but in the last quarter of game, he goes on carrying a shotgun, falsely accusing people and shooting them.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Mira being 'that' is so much an untwist it hurts. Also she is undirectly responsible for everything that happens, in all games. Way to go.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]At the same time I was surprised about the ending, it's so damn open, I really doubt that this is the end of the series.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game is quite \"short\", if you know what you're doing.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall, a good game, but it suffers (IMO) from the 'middle child syndrome', strangely, more plots are opened instead of closed because of this game. I'd say that VLR is the better game in terms of puzzles, but ZTD has a better story and tries to keep the suspense up all times, while VLR drops it right at the middle. I haven't played 999 yet, as I await for the Steam port of it.\n\nI'd rate ZTD an 8, an solid game experience, full of deaths and nice stories branches. And complex motives.\n\nAlso, the Decision Game. [spoiler]2 in binary is 10. Once you played it, you'll understand.

It's still a good game, with a variety of interesting twists and mind boggling time line bending, but at the end of the day it fails to pull it's own weight. \n\nFirst thing's first: The Cast.\nZTD is played through three groups of characters, Q team, D team and C team. Sadly, C team, containing Sigma, Phi and Luna, character's we know and love, play a surprisingly small part in the game. Phi is a grave casualty in this situation, receiving far too little screen time for such an important character, and while Sigma and Diana have reasonable time, their existence is more about establishing their relationship than strengthening their characters.  Carlos, leader of team C is a new character introduced, who is a perfect flawless John Doe fireman, but still manages to come out as one of the better characters if you can ignore his backstory being ripped out of a Disney film. Junpei and Akane are back and better than ever as the co-members of C team and they hate each other... For roughly five minutes. After that Junpei is hunting for that poon once more and Akane is talking about how she could never live without him, even though he's become a wildly cynical dick.  Then, there's Eric, a ceaselessly whiny, trigger happy fellow who spends almost all of his time on camera screeching about this or that. Mira, a girl who loves from the heart for the heart, and manages to scratch that 'angsty, just not quite realistic murderess' that everybody knows and loves. Last but not least, your friendly robotic child and a dog that everyone has an absurd affinity for.\n\nThe Animation!\nIf you're looking for some constant uncomfortable uncanny valley in your life, look no further. Joking aside, the animation is a nice detour from the previous game's Visual Novel style, as it allows for a little bit more freedom in camera angles, but I do think it ruined the immersion a great deal at some times with the jerky, jaunty movements and sometimes unsynced voice/lip movements.\n\nPlot:\nThe plot of ZTD was good. Kind of. It was good as a stand alone game. However, if you're expecting Akane to talk about her brother who loves her dearly, that's not going to happen. If you're expecting to ever hear about K, tough. The previous games are mentioned in such small amounts that, while it would be nice for new players, it is incredibly disconcerting for someone who wants to know more about the mysteries left over from previous games. Still, there were good twists sprinkled about, and while it did dip into the melodramatic from time to time (see; Maniacal laughing, unnecessary murder, WHO KILLED MIRA?!), over all it managed to handle the situations portrayed well.\n\nEnding: (This is where the spoilers really really start, so turn back now.)\nThis is where the game fell off the most. The ending for ZTD was a huge disappointment. Once again, everybody was trapped in this facility because Zero had the good of mankind in mind. Well, more exactly he had 'Complex Motives', and needed to bring himself into existence even though that creates a paradox of it's own. Then, there's the fact that, assuming as the implication has been that this is the last game in the series, we don't even know who our villain is. It's just some terrorist who we know nothing about. Free the Soul, Brother, Left, Crash Keys, Cradle, throw them all in the same pot cause they're all good guys at the end of the day and you're never going to know who the real bad guy is. \n\nVLR's ending left a huge promise for what ZTD was going to be about; Sigma and Phi trying to stop the outbreak of Radical 6, with the help of some other company from that timeline who never appear in this game. Instead we got a soft boiled, poorly connected rehash of past Zero Escape games where Sigma and Phi played a surprisingly small part.\n\nOverall:\nOverall this game is a good game, contrary to what everything in my review says. If you liked the other Zero Escape games, you kind of have to play it to experience the ending, but know that it won't live up to it's predessesors in anything other than psychobabble. If you just want a different, story based game with puzzle elements, go for it. You'll definitely find yourself missing something, but it's something unique, and that much is nice. Preferably play the other games first though. More or less just buy the trilogy and be disappointed but not entirely crushed by this one. \nEnjoy!\n", "timestamp_created": 1467800731, "timestamp_updated": 1467800731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24130853": {"recommendationid": "24130853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017828674", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468153272}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 recommended if you like riddles/puzzles and want to play something that will leave you weeping and screw with your mind, play 999 (9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors) and Virtue's Last Reward before this though.", "timestamp_created": 1467800417, "timestamp_updated": 1467800559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.977654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24128440": {"recommendationid": "24128440", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990638511", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467761326}, "language": "english", "review": "Game takes the impovements made in ZE:VLR and rolls with them in an even better story.

Any time there is a choice.. or what Zero calls the \u2018Decision Game\u201d the team leader has to choose between options A,B, or sometimes C and D. Each choice has the potential for dire consequences for either one or more people. In addition to that, the scenes are all out of order. That\u2019s done seemingly intentionally as so many aspects of this game are. This is rationalized by the devices the captives wear on their wrists. They inject them with a sedative and a compound that makes them forget every 90 minutes. This means you have to try and figure out and piece together the true sequence of events and also which events you need to try and avoid as they may cause the deaths of multiple people.\nThe complexity of the game continues on further with at least one of the captives may not be all they seem to be, adding in even more intensity and general mistrust.

by all means should not exist...but thanks to the love of the developers and the passion of the fans this game is finally here !!!\n\nBy all means this game is by and for the fans if you haven't played the other games ( 999 and Virtue Last reward ) you should not play this game, wait for a few months because 999 and virtues last reward are coming out for PC !!!!\n\nThe major diference from the other games is that it gets rid of the Visual novel style to a more cinematic aproach probably to appeal to the West.. unfortunatly it ends up feeling cheap and with such a low budget it really was a bad idea.\n\nThe game itself is about solving puzzle rooms and watching cutscenes and also making choices..\n\nThe main attracion here is the story and the characters.\n\nUnfortunatly as I stated at the beginning the games ending is a huge let down, and is not at all as tight and epic and emotional as 999 and Virtues Last reward.\n\nThe twist are decent but not impressive and the ending is a horrible to say the least, you can see how they were constricted by budget and time.\n\nThe worst offended will be the people that come from Virtues Last reward and 999 fresh and start up immediatly Zero time dilemma they will see how low quality everything is, from the story to the characters.\n\nThe game was supposed to answer all the questions fans have in a big epic conclusion to a beloved series, but ends up feeling cheap and lazy.\n\nin the game we play as 3 players divided in 3 teams.\n\nTeam D which was written by the creator,\n\nTeam C and Q which was written by some other people and it shows so so so much how bad the other teams are in comparision, Team Q especially suffers from 2 horrible characters and only 1 good one.\n\nReturning characters are just not doing much at all, it feels like they are just there because they have too..\n\nI think a big issue is the and it shows in VLR  in which ushikoshi spend 3 years planning and wirting hyping the 3rd part up so much that when the 3rd part was not greenlit he dropped it and when it was greenlit he rushed it too much.\n\nThe music as well is a huge let down compraed to the other 2 games...\n\nwith the epic songs being remakes from the last one...\n\nIn the end I enjoyed the game I wont lie, the puzzles are nice and fun and the beginning and mid story are great.\n\nBut the characters, the ending, the overall feeling of cheap budget and rushed story really left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nBuy this game if you are a fan and have played the other 2, if you havent played those DO NOT play this one as it spoils major plot points and great twist right at the start of the game.\n\nIt is still a good game but it is a mediocre zero escape game.\n\nScore 7.5/10\n\nAchievement Difficulty: 2/10 it's

The TellTale-like, full cinema narrative ended up as quite engrossing, but still rough around the edges. When models are a bit constrained to samey lip-syncing and paired up with all-too convenient camera obscuring angles, it sometimes comes off as a bit cheesy.

Due to the new structure, this game refrains from doing it as much, but it's almost to a very, very draining point.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, I keep finding that Uchikoshi relies on the same tropes and concepts throughout all his writing, so it kind of leaves me less excited or even easily predictable. However, I still enjoyed the ride, and his perspective to address the visual novel or choose-your-adventure medium is fascinating. I do enjoy how much this game builds up on both of the previous installments' points and moments, which makes it even more essential to read 999 and VLR.\n\nBut fans coming into this, and it's important since it really MAKES the experience to have read 999 and VLR --- if you're a fan, this conclusion to the trilogy is going to be very satisfying. With references to Back to the Future, Doctor Who, all the fanservice plug-ins, and tying the most vexing cliffhangers from before up, you'll be happier than one snug, Funyarinpa in a rug.", "timestamp_created": 1467746987, "timestamp_updated": 1467746987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24115935": {"recommendationid": "24115935", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986310914", "num_games_owned": 4064, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467743532}, "language": "french", "review": "Dernier \u00e9pisode de la trilogie Zero Escape, ZTD est tout simplement incontournable afin de connaitre la raison des \u00e9v\u00e8nements survenus pendant Virtue's Last Reward.

Bonne nouvelle, les deux jeux devraient \u00eatre publi\u00e9s sur Steam prochainement !\n\nConcernant le jeu en lui m\u00eame, il abandonne un peu le format Visual Novel pour un mode cut-scene / cin\u00e9matique qui n'est pas sans rappeler les jeux Telltale.

You can tell they tried to fix it by using camera angles that point towards the ceiling during some dialogue, but it doesnt mask the fact that the animations were very subpar. This gets a bit of a pass from me since aksys was trying to do something different on a fairly low budget. The game would have been better as more of a VN with some 3D animations like VLR was, but props for trying something new.\n\n-The dub is worse than VLR. In VLR there was only one voice I didnt like (clover). Whereas ZTD has several bad choices. Akane and Eric are pretty Bad. Junpei and Diana have their moments where they fit perfectly, but other times they sound very out of place. Props to Matt Mercer and Karen Strassman for their performances as sigma and phi, as well as D.C. Douglas' outstanding performance as zero, which were head and shoulders above everyone else.\n\n-The story was great as a self contained narrative, but in doing so they clearly retconned a bunch of stuff from VLR. I wont tell you which, but I will advise you to try not to be too disappointed if you don't have all your questions answered. On the bright side ZTD asks a bunch of new questions and answers them beautifully. So please go in with an open mind, and get ready to have it blown the fuck away.\n\nPS: Play 999 and VLR first, its not mandatory to understand ZTD but they're great games and this game will spoil the fuck out of them in the first 2 hours.", "timestamp_created": 1467744018, "timestamp_updated": 1467744108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24115661": {"recommendationid": "24115661", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980658419", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469399908}, "language": "english", "review": "A suspenseful, thought-provoking conclusion to the storyline began in Virtue's Last Reward and a worthy entry to the Zero Escape franchise and the 'escape room' genre.

You can tell some puzzle rooms are much more well thought out than others. Difficulty also varies from easy to challenging. \n\nOne of the things I love about this series is the way they smoothly mesh actual science, theoretical science/ pseudo-science and science fiction. This game does not dissapoint there. It made me search stuff up so thats a plus (?).\nAlso, this series is the only game I play with a pen and paper to write notes down. There is an in-game memo pad, but writing in that is like trying to write with a wet bar of soap especially if you're using controller.\n\nInstead of the 'smack in the face' mind blowing plot twists that I experience playing the first 2 games, this game had me realise where the story was going as clues were fed to me. Although there were a few surprises. [spoiler] Although I sortof felt that some of the twists had been done by the previous 2 games. [/spoiler]\n\n[strike] The ending was alright, but it left me slightly hanging about the details of what happens to characters. [spoiler] One thing that nags at me is Mira. What happens to her? Does she just get away? She is a psychopathic serial killer and many of the characters at the end knew she was a psychopathic serial killer :/ [/spoiler] [/strike]\nEdit: Turns out there were additional notes added after you complete the game talking about the details of what happens to characters :D\n\nI agree that the animations are clunky and it seems the devs realised this so they try their best to minimise animations with cinematography tricks that obscures parts of the model or do stuff off screen. The character models are good though.

This game consists of cut-scenes/visual novel parts, and puzzle solving components, and is generally about nine people and a dog trying to find a way out of an underground shelter, with escape rooms, that they are trapped in. Playing the previous games of the Zero Escape series is highly recommended since there are many recurring characters from previous games, and many references to the previous games.\n\nStory: The story is laid out so that you watch/play fragments of the story from the perspective of different characters/teams at different points in time, similar to puzzle pieces, and you piece the fragments together to get the whole story. I found this way of presenting the story to be effective since it makes it easier to connect with the characters since their memory is usually erased in every fragment. I liked how may loose ends in this story and the story of the previous games were connected and explained but I feel there are still a lot of loose ends and too many Deus Ex Machinas were used; it seemed really random how special super-advanced technology that no one in that universe has heard of/knows about would randomly be found, and how the antagonist would just happen to have a special ability. Compared to the plot of the rest of the games in the series, I would say this game has the weakest plot. Although there were some components of the plot that were based on facts and pseudo-science, I felt disappointed since there were a lot fewer components compared to the other games in the series. Overall, I would rate the story 7.5/10 since there's a plot twist I did not really notice until a bonus ending was revealed, otherwise 6.5/10 without that plot twist.\n\nCharacters: The characters were great. Each had their own detailed backstory and each character was unique in their own way.  The personality of each character really reflected the past experiences mentioned in their backstory and matched the plots of the previous games in the series for returning characters. Overall, I would rate the characters 9/10.\n\nArtwork/Graphics: The artwork was great. Most rooms in the game were pretty detailed. For a VN/puzzle game, the graphics are great. Nothing to complain about, except, maybe, use different models for the characters that are forced to live on minimal food for 10 months. Great artwork/graphics overall, 8.5/10.\n\nMusic/Sound: Music and sound effects were excellent. I liked how they reused the soundtrack from the previous games for emotional scenes relating to the returning characters. Really catchy music and nothing to complain about the sound effects. The voice actors were also great, nothing to complain about, except I would prefer having al lthe same voice actors from VLR for the returning characters. 9/10.\n\nPuzzles: The puzzles were too easy compared to the other games in the series. I was rarely stumped for any of the puzzles and there were fewer puzzles in this game compared to the other games in the serious. I would rate the puzzles 7/10.\n\nOverall: I would rate this game 8/10. Good story, excellent characters, graphics and music.

Just, wow.\n\nThis was a game. I have been with this series since just before VLR came out and to see it finally reach its conclusion was an extremely satisfying experience. \n\nI was suprised when I first heard this was coming to Steam but was extremly excited to finally play Zero Escape in HD. But enough about that, onto the game itself. \n\nThe first thing I should stress (although I feel like its pointless to say since everyone else is saying it but oh well) is that people should probably play 999 and VLR (virtue's last reward) before jumping in here. Zero Escape focus has always been on its narrative, and although the developers do their best to not put in spoilers, inevitibly plot points from both previous games (999 to a lesser extent but VLR extensivly) are revealed and the player risks missing context or spoiling the major twists of those games if they play this first. The most major of these being the lack of connection to the already established characters and thus not being able to experience the story to a full extent. Luckily for those who don't own a 3ds (999 was exclusivly on ds, VLR on 3ds and Vita) remasters have been announced for steam so soon enough players should have easy access to all 3 games.\n\nI suppose I should mention my problems with the game since it is not perfect, Unfourtunetly we have to once again sit through clunky and strange animations, but honestly compared to VLR this game is nothing and after playing through that this really didn't bug me at all. Also, I understand story was the main focus of this game but the lack of \"escape\" sections in this game is very noticible, especially compared to VLR which had numerous \"escape\" sections while still keeping its complex and compelling narrative. It seems their awnser to this was to make the sections in this game very unclear as to what the player had to do at some points, and this would have been fine if they hadn't removed the hint system from VLR which could help people figure out the solutions themselves without spoiling themselves to the whole escape section and runing the only gameplay sections this game has. \n\nDespite this I can honestly not reccomend this game enough. Like VLR the clunky animations are more then made up for by the steller voice acting that was on point the entire game. The story is immersive enough to warrent a pass on the lack of balence with gamplay. The \"Decision Game\" was a nice change from the usual Zero Escape formula of 9 ruling everything, and it was nice that your decisions actually had a major impact on the overall story, an improvment over the last game's attempt. I was unsure of the 3-team formula (for lack of character interaction) and fragment style storytelling (lack of chronology) but they both ended up working out quite well, the former providing comepelling tight knit inclusive stories that made me care about each character, the later allowing for me to learn things out of order and context and simply fueled my interest further into how some of the things that I saw happened, only for me to have plenty of \"OHHHH, SO THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT\" moments throughout the game.\n\nI have one major complaint to vent about, it does not even pretain to the game or gameplay, but rather what happens after you complete both of these things. Warning: I don't devulge any details here but some might consider this spoilers so I am moving my point to another paragraph so people can skip over if they don't want to be spoiled.\n\nAfter you complete the game, the creators were nice enough to enclude little \"epilouge\" stories in the form of files that provide aftermaths for each of the characters..... with the exception of 3 members, all from the same team. This frusturated me especially because this was my favourite team to follow throughout the whole game and to not see an ending for them is dissapointing to say the least considering the author has already stated this is the last game in the series. However, the writer of the story always does an extensive Q and A in the months following the release of these games in order to awnser any questions people might have (as the games can be quite confusing) and this is sure to be brought up so I am looking forward to his response.\n\nOverall, this was a really good game.

All questions that you wanted answered from the past 2 games will be answered. Only major problem is the presentation of the game.

Gli enigmi continuano ad essere interessanti e mai frustranti, un buon contorno per la storia che la fa da padrona in questa esperienza. Il gioco si completa in circa 20-25 ore.

In ZTD all characters are rendered realtime for cutscenes and regular speech. This means they realistically walk, gesture, and interact with the environment at all times. All characters are voiced everywhere except during room escapes.\n\nThe downside, however, is that despite the technology improvements, it still pales in comparison to similar PC games. The texture resolutions are low, the quality of sound effects is poor, and the English voice acting is awkward in some places. I especially didn't like Zero's voice, as the distortion applied to it made it very hard to hear against the music.\n\nOn the plus sides, the music is still good, and let's face it, we're playing this for the awesome plot! So what can you expect from the plot compared to 999 and VLR?\n\nSince you may have read that the premise involves characters dying in order to escape, this game discards the hand-holding of rules penalties and launches right into making you make harsh decisions that swiftly and callously kill people, before you even encounter a single escape room.\n\nWhen you do begin encountering the escape rooms, you'll find the challenge to be pretty steady, with a few head scratchers that call for some deep logic and note taking. No disappointments here.\n\nAnd of course the last thing is how the characters fight back. With 999 gently introducing the concept of alternate realities and VLR developing it into a decision tree, ZTD takes the concept to extremes with lots of reality-altering shenanigans. In VLR you made decisions and followed the tree as far down as you could go, where in ZTD it is more episodic. You make one set of decisions, and then that fragment of story reaches a conclusion or cliffhanger, and you are invited to continue that branch later on with a different group. This is a bit jarring in the beginning since it's hard to keep track of when you are in the story, and what decisions were already made. The characters, however, are equally disoriented, so you will get used to it.\n\nOverall great game to conclude the Zero Escape series.", "timestamp_created": 1467663141, "timestamp_updated":

While the puzzles will take the majority of your play time (unless you're a super genius), the main meat of the game is definitely the story and the characters. [spoiler]The story itself is a form of puzzle as well.[/spoiler] Zero Time Dilemma is the last of the trilogy, and while it can be played as a standalone, It WILL leave you with questions. It will also lessen the impact of the story of previous games, so please play them in the \"correct\" order.\n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\nWhile there weren't as many puzzle rooms as VLR or 999, they were still as complex, if not more complex than previously, and as varied as ever. I'd say that each puzzle room took me from 15 minutes for the more straightforward ones, and up to 1 hour for the really weird ones. They were all REALLY fun. Even if I got frustrated, I always ended up enjoying the puzzles after finally solving them. I did not need walkthroughs for these, but a pen and paper were a must.\n\nLots of paradoxical and philosophical thinking, VERY out-of-the-world mysteries[spoiler]out-of-the-dimension mysteries[/spoiler], and overall great story and characters. This is also true for the new characters, even if Eric is annoying almost all of the time. They all get great backgrounds, and they are very well included into the story of the returning cast.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\nOne thing that didn't come up, was alternate solutions to puzzles[spoiler](For Golden Files in VLR, and True Ending in 999)[/spoiler]. And there were few moments when I didn't even see what I was clicking for progression, and a very few moments where I even started randomly clicking things.\n\nWhile the visual quality and style is amazing (in fact, I like it more than the beautiful 2d of 999), the 3d animation is lacking. The same animations get reused constantly, lipsync is almost non-existent and those few unique animations you see sometimes, are a bit lacking. Still miles better than VLR.\n\nThe ending is a very slight cliffhanger. I say that it's that kind of a cliffhanger as to be even good, but I know some who would hate it.\n\n[h1]The End[/h1]\n\nAfter this splendid finale, I can whole-heartedly say: [b]This is my #1 videogame series of all time![/b] Every loose end got cut, and all the questions (that I had) got answered, and the puzzles were mostly amped up in difficulty. As a sequel and a finale, it fills all the check marks and then some, and that's all I could ever ask for.", "timestamp_created": 1467640176, "timestamp_updated": 1498465410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24080714": {"recommendationid": "24080714", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037151258", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467640489}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "I fucking love zero escape series and this game isn't different.

It's highly recommended to additionally play 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, though it is possible to enjoy Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma (ZTD) as a standalone story, then play the other two games as sort of a \"backstory\" later. If you read nothing else in this review, just know that.\n\nZero Escape, as a series, is a prime example of how to write a true mystery thriller story. It keeps the reader guessing and doubting to ridiculous degrees with all the twists, but in the end every major plot point has its place in an overarching storyline and every character plays their part. It's notable that the writer (Kotaro Uchikoshi) sticks to the established rules of his world and story; a keen observer will see painstaking attention to consistency.\nReiterating, the similar and popular Danganronpa, a title which left a sour taste and huge disappointment for me, had big issues with contrivances and downright [i]random[/i] things that were introduced as simple one-time plot devices, as well as how disjointed the story felt from one chapter to the next. This is not the case with ZTD, where each plot element is important and is resolved. Things don't randomly happen; everything has relevance. A player finds themself constantly contemplating each new revelation, no matter how innocuous, because nothing is throwaway. Considering ZTD builds upon two preceding games, what we have is simply masterful writing. Additionally, it is worth noting that the characters are all quite fleshed out and well-written. The player will be spending a lot of time learning more about them as the story progresses, and there is much to learn.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's simple. You are given a menu to view various segments of the story. The structure of these segments comprise of a cutscene, then a decision (that has a real impact on plot) and/or an \"escape room\" (a series of puzzles to find an exit), then another cutscene. Progression happens when the player has enough knowledge from various segments to overcome a dilemma which previously posed as an obstacle.\nDue to the nature of the narrative, it can become difficult to follow the plot sequentially, but ZTD provides a handy in-game flowchart to help the player understand the chronology of events. Speaking of which, I did find the introductory segment of the game a bit repetitive, as I needed to view a scenario many times from different perspectives, but it's ultimately a necessary foundation for everything that ensues; an investment which paid dividends.\nA weak point of ZTD, however, is a somewhat poor presentation, most notably stemming from relatively janky animation quality in the cutscenes; this is most noticeable in scenes with heavy action. A large part of one's enjoyment of ZTD is the ability to accept this. I, personally, was able to get past this, as the animations worked well enough to convey the events as they occured.\n\nIn summary, Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma, despite a rough presentation, achieves excellence in storytelling. It has a lofty ambition to intrigue the player to learn the truth behind the mysteries, and it undeniably succeeds. Whenever the player thinks \"I figured it out!\", a plot twist occurs and dashes those expectations again and again until the player is confused and mentally exhausted, and it is at this point ZTD lays everything out. It is at this point everything comes together, everything makes sense, for a satisfying conclusion.", "timestamp_created": 1467628387, "timestamp_updated": 1467628769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24075898": {"recommendationid": "24075898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025865164", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467599260}, "language": "english", "review": "There are two types of people in the world:\n1) People who have played 999 and VLR.

It has everything you have come to expect from the series; a diverse cast of characters, philosophical and supernatural themes, a heavy atmoshpere, puzzles, and of course, A LOT of plot twists/sudden revelations. However, the game has one major change in the way that the sections between puzzles are presented. The old visual novel presentation with a plethora of text is now gone, replaced with fully voiced cutscenes. The change is a nice one, but the animations are stiff and choppy. The animations can be distracting, but you can't really blame the small team that developed a game which initially wasn't meant to exist due to a lack of funds. There is also dual audio so that was a nice addition.\n\nAll that said, the game is best experienced after having played 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. There are a couple of references to older games which enchances the plot and gives you more insight to a few of the characters.

Not often do I come across a game that makes me say \"holy shit\" out loud, multiple times.\n\nMr. Kotaro Uchikoshi continues to impress and delight/horrify with more engaging puzzles, convoluted plot, mindbending conspiracies, and unfortunate death and dismemberment with his final entry to the Zero Escape series. While similar to the others in style and concept, Zero Time Dilemma still carries enough uniqueness to make it as enjoyable as the others. Overall, I feel that ZTD is an improvement over the previous title, VLR, with better animations, better character designs and dialogue, better audio/soundtracks, and a true ending that isn't full of plot holes.\n\nI have a couple minor complaints. ZTD felt like it was a tiny bit shorter then the previous titles, with 7 endings instead of 9, and fewer, easier puzzles, lacking a challenging endgame puzzle. I'm also a bit sad that the gripping, vivid descriptions of 999 were replaced with cheesy 3D animation in VLR and ZTD. For that reason, 999, the first game, will always be my favorite in the series.

I have been anticipating escaping rooms and choosing my fate in this installment for quite some time, so I have my bias. A mix of Steins;Gate's time travel drama and Danganronpa's bloody intergroup conflict, this story's fragmented plot may seem challenging or daunting for some, but immensely rewarding for those who enjoy puzzles and solving mysteries. \n\nAn absolute must for followers of the series, as this is another hit from the Zero Escape staff. Newcomers should look to experiencing 999 and VLR if possible before diving into this one, as the story involves all three games heavily, and can be confusing for those not familar with the series concepts.\n\nPros:\n-1080p version of what you would be playing on a handheld screen otherwise, good to recognize the devs for making a PC port.\n-same mind trip experience you've come to expect from the series\n-excellent OST\n\nCons:\n-unlike in VLR (the second game), where you could get by without playing the first game, ZTD pretty much requires you to be familiar with the first two games to get the best enjoyment out of it. Either play 999 and VLR first or watch someone LP it\n-an audio glitch where the music will sometimes stop playing during cutscenes sometimes happens, taking you out of sad/tense moments\n-it can be frustratingly difficult to figure out where you're supposed to go in the flowchart next when you've exhausted your visible options.

On one hand, I enjoyed it very much and found that its flaws didn't really dampen the experience as a whole for me. On the other, I can't really give it an unconditional recommendation.\n\nLet me start off by saying that if you are already a fan of the Zero Escape series, you've already played and finished this game - so really, what are you looking in the reviews for now? If you are considering whether to get into the series, the answer is that of course you should - go play 999 and VLR right now!\n\nAs for ZTD itself, it is not without its issues. The good, however, is very good - (mostly) good characters with complex motivations, an interesting plot full of timey wimey and quantum theory bull shit. The story is not perfect by any means; some plot elements are wavering near asspull territory, and some characters lack sufficient characterization, development or a reason to be in the story. The way the story is framed and presented is on the whole very innovative, as the story is told in independent fragments that can (and often must) be played out of order, taking advantage of the medium to tell a story that wouldn't have necessarily worked as a film or book. At some points, you need to do some unintuitive stuff in order to progress the plot, which you wouldn't necessarily know unless someone else told you, and there's a few moments of tedium through the course of the game, but on the whole, the writing and presentation are pretty good - I wish there was bit more banter and fleshing out, and that the story was a bit more meaty on the whole, but on the whole I would say that it's a good and fitting conclusion to the trilogy that I enjoyed greatly.\n\nNow, I have two big qualms with the game. The first is mostly technical - I've had to deal with constant bugs and crashes throughout the whole thing. The interface is clearly designed with a controller in mind and few concessions towards M/KB input - it does work and I played through the whole game in this fashion, but you still can't rebind keys, input text through your keyboard (you instead use your mouse to press keys on your screen), or even get M/KB button prompts - it's all Xbox controller stuff, and you don't even have a helpful guide as to which key does what besides trial and error. While not really a technical issue, it must be said that the animations are just plain awful. It's not really a deal breaker, but everything looks cheap at best and comical at worst (or is it the other way around?) The models themselves are rather pretty and well made, a few low-res textures aside, and the environments are completely acceptable (with the same caveat). Unlike others, I haven't had any framerate issues, but given the bugs and crashes, I don't know if that's enough to recommend this version of the game over the 3DS or Vita versions (which I have not played.)\n\nMy second big issue is that Carlos will never be real.\n\nAltogether, I give this game a solid 8.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1467595251, "timestamp_updated": 1467595528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513892", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24066357": {"recommendationid": "24066357", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005805364", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469739021}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is the third episode of the Zero Escape series.\nYou don't need to play the other two to understand this one but it will spoil both game if you don't, so you should probably wait for their future release on steam or play the console version.\n\nIf you did played the previous games and liked them, you don't even need this review to buy the game and enjoy it.\nPuzzles was okay, music was fine, the fragment system was a good idea and the story got some really nice unexpected twists.

It's an amazing game, but its prequels were so good that they make this game almost disappointing. Nevertheless, it's worth your money.\n\nZero Escape 1, AKA 999: 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors, was a masterpiece. Its story is one of the best in video gaming history. It was clever, suspenseful, and full of mysteries and twists. If you like mysteries, you gotta get 999 if you can. It's available on DS right now (iOS too, but we don't talk about the iOS version. Don't get the iOS version), and it should be coming to Steam soon. Zero Escape 2, AKA Virtue's Last Reward, was also a masterpiece. It gave us another equally brilliant plot on top of good quality of life changes like a flowchart that you can use to jump to any part of the story you've seen, skipping the stuff you've already read. It's available on 3DS and Vita, and should be coming to Steam after 999 does.\n\nThese two games set a very high standard for Zero Escape 3, Zero Time Dilemma, to uphold. And just like Mass Effect 3, it was doing very good at first. I was almost ready to call it my favorite Zero Escape game. Its story was great so far and it held my attention. Its puzzles were already much better than those of the previous Zero Escape games, being more creative and challenging. But then it Mass Effect 3ed.\n\nFor those who don't remember, Mass Effect 3's ending was atrocious. Zero Time Dilemma's final act was silimar. The ending itself was good, but it left many unanswered questions. Many of them were from 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, and I guess I'm OK with them not elaborating on details of previous Zero Escape games to avoid confusing newcomers, but some of them came from Zero Time Dilemma itself. My guess is that they ran out of money; it's pretty obvious they were short on money given the poor graphics/animations. I suppose we'll have to wait for a Q&A to hear the answer to our questions.\n\nUltimately, Zero Time Dilemma's incomplete ending prevented it from being as great as 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. As they say though, it's the journey that matters and not the end, and Zero Time Dilemma had an amazing \"journey\" just like Mass Effect 3. For this reason, I still loved Zero Time Dilemma. If you're a Zero Escape fan, I think you'll end up loving it too. If you're not a Zero Escape fan, you should pick up 999 on the DS if you have one or on Steam when it comes out. You could jump straight into Zero Time Dilemma, but a lot of the game's twists are better if you've played 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. Once you've played through 999 and Virtue's Last Reward, I would say that this game is definitely worth playing.\n\nTL;DR: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1467591325, "timestamp_updated": 1467591325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24065003": {"recommendationid": "24065003", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993753935", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467588179}, "language": "english", "review": "When, what feels like an eternity ago, I was introduced to the, at the time, nearly unknown to the world game of 999, it was nothing short of a revelation.

And yet, how could I expect them to be fulfilled so thoroughly?\n\nSuffice it to say, Morphogenetic Sorrow filled my days. It might've been slightly harder than what I was used to, in both the puzzles and interface, but... On some level, 999 did something scarcely any other medium has ever managed to accomplish with me.\n\nIt actually brought an emotion to my eye. With every second of a story unraveling in front of my eyes, I was reminded of those days I thought long forgotten, of that sacred moment when I launched that very first game of Broken Sword for the first time and had my perception of the medium forever changed.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nWhen Virtue's Last Reward came about, t'was the purest of sufferings, for another console was needed.

A lot of them are remixes from the past games, but the new ones are as great as the old.\n\nThe art style is okay, it's nothing special and looking at the promotional artworks it's pretty generic, but it's good enough for the budget the game had, the problem resides more in the animations. Well, more like the lack of animation in certain scenes. Again it's okay for the budget it had but it's a bit of a shame considering the game went in a more \"cinematic\" direction.\n\nThe Escape Rooms are really fun overall.

Zero Time Dilemma is actually the third and last installment in the Zero Escape series, following Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors and Virtue's Last Reward (both are currently unavailable on Steam, and were originally released for the Nintendo DS and 3DS respectively). These visual novels or adventure games involve people getting abducted by a mysterious masked entity calling themselves Zero, and then being forced to participate in deadly games that put their lives on the line. \n\nDetermining how and why this is happening is the key objective of all these games, with replayability in fact being a critical way of getting all the answers. This does have the downside of basically exhausting all the game's content by the time you're fully satisfied with it, as aside from the jigsaw puzzle narrative, the only other major component of Zero Time Dilemma is its elaborate \"escape the room\" puzzles that, despite some hiccups here and there, provide an excellent challenge and reward patience and critical thinking. Nonetheless, it is a very engaging and compelling experience while it lasts.\n\nThe developers clearly made a conscious effort to ensure that Zero Time Dilemma could be enjoyed as a standalone experience, as all the basic plot points connecting the series together are explicitly laid out, and you shouldn't be too confused about the basic plot by the time it's all over. As a result, a lot of the characters and plot threads from prior games are either marginalized or dropped entirely. This, in addition to the drastic changes in character designs and presentation (not all of them for the better) could make this a somewhat jarring experience for people familiar with the earlier games. However, I'd still strongly recommend playing or looking up the prior Zero Escape games in order to gain a deeper understanding of the series universe (or shall I say, multiverse, *wink* *wink*) as well as the backstories of several key characters that will help you understand them a lot better. I myself watched Let's Plays and read wiki entries on Zero Escape before buying this game, and they played a huge role in shaping the way I experienced it.\n\nAll in all, this is a fundamentally sound and entertaining thriller that will keep you thinking long after you're done with it, and though it's far from a perfect game, I highly recommend it if there's room in your budget for the price tag.",

Not perfect, but certainly better than average and worth playing. The best way I can rate it is by comparing it to its prequel, Virtue's Last Reward.\n\nOn the plus side, ZTD completely drops text narration. In my opinion, this is better than being half of a Visual Novel like VLR, because once you voice the dialogue you are left with perfunctory narration that simply describes routine actions. Seeing those actions animated gives you more time to see the story and character development and less time reading about someone reaching into their pocket or furrowing their brow. ZTD only reverts to text conversations during puzzle rooms, where you wouldn't want to wait for the VO lines anyway. Also [i]blessedly[/i] absent are VLR's constant shoehorned bad attempts at wordplay (\"jellyfast\", \"hoption\"). Characters joke with each other occasionally but the jokes are never really awkward.\n\nIt's also nice to have static teams who have a general interest in working together. VLR's characters felt unrealistic because of how willing they were to directly cause the deaths of most or all the other players. This is a big step up from that. There's also a lot more violent imagery and on-screen deaths which allows the characters to show how devastated they are by the consequences of their actions.\n\nPuzzles are logical and satisfying to solve, for the most part. There's good variety between math, object hunting, and experimentation. Rather than having an explicit \"Easy\" setting, characters will gradually comment on the puzzle if you continue to exit the puzzle and re-enter; you can click through these conversations without reading if you adamantly do not want hints. There were no puzzles where the English localization caused problems.\n\nOn the flip side, the story\u2014while it has twists that I REALLY enjoyed\u2014doesn't end on a perfect note. A few things set up in this game and in VLR are left unresolved; I had hoped for a fantastic ending and got one that was merely good.\n\nThe character models and animations are not that great. Diana's skirt in particular looks bad whenever she's not standing up. Some of the running animations look like a first-year student's homework. The mouth animations aren't detailed enough to accurately match their speech. It looks like it was rushed, but it's probably also the result of the game needing to run on two handheld consoles. A PC game that is basically nothing but cutscenes (not that I'm calling that a bad concept for a game, obviously) ought to at least look comparable to other PC games at the same price point.

Once and only after you've done that play this game.  Even then I would replay both games and read up as much as you can on it as the story in both games, and the philosophy, is super deep and tense.  To put it as short as possible this game is a hallmark in story telling, it has incredible voice acting and the are enough shocking story moments to keep you spinning in your chair or on your couch.\n\nMy only gripe is that coming from VLR the almost non-linear pathing can get pretty confusing sometimes.  I appreciate what the game is doing by introducing 3 main protagonists of sorts, or 3 main story groups, but it's very hard to keep track of the time lines that youre in when you choose them.  In VLR everything was linear in a sense where you followed a natural progression til you hit a dead end or a make a decision.  Here at anytime you can be kicked out of what the game calls a fragment and you need to either join another fragment or another character teams fragment - again this just causes a very disjointed story at times.  In the end after 100% the game it is understood more or less but it be confusing at the beginning - whether this was intentional is debateable as your characters in game are given a drug that causes them to forget usually after ever fragment.\n\nOverall though, I completed 100% as mentioned in under 20 hours.  I will admit that I did use a guide once or two on a few puzzles, some of them are savage such as the one where you need to translate an alien language, think hiroglypics, into a tridecimal number system.  There are also some clues that even after the solution is known are very vague or poorly explained but thats only a small handful.\n\nOverall I will be giving this game a perfect 5 out of 5.  It's a must buy/play but again if you havent played 999 or VLR I would avoid for now, if you insist on playing it I can only assume you wont get the full benefit of it yet - it may only be a 3 or 4 out of 5 for you now.", "timestamp_created": 1467528242, "timestamp_updated": 1467528332, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495569", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24039100": {"recommendationid": "24039100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048496566", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467765264}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, it has some hiccups at the start and at the conclusion, but the framing device for this story is INCREDIBLE.

On one hand, you could argue the storyline and cinematic presentation is the best in the series. The puzzles aren't the strongest the series has seen, but the consequences of the decisions made within the game have a much more immediate effect on the story. The graphics are genuinely not very good, even on PC they look poorly animated even for a handheld game. Many things that were supposedly to be resolved from 999 and Virtue's Last Reward are not actually very clearly addressed (for the sake of spoilers I will leave it at that). There are a lot of great ideas in the narrative and design of the game that take place here, some of which are so over the top I might think they actually destroy any chance the narrative has of making sense. At the very least, I will say I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles, had many laughs and occasionally emotional moments watching the various ways people died and overall hope that if there is a Zero Escape 4, it takes less than four years to come out! 8.8/10, here's to hoping Uchikoshi has a bigger budget to work with next time around.", "timestamp_created": 1467526015, "timestamp_updated": 1467526015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24038780": {"recommendationid": "24038780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073490803", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467627680}, "language": "english", "review": "As many before me have said: Please, first play 'Zero Escape: 999' and 'Zero Escape 2: Virtue\u2019s Last Reward' respectively, before playing 'Zero Escape 3: Zero Time Dilemma'. \n\nThe series as a whole is incredible. I dare to say the best I\u2019ve ever played. I thoroughly enjoyed Zero Time Dilemma. The puzzles were fun, and I loved the silly little interactions like in the previous two games. The soundtrack is wonderful. I loved the gameplay and, in this aspect, think it\u2019s the best out the series. I especially loved D-team: Their voice actors were on point. I loved their story, interactions and endings. They were what made Zero Time Dilemma for me.\n\nThe main story started off fantastically and promising. I was completely hooked throughout most of the game. However, when nearing the end, I got a bit let down.\n\nThe revelation and the true ending were underwhelming. I don\u2019t think they were necessarily bad ideas, however badly executed. Questions from the previous games that the makers promised would be answered and explained, were left unanswered and unexplained. Even more questions were raised. The game by itself is great, but I can\u2019t say that it's a good and proper conclusion to the series. \n\nI'm convinced that I wouldn\u2019t have been let down if they had extended the ending, given certain characters more screen time and backstory, and spent time answering and addressing things from both this game and the previous games. I truly hope that this will be corrected and that we can be given closure. Not necessarily with an expansion or a fourth game, perhaps with a short novel.\n\nThe underwhelming ending doesn\u2019t take away the fantastic moments in the game. Some were my favourites out of the entire series. Despite leaving us with many questions, there were things that did get answered and were given closure. I know that Uchikoshi and co. have done the best they could with a limited budget, and I\u2019m very grateful for this game existing in the first place.

The fragments allow you to piece the story together in the order you choose, but without compromising the in-world character knowledge due to the in-game setup.\n\nThe twist at the end (there is always a twist at the end when you discover Zero's true identity) is simply amazing and has to be experienced first-hand -- try to avoid spoiling yourself before playing.  But once you know, it's also interesting to go back and play through some earlier parts of the game (or watch an LP) to see how you interpret things differently when you know the secret.  On the other hand, it's also important not to rush to the end -- it will lose most of its impact if you're not paying close attention to the journey as well.\n\nThe puzzles are a bit more linear and perhaps a bit more simplistic than some of the previous games, but I don't think that's a bad thing in this case.  Most rooms have just enough to be interesting but not so much that they become a drag, and while you do have to replay some sequences to get all the way through the story, the flowchart system allows you to quickly jump to where you need to be and skip right to the part you're most interested in, so it's never a problem.\n\nAs far as port quality goes, it's decent.  I had no issues on my modest rig (steady 60 FPS at 1080p borderless).  The textures are a little lower quality than some would like, and the animation (especially facial animation) is almost comically bad, but it's easy to get over that and enjoy the excellent voice work and story.  The game is 100% mouse control (there's little to no use of the keyboard, even in places that might have benefited from it); or you can use a controller if you're that way inclined -- but a mouse is a better fit in my opinion.\n\nThis is one of those rare games that gripped me quick and wouldn't let go -- I didn't quite manage to play it in a single session, but not for lack of trying (work and sleep can be inconvenient sometimes).

However, the animations are laughably bad, the voice acting is great save for some cringe-inducing moments, and it is definitely short for my tastes.  What I mean is that I finished this in 23:05:48 accoding to my save file, and my time for VLR was around 43 hours.  999 was about 6-8 hours, but you see my point.  This game was meant to solve everything, and I believe it did.  It gave us the links to 999 that we wanted, and it had its links to VLR as well.

While ZTD does tie up the most important story elements, there are 2 important plot holes that are never explained and a few loose ends from 999 and VLR that don't get resolved.  Overall, it does everything it needed to and is a satisfying conclusion for the trilogy.\n\nPros:\n- It's Zero Escape 3, it's on Steam\n- The story is interesting and very enjoyable\n- Clever gameplay applications of the game's themes\n- Lots of puzzle variety, though 2 simple concepts are repeated a few times\n- Mostly good voice acting\n- Around 25-35 hours long\n- No dice-flipping puzzles\n\nCons:\n- Inconsistent puzzle difficulty; sometimes they're much too easy, other times overly difficult\n- The meat of the story doesn't really kick off for 5-10 hours depending on how you play\n- Some story locks are very tricky to get past (but satisfying when you do)\n- The menu system is more complex than it really needed to be\n- The low-budget character animation can be distracting at times\n- The cinematic camera is tailored to small 3DS/Vita screens and is almost always zoomed in way too close on PC\n\nOther:\n- I don't normally mind blood and gore in games but there are a few places in ZTD where in my opinion they went a bit too far towards \"horror\" rather than 999/VLR's mystery-thriller direction\n- ZTD will be a better experience if you play [i]9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors[/i] and [i]Virtue's Last Reward[/i] first; 999 was just confirmed for an upcoming PC release but VLR may be a long time coming since it's still readily available on 3DS and Vita\n- ZTD has some plot holes but the ones I've seen people complain about the most actually aren't plot holes...

I would've been really surprised if the team behind the first two games in the series suddenly put out a bad game, honestly. \n\nIs the story better than the first two games? Hmm... I like it more than VLR's, but probably not as much as 999's.\n\nThe graphics? Again, better than VLR, but not as much as 999. Yes, I really like the sprites.\n\nThe music? Well, it's got a ton of tracks from the previous two games and some pretty great new ones too, definitely satisfied on this front.\n\nThe gameplay? It's practically unchanged from VLR, except that the text auto-advances. Same puzzle types, same timeline mechanic, decisions that need to be made, and lots of dialogue. I felt the puzzles here were in general easier than the first two games, and there's a bit fewer of them (13 rooms as opposed to the 16 of the first two games). The unique twist here is the non-linear gameplay flow, as in, the game is played in fragments in whatever order you desire (for the most part). \n\nIf I have any complaints... yeah, the animations aren't great, the ending feels a little rushed and the epilogue is text-only, and there's a few loose ends left behind that aren't especially important. But the ride to the ending is great as usual. There are some really terrifying things going on in this game. Disgusting decisions that you have to make to keep the story progressing. Lots and lots of death. Every character dies numerous times on the way to the true ending, in a variety of pretty gruesome ways. Special shout-out goes to [REDACTED] which I got fairly early on and... uh... yeeeaaah, a lot of nausea from that. Oh, I'm not gonna say what though, that'd be spoiling.\n\nBut yeah, is it perfect? Nah. Has issues, as does every game in the series. Do they make me dislike the game as a whole? No. All three games are great. I'd still pick the original as my favorite in the series, especially for the writing and story, but this and VLR are about on-par, and the more vicious nature of this game probably appeals to me a bit more. It's not as long as VLR but there's no repeated sections like VLR had, all the various brances are pretty wholly unique story pieces, the only repetition is a few bits of Zero's dialogue setting up the decision games all three teams play.\n\nAnyways, if you liked the first two games, you will like this one, there's basically no doubt in my mind about that.

Definitely play both 999 and VLR before this one, so you get to gasp in horror three times instead of just once here. But the plot twists in this story alone caused my jaw to hit the ground more than once.\n\nThe graphics are a little bit average (hair glitches all over the place, no joke) but the voice acting is pretty good, and successfully conveys all the emotion of the characters in their moment. Speaking of the characters, in true Uchikoshi style, all of them are real (so to speak) and I love all of them to bits, flaws and all.\n\nAlso, be prepared that to get all of the good endings you'll have to go through many, many bad endings with many, many deaths. The horror tags are no joke, this ish is gory as heck. As the characters are so wonderful, getting all the endings will probably cause you great emotional pain.

Due to poor sales in the homeland, Zero Escape 3 has been delayed and almost cancelled several times, but it finally came to life. And I couldnt be any happier at this very moment. I have just finished one of the best stories of the year, and possibly a masterpiece in its own right that will certainly be remembered as the first title of this genre to finally launch worldwide on a variety of platforms and in full english localization.\n\nZero Time Dilemma picks up when Virtue's Last Reward has left us. This time, the player doesnt just follow Sigma, the protagonist of the second game, and his friend Phi, but a whole group of people, three teams in total, called after the initials of their names. C, Q, D. Everything we knew from the second game is explained in detail through cutscenes and, despite the complexity of the whole storyline, it all fits together nicely at the end, wrapped up in a fantastic package of fresh ideas and exploration of all the tropes involving time travel, spacetime adventures and thrillers.\nI'm not going into details of any kind because virtually everything could be a spoiler and this game, as in typical Uchikoshi fashon, is filled with surprises and twists so hyperbolic that simply nominating them is a sin to the newcomers.\n\nWhat I am going to do, is say that if you like engaging moral choices, lots of decisions with tons of bad endings, and you have a general idea of what Visual Novels and puzzle games are, look no further and buy instantly. Let yourself be driven by curiosity and start the Decision Game. It will be an experience you wont forget. When you think Mr. Uchikoshi couldnt reach higher standards, here you will be proven wrong.

If you can't purchase and play those first two games in this trilogy, then do the next best thing and watch a playthrough on youtube for them both. All three games are excellent and totally worth checking out. And much like you wouldn't start by first reading the third book in a trilogy, you should not play this game until you have experienced the first two. Trust me, you'll thank me later. \n\nZero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma is the final part of the Zero Escape trilogy. The theme of the 3 games is very similar: 9 trapped individuals are forced to take part in a dark and brutal game which makes these participants question just how badly they want to escape and how much they're willing to sacrifice of themselves and others to do so. \n\nIn Zero Time Dilemma, 9 participants are sealed inside a bomb shelter and forced to play what is known as the Decision Game, in which the players are forced to make difficult choices that - in a lot of cases - have severe consequences, including death. Unfortunately, the 9 participants of this game are told that in order to escape, 6 of the 9 participants will need to die in order to open the X-door which leads to freedom. \n\nThe game is divided into 3 different parts: Cinematics, escape rooms, and decisions. In the cinematics - which comprise a large part of this story-driven game - the story unfolds as the various characters interact with each other and occasionally reveal some of their past. In the escape rooms, you as the player must check the room for useful items, solve puzzles, and figure a way to get out. And in the decision sequences, you as the player are forced to make an impactful choice that will lead the story in one direction or another.\n\nThe beauty of this game is that the story has multiple paths and multiple timelines thanks to all the choices you can make. For example, choosing to kill off 3 of the 9 participants will result in a completely different timeline than the one where all 9 participants are alive. Some of these choices can lead to a prompt GAME OVER screen, but others will lead to very interesting plot developments. Thanks to the structure of the story and the players ability to choose which route to take and which section to play, the games story comes together like a beautiful jigsaw puzzle. Some parts might be quite confusing until a different part of the story is played, but when the pieces snap together in your mind it's certainly a euphoric \"Ohhhh!\" feeling. \n\nWithout revealing too much, the game stays true to the rest of the Zero Escape series and delivers some great twists along the way. Once the story gets going, it's a tough game to put down. And then even after it's over, it's likely to stick in your mind for a good long while. \n\nZero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma is an incredibly exciting and compelling game to play, and one that does the series proud.

I was so excited for this game that in the week leading up to its release I barely slept 4 hours a night, and here I am now, not 3 days later, underwhelmed.\n\nNo, that's not quite right. Not just underwhelmed. I'm going to be blunt and say this game is a complete disappointment. \n\nTo start, it's a competent enough port, probably among the cream of the crop of console ports. This was my biggest concern going with the Steam version fearing it would be a buggy mess, but it is very polished. KBM and controller options are available and feel mostly natural, graphical options are available and the game performs at a mostly flawless framerate, and I experienced no discernible glitches. I'm very happy to have been able to play this game smoothly on my platform of choice, so hats off to the team at Chime responsible for the lovely port.\n\nIt's unfortunately all down hill from here. There are several things I could address, like the game being incredibly short, too easy, and with too few puzzles, but I think I should focus on the main entree, what makes Zero Escape so appealing to begin with, and sadly my biggest complaint: the story telling. Gone are the narrations, the protagonist's thoughts, the vivid scene details that glued together dialogue between the cast. \"Novel\" sections of the game are now cinematic cutscenes and all of the details you would have gleaned from the text are instead acted out by a cast of stiff, mechanical, emotionless husks. \n\nDon't get me wrong: the quality of the models is actually quite good, and the animations in and of themselves would be tolerable if it weren't for the fact that they're now expected to carry the entire show. But add in some questionable voice acting, sparse dialogue and a translation that apparently never saw the desk of an editor and you're left with some of the worse scene delivery I have ever witnessed. Characters say exactly and only what they need to say, leaving a skeleton of a narrative with the few bits of meat being painful to watch. Budget constraints, especially for this title, are understandable, but I imagine most of the budget was blown on the cinematic cutscenes that were not even worth the payoff, where that money could have and should have been spent on much more attention to the writing.\n\nI could even see past the delivery if the story itself was any good but it sorely disappoints. The story answers several long standing questions for series fans, while ignoring a few others, all while weaving its own rather self-contained plot that is mostly predictable and no where near as cohesive as the previous games. The attempt at tying this game together with the universe of the first two games feels, in a word, forced, as allusions to (most) revelations in this game simply do not exist in the previous games, making the connection superficial at best. I can't help but feel this came as an expense of making this game's story accessible to newcomers, which it surprisingly succeeds at.\n\nOn that note, however, I can't possibly recommend this game for those who haven't played the first two games, as you're sure to walk away from it thinking it's an entirely mediocre and quite overpriced adventure game. This game feels like nothing more than closure for the fans, and for that matter I am thankful. We got a bad ending, but surely it's better than no ending at all.\n\nIf there's a silver lining, it's that Zero Time Dilemma serves as a poignant reminder to live in the moment: it's the journey, not the destination. The game closes with enough ambiguity for a sequel, but I secretly hope it's never made. It would be impossible for me not to recommend this for fans of the series, but what I really recommend is to never stop seeking the bluebird.", "timestamp_created": 1467456369, "timestamp_updated": 1467456369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24011897": {"recommendationid": "24011897", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998771227", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467526585}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was an amazing conclusion to a great story told in 999 on 3DS and VLR on 3DS/PSVITA.

Then play this game no question. I liked it the least of the series but it is a good conclusion and verry good.\n\nHave you not played/watced 999 or VLR? Don't play this till you play both of those you will be lost and a good chunck of the game will lose a lot of the impact I dont' think a summary will suffice the game assumes you are already invested with the charecters and lore and just asumes you know what's going on.\n\nLonger Explination:\nSo most everything that was good with 999 and VLR is here. I liked the puzzles but they were deffently a lot easyer then the privous games also since you go thrugh the story in random order the difficulty swings wildly but never that hard really. I actuly ended up doing the puzzle room that I found the hardest first and the last puzzle room I ran into was by fare the easyest for me. Also there is signifcantly less puzzle rooms then the privous games I was shocked when I got the you compleated all puzzle rooms trophy.\n\nThe story starts out really strong and ther are some brillent twists. The charecters where all interesting and more belivable with one notible exception. [spoiler] Mira's end character growth was horrible[/spoiler] While I enjoyed the story I felt it got way to sci-fiy and predicable twords the end compaired to the pervious two. The other thing I didn't like over the other games is when you fail story wise you never felt like you had controll or any way to avoid it though it was intentional and effective I just liked how the other games handled it better. \n\nAlso if you notice the game is signifactly shorter the privous two that is mostly beacuse it cuts out a lot of the need to replay full sections and beacuse everyting is voiced they don't overexplain everything and the game is better for it. There is just as much meat to this story as the privous entries it's just more effecent at getting you there.\n\nA lot of complaints went to the animation and graphics of the story sections and honistly while I prefer the text descriptions of what was happening 999 had after like 20 min I stopped noticing and was pulled into the story.

I looked some of the ones up where it was just a factor of luck or going through the probablities a lot.

Two that really screwed me up were the manufacturing stungun sequence and the study shifting down 7 that would make a negative number. If you contemplated that then you know my pain for a pointless hint I already knew! Doesn't everyone combine everything in their inventory already? My favorite puzzles were moving the shapes around to let one pass. Not sure why.\n\nI didn't really like the art direction here.

I was so immersed, and needed to know what happened next.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not NEARLY enough mystery in Zero Time Dilemma. Most, if not all the plot twists and revelations were very predictable, and not once was I surprised by anything that happened. 999 and VLR (The previous games) did everything so much better.\nSome characters are likeable, and some are just brain-dead cardboard cutouts.\n\nNot all of it was bad though. Most of the puzzle rooms were very well done. Some had a good amount of challenge, whilst not being so difficult that you'd have to look up a guide. I DO wish there were more puzzle rooms though.\nThe game WAS an enjoyable experience, so I won't be giving it a negative review, but I regret paying full price for it. I feel a \u00a319.99 price tag would've been a lot more deserving.\n\nI do recommend this game to Zero Escape fans, but it'll be best to wait for a sale.\nAnd I DON'T recommend this game to people who have not played the previous games to completion. Big plot twists from 999 and VLR get spoiled within minutes of starting this game, and why would you start from the 3rd game in a story-focused series anyway?\n\nIf you're waiting for a sale, but want to play a game similar to this, I recommend the Danganronpa games. They're developed by the same company as Zero Escape, and Danganronpa 2 is one of the best gaming experiences I've had in years (But obviously, play Danganronpa 1 first).", "timestamp_created": 1467438730, "timestamp_updated": 1467438730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.728810", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24006409": {"recommendationid": "24006409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121914094", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467436182}, "language": "english", "review": "If you haven't played the other two installments of the Zero Escape series - 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors and Virtue's Last Reward - then you really won't enjoy or understand this game, so play these first and maybe just snag the game now for the early buyer bonuses.\n\nThat being said, if you have played the first two games, then I would recommend also playing the final part, because if you've enjoyed the gameplay of the prequels, the finale plays similarly with a mixture of puzzles and VN-esque decisions, and it's fairly enjoyable. The puzzles aren't too hard; I'm fairly impatient, not that smart, and I played this game on little sleep, and I still only had to consult walkthroughs a couple of times. The decisions and the surrounding gameplay that's similar to VLR is pretty fun and doesn't require that much thinking, although I did get stuck at one or two points.\n\nThe design of the game was something I couldn't quite warm up to, to be quite honest. The music and voice acting were nice enough (I played with the original Japanese sound because I'm a weeb), but the graphic and cinematic design left a lot to be desired. It's probably a matter of personal taste, but the way the camera would cut away ten billion times and the weird attempt to 3D-ify a 2D art style just didn't sit that well with me. It seemed very cheap, to be quite frank. I think part of it is the fact that the PC version is a very hurried port of the 3DS/Vita versions, where the graphics and controls would seem more natural...\n\nEither way, I have a lot of opinions about the story too, but since a lot of people reading reviews will want a spoiler-free one, I can only stay vague. I don't regret buying and playing this game, but I found a lot of the revelations, events, and story choices very disappointing.

I will kinda break this review down into two parts, one talking about the game as a port, and the other talking about the game itsself. Before I go into it however, I must stress that you will get the MOST enjoyment out of this game if you have played 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors on the DS or iOS and Virtue's Last Reward on the PSVita or 3DS. Those games are fantastic, and while you can play this game without having played those, the payoff is most rewarding if you've stuck through the whole series. Also this will basically spoil the previous two games, so that's something else to keep in mind.\n\nSo, first I'll talk about how ZTD is as a PC port. My summary of it is.... it's good. It's nothing extraordinary, but for me it worked perfectly fine and looked nice, at least for being basically a straight port of the Vita version. You get a decent number of graphic options, like multiple kinds of anti aliasing, motion blur, and different screen modes including Borderless Windowed mode. There's not really any adjustment for the actual textures or anything and you cannot rebind keys which is a bummer, but fortunately this game is mostly point and click style, so there's not really much you'd need to change unless you really are gungho about using your keyboard for it. Do keep in mind that this is a game that was originally meant for a handheld with a much smaller screen, so if textures look low resolution, its because they are. It won't be anything offensive graphically, but don't expect something that will blow you away with its PC visuals. It does have controller support which works pretty nice and to me made it a bit more enjoyable, so that is something to consider as well. But overall, decent port.\n\nNow with the port talk out of the way, let's talk about the game itsself. As someone who's been into this series since the first game, I am very happy to say that this was a fantastic conclusion to the series. It wraps up pretty much every loose end left in the series, expands on some things left from previous games, and shakes your core and surprises you just as much as the previous games did, if not more. It does a lot of things differently versus previous games too. They chose to ditch the standard visual novel playstyle, and instead go with cutscenes that are more akin to something like the walking dead. This makes it more enjoyable for someone who prefers something more cinematic. There's only really one drawback to this however, and it's that the animations are.... well, crap. They look pretty stiff and bad, action scenes are pretty stilted and characters feel like planks a lot of the time. Fortunately for the game however, it's more than made up for with the presentation and the writing. The tension of the scenes, the cinematography, and the music all allow you to look past the shitty animation and get immersed all the same. It says a lot that there were moments in the game that were able to terrify me or make me disgusted despite the animations. There's also some complaints that you could make about the English dub, as the vocal performances really do seem to range in quality. However, I played the game with the Japanese audio, which was pretty spot on the whole time. So, that's something to keep in mind. \n\nNow as much as the story is important to the series, what's even more important is  the way you progress through it and the puzzles you encounter as you play. The game has retained a similar flowchart and node system from Virtue's Last Reward while adding some new twists. You can still easily jump to individual scenes and decisions, preventing the need to save scum and waste your time replaying the whole game. What's different here though is two things, the first being that some of the outcomes are actually randomized. I was really worried that this would make going through the choices and branching paths more tedious, but fortunately it does not get in the way too much. It actually helps add some drama and tension to decisions you'd normally just make on a whim to get through all the paths. The other big difference is that the story is delivered to you out of order through various nodes in time for each of the three protagonists. As you play, you will fill out the global flowchart and be able to piece together the chronology of events. This is done very smoothly, as I was able to very clearly and easily piece it all together and make sense of story. That isn't to say the story is simple, it's very complicated as you would expect from these kind of games, but it's smartly written, well paced, and everything mostly ends up making sense in the end. As for the puzzles, there's really not much I can say about them that would be new, they seem to be just as good and challenging as they were in previous games, though I maybe would have liked some more puzzles to progress through overall, as I feel there was a distinct shortage of them. Not that I mind much though, cuz the story's pacing might have been damaged if more were added. But if you like puzzle games, you will probably enjoy these puzzles. I do recommend keeping a pen and paper handy though, cuz while the memo function works nice, you'll get tons of information taht you'll wanna keep track of.\n\nOverall, I am very happy to say that this is the finale that I was hoping for, and I think anyone who is a fan of this series will leave very satisfied and happy. It might even be enjoyable to for new players, since the game is designed to welcome new players. However I must stress yet again, if you can play the previous two games, definitely give them a try.

I remember playing 999 a long time ago and then VLR back in 2013. Back then this game was cancelled because of bad sales but there was a movement called Operation Bluebird that got it back up and asked for a 3rd game. VLR left a lot of plot holes that were finally filled in Zero Time Dilemma. I might be biased but it feels so awesome that they actually made this game to complete the series!!\n\nIt feels so good to have known what happened at Dcomm and how the events of VLR started.\n\nAnyway for an actual review.\n\nThe sound track is great. I loved the music throughout the series. There's suspense music, scary music, awe filling music for those d'awwww times.\n\nThe story is well written and the story lines help a bunch. It all makes sense eventually for every story line and you can go down them to figure out what happened. There's certainly some major mind fuckery going on but its the good kind that makes you think \"WOW! That was awesome\". If you enjoy Steins;gate, Umineko or other mystery-esk visual novels of that sort then you'll definitely enjoy this one.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good. What I would expect from a funded game company. They definitely didn't slack on that although you can still notice clipping at times and some models look out of place. I'm looking at you Desert Eagle. Overall though, its decent enough that it won't take you away from the story which is the most important part.\n\nThe characters are well written. Although I'm kind of bugged that Sigma and Phi seemed different from the previous one but they go back to their normal selves eventually. I loved their team's arc. Junpei changed a lot but its explained why that happens. Akane seems the same but now Junpei and Akane have a chance at a future together which is AWESOME. Carlos, Mira, Q and Eric are completely new characters which are pretty cool by themselves. They fit an archtype that was remeniscnet in the previous two games. \n\nPuzzles were moderately challenging. I sometimes get stuck because I forgot to find one item in the room so I highly recommend that you: LOOK AROUND, COLLECT ALL THINGS, TRY ALL THINGS ON ALL THINGS if you're stuck. Definitely helps. None of the puzzles took too long and/or were too hard. They granted a sense of acomplishment when completed which is the desired effect I guess. There is a distinct lack of puzzles though but you're here for the story, not the puzzles.\n\nIt took me about 20 hours to beat this game. So about $2 an hour for this game assuming it costs around $40 dollars for you. Not bad.

Even with that, I can follow the story quite well so I've no complaint in that area. \n\nNext are the puzzles, personally I think their difficulty is a bit low. I'm not that good at puzzle games. Nevertheless, I managed to get a perfect completion in this game in just less than 25 hours and referencing guides 3 times only.\n\nWhich brought me to my 3rd point. The game is rather short IMO, a full completion in less than 25 hours for a game at this price is a bit overpriced. If I'm allowed to compare this with other Spike Chunsoft games, the Danganronpa series, the Danganronpas although an older games, feels better in price / gameplay hours ratio.\n\n\n[list]\nPros :\n[*]Story are good. If you're a fan of sci-fi , you'll most probably enjoy this game.\n\nCons :\n[*] Puzzles are a bit easy. \n[*] Short gameplay with no replayability incentives.\n[/list]\n\nMy final opinion on this game :\nThis is a good game, however a bit overpriced. If you're new to the series, you'd probably want to wait for the previous games to appear on Steam first before getting this game. If you're not in hype for this game, I'd suggest to wait until this are discounted.", "timestamp_created": 1467377766, "timestamp_updated": 1467377766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

haven't played 999 or VLR... But now after finishing they would miss out on so many revelations. So if you can, get your hands on them(with 999 coming to STEAM; hopefully VLR will come too).\n\nThe story was nothing what I had expected, considering the previous titles. They really went the distance in this one. Not going to say much here, since it's the main draw of the games.\nThe sound was the best part, especially the JP VA performance (can't comment on the EN one's, the JP cast([url=http://myanimelist.net/people/2/Tomokazu_Sugita]Sugita[/url], [url=http://myanimelist.net/people/99/Miyuki_Sawashiro]Miyuki Sawashiro[/url],[url=http://myanimelist.net/people/17/Akira_Ishida]Akira Ishida[/url],[url=http://myanimelist.net/people/212/Daisuke_Ono]Daisuke Ono[/url],[url=http://myanimelist.net/people/284/Fumihiko_Tachiki]Fumihiko Tachiki[/url]) was just too good to miss out).\nThe visuals as expected were not the best poor animation, low res textures, obviously PC was not the main platform. \nBut it's kind of a miracle that this game was made at all and even made it to PC. \n\nAll in all the finale of Zero Escape offers a great end to the series. Highly recommend to everyone (mind the age rating on this one) who would like to enjoy the best story in a videogame so far.\nHere's hoping more people will like to get their minds blown and find out the mysteries of Funyarinpa.\n\n[i]Memento mori, if the nineth lion ate the sun.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1467372673, "timestamp_updated": 1467372745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23982055": {"recommendationid": "23982055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053714727", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467583452}, "language": "english", "review": "\"We are in the history God abandoned...\"", "timestamp_created": 1467372673, "timestamp_updated": 1467372673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23980745": {"recommendationid": "23980745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314012466", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476569051}, "language": "english", "review": "Why did the snail cross the road?\nTo kill six billion people.\n\nBecause reasons.", "timestamp_created": 1467368929, "timestamp_updated": 1467368929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502381", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23980264": {"recommendationid": "23980264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014105001", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472289694}, "language": "english", "review": "Radical, 6 / 6", "timestamp_created": 1467367464, "timestamp_updated": 1467367464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 56, "votes_funny": 165, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632320", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23980194": {"recommendationid": "23980194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024380828", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471424874}, "language": "english", "review": "Engaging story, interesting puzzles, and some crazy science-fiction concepts is what makes the zero escape series great.

Despite a low budget(from what I heard) it worked out well and the plot overcomes it\n\nCon:\n- Tiny bit confusing at times to unlock some things(but again it could be argued that it's part of the game)\n- Did not like the transport puzzle(atleast one part of it)\n- You can quick skip dialogues which is good, maybe I just wantd to see that you can speed up text(speeding up sometimes skips dialogues so that's why I refrained from speeding up)\n- Choice making was solid, but it did lower the experience slighlty since sometimes I forgot what happened at a certain area when I came back to it\n\nI spent a good 16hours to complete this game, now I'm a bit down that its over.

I highly suggest experiencing the first 2 games before this one, as long as you're fine with a game series that really requires you to think (if you want mindless fun this isn't the series to play).  A lot of enjoyment from this series comes not even from playing, but just from mulling things over and truely pondering your own theories and ideas.\n\nIf you HAVE played the other 2 games, you will likely already know that you need to play this game even if it was half as good as the other games (I used vacation time to finish the game as soon as possible, no regrets).  I won't go into talking about the plot or anything since having anything spoiled at all would ruin a lot of what makes this series fun, so I'll just keep it to the things I was concerned with.\n\nI initially had some fears about the budget, developement issues, and change in style of the game (not that it would have stopped me from getting this game, if they decided to release it as a choose your own adventure book I still would have bought it).  The good news is the only thing that suffered (when compared to higher budget games anyways) is that the graphics/animations could be better, but coming from a Visual Novel background that's not nearly as important as the story, plot, and characters.  I also would have wanted it to be longer, but that's only because even after waiting for 3 years I didn't want the series to be over.\n\nFor people who are set on having this be the first game that they play, know that you won't be entirely in the dark as aspects of the other games are explained, but you might be overwhelmed, and it would also retroactively take away some of the enjoyment of playing the previous games since a few of the key plot points will be revealed (it by no means would be a reason to not experience them though, might even make some portions of the games more interesting, if somewhat spoiled).", "timestamp_created": 1467358765, "timestamp_updated": 1467359245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23977038": {"recommendationid": "23977038", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988573703", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467446858}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Steps to Enjoying Zero Time Dilemma[/h1][olist]\n    [*]Play 999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors\n    [*]Play Virtue's Last Reward\n    [*]Play Zero Time Dilemma\n[/olist]", "timestamp_created": 1467356820, "timestamp_updated": 1467356820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23976556": {"recommendationid": "23976556", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994772882", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467579993}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is fucking badass and if u dont like it? well u might be a 'retard\"", "timestamp_created": 1467355025, "timestamp_updated": 1467355025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500415", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23976309": {"recommendationid": "23976309", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994772684", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467391152}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is really good.\ngo play 999 followed by VLR if you haven't already.\nenjoy sci-fi anime shit and twists and branching timelines\n9/9 would access the morphogenetic field again.", "timestamp_created": 1467354094, "timestamp_updated": 1467354094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23976232": {"recommendationid": "23976232", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978139741", "num_games_owned": 1034, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467580778}, "language": "english", "review": "Seriously amazing ending to a series that got me involved like no series has before.", "timestamp_created": 1467353799, "timestamp_updated": 1467353799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23975945": {"recommendationid": "23975945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075242341", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475510210}, "language": "russian", "review": "10/10 \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430", "timestamp_created": 1467352633, "timestamp_updated": 1467352633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23975923": {"recommendationid": "23975923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114409454", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468042670}, "language": "english", "review": "- Wishlist the game\n- Bought the game\n- Installed the game\n- Played the game\n\nAfter a few minutes, finished the game.

There was even an official announcement years ago that a third game in the series would most likely never happen. After a while, the creation of a third game became an inside joke to fans of Zero Escape similar to \"Half Life 3\" jokes that you see all over the internet. Eventually, this third game became a reality when Spike announced it in 2015.\n\nAfter getting about 7 hours into the game, I am writing this review. Steam didn't account for two hours of my playtime offline. Anyway, having experienced somewhere around 1/5 of Zero Time Dilemma, I can gladly say that Spike delivered on what the Zero Escape fanbase has been asking for all this time. There are many references to the previous games, some comical and some plot related, and the interactions between characters from 999 and VLR are to die for in Zero Time Dilemma. The voice-acting cast is superb for each role, and the 3-D graphics look fantastic on PC, compared to VLR on 3DS or Vita.\n\nZero Time Dilemma is a gift from Spike Chunsoft and\tKotaro Uchikoshi that is dedicated to the fans of the series. Without the continued fan-support over the previous years, this game wouldn't have been made possible.

The rest are [b]very well voiced[/b].\n\n- The character [b]animations feel unnatural[/b] at times (even though it appears they tried their best to avoid this).\n- Though the music was sublime, [b]too many tracks were borrowed from previous Zero Escape games[/b], which I found to be lazy.\n\nAll in all, if you've played the previous games, Zero Time Dilemma will offer you plenty of satisfaction and fond memories.

It may not be perfect, as I still find the first game (999) to be superior, but in the end I'm still debating which is beter between this game and Virtue's Last Reward, since it did live up to the hype with the plot twists.\n\nI initially gave it an 8 out 10, but after finishing it and learning that the game had a HUGE amount of clues and foreshadowing supporting the true ending, I give it a 9/10. Sadly I can't really explain in detail what I'm talking about without actually spoiling it, but it really is a final and worthy sequel that answers a lot questions and it is only creating a few more that can easily be answered with the player's interpretation.\n\nThe only complaint I have is the English voice acting, which at times can make scenes feel cheezy and less aunthetic, and Zero's voice can be inaudible from how faint he is compared to everyone else. \n\nThankfully however, the original Japanese voices are well done and I might just replay the game again sometime in its original format so I can better compare the English and Japanese audio.\n\nAs for the visuals, the 3D model approach did not bother me at all considering that the game almost never existed and that it was made on a tight budget due to the fanbase's high demand.\n\nThe option to skip texts that were never read is also a nice addition to this third installment for how scenes were more cinematic than the first two.\n\nI will definitely recommend this series to Sci-Fi/Puzzle/Mystery/Murder Mystery lovers.", "timestamp_created": 1467334164, "timestamp_updated": 1467630199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23970193": {"recommendationid": "23970193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115021203", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467330269}, "language": "english", "review": "I refreshed this page over and over and over again just to buy it the hour it came out.

It also is similar to Berserk in that it's arguably one of the best in its genre, but hasn't necessarily had the releases that it deserved. \n\nBasically, Zero Escape games are visual novels that have puzzle sequences and decisions that change the route that you take. Characters in Zero Time Dilemma aren't static sprites, they're 3D models that move which follows from the preivous game Virtue's Last Reward for the Vita/3ds. 9 People are trapped in a place and they want to get out, but in each game they can only get out by playing the game of the person, \"Zero\", who locked them in there. Sort of like [i] Saw [/i]\n\nThere was a period of time where it was believed that this game wouldn't be able to come out due to lack of popularity, which was upsetting due to the second game, Virtue's Last Reward relying on this game to answer the questions it left to fans. This period of presumably dead development shows in the game with art assets that don't look to great, bad character animation, and English voice acting that leaves a lot to be desired. With that being said, this game is turning out to be the best in the series for me. \n\nThe low quality aspects of the game give off a campy feeling that allows you some moments of respite when you laugh at the awkward Pivot Stick Figure running animations, or poorly delivered lines that are reminiscient of cheesy horror movies. Outside of the production quality, the writing doesn't play coy when explaining the supernatural plot points such as morphogenetic fields and time travel. For veterans of the series it's refreshing to not be treated with the run-around, as this game is meant to provide reason to Virtue's Last Reward. Despite some issues with the delivery of lines, the plot structure of Zero Time Dilemma provides an interesting re-imagination of previous styles by utilizing fragments more than flowcharts and not pulling punches when it comes to dark material.\n\nAs a short aside, I think this game has arguably the worst puzzles of the three Zero Escape games to date, but I don't think this game ever had puzzles that could rival games like Professor Layton, so it's not a huge bother.\n\nThe question then becomes, \"Well should I play the two games prior?\" and that question isn't an easy one to answer, because the two games are good enough as standalones that I recommend playing them, but the iOS version of 999, the first game, doesn't run well and outside of Emulation, you may not have a DS + the cartridge. VLR as of right now is only on the 3DS --this version has some bad bugs-- and the Vita as well. Both games are worth playing on their own if you can find a way to play them and Zero Time Dilemma is as well, but if you're new to the series it may be difficult to look past some of the poor production quality that is likely a result of issues during development. \n\nIn terms of the technical aspects, you can switch between the English and Japanese dubs at will, and the game supports windowed/fullscreen/borderlessfullscreen up to 1440p and may go farther but I couldn't check. The keyboard controls are kind of wonky and you can't change key bindings as far as I'm aware, but you can control the whole game with your mouse so it isn't a problem. \n\nIt's worth noting that this game has massive spoilers for the previous two games, and if you play this game before the the previous two, then you'll be spoiled on some twists and turns which is one of the selling points of the story. It wouldn't necessarily ruin anything, but a lot of the mystery and wonder would be gone if you decide to go back.\n\nPersonally, I recommend the game because I love the series and I love this, so I think you should get it and enjoy the world of Zero Escape. However, if you're the type of person who is difficult to impress or critical of what some could consider sloppy work, then I recommend you start elsewhere in the series and work your way up to this delightful, sci-fi, horror, mystery, puzzle game.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]It serves as a good Book-End for the Zero Escape series.\n[*]Interesting new setting + characters\n[*]Decision Game is a good step up from the Nonary Game and Digital Roots.\n[*]Fragmented scenes serve the story better than flowcharts\n[*]Minor spoilers: [spoiler] And an all-star cast with cool new character designs [/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Low quality models & animation (which can lead to humor!)\n[*]Lackluster dub (which can lead to humor!)\n[*]Puzzles can occasionally be lackluster\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1467313983, "timestamp_updated": 1467326611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23961525": {"recommendationid": "23961525", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977685979", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479964685}, "language": "english", "review": "beated the game in 10 mins. best $40 bucks I ever spent. gg", "timestamp_created": 1467309284, "timestamp_updated": 1467309284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.981320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23960990": {"recommendationid": "23960990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065636519", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1520, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478901536}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] End of the Nonary?[/h1]\nI have played the past two games within the last year and now after all this time the style sticks.

Before you even buy the game and play it, I HUGELY recommend that you play (or read up) the orginal 999 and VLR. As this game has crucial plot points from thoses games. (like 4 of the characters are from thoses games).\n\nIf you have, then buy it now and play it for youself. Its best to go in completely blind as the game is an experience on its own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant more huh? Well I'll try to explain the elements of the game while keeping spoilers to a minimum.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay kicks in either at \"SEEK A WAY OUT\" or during \"MAKE YOUR DECISION MOMENTS\".\nSo techniquely this isn't exactly an \"Gameplay\" focused game. Which is fine if you okay with listening and taking your time with hours of cutsences. The puzzles in the \"SEEK A WAY OUT\" are okay, some are challenging and could take some time to get your head over it. However while there are quite a few \"SEEK A WAY OUT\" situations, I ended up being slightly disappointed that there wasn't a final room to escape from in the TRUE ending.\n\nStory:\nOne of the strongest points of this game. If you have played the previous Zero Escape games, then you'll know that the story is pretty Mindblowing at times. In this game, yes, it does close the game up for good. But I can't really say that the plot twists are Mindblowing. I'm not going to spoiler for your sake, but eventually I was able to guess things before it could even explain what the thing was.\nBut either way, I enjoyed the story as its the main focus for this game. If you're not into strong story driven games like this one, then you'd probably want to find something else.\n\nNarrative:\nNow, let me explain. The voice acting and the directing for this game is GREAT. Even the camera angles look professional at times. You can tell that SPIKE CHUNSOFT worked really hard for this game to come out. However, as well as that. You can tell that this game may have had a low budget. The animations are rather choppy at times and the graphics look worse that VLR somehow.\nThey changed the first person narrative though by having you view sections of 3 different characters. As the characters forget every 90 mins, the first time you play the game you won't have any idea which timeline it maybe. You no longer have to constantly click to progress through text anymore. I suppose this is a good thing, however there are many times in the game where it gives you a code that you need to write down.\n\nOverall:\nZTD may not be strong with its gameplay, however the story will make you want to get the gameplay sections outta the way. \nIt makes a fine conclusion to the Zero Escape games as a 8/10, while my previous 9/10 for VLR and 7/10 for 999\n\nSo if you want a good story driven franchise.

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THE PREVIOUS TITLES OR A HUGE PORTION OF THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE LOST. IN ADDITION THERE WERE HINTS GIVING BY THE DIRECTOR THAT THE PREVIOUS TITLES WILL BE RELEASED ON STEAM, SO BE PATIENT OR FIND A WAY TO PLAY THE OTHERS. \nALSO DO NOT WIKI THE GAME AT ALL BECAUSE HUGE SPOILERS ARE THERE EVEN IN THE FRONT PAGE. AVOID THE WIKIS. \n\nMoving on, there is no story that is epic like this series on PC at all. It's the best story period and not much details can be given because it will be a spoiler. This is what many people will tell you about the Zero escape series when trying to explain it to you. \n\nHowever all we can say is that the game starts out basically as you being a participant in a game with other people. There are decision making events which effect actual outcome and you will get different experiences from each choices. There are puzzles as well which play a huge role to the story. You'll learn theoritcal ideas and you will learn knowledge which are used in real life work environments. At first, it starts out simple then the story just explodes and branches out in to braingasm of events in which you won't get the experience in any other games. This one expands on the previous title in a much bigger way you won't expect if you played the previous titles honestly. The first title is about 5 to 9 hours if your only going for the story which is still good enough, second title Virtues Last reward increases to 40 hours and finally this one goes beyond that in terms of elements. I own both the VIta version and PC in support of the team that made the series and trust me I don't buy multiple port versions of a game if it sucks. This game has done an excellent job on the PC side on it's first try as well.\n\nThe Series has won awards in the past for best story so please consider playing the previous titles in order before playing this game without looking at the plot.

Characters really feel that they changed between games [VLR AND 999 SPOILERS, but if you didn't play them you really should before going to ZTD] Junpei feels like an edgy teen adult now, Diana really is the way you expect the woman who inspired Luna to be, Sigma seems like a 70 year old stuck in that body, but that is done very slightly and not the \"haha funny\" way, which is amazing, and Phi is just amazing in this game. Is it the best franchise i ever played? Of course. Do i recommend it? Only if you played 999 and ZTD, otherwise things get very complicated and you aren't going to get half of what they're saying about morphogenetic fields and stuff. So, this is one of those games where the score you are going to give to it ends up being how much you like the franchise, for me it it 11/10, but for someone who looks at Sigma being a 70yo stuck in a 20yo and says \"wth\", it is not.", "timestamp_created": 1467252384, "timestamp_updated": 1467511094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540864", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23942385": {"recommendationid": "23942385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042322678", "num_games_owned": 354, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479925578}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the third installment of the Zero Escape trilogy, starting with [i]999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors[/i] on the DS and [i]Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward[/i] on the 3DS and Vita.\n\nWhile the Creator says that it can be played without prior knowledge of the previous games (999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors on the DS and Virtue's Last Reward on 3DS and Vita, with both being remastered for Steam), I HIGHLY recommend playing the previous two games to get the complete story and not be spoiled.\n\nThe game takes a much darker turn from 999 and VLR as Uchikoshi, the director and producer, was given more creative freedom to make his game, at the cost of a tight budget, which shows.\n\nThe animations for the characters are somewhat wooden and odd. The lip-syncing sometimes better suits the English or the Japanese voice acting (which you can change on the fly.)\n\nThe graphics aren't too good or too bad but the launcher lets you add AA which gets rid of the jagged edges unlike the Vita and 3DS versions.\n\nThe story is just as good as the other games with an even bigger twist. As a closer to the Zero Escape Trilogy, it fills its purpose but still leaves me wanting more since it falls a little bit flat after the big reveals in 999 and VLR.\n\nParticipants are split up into 3 Groups, C, Q and D into their respective wards. They are split off and have no way to contact each other except through notes passed on through an old dog who must go through vents to deliver them. They wake up with watches on their wrists. A masked figure appears:\n\n[i]\"90 minutes. When next you wake, you will have forgotten everything that has happened here.\"[/i]\n\nTheir watches have drugs that cause them to sleep and to forget everything they have learned, done and accomplished in the last 90 minutes that they've been awake. The only way out is to kill 6 other participants for passwords to the X Door. Their lives, Zero's and the fate of the human race are in the hands of these 9 participants.\n\nThis is The Decision Game. This is Zero Time Dilemma.\n\nThe game play is made up of Fragments, Quest Rooms and The Decision Game.\n\nFragments are the visual novel part of the story where you choose a fragment that looks interesting and you play for that team's scenario in an unknown timeline and location in time. Are you playing before or after a character has died? Is everyone else still alive? Did that person die in this timeline or will you cause it later on? You'll have to play to unravel the mysteries that Zero is leaving you with.\n\nQuest Rooms are essentially the puzzle aspect of the game. While they aren't as demonic as Professor Layton's twisted mind, they are much easier than those in VLR and a little easier than the ones in 999.\n\nThe Decision Game is where you'll spend your time figuring out how to keep someone or even yourself alive. Will you pull the trigger to save someone from a fiery death at the cost of possibly firing a live bullet at your friend? Will you push a big button that says DO NOT PRESS THIS? Will you escape the Decision Game by guessing the correct flip of the coin and save everyone?

The game pales in comparison to the other complete masterpieces in the series. Don't expect any kind of satisfying conclusion or any life changing journies here. All you'll find is a short 20 hour game that goes all over the place and just feels like something they had to make rather than wanted to make. Has there ever been a time where fans petitioned a developer to make something and it actually turned out good? Gone are the well-written characters and incredible mystery and mystique of what's down the next route. At least the music is pretty good despite a ton of it just being remixes or it playing at odd or repetitive times.\n\nThis isn't a bad game, it's actually ok. The problem is that 999 and VLR are straight 10s due to being original and engaging games that leave you satisfied and your mind blown. ZTD just feels run of the mill and more like a 6 or 7. In my opinion I think they were over their heads with their decision to make the game fully animated and forgo the heavy text/talking head style that previously worked wonders. The \"talent\" that worked on this game simply have little to no experience animating cutscenes like this and the lack of text segments do not allow for the engrossing text crawls that 999 and VLR prominently featured. The other huge glaring flaw with this game is the memory loss/fragment mechanic. It robs the game of feeling like you're playing a \"game within a game\" with rules and set outcomes. I completely understand why this could've been an interesting mechanic to observe but it ends up not utilizing this anywhere close to well enough to justify the loss of the traditional structure. And now we finally get to the decisions. The fragment system strikes again by downgrading the decision aspect of the game because you barely have to live with them since you only do one room at a time instead of an entire several hours long playthrough. Theres no weight or sense of progression with the story because you're just given completely random segments that quite honestly like to make up rules. A lot of fragments you'll play will just take you to what is essentially the end of the game. So because of that \"playthroughs\" are less than an hour long.\n\nI just don't know anymore man.

Zero Time Dilemma is shaping up to be the same way.     If you're looking for an open-world experience, this is not it.  If you're looking for tight gameplay mechanics ala Super Meat Boy or Mario, this is not it.\n\nWhat you get from the Zero Escape series is an incredible journey, a series of interactive novels with room-escape puzzle segments.    The games take full advantage of the interactive nature of video games to tell stories that are both fantastical and intimate.    You will wonder just what in the world is going on at times, but bit by bit, piece by piece, the story of each individual title comes together.\n\nAnd then the games take everything you've learned and proceed blow your mind with it.\n\nThese games are experiences I will cherish for the rest of my life.   If you take this journey yourself, you absolutely must do everything in your power to play them in order:  999, then VLR, then ZTD.     You absolutely must do everything in your power to NOT read spoilers about the characters or plot points - this includes looking up  random wiki profiles on the characters, since you may accidentally stumble across spoilers in a page title or hyperlink.\n\n999 is available for the Nintendo DS and makes full usage of the device.  A stripped down version of 999 which removes the puzzle sequences from the game, as well as the Nintendo DS elements is available on IOS.   Virtue's Last Reward is available on the 3DS and Playstation Vita -   both versions are the same, although the 3DS version contains a save-corrupting bug which can be avoided as long as you save only during the story sequences (not the puzzle sequences).  \n\nBoth titles are reportedly going to be coming to Steam, so for those of you who  haven't been exposed to this series yet, if you wait a while, you should be able to experience the complete series on your PCs.  Trust me when I say you don't want to play the games out of order.   Because once you do,  you've had earlier titles spoiled for you, and there's no turning back from that.   You will have missed out on the once-in-a-lifetime experiences of the earlier title(s).\n\nEnjoy the music.    Connect with the characters.    Take in the stories.   Scratch your head on the puzzles.   It's one hell of a journey.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to playing this game.", "timestamp_created": 1467242861, "timestamp_updated": 1467242861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503873", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23939254": {"recommendationid": "23939254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018952072", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1516138097}, "language": "english", "review": "IT'S FINALLY OUT!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1467241429, "timestamp_updated": 1467241429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23939236": {"recommendationid": "23939236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023591911", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467347654}, "language": "english", "review": "I missed Zero Escape so much, and so far this is everything I wanted from a series finale.\n\nPlay 999 and VLR first, obviously.\n\nI'm not going to write too much, but let's just say:\n\nIn 2011, 999 was the first game that I ever pulled an all-nighter playing.\n\nIn 2013, VLR was the first game that kept me glued to my seat all day.\n\nZTD is here.", "timestamp_created": 1467241373, "timestamp_updated": 1467241373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23938860": {"recommendationid": "23938860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162697340", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491601239}, "language": "english", "review": "4 hours in this game.....

These escape segments have no time limit and thank god for that because even though the puzzles are very well done they are also certainly challenging\nHowever by no means unfair\nYou are always given enough hints to find the solution and the puzzles themselves are unique and fun to solve each time\nEven if you're not a fan of point and click or puzzle games\nYou will not have trouble solving any of these if you are patient and willing to search for clues. These escape rooms can be done in any order and which one you are trapped in depends on which team you've chosen. Team C, Team Q or team D. All of these teams consist of 3 persons each and you will play as either Carlos(c), Q(q) or Diana (d) each being the leader of their team.\nYou can freely switch between teams at any time as well.\n\nAnother big part of the game is decisionmaking you are given a flow-char where you can see the different outcomes for every decision you make and believe me, there are a lot.\nWhile games like 'the walking dead' bu telltale games offer you the illusion of free choice\nHere your choice has a drastic consequence each time\nYou might die in the middle of the game when there is still so much more to discover, you might even die in your very first escape room\nThe best thing about this is that the choices you have to make are never black and white\nThere's always that \"but what if...\"\nThere is no right or wrong decision. It really makes you think and thats what this game is all about.

While ZTD can be played as a standalone title, you'll be missing out on a lot of crucial information and you won't enjoy it to its maximum potential.\n\nAnother hit in the Zero Escape series which has yet to have a bad (or even mediocre) title. The overall premise is similar to the two previous games: 9 people are stuck in an underground bunker, where they are forced by the antagonist (a peculiar geezer named Zero) to play a game ('the nonary game' in the previous titles, 'the decision game' in ZTD). For each person that dies, a password will be obtained for the X Door, which when provided with 6 passwords, will open and result in freedom for whoever opened it (and whoever passes through in the ten seconds after). This is the basic premise, but the story goes MUCH deeper than this and anyone who has played a Zero Escape title beforehand will understand what I'm saying.\n\nI've personally already completed the 3DS version of ZTD, so I can say with absolute certainty that the story is great. My only criticism comes in the form of the games ending. Without spoiling anything, I believe that if this was meant to be the conclusion to the series, they have left the ending a little open ended (I'm hesitant to call sequel-bait, but it's a distinct possibility). This may result in another game in the series being released (which I'd love), but based on the wait many fans have had to endure for ZTD, it's a distinct possibility that another may not be made. Don't let this put you off, however - the journey through the entire game itself is incredible and it's on par with the previous titles (which are also held in a very high regard by most people who have played them). Some of the plot twists will blow your mind!\n\nIn terms of gameplay, there's not really a lot I can say. The game consists of a mixture of visual novel elements along with 'escape the room' style puzzles, with a large flowchart full of branching decisions. The game handles this in a very unique and interesting way, however, allowing you to jump between fragments of the timeline, not actually knowing where they place until they're completed. This allows you to jump right into whichever fragment you desire, and play the game in whatever order you choose.\n\nThe PC port is absolutely fantastic, and I have been getting consistent 60FPS at 1080p with full antialiasing with an antique GTX 650 and AMD-4170fx rig. The animations may be a little jarring occasionally, but the voice acting more than makes up for this.\n\nOverall, Zero Time Dilemma is a fantastic entry into the series and I'd highly recommend buying it ASAP.

The game features a non-linear narrative (meaning you don't have to play the game in a set order), and depends on your choices and their consequences to advance.\n            \nThere are essentially three parts to ZTD: cutscenes/story, Escape Rooms, and player's decision. Like I stated above, there is a lot of reading to do as the cutscenes feature heavily between different segments of the game, and (depending on how adept you are at puzzles) you're probably going to spend most of your time watching these cutscenes. The escape rooms are the majority of the gameplay - you'll be placed in a variety of different rooms, and must use your own knowledge and the items and clues provided for you to make your escape. Players decision is exactly what it sounds like, similar to the choice aspect of [i]Life Is Strange[/i], but with a bit more of a twist - the choices you make are weighted on a percentage chance, so they may end well or they may end [b]horrifically[/b].\n\n[b]Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - My Thoughts[/b]\nI have played the entire Zero Escape series (albeit in the wrong order - oops), and I love them. As a puzzle fan and an avid reader, the series is perfect for me. However, you do not need to have played the previous two games to enjoy Zero Time Dilemma, but it is recommended. I repeat: [b]you do not need to have played the previous two games to enjoy Zero Time Dilemma[/b].\n\n[u]Story:[/u]            \nThe story behind ZTD is phenomenal. Every twist and turn poses more questions, and you feel as though you can't stop playing until you've found all the answers. There are many different endings to explore, both good and bad, and you won't feel like you've truly completed the game until you've seen them all. As previously stated, it follows a non-linear story and you can play it in any order - which works extremely well due to the participants losing their memories every 90 minutes. They don't know what order things are happening in, and neither do you. However, as endings are unlocked, you'll be able to see the game's story flowchart, and this will allow you to pinpoint things you've missed. \n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u]            \nI love the gameplay within ZTD. I've managed to escape all of the rooms without help, but I did struggle and become frustrated at points. Escaping from a room off of your own back is extremely rewarding though, so try not to use guides unless you're 100% stuck! (See my tips for escaping below.) The only thing that bothers me, is lack of gameplay during the first hour or so. The introduction is quite heavy, and you'll find yourself waiting a while to get into things.\n\n[u]Characters:[/u]            \nThe characters are very interesting too. There are 4 returning characters from the older games, and 5 totally new characters - and they've all got their own story to tell. You start off by only knowing their names, but after playing through their teams fragments, you'll slowly learn how they came to end up in this messed up game of murder. Whilst I'm on the subject, the 9 people are split into 3 teams, each with a team leader (and that's who you'll control). But I honestly loved getting to know them all, some of their backstories really took a turn for the worse.\n\n[u]Visuals:[/u]            \nThe art and animation is average honestly. Now, this does not mean bad, it just means compared to the rest of the game, I don't favour it as much. If you love the artstyle from the Telltale games such as [i]The Wolf Among Us[/i] and [i]Telltales The Walking Dead[/i], you'll probably like the art in ZTD. However, the animations are quite clunky, and the mouth movements can be quite bizarre at time. That being said, the team making the game was small and they had limited time and resources so they did a great job considering that!\n\n\n[b]Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma - Pros and Cons[/b]\nPros:\n- Compelling and interesting story\n- Amazingly written characters and backstories\n- No puzzle room is the same, and they will all make you think\n- The addition of the skip text button!\n- Flawless PC port\n- Estimated 20 hours playtime without skipping/using guides\n- Gab\n            \nCons:\n- Janky animations\n- The memopad (partially because it has a limit, partially because no one likes writing with a mouse or controller)\n- Lack of gameplay during the intro\n- No 'rotate' prompt on Xbox Controller (it's RB)\n- I pressed [i]the[/i] button\n- Snails\n            \nDo I recommend the game? [b][u]100% yes[/u][/b]. I'm honoured that Spike Chunsoft provided me with a review copy, ZTD is currently my favourite game of the year. If you love mysteries and puzzles, get this game!

[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b] \nReady to get your mind blown, because Spike Chunsoft is ready to poke around inside your head again with the third in the Zero Time Dilemma series. And while it's not as good as Danganronpa 2, it's still worth its weight in gold in terms of this writing. Drama's the name of the game here. The game may seemingly start slow in building its set pieces from the beginning, but the game gets into a good pace of intrigue and shock factor when you have to make hard decisions about the well being of the teams with Zero's game. And the third act is an onslaught of set piece after set piece, as you just sorta stand there in awe while it keeps on blowing you away with the next reveal. And puzzle wise, the game does a great job of mixing things up as well, being able to keep things reasonably fresh as you try to break out of the latest room that you've been trapped in. Where the game falters a bit is in its characters: as a couple of them just don't have the charisma to stand out. And some of the presentation elements really missed the mark, in particular with the animations. The animations are just plain bad. But the game focuses on the story, and that's where it truly shines. It's a memorable third game that gives several answers, but asks new questions in the process. Another great game in the Aksys and Spike Chunsoft library.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo4zIjU4Iyw\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The drama created. It's never cheap, and it's always able to pull on strings, even if the character has had questionable decision making up to that point. The game does well in making you feel for these characters.\n[*] The entire ramp up to the climax and the finale. It's just jaw dropping with everything that goes on. You'll not only be at the edge of your seat, you'll be glued to the screen, not wanting to leave. \n[*] The writing duality in terms of the choices that are presented to you. Each choice doesn't seem like a no brainer (although you will choose both eventually to see all the plot), and makes you truly wonder what you'd do in the same situation.\n[*] The piece meal story progression in terms of the overall timeline flowchart is fun. Forcing the player to play the story out of order, to the point where they have to figure out where exactly they are in the timeline: yeah, that works rather well here.\n[*] The science/math theory elements are always appreciate from a player who has a CS background. Yay Quantum Theory!\n[*] The plot does a great job of not spoiling itself, but giving hints about what's to come in the future. I noticed that when I went back to rerecord sections that some of the language and symbolism used connected directly to the end of the game, and I was just in awe at how woven it was. I like to call that the Edgar Wright effect, and ZTD has it in spades.\n[*] 20+ Hours of content here. While it's a 40 dollar game, you do get your money's worth in the genre.\n[*] In 99% of the cases, the game does a good job of hinting when you get stuck, in particular when you're stuck within a room and can't figure out what you need to do next.\n[*] Q team in particular has some really interesting characters within it. Their personalities help really create an interesting dynamic, and was probably my favorite team to follow.\n[*] Puzzle design has a good variety to it, and hits the sweet spot of reasonably challenging, without making you throw your keyboard at the wall.\n[*] The game does a reasonable job of making you ignore plot holes, just by its immersion factor alone. And I'm not talking about those perceived plot holes that aren't actually there because it hasn't shown what it truly is yet, I'm talking about the actual plot holes.\n[*] Game includes the japanese voice acting as an option. Good to see.\n[*] Just on a personal note, it's nice to see the PC port of the game come out at the same time as the 3DS and Vita. It's nice to see that the PC platform is being taken more seriously, and that is being opened to a whole new audience. Now get on porting 999 and VLR, please.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oh geez, the animations. Some of the worst animations I've seen in a game in a long while. Not only are they unnatural, they are comically bad at some points, giving the game a B horror movie feel at times. Which could have worked if the other parts of the games tone didn't go completely against it.\n[*] There's some missing sound elements in cutscenes that work against the games immersion. If blood is draining into a drain, I expect to hear something along the lines of drainage. \n[*] The little details of this PC port are annoying. There's things like the labels for keys that aren't included at the top level (you have to go to a help menu to find them), and even then, they can be wrong. For those who play: W is your quick item switch. You're welcome.\n[*] The characters that have come over from VLR really need you to have played VLR in order to truly enjoy them. Otherwise, it feels like there's segments missing.\n[*] Once in a while, the english voice acting...can be a little cringy. \n[*] Actually, a couple of these characters just don't have the charisma to keep you interested in them specifically. Q team being the exception.\n[*] Keyboard functionality within the sections where you have to type in words, would have been appreciated.\n[*] Attempting to write on the in game notepad is like buttering up your hands and trying to play Wii Bowling. It just, no. \n[/list]\n", "timestamp_created": 1467219222, "timestamp_updated": 1467219222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664086", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39469900": {"recommendationid": "39469900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057826040", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491666378}, "language": "english", "review": "A game for Phi Brain Kids :b", "timestamp_created": 1516404290, "timestamp_updated": 1516404290, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 1229, "total_negative": 98, "total_reviews": 1327}}

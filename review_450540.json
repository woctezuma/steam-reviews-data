I didn't expect much from it, really. Just some sort of a fun-ish shooting gallery, I was ok with that since I was mostly looking for that and I like shooting guns. For someone, like me, who's from a country where it's a bit more complicated to do that, it was a cool idea.\n\nBut shit, was I in for quite a ride! Sure, there's your basic shooting gallery mode, and it's done well... But SO MANY GUNS! And they're all insanely well-made, all animated almost perfectly, as you'd expect an RL gun to actually move and work. The sounds are really great, each gun has its own moving parts, and has its own feeling. And there's so many of them! Even old weird stuff, like that old breech-loading pistol. It wasn't really necessary for the devs to add that, but it's still there! \n\nAnd of course, there are all the experimental modes, like the zombie mode or the survival horror one, the take & hold, ... none of those modes are as studied as they could, but they're more than enough fun to keep you busy for a while. Unlike most VR games I tried so far, I'm actually looking forward to my next play session.\n\nFinally, the devs themselves.

A very realistic firearm simulator. Being a firearm owner myself the realism I must say is almost perfect. There are a few minor things here and there, like the selector for full auto on the AK being in the wrong position, but dang this game is so awesome it makes up for that. It is so realistic you can take magazines spawned with a specific gun and use it in another gun of a different type if it accepts that mag in real life. You can even load individual cartridges into mags, so for example if you accidently eject a live cartridge you can pick it up and put it back in the mag. It's crazy detailed like that.\n\nThe game part, although small is kind of fun. This is really more for just messing around than actually playing a \"game\", but it is still fun. I found some of the instructions and such difficult to follow, but once you figure it out you can have some entertainment. \n\nHonestly though if you just like going to the shooting range, or have always wanted to play with firearms then this is a must have. It pretty much is like a range day, but you can spawn any weapon in the game you want. Different accessories like silencers, sights and scopes, lasers and flashlights. Ammunition of multiple types, even of the same round, such as tracer, AP, HP, FMJ, etc). And some other fun tools which also make good weapons (hammer, crow bar, and more).\n\nA few things I hope to see in the future (in case the devs read these reviews):\n- ability to spawn explosives using the ammo spawner, like 40 mm grenades, RPG's, etc.\n- ability to manipulate fire selector on all guns using non-dominant hand grip (AK selector for example, like you can on the L85A2)\n- improve visibility of the red dot sights (they are way too dim, even for daylight)\n- MORE super realistic guns! Some belt fed machineguns and grenade and rocket launchers, etc. But all I can say is keep the quality going, so if that means it is a slow process that is fine with me. This should be the ultimate firearms simulator, and it's got a hell of a solid start.\n- More detailed realism on some things that are lacking, like having to line up the primer on RPG's when inserted into the RPG-7. Grenades not arming until X amount of meters after launch. \n- More maps and more targets and fun things to shoot at... like challenging targets \n- Keep up the great work!", "timestamp_created": 1513403667, "timestamp_updated": 1513405381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38326215": {"recommendationid": "38326215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003111976", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1514390907}, "language": "german", "review": "this game was early in the past the reason, Y i buy me an VR gear :D\n\nnot good game to play ...y i miss the real survivalgame with this weapon and showcase game.\n\nThis guns and the handling is outstanding and the top of the top of all simulations about guns\u00b0!\n\nif it brings better  targets as sausages i party up this game as uber GODgame.\n\nAND PLZ TAKE OUT THE REVEARBS ALL OF THE GUNS ITS Terribeland silly sick pain in my ears.\nthe revearb destroy the gunfeeling..in rooms,forest,longrooms.wide-rooms, halls...everytime the same shit doink doink metalsounding reverb on the guns.\nthis was an crap simulated algorythmus..the early reflections not good,the sound of reverb are kadoink,metal sounding :D not warm,not silky...only everytime DOINK DOINK ;D\n\nbut..the game is outstanding and my first vr love!!!", "timestamp_created": 1513350095, "timestamp_updated": 1513350095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38305389": {"recommendationid": "38305389", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971640811", "num_games_owned": 1061, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 101, "last_played": 1514312202}, "language": "english", "review": "One of very few games I could say are a must have if you have a VR headset.

Every other VR shooter dev should be buying this game and taking notes. Anton has been cracking the problems of guns in VR wide open for years, and he has set a high bar for others to reach.\n\nIf you're not into guns very much, good news! H3 isn't about murdering waves of humans! The developer isn't crazy about the violence or 'gun culture.' He seems to be focused on replicating the physical simulation of these machines in a very faithful way.\n\nTotally into guns? Good news! H3 is a wonderland of highly realistic firearms, lovingly simulated for you to customize, learn about and deploy in challenging scenarios! While the targets don't bleed, everything else about the game makes it worth your time. No, you don't get to blast terrorists or zombies, but if you appreciate the art of mastering weapons, some of which you'll never lay your real-steel hands on in your lifetime, you'll get a kick out of this game.\n\nSimply put, its a playground filled with guns that can't hurt you or anyone else. Even if you're currently wearing an NRA hat and strapped with a match grade USP .45 with suppressor, you'll appreciate the joy of messing around with these boom-sticks without fear of pissing off a range officer or DNR do-gooder.

I have gone into this knowing it is EA and therefore things are being added and changed over time. However, this is my opinion of the game at the time of this review, after over a year in EA development.\n\n     When looking through the top rated games for VR, this is always near the top. When looking at the games currently being played, this is either at the very top or near the top. After playing this myself for 2 hours, I have come to the conclusion...that I have no fucking idea why. \n    \nTHE PROS\n     -This is a 1 man dev team making this. He puts out regular updates via youtube and seems really excited about what he does. He seems to actually listen to his community and makes changes in game based on the requests of this community. I have to give him props for that. This is something I love to see and so the dev gets an A+ just for this,\n     -The detail put into the guns is amazing. From meshes to detailed safety switches to bolt action movements are all on point. Even though I have not been close to many real world guns, I believe the ones in this are close to if not exact replicas. The fact that you must go through the motions of putting a magazine into a gun, and then pulling back the slide to ready it is really nice to see. I wish more games would take notes from this and implement it.\n     -It feels like a really great simulation. You can go into a shooting range, pick from a WIDE assortment of guns and attachments, and then go nuts on a paper target or other objects.\n\nTHE CONS (IMO)\n     -The whole concept of the game AI is that you're fighting against....hotdogs, hence the title. I get that. However, after the detail put into the guns, it kinda pulls you out of the immersion only getting to shoot at dissected hotdogs.\n     -There's really not much \"game\" here. It feels as if you're playing a giant tutorial that you never actually pass. There are numerous shooting ranges, ranging in style and utility. Also at the time of playing, there are a few minigames. They range from a B-movie horror scenario where you're trying to find chunks of meat to throw into a grinder in the spawn area while dodging traps and killer robot hotdogs, to a capture-the-point scenario where you take points from AI hotdogs and hold them for a predetermined amount of time. There is even a zombie wave shooter thrown in there. While these game modes were neat at first, I really couldnt justify the price point for the amount of \"game\" in this. I do acknowlege again, however, that this game is EARLY ACCESS and this could change over time\n\nSo in conclusion, if you're a \"gun nut\" who lives and breathes gunpowder, then by all means this is a must have. If you have a slight interest in guns and just want to relax while putting some virtual bullets down range, then also this should be in your library. However, if you are looking for a game with a good amount of different things to do with the nice gun physics and attention to detail, then you might be disappointed like I was. By all means, this is not a HORRIBLE game.

In reality it is one of the best VR experiences out there, and I think that can largely be attributed to the quality control and attention to detail put into the game by its dev. I don't particularly love guns in real life and I find the idea of owning/shooting gun kind of intimidating, but this has really been enlightening for me as an educational tool. The level of realism for each gun is so high, that after 20ish years of gaming where the majority of games involve guns and shooting of some kind, I was shocked to find that with an M-16 in my hands I had no clue how to actually fire it. All the small things; loading the right clip, flicking the safety, racking the slide, fiddling with the sights and attachments... I absolutely loved it as a learning experience. Plus, the little things, like I didn't know that after loading and racking a pistol, removing the clip still leaves one bullet in the chamber that can be fired. It was therefore surprising to me when I accidentally shot my virtual foot off, thinking the gun was safely unloaded. To me, this is one of those things where even if you are the most liberal, anti-gun person in real life, it's a damn good thing to at least understand how they work from a safety/preparedness point of view!\n\nBut it's not all educational and serious; In fact, for a game about realistic, lethal weapons, H3VR does an incredible job at not taking itself too seriously! There's tons of fun to be had with all sorts of varying game modes, from straight up target shooting at a range, to swinging out of the ceiling whilst shooting in a jungle gym type arena, to the terrifyingly intense meat grinder mode. As well as being able to spawn items to mess around with without limitation, there is also the ability to reset the environment back to its clean, original state. The variety of guns is large and fantastic, with a huge amount of quality and care in each one. With one exception, they are all true to their real life counterparts, but that one exception is a fictitious gun, the Cleric's pistol from the film Equilibrium (which was a total dream to get to shoot!). There are also some melee weapons to mess around with, as well as throwables and then some straight up silly items.\n\nGraphically, the game is so well done. The guns and textures look amazing and some of the best I've seen in VR. The audio too is absolutely top marks, with fantastic attention to detail being placed on little things from the crack of the different calibers to the plink of the bullet casings hitting the floor. Gunfire also takes into consideration environmental reverb, so a rifle shot doesn't sound the same in the gunrange as it does outside. All these small things do such a good job at making the experience feel realistic.\n\nThe physics are excellent, with the ability to change how physics work from realistic to semi-realistic, or to not at all. I love realistic because I love the \"feel\" of the guns when you toss them on a table, though tossing grenades with realistic physics is a little tricky! I also absolutely love that the option is given to have no bullet casing cleanup, so you can see all the casings pile up on the floor. Other than that, interacting with guns can at times be a little niggly, especially with the Touch controllers, but I mostly chalk that other up to just the nature of doing anything with the motion controllers, plus a recent update helped tremendously with Touch calibration. \n\nBecause of the mostly standing nature of the game, VR sickness was non-existent for me. You can move around the areas with a teleport, which works perfectly fine. I have no complaints about this game at all, but I do have two disappointments, of which sadly the debates on each have been soundly put to rest! I would have liked to (or the option to) been able to see my hands in game for immersion. However, due to the understandable technical difficulties in this task and potential bugginess it could cause, it isn't going to happen. But even more than that I wish so much that H3VR had a Workshop on Steam where modders could create fictitious guns from sci-fi or movies (like the RoboCop gun, Blade Runner, etc, or maybe even crazy things like a Proton Pack!). However, due to the complexity of adding guns and their physics, the game wouldn't be able to support the architecture for modders, so it is a sound no on that. The absence of these two thing are disappointing in the truest sense of the word, but in no way make the game any less incredible.\n\nEven though its Early Access, the current game is polished like a full release.

It's one of the few must-have VR games out there right now.  And while I can't speak to how the game feels with a Vive (maybe someday), it's great on the Rift's Touch controllers.\n\nPersonally, I really enjoy the reflex ranges with the pistol courses.  There's a viscreal satisfaction to acing them that's hard to put to words.\n\nThe pro's:\n+The audio is distinctively satisfying.  Whether it's the thoont of the M79 grenade launcher, or the BRRRRRT of the mini-gun.  Even the noises the various mags make as they slide out of the pistols is a treat.\n+The simulation can be incredibly deep if you want it to be.  You can set yourself up as if you've gone out to an actual indoor range with only so many magazines to work with and a simulated box of ammo.  Where every couple of minutes you have to go through the motions of loading up your mags a shell at a time.\n+Or you can go at it without a care in the world and blow through thousands of dollars worth of virtual ammunition in minutes using the infinite spawn toggle for your holsters.\n+The controls are more often than not really intuitive on the Rift's Touch controllers.\n+Steadilly growing at the time of review; new guns and ranges are being added every few months.\n+Dual-wield Saiga 12's without destroying your shoulders!\n+Yes, there's a mini-gun.\n\nThe con's:\n-Slow to load.  The game will load up just fine, but then I usually end up standing around the range select room for a few minutes before I can actually select a range to load up.\n-Loading mags into the guns can sometimes be a little fiddly with the more realistic loading option.  This is mostly due to a lack of tactile feedback.  But some of it is chalked up to how the magazines orient themselves in conjunction with the controllers in virtual space, and how the controllers end up \"interacting\" in actual space.\n-Sometimes the controls aren't all that intuitive..  But more often than not, there's instuctions on the weapon spawn menu.  Plus, there are some guns that just aren't all that intuitive.\n-Lack of tactile forms make shooting the rifles a little less satisfying.\n\nTL;DR: Grenade Skee-Ball.

I usually like deep, boring games where you stare at a map moving sliders around, or walk around an island thinking about the meaning of life. But in H3VR, I can grab a Desert Eagle, slide a magazine in, pull back the slide and watch the first bullet enter the chamber, then grab a second gun and blast away. And it's [i]amazing[/i].\nThere are more and more gun-shootin' games on VR like Pavlov and BAM, but none of them feels quite as right as H3VR - just the satisfying feeling of slamming a magazine into a MP5 and slapping the bolt forward like all the best action heroes is almost worth the money by itself.\n\nAnd it's funny because the game seems pretty straightforward - it's a sandbox with a collection of weapons ranging from antique pistols to modern tacticool M4s with all the trimmings, a couple of shooting ranges, and some challenges with mobile hot dog opponents or target discs. As a non-American who's only shot a gun once, there's something incredibly relaxing about simple target practice, blasting wooden cutouts with a pump-action shotgun or sniping watermelons with a .50 anti-materiel rifle while lying on the floor of my room. After years of playing FPS games, it's amazing to actually experience a M1 Garand up close, or create my own reflex-sighted-flashlighted-scoped UMP45. Oh, and it has Deckard's pistol from Blade Runner. I mean, isn't that an instant buy in itself?\n\nNothing else on VR - even non-shooting games - feels quite as [i]right[/i] as H3VR. There's tons of updates (can't wait for the upcoming WW2 one), which brings me back every month as I go through the menus and try out all the unusual new weapons that have been added in.

New and interesting game modes are often enough to keep the game fresh during the early access period to such a point that the sheer ammount of game modes will probably be intimidating to new players at release. New guns are being added all the time necessitating players to practice with the different mechanics some guns use in order to do the more demanding game modes. Knowledge of how guns work. is important. Different mechanics for guns include but are not limited to: Breach loading, lever action, closed bolt, open bolt, clip loaded, magazine loaded, dual fire selectors, and magazine catches. The game treats every gun in a unique way and if you don't know how to use the weapon in a fast pased game mode you'll run into trouble. Thankfully the game has a large number of differen shooting ranges that let you learn or simply have a little fun. The number of weapons even at this point is impressive.\n\nThe game supports a good number of different movement modes that range from immersive to comfortable. Personally i like the armswinger mode that allows you to run have very fine tune moving at the expense of the ability to reload while running. It's great for immersion. \n\nThe enemies while great targets are uninteresting to look at and are quite dumb in terms of AI. The slicers are very cool and interesting to fight(in melee) but are pretty easy to deal with with guns and cannot path very well. The clunk mk2 is the star of the show in terms of design. Having internal and external parts that can be damaged to disable the tanklike robot in a multitude of ways. The problem is that it is not implemented well yet, has a dumb ai, and has very few offensive  abilities. The problem with implementation is that when you spawn them they just all spawn in one place on the lowest level of the map that you would think would be the most fun to fight them. They never try to take a position that would be beneficial to them and they will often sit and wait for the player in places where the player can shoot at them without reprocussion( they cannot aim high). They only have one weapon that can be easily outmaneuvered since the projectiles are slow. The final and most common enemy is the weinerbot. It has several forms(zombie, bandit, soldier) and can have one of many weapons and armour types. The're ok to shoot at but not really immersive. However their simplicity does allow there to be ALLOT of them spawned at the same time which can be challenging and fun. \n\nThere are a large number of sandbox levels, a few challenge/score levels, and a few objective levels to play in. There are 3 levels that are the most important to talk about. First off is the arena prototype, it's just a large area with lots of catwalks and places to take cover you can turn on auto spawning and just run around shooting to get the hang of your guns or take cover and practice that way. The newest level where you capture and defend strategic points and loot for different guns and atachments. The meat grinder, horror/comedy themed survival mode with puzzles. There are quite a few more but these are where I spen the majority of my time playing. There is the friendly45 range which looks quite similar to the gun range in the youtube channel hickock45 witch is my favorite range to just play around It needs a way to add more targets to the scene permanently and a way to reset the targets without losing the guns you're using though. \n\nOverally the game is worththe money at it's current point. It has allot more content to offer than other shooter games and has an unnatural level of polish for it's point in development. However it's a game that requires some time to get accustomed to so it doesn't do well as a party game.

But, you can also do challenges like you start off with a pistol, and eventually need to aim on some targets in a few seconds before a new round of targets starts off. And when you become better you can buy with ingame credits for a new gun you want to use. There are also bots in this game, so you can actually put up a firefight on you're own with bots. And i really had a blast with it in the mini arena! As a total result  for this game, i am really not regretting what i have paid for!

There\u2019s the standard teleportation, a sliding mode, arm swinger mode, and more. The sliding movement mode is exactly that. You point where you want to go and you slide there as if you were walking. The arm swinger mode is a bit more realistic compared to the others. You hold down the touch pad down, and swing your arms. That\u2019s it. It replicates the movement you would make if you were walking. It\u2019s kinda weird at first, but it\u2019s my favorite movement mode.

If you are money conscious like me, I'd tell you that this is not for a hardcore gamer as much as it is for someone who wants an outlet for casual (but realistic) gun mechanics and ranges.  \n\n[h1]Development[/h1]\nH3VR is stable and updates and new content are regular.  The developer is experienced and passionate about his work, and I'm very happy to see he smartly weighs development priorities.  The one real caveat\u2014but well within his right\u2014is that he is protective of how H3VR is used.  In recent times, he's been vocal on his limits for H3VR being used as a vehicle for objectionable content in the public space (or used to promote a product without permission).  From my analysis, his interpretation of \"objectionable\" is already in Twitch/Youtube TOS, so it's not anything outside the norm.\n\nI'd tell you to sign on to the beta branch because that seems to be the route to go for the \"bleeding edge\" in terms of content.  Don't get too flustered if your favorite gun isn't already in there.  From my observation, the limit is available VR-ready models.  I also think he's got his priorities right making the overall improvements to modes and bugfixes.  As a modeler of 11 years, I can tell you modeling is a time-intensive operation, and that time is better served making the platform for your favorite gun as great as it can possibly be.  I personally have two guns I want in the game, but I'm probably going to end up modeling them myself because there's just so many others that could possibly be added (and PDWs is getting kinda dense).\n\nAnton also seems to optimize well because even my R9 390 can handle the top settings and not chug under a metric ton of spawned guns and mags.  Only in the beta branch have I gotten some stutters in one area, but that's why its called the \"beta branch\".\n\n[h1]Virtual Experience[/h1]\nWithin the scope of the game (not VR in general), I'd tell you that it's almost fully convincing.  I like how well thought out the use of the controllers are in terms of replicating the feel of manipulating an actual firearm.  It's clearly optimized for the Vive because some of the actions using the thumbsticks take a little practice.  You really want to consider a third of fourth camera.  That's smart in general, but also because the best locomotion is \"Arm swinging mode\", and in that mode, you can move (but not turn) by swinging your arms around.\n\nI can sit down and just putz around in H3VR for 4-5hr intervals.  It's not lacking in engagement into the environment.\n\n[h1]How I use It[/h1]\nPersonally, I use it like I would use a range in real life.  I've kinda given it more purpose than a casual sim.

So much tender love and care has been put into every little nook and cranny of the guns you can use that it brings a tear to my Patriotic striken eye. (And I'm not even American!) The developer - Anton - is so dedicated to this project and so happy to work on it with bi-weekly updates with new content, bug fixes and as so heavily active in the community that he should be a Role Model for how you develop and run an Early Acess title.\n\nEnough sucking the developers dick. Lets get into the meat of it. (eheheh... meat... puns...)\n\nPros:\n- Multiple scenes for you to explore, play in and test weapons in the game alongside a few very fun objective based maps with interactables. Such as AI spawning, target practice (With multiple settings and variations to play.)\n\n- Over a hundred guns to play with. And as advertised, each is accurately modelled and functions like the real life counterpart. (Sparing for some VR limitations, you still require the touchpad for some interactions, most of it is using your own two hands!\n\n- Constant and active developer updates and developer himself. You'll get any answer you need from the H3VR reddit, where updates are posted with changelogs. You won't miss a thing and keep up with the memes!\n- Slow to fast paced gameplay. Fancy shooting up some bots and running about? Or you just wanna load up an AK-47 or two and see how many times you can hit the broad side of a barn? Hell yeah you can! Your imagination is the limit - scenes provide you with plenty of visual stimulus to keep you entertained. And just exploring how the guns work and looking at their models is a load of fun!\n\n- Weapon wackiness. Wanna put 13 red dot sights on your Mk-18, 3 sniper scopes and 9 laser dots? You might crash your game. But you can do it!\n\n- Meat.\n\n- Just buy it already.\n\nCons:\n- It's still a WIP.\n\n- Wait, Mister! Thats a con? Yes! It is, the game is still being made. There are unfinished features of the game that are on the list to be developed on, so your favourite section might not be updated for a long time. \n\n- There will be no Kollibri.\n\n- Antons couch.\n\n- There aren't really many cons.

Prior to getting my vive around Christmas, I had been eyeing this game for several months. After my initial list of games I purchased this one a little after the MEATS update was released and have loved every minute of it since. It is nearly my most played VR game (audio shield slightly wins right. Ow because my wife and guests play that in addition to myself). \n\nI originally only wanted a VR shooting range, but this game does so much more (in addition to the VR shooting range). MeatGrinder is a huge thrill and a ton of fun. MEATS offers a huge variety of ways to shoot. The indoor range and friendly 45 are my favorite ranges (I love the \"trap shooting\" on friendly45 even though I can only hit the pots. The most recent WURSTWORLD update is just incredible and is the real reason I'm writing this review. \n\nI normally try and get 1hour/$ in my video game purchases, but WURSTWORLD itself feels like an entire game. With ~16 hours at the time of writing, I feel like I've totally gotten my money's worth and extra. Anton, the dev, clearly puts so much work, thought, and love into this game. The physics are amazing, the game looks great and ran perfectly on my 980 before I upgraded, and the variety of guns and ammo is just astounding. I'm not even entirely sure I've used every firearm yet because there are just so many and Anton is continuously adding more. \n\nIf I had to say one bad thing about this game, it's that you really need to watch Anton's dev logs in order to figure a lot of things out as the current in-game directions are lacking. However, Anton has mentioned this is something he is working on. \n\nThis is a sandbox game, so don't expect a story line (although WURSTWORLD has a better storyline than a lot of other games I've played), but this is the definitive firearm simulation game for VR.

A Firearms simulator at heart but not what I would consider a game.... YET! Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades has only just gotten an update that has just started turning it into an actual game.\n\nIf you go into Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades expecting a full on VR game then you will be slightly disappointed, however if you go into it expecting a Simulator or an Experience then you will be a very happy chappy.\n\nThe game is developed by a very dedicated & loyal developer that always puts the content and the community above the income. He's never released an update that I've been disappointed with to date. \n\n[h1][b]The Review:[/b][/h1]\nHot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades is a very fluent, realistic, very detailed, lovingly crafted simulator. The firearms are modelled to their real life counterparts, the sounds are authentic to the real life counter parts & most importantly the FPS is solid smooth all the time. (Something that you should always expect from a Virtual Reality product.)\n\nThe controls work great, the firearms are modelled exceptionally well & each moving part flows smoothly with the animations. There's a lot of different movement options, graphical settings for weaker computers & plenty of gameplay modifiers to change the experience from realistic to playful. (If you choose.)\n\nThere's a large number of game modes in the game currently from Sandbox target shooting maps to indoor & out door rifle ranges, night ranges, etc. There's also a small number of actual game modes with moving targets and tagets that shoot back.\n\nCurrently the closest thing to an actually game experience is Meat Grinder & WurstWurld with targets that actually fight back & other little mini games to play. There's just so much content on offer here & it is getting better, I've sunk (currently) 100 hours and still haven't had enough of this experience.\n\n[h1][b]The Verdict:[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\nHot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades while a fantastic VR experience isn't without its problems. There's bugs here & there & there's sometimes some bad physics but overall the worst thing about the game is that it does lack some actual game modes, things with enemies that fight back. Currently WurstWurld is slowly making progress towards that but it's still a little lacking.\n[list]\n[*]Lacking actual game modes.\n[*]Buggy physics (at times).\n[*]Occasional game mechanic failures which prevent further play without a map reset.\n[/list]\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\nWhile Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades has its problems it also does a lot of good, I mentioned a lot of them throughout my review but I'll also add them here for those who would like me to just get to the point.\n[list]\n[*]A fanatastic & realistic sandbox Firearm experience from the comfort of your home. (And for those of us who don't have the money to spend on ammo all the time).\n[*]Realistic & beautifully crafted weapon models that really are something to oogle.\n[*]Realistic bullet drop & physics.\n[*]Exceptionally fluent & well animated models.\n[*]A constant 60+ FPS Virtual Reality experience.\n[*]Plenty of customizability from graphical settings to gameplay modifiers.\n[*]Lots of different Firearms to play with from Semi-Automatics to Bolt Actions to Lever Actions & of course Full Auto's.\n[*]Constant and consistant updates that add more content. (Even if only small).\n[/list]\n\nThis VR experience in my honest opinion is that it's a [b]MUST BUY[/b] if you have an Oculus or a HTC Vive you [b]SHOULD[/b] have this game.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b][/h1]\nMy final verdict from Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades is a solid 8/10.\n\nIt just needs a lot more actual game modes to make this a 10.", "timestamp_created": 1499211699, "timestamp_updated": 1500074187, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502605", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33245432": {"recommendationid": "33245432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066087703", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 129, "last_played": 1514441007}, "language": "english", "review": "If you have a VR and are a fan of gun's git this game i higely recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1499197274, "timestamp_updated": 1499197274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33228905": {"recommendationid": "33228905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402360000", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1514114514}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u521d\u3081\u3066\u306eVR\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\n\u9283\u306e\u30e2\u30c7\u30eb\u304c\u30ab\u30c3\u30b3\u3088\u304f\u3066\u5c04\u7684\u697d\u3057\u3044\n\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u304c\u697d\u3057\u307f", "timestamp_created": 1499172034, "timestamp_updated": 1499172034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33223599": {"recommendationid": "33223599", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993347146", "num_games_owned": 880, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 908, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 16, "last_played": 1514011585}, "language": "english", "review": "buy this if you own a VR system", "timestamp_created": 1499162184, "timestamp_updated": 1499162184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33213790": {"recommendationid": "33213790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242037024", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508794100}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game!

In reality it is one of the best VR experiences out there, and I think that can largely be attributed to the quality control and attention to detail put into the game by its dev. I don't particularly love guns in real life and I find the idea of owning/shooting gun kind of intimidating, but this has really been enlightening for me as an educational tool. The level of realism for each gun is so high, that after 20ish years of gaming where the majority of games involve guns and shooting of some kind, I was shocked to find that with an M-16 in my hands I had no clue how to actually fire it. All the small things; loading the right clip, flicking the safety, racking the slide, fiddling with the sights and attachments... I absolutely loved it as a learning experience. Plus, the little things, like I didn't know that after loading and racking a pistol, removing the clip still leaves one bullet in the chamber that can be fired. It was therefore surprising to me when I accidentally shot my virtual foot off, thinking the gun was safely unloaded. To me, this is one of those things where even if you are the most liberal, anti-gun person in real life, it's a damn good thing to at least understand how they work from a safety/preparedness point of view!\n\nBut it's not all educational and serious; In fact, for a game about realistic, lethal weapons, H3VR does an incredible job at not taking itself too seriously! There's tons of fun to be had with all sorts of varying game modes, from straight up target shooting at a range, to swinging out of the ceiling whilst shooting in a jungle gym type arena, to the terrifyingly intense meat grinder mode. As well as being able to spawn items to mess around with without limitation, there is also the ability to reset the environment back to its clean, original state. The variety of guns is large and fantastic, with a huge amount of quality and care in each one. With one exception, they are all true to their real life counterparts, but that one exception is a fictitious gun, the Cleric's pistol from the film Equilibrium (which was a total dream to get to shoot!). There are also some melee weapons to mess around with, as well as throwables and then some straight up silly items.\n\nGraphically, the game is so well done. The guns and textures look amazing and some of the best I've seen in VR. The audio too is absolutely top marks, with fantastic attention to detail being placed on little things from the crack of the different calibers to the plink of the bullet casings hitting the floor. Gunfire also takes into consideration environmental reverb, so a rifle shot doesn't sound the same in the gunrange as it does outside. All these small things do such a good job at making the experience feel realistic.\n\nThe physics are excellent, with the ability to change how physics work from realistic to semi-realistic, or to not at all. I love realistic because I love the \"feel\" of the guns when you toss them on a table, though tossing grenades with realistic physics is a little tricky! I also absolutely love that the option is given to have no bullet casing cleanup, so you can see all the casings pile up on the floor. Other than that, interacting with guns can at times be a little niggly, especially with the Touch controllers, but I mostly chalk that other up to just the nature of doing anything with the motion controllers, plus a recent update helped tremendously with Touch calibration. \n\nBecause of the mostly standing nature of the game, VR sickness was non-existent for me. You can move around the areas with a teleport, which works perfectly fine. I have no complaints about this game at all, but I do have two disappointments, of which sadly the debates on each have been soundly put to rest! I would have liked to (or the option to) been able to see my hands in game for immersion. However, due to the understandable technical difficulties in this task and potential bugginess it could cause, it isn't going to happen. But even more than that I wish so much that H3VR had a Workshop on Steam where modders could create fictitious guns from sci-fi or movies (like the RoboCop gun, Blade Runner, etc, or maybe even crazy things like a Proton Pack!). However, due to the complexity of adding guns and their physics, the game wouldn't be able to support the architecture for modders, so it is a sound no on that. The absence of these two thing are disappointing in the truest sense of the word, but in no way make the game any less incredible.\n\nEven though its Early Access, the current game is polished like a full release.

It is very rare for me to type up a review for a game, but this one most definitely deserves an absolutely good, honest review. The developer is one the most devoted developers out there. I submitted a question asking if this game is able to work on the Oculus Rift (BTW yes it does), and the developer got back with me within an hour of asking the question. Another example is when I asked a question on the H3VR Reddit page, regular people were not the first ones to reply to my question, the developer was the first, and even answered that about an hour after I posted that. That support is a very rare thing to see with the games and developers now. The graphics are really good, and after a while, it feels like I am actually in the game. The game runs very smooth on my PC (I7 6700 processor with a GTX 970 4GB graphics card), and that is with a high quality preset. This is a very relaxing game too when you are just shooting in some ranges. \n\nSO TO SUM ALL OF THIS UP: \nYES GET THIS GAME!!! $20.00 is a great price, and honestly, I'd buy this for $60.00 over any AAA title because of the support and great devs that keep this game going with the great updates and all.

Then you can go out in the desert and shoot bottles (hmmm maybe adding Jack rabbits would be a good suggestion1). Then you can go intio the arena and face off with some nasty robots. or.... go after flying buzzsaws with a crowbar and a hand drill!

The graphics and design are quirky and fun, and there is a large array of weapons to choose from.  Did I mention you get to blow things up?  My favorite so far is the hand grenade skee ball.  There's also an obstacle course, firing ranges, and a host of fun things to do.  I could see spending hours in this.\n\nThe Bad:  The controls.  In their desire to make the use of the weapons as realistic as possible, the devs seemed to have forgotten (I'm sure they didn't forget...I'm sure the controls were the result of a lot of trades offs and I don't want to seem like I'm knocking them because it's clear a lot of effort went into this game) that the touchpad controllers lack fine motor control.  Picking up a cartridge to insert into a gun involves  a lot of helpless fumbling to get it to align properly.  There's also cocking the trigger and pulling back the barrel and attaching the scopes etc.  The point being, the game seems to require fine motor skills from a controller that lacks them, and it makes for frustration.\n\nAdditionally, when you're using the scope on a rifle, you have to shut one eye to see through it.  Can you guess why that's a problem?  And, again, because you're squinting at something, trying to sight something far away, small, incremental movements are required from a controller that doesn't really do small and incremental.  \n\nThere's also a weird bug that kept me from being able to pick most things up off the ground.  Not really a huge deal (and I did recalibrate my floor multiple times), but drop some bullets or a scope or a magazine? Just consider them gone and spawn new ones.  \n\nOverall, I like the game.  But the more I played, the more my frustration grew.  I'm not entirely sure it's the fault of the devs.  I just wish there was a balance between the realism they're trying to achieve and reality of the controllers we have to use.", "timestamp_created": 1487810566, "timestamp_updated": 1487810566, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30106454": {"recommendationid": "30106454", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993117250", "num_games_owned": 477, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510775682}, "language": "english", "review": "That feeling when you are shooting with double Desert Eagles.

If you are having problems learning the controls, take some time to play around with it and learn. Yes, a tutorial would be nice to have, but you're not going to jump right in and learn everything in 15 minutes or less. Lastly, if you're mad because you just wanted to pick up a gun and shoot stuff like every other game, it doesn't work like that in real life either. Having problems firing the M4? Go online and watch a video on how to properly load and fire an M4, you'll be fine after that.

Now, aiming sidearms one-handed feels very different (and is strangely difficult) from what I was used to, but maybe that's because it was so long ago.

The minimum specifications state that I should have a GTX 970 (currently running a 770, with every other minimum system requirement matching or barely exceeding). I can safely assume that the difference is minor, and has very little impact on the games performance. This is not to say that a 760 would perform just as well, but I figured that my system could set the system requirement at a lower bar. I played again today for the first time in 2 weeks to stress test the rig, and I found it to have a very smooth framerate. When I initially purchased the game a few months ago, the game was very jumpy on some modules. However, as of today I can easily tell that the developers have been working extremely hard to optimize the game even further.\n\n[b]Realism[/b] - This is important for me. The very first thing I did after I installed the game was to pick up an M4 and go through the paces of loading it up, charging it, and eventually firing it. However, I was not expecting to actually have to use a safety switch in a VR game. That's when I knew that attention to detail was the games primary focus. Granted I DID buy H3 blind, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. I set the gun down and picked up a grenade. Like the biased approach that I had, I just threw the damn thing. Nothing. Turned out the pin actually had to be pulled. Well I'm an idiot. To me it was like opening a 10K piece set of legos, and being told \"Go forth and prosper.\"\n\n[b]Replayability[/b] - H3 is a sandbox game mixed in with various levels of weaponry and processed meat. Sure you can use all the weapons, and throw all the explosives currently available, but then your creative juices will start flowing and trickshots and speed runs will eventually ensue. After spending 20+ hours in the game between multiple accounts, I always seem to find something new to do and test out.\n\n[b]Dev Updates[/b] - The amount of updates that get pumped into H3 are astronomical. Yes I am writing this review when it's still early access, and I know it could potentially slow down as the months progress. It's not necessarily the amount of updates that makes this an important category for the review. It's the developers focus on what should be updated for the game. For example, I've seen many cases where other game developers will push multiple updates through the week that have new additions for the game, but completely neglect the known bugs or other playability issues. This is not the case for H3. It's a nice steady mix of additions and fixes that allow the players to continually explore new things, while re-playing existing content with fresh fixes. Not only does the developer update the game, he (Anton) also loves to push video updates on youtube to show the H3 community what's new, what's been updated, and what's on his mind for the future of the game.\n\n[b]Player Support[/b] - What I've found out recently is the amount of support that the team gives towards the games community. I've seen and experienced a lot of interaction between the dev team and the community. Which is absolutely fantastic. After chatting with a member of the team regarding a suggestion, I was informed that the team highly encourages community feedback. That's what early access is all about. Becoming involved with the game, and providing feedback to the team to make the game as successful as possible. \n(Thanks Luke for your time!)\n\n[b]Difficulty[/b] - One thing that threw me off was how diverse the weapons are. I love to shoot, and have shot A LOT of weapons over the past few years, but I found quite a few weapons in game that took me a bit of time to learn how to operate. For players or future players that haven't fired a weapon before, don't fret. The game isn't a \"stump the dummy\" kind of game. It's more of a learning opportunity than anything else. In a many cases, once you learn a type of weapon, you've actually learned the mechanics of a few others.\n\n[b](TL;DR) Final verdict[/b] - Overall, purchasing Hot Dogs, Horseshoes & Hand Grenades was well worth it. I couldn't really think of a con or complaint for the review. Sure others will have differing opinions with the game, but the overall attention to detail stood out for me, and really highlighted the potential for a successful future full release.", "timestamp_created": 1483064656, "timestamp_updated": 1483064839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28778392": {"recommendationid": "28778392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074092530", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496197801}, "language": "english", "review": "I now understand how bad my chances are of winning russian roulette...", "timestamp_created": 1482988047, "timestamp_updated": 1482988047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28768093": {"recommendationid": "28768093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055334037", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482962213}, "language": "english", "review": "if you have a ton of moeny to buy vr games you might like this every now and again but it really doesnt have much jsut a bunch of guns you can shoot at cardboard pop ups not i would recommend a game like onwards or out of ammo instead they actualy have a game not a tech demmo", "timestamp_created": 1482962572, "timestamp_updated": 1482962572, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.406481", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28767849": {"recommendationid": "28767849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120043515", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1514214378}, "language": "english", "review": "So I have no idea how guns work but now I feel i do.

I have to judge a game based on what's available, and over the past two months the developer has worked extremely hard on providing two very, very robust modes as well as updating some of the older prototypes.

It's the most accurate weapon handling I've experienced in VR. You literally have to load the magazines/rounds as you would in real life. On most rifles you can use your second hand on the foregrip to help stabilize your shot. You have to screw on the supressors, just like in real life. Magazines are firearm specific, but beyond that you can spawn and mount virtually any optic, suppressor, etc to your weapon of choice.\n\nIf you've never handled any firearms before, just know that if it's not a revolver, you have to chamber your first round manually by pulling the charging handle (SMGs, carbines, etc), manipulating the bolt (bolt action rifles), or racking the slide (pistols). You also have to manipulate the safety selector switch by pressing left on your firing hand's d-pad. Some firearms only have safe & fire/semi. Others have the addition of burst and/or full auto. \n\nThere are shooting ranges of different types, a gym course, and more. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend pulling the trigger (no pun intended) on this purchase. It's only going to get better with time. I'm definitely going to be using this game to showcase VR to others with an interest or background in weapons.\n\nI have some opportunities for improvement I want to mention.\n\n- I'd like to see more weapons in the support category. Maybe the M240B, M249, and AT4.\n- I'd like to see the M203 or M320 attachment for the M4 available and a function to switch between the grenade launcher and 5.56mm\n- Add a tutorial/easy mode for the meat grinder game that enables spawning magazines once you find them so you can enjoy the game even if you lack skill.\n\nAll in all, I'm VERY impressed by this game.

The constant attention to and interaction with the H3VR subreddit is a testament to the quality of this title, with community suggestions being added to the latest build of the game mere hours before updates/ bug fixes are pushed to Steam.\n\n\nThe meat of the game is playing with firearms, and fighting robits. The level of detail put into each weapon is what really sets this titles apart from the rest. That said, the controls are a little more complicated than most other VR games, but I have found this to part of the fun while demoing the game to friends. 'Why can't I fire this frig-  -BANG-  Ah.' However, if you watch the weekly updates, Anton does a fantastic job of explaining the controls and new mechanics (which change regularly).\n\n\nOverall, if you own a Vive, H3VR is a must buy in my option.

The developer, Anton Hand, does however explain incredibly well in his youtube videos how to use your controls, quick-belt slots, which guns can do what and all that jazz to its full extent, so definitely check those out if you want a full look through how the game functions and what you can do! His Youtube is just called \"Anton Hand\", and he does a devlog video every friday to explain what he is working on and why some things will or will not make it into the game. Healthy for gamers and game developers alike!\n\nAlongside what I just wrote in the paragraph above, Anton updates the game every other week(used to be every week, but was changed recently) to fill in what he's working on for the game! He's very active with the community, takes in feedback from the players and experiments a lot with ways of making the game comfortable for as many as possible! Speaking of which, the [h1]locomotion[/h1] in this game is very customizable and easy to get a grip on! You can change the style of movement(joypad-like moving, teleportation, click-to-walk-to-that-location, etc.), how fast you are, sneak speed, among lots of other options to adjust!\n\nBeyond that, there's not much else to discuss without explaining everything the game has to offer! So on that note, I'll give you the innevitable [h1]TL;DR![/h1]\nThis game, in my book, is bloody fantastic! It's fun, rewarding for those who learn, open for loads of customization, very clear and frequent contact between the developer and players, constant flow of updates(again, every other friday), and just the sheer joy of picking up and using guns is [b]the[/b] experience! Out of all the VR games I've played(which includes most of the popular ones), I always find myself going back to this game to pick up the M1911, Desert Eagle, M4A1 or bolt-action sniper to fire at some hot dog robots, target plates fired from the \"PULL!!\" cannon, or lay down in the sniper-range to take down some far-away watermelons with a massive anti-material rifle! There's no reason for you NOT to get this game!\n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1479938302, "timestamp_updated": 1479938612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26909096": {"recommendationid": "26909096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045961531", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509852427}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a really fun vr game if you like guns and you own a vive", "timestamp_created": 1479938291, "timestamp_updated": 1479938291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26894415": {"recommendationid": "26894415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025315899", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479669476}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El juego da pasos de gigante con cada actualizaci\u00f3n , es muy entretenido y inmersivo, y te deja pegar todos los tiros que te puedas imaginar y mas con un buen numero de armas, os dejo un video jugando para que veais lo currado que esta:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxgOIGLT3cI\n", "timestamp_created": 1479936448, "timestamp_updated": 1479936448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26892402": {"recommendationid": "26892402", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991731429", "num_games_owned": 394, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1032, "last_played": 1514651778}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely must have for any VR owner.

The weapons mirror their real life counterparts in their mechanics, which is always evolving as the program becomes much more complex.

But seeing that the dev puts out weekly and very thorough dev reports I decided to support him in what I thought was a game with a lot of potential.  Turns out it's doesn't just have potential, it's already great and polished.  \n\nIt's also very realistic. Well, hand grande skee ball and Lazer wands aren't based in reality but the guns sure are.  Magazines don't magically slide into the gun when they are in proximity.  You've got to put it in there yourself.  No auto reloading.  You have to release the mag, insert another, and chamber a round.  And that process is true to the firearm you're working with, meaning the VR gun operates the same as it's actual reality counterpart.  Very cool, if not a tad frustrating when trying to operate a firearm you're not familiar with.\n\nThere's no in-game tutorial.  Just like actual reality, you've got to figure out how things work on your own or you have to go to YouTube for assistance.  There is a bit of a learning curve but I think that's perfect for this type of experience. \n\nThis is now my go-to title for casual time killing in VR.  But there are also not-so-casual parts to the game if you're looking for a challenging race-the-clock, or wave shooter experience.

There are a lot of cool features and ideas here, but packaged in a clumsy way. It's obvious that the developers are very good at simulator mechanics but are clueless about UX and have no idea how to make something [i]fun[/i].\n\nH3 is basically a gun simulator with some shooting ranges and a handful of poorly designed game modes. The gun simulation mechanics are very solid - the guns look awesome, the interactivity with them (mostly) feels right, and shooting them and reloading them is fun. If you're into guns you'll probably get hours of enjoyment just out of plinking targets at the simulated shooting ranges.\n\nAfter adding the first few shooting ranges, the devs began experimenting with actual gameplay modes. These are all still in development but unfortunately tend to be brought down by issues more fundemental than just being a work in progress. \n\nThe first mode to add enemies who move around and shoot back at you was the arena. The arena has some large, ugly robots known as clunks that navigate around slowly and fire long volleys of slow-moving bullets. Instead of having a body hitbox and HP, the clunks have some red switches that you are supposed to shoot. If you manage to hit all of the switches before any of them reset, the clunk blows up. The design flaw here is immediately obvious: the switches are tiny and extremely hard to hit, and since the clunk fires long bursts at you, you have to spend most of your time ducking behind cover and hardly ever have time to take careful aim at one of the switches. This requires way too much precision, is too demanding, and isn't fun at all.\n\nThen they added a variant that has a whole-body hitbox instead of the switches. Sounds great, right? Except that it has so much health you'll be dumping mag after mag into it before it finally kicks the bucket. You'll end up spending several minutes on one enemy, unless you bring drum magazines and laser sights.\n\nThen they added a new mode for Halloween called the \"meat grinder\". In this mode, you explore a seemingly endless maze of copy-pasted hallways and 3 kinds of traps looking for a few pieces of torso to bring back to the start point which you'll be hard-pressed to find again. There is a new robot enemy here, a tall and narrow one that has spikes instead of guns. There are a ton of pieces to blast off of this robot, and all of the magazines you find in this mode start with less than full ammo, so you'll probably go through all your ammo to destroy one robot. Another mode that is poorly designed and not much fun to play.\n\nIn a year or two there might be a really solid game mode here, but for now you can expect solid shooting simulation and some game modes that only tease you with the idea of fun that is kept just out of reach.", "timestamp_created": 1478066165, "timestamp_updated": 1478066165, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26364090": {"recommendationid": "26364090", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969189799", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511634994}, "language": "english", "review": "I've always had  fascination with guns and how they work, in particular the reloading mechanics.

It's very solid mechanically with an impressive attention to detail. H3 already has a large variety of different firearms and a constant flow of updates, adding new weapons, new features, and occasionally new ranges.\n\nThe mechanics of the guns are very robust, and not easy to master. If you know how guns work, then things will most likely work just as you would expect them to. If you don't, then you'll spend some time figuring it out before you're able to shoot things. It's not as simple as load and shoot for most guns, and there are no in-game tutorials (yet). Most guns operate on similar principles, though, so once you figure out the general principles, it's just a matter of figuring out how they apply to each different gun.\n\nThis is a firearm sandbox more than anything else--there isn't really a whole lot to do in terms of guided gameplay. Out of all of the gameplay areas so far, only a few of them (the arcade proto, the arena, the breaching proto, the Gunasium, and arguably the modular arena) actually have anything resembling an objective, and none of them are very lengthy. Those aren't what keep me coming back to it, though, for the most part; I consistently return to try out the new firearms and features that are frequently being added, and I occasionally jump in just to shoot for a bit, even when there's nothing new.\n\nH3 is perfect for someone who has an interest in guns, but doesn't own one.

There is more with breache n clear areas but these are still under developement but work well enough to try out. \n\nLoading weapons, setting fire rate or turning off safety, pulling back to chamber cartridges is all well done especially dropping the empty and quickly shunting the new one home which gives that authentic feel and makes non VR shooters a little empty to go back to. \n\nSo far it has been one of the best Early Access games I have tried as the Dev is really active and the game gets updates with fixes and addditional content every week, along with a vlog discussing the update and a general how things are going chat.\n\nBuy it you will seriously have fun.\n\n\"Wonderful\"", "timestamp_created": 1474096040, "timestamp_updated": 1477116471, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25529397": {"recommendationid": "25529397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002882333", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1097, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506310904}, "language": "english", "review": "Quality Early Access.

At the MOST, you can learn basic operation of a firearm (like loading a magazine, revolver, charging the firearm, safety, and a basic idea on how to aim down a sight.).", "timestamp_created": 1472967096, "timestamp_updated": 1472967666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25317604": {"recommendationid": "25317604", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013087040", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 657, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512858228}, "language": "english", "review": "VR IS THE FUTURE!", "timestamp_created": 1472875507, "timestamp_updated": 1472875507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25289413": {"recommendationid": "25289413", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009916106", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501973058}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVnsF4ZyZic\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOA7DXxLnkc\n\nThis game is simply epic! It's very realistic, more like an simulator than game. I just like going into that game and shooting at random stuff with different weapons. Even in the early alpha state, the game is already amazing.\nWeapons have to be reloaded manually, there's not \"reload\" button, you have to pick up the magazine and slide it into the gun or if it's a shotgun, you gotta load the shells one by one.\n\nYou can also load single bullets into the magazine and there are other fun things too, such as hand grenades, tnt and even fireworks + zippo lighter to light up the TNT or the amazin banana bomb!\n\nThere are some obstacle courses and other timed / scored courses too, such as GUNasium, where you have to climb thru obstacle course, hit the buttons and shoot the targets.\nOr you can fight evil bots!\nOR you get to be the terminator with the classic M79 grenade launcher!\nThere are weapon attachments too, such as scopes, silencers, laser sight ..etc and you have to manually attach + adjust them, you can also mix scopes, for example you can have Holo + magnifying scope, so you can flip the magnifier scope aside and have short range Holo.\n\n\nThere are things to be done tho, for example the safety / fire mode switch on guns have to be taken off by pressing a button on controller, i'd rather have it like real, that i have to push it with other hand, but I kind of get the idea, in real, you'd be able to take the safety off with your thumb, but VR doesn't have fingers, so it's easier to use a button i guess .. it could be both then. that you can use a button and do it manually.\n\nAlso if developers are reading this, ADD MINIGUN!!!! This game MUST have MINIGUN!\nAnd other things i'd like to see, is more realistic scenarious, such as the house, only with full detail and live targets, in other words, better textures and environments and finally more different scenarious, such as a big warehouse with different objectives (shoot targets, live targets, bots ..etc).\nMaybe you could even add realistic bombs and make them defuseable (some bombs may go off when you move them, some have wires you can cut ..etc).\nOh yeah and it should be possible to take the weapon apart, piece by piece like in real.\n\nbut I really like the game as it is, i just hope for more content :-)", "timestamp_created": 1472751169, "timestamp_updated": 1477102033, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454128", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25281961": {"recommendationid": "25281961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085444353", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1514244382}, "language": "english", "review": "If your an american, Get it.\nIf you like guns, Get it.\nIf you like details, Get it", "timestamp_created": 1472718868, "timestamp_updated": 1472718868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25281126": {"recommendationid": "25281126", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978759417", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472611595}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: The guns behave in a very realistic manner, and all of the controls that someone familiar with firearms would expect to find can be found where they belong.\n\nCons: The game is very picky about things like magazine placement, requiring an inappropriate amount of precision to prevent the magazine from simply getting snagged on the magazine well, an issue that doesn't happen in real life due to actual tactile feedback.

So why should you pay \u00a314.99 for this? Well for starters, this has easily the deepest and most satisfying gun mechanics of any VR game. Everything from shooting to reloading is handled with such care and attention to detail that it provides a truly authentic shooting experience, not to mention the absurdly high quality models for the weapons. You're given a hefty arsenal of guns too, and with the game's delightfully frequent updates, more and more get added to the game all the time.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe visuals are basic, no denying that. The environments are just very flat and feel very \"stock\" for a Unity game. Fortunately, the guns are a stark contrast: even holding them right in my face, the models and materials are faultless, which only adds to the authenticity of the gun mechanics.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nFrom the outset, there's an impressive amount of content on offer. You're first booted up into a menu of bright red buttons, each one providing their own style of gameplay. I mainly just mess around at the indoor range, trying to get the best score with all manner of weapons. But other highlights are the grenade skeeball (I think I spelt that wrong), arena and of course the breaching level, where you can fufill all your badass action movie fantasies.\n\nThe developer also includes handy features which work around potential problems that may arise when playing the game. Not got enough room for room-scale? Just teleport everywhere. Need to carry extra ammo/guns? Pop them on your virtual tac-vest. Have you got guns, casings and magazines sprawled across the floor? Just reset the level.\n\nBut, as expected, the real stars of the show are the guns. If you can do it to the gun in real life, you can do it in-game. How you handle and configure the guns is entirely up to you. I personally find pistols the most fun, you can do all kinds of tricks and skill shots with them while also being a delight to reload. That's not to say longer guns aren't also fun to use. With support for all kinds of attatchments, the ability to grip the gun with both hands and a vast selection of killing machines from shotguns to sniper rifles. Furthermore, if you want. You can fire the guns with one hand, load as many attatchments as you want (for instance: An Acog scope, sniper scope, holo sight and red dot sight all on the same gun).\n\nIf there is one thing lacking at the time of writing is the absence of supressors (aside from the one found on the M9 pistol). But I'm sure they'll get added in some future update.\n\nEDIT - THIS HAS BEEN ADDED. NOW THERE IS NOTHING MISSING.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nOverall, if you have even a passing interest in guns and are lucky enough to own a Vive. This is an essential purchase.

I was so determined to figure out the game, that I went back to it shortly after the negative review. Suddenly just about everything was working, but here are my existing issues:\n-Being able to drop a mag out of the AKM or one of the SMG's.  \n- I am able to detach scopes, by holding trigger to grip it, then down on the pad. It is still a little buggy but still ended up working, I swear I had tried this before and it wasn't working.\n-It is awesome news to hear that the mounting system is being worked on, that is my main problem.\n-The menu still has trouble coming up, I found the 4 directional menu comes up easier if i combine sliding my thumb with actually pressing down, but straight pressing, I need 3+ clicks to bring a menu up. \n-Previous issues that I resolved really just came from not knowing the precise inputs needed to make the actions occur. Along with that, a lack of instructions, which I know the developers are aware of that request. \n\n\nLike I said in my original review, this game is amazing when it comes to how it has been designed. I have been parts of alpha/beta testing, and I should have better understood that this game is still in heavy development, along with most VR games. I understand that with an early game, the developer just wants to get the features in to show everyone what the game is capable of, and is really all about. Then the finishing touches involve cleaning up bugs and clunkiness. With some forgiveness, sometimes a bug just has to be focused on. So considering the games current state and development stage, it absolutely needs a thumbs up. \n\nIt is one of the best looking games that I have, it just happens to be an issue when I want to just show somebody this game.

I was not expecting much at first knowing Vive games are still in the making but I have to admit this was a good surprise !\nThe game is quite realistic on several aspects, the weapons look real, ammo and items too, aiming is better than in other VR games.\n\nThere are still things that really need to be improved like magazines reloads, they are a lot harder to switch than in real life because you can't feel them. It's a pain to aim the mag inside the weapon and if you want to do it fast you really have to be careful not damaging your controllers.  In a real situation you don't have to look at the mag and the bottom of your weapon you just grab one and switch, there should be some better automation to get this result. \nThe recoil feeling and depth of sound would benefit a little more work too.\nAlso sometimes the pistol grip of the weapon doesn't match the controller hand position, making it odd to try aiming.\n\nHowever I'm confident the dev will fix all this real fast because this is going to be the reference weapon handling and shooting for VR. This could lead to a new standard for all FPS games as funny as it is now just to play with VR guns and grenades this game is the coolest anti-stress break !\n\n\nPS: Dev please add some bullpup weapon that would be really neat to use for breach missions ;)\n\n\nEDIT:  Devs are doing a great job !!", "timestamp_created": 1468231859, "timestamp_updated": 1473094861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629851", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24243688": {"recommendationid": "24243688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091549050", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 328, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505056586}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like shooters or guns at all, you need this game.

Full gameplay is unknown as this in an early access game. I don't think the dev has a planned feature set and is just kind of developing the sandbox as he goes. Likely a bad sign if you want a complete game but I was willing to risk it for $20. This is less of a problem for a sandbox as it is more likely to be a collection of features anyway. The dev seems to be listening to and interacting with the player base for feedback on where things should go. I have actually spent the most VR time in this game. It is a lot of fun to check out all the guns and handfull of explosives that are currently in implemented. As far as I can tell everything is high detail and offers fairly realistic interactions.\n\nYou can load single bullets into the guns and all mags keep track of ammo count. A bullet must be chambered to fire and weapons have a safety if they do in RL. The angles of grips match that of the weapon's real life counter part although I don't know how well this works with the vive having a much different grip than most firearms. Currently there are mostly pistols but there is also 3 shotguns, 3 smgs, the M4, and a granade launcher. Most of the pistols are semi-auto but there is a revolver as well. A recent update added speed loaders which is nice as it can be kind of slow to load each round by hand.\n\nThere is a system to hold equipment on your person like a chest harness which is very handy. The menu on / triggered by the trackpad lets you teleport as well as pick stuff up from a distance. This lets you get stuff from across the room without teleporting or just lets you get something you dropped and you are too lazy to bend down. It might actually be my favorate feature. I'm playing the game in a space that is a bit too small to count as room scale but enough space to swing my arms around. It still plays fine.

It was fun for the first 5 minutes messing around the handguns and rifle in the indoor range, but shooting a stationary target in a firing range gets old real quick. I thought to myself: \"What a waste of money\" and closed the game.\n\nThat was until I fired up the Arcade firing range.\n\nNothing is more exhilirating than racing aginst time shooting moving targets coming from all directions to ram you, and franctically trying to reload your rifle or reaching out to your sidearm clumsily when you ran out of bullets.\n\nThis game also has a \"Police Training\" Modular range, which you can hone your reflex skills with a handgun or a rifle. The firing mechanics of this game is so close to reality that I actually found real life shooting tips extremely helpful and relevant (such as firing stance).\n\nSome may find the price of this game discouraging as it is still in early access and contents are limited. I, however, felt this game is worth my money even at this state, and every new content is a bonus for me. Good job Anton!\n\n7/17/16 Review Update:\n\nThis game has turned into a monster! Many new guns have been implemented such as shotguns, bolt-action rifles, submachine guns etc, and they are all real fun to play with! With the recent patch, the devs even implemented a realistic ballistic system where gravity and air drag affects your bullet trajectory.\n\nAt this current state, the price is no longer an issue as its worth every single dollar.

There are some mini-games like grenade skeeball and an arcade shooter, but mostly it's just toying around with firearms at the range. The guns are modeled to be a lot more realistic than your typical shooter. Using the M4 for example requires first attaching a sight, manually loading the clip, pulling back on the handle, and selecting your fire mode. Only then can you shoot.\n\nFiring guns in this is surprisingly satisfying. I'm not a firearms enthusiast by any stretch (been to a gun range all of twice in my life). But using these virtual guns for target shooting turned out to be a lot of fun. It even has me thinking of getting an AR-15 stock and building some sort of holder for more realistic rifle shooting.\n\nMy favorite moment though has been dual wielding MAC-11's.

The graphics are second to none, both on the guns themselves and the environments (love the Skee-ramp and that Arizona sunset!). Where this game *really* shines, though, is the interface. This is a developer who doesn't treat interface like an afterthought, but very carefully considers its role in all aspects of the experience. Using your hands to operate the guns, doing everything from twirling a revolver to popping the lever off a grenade, becomes so natural after a short time that you become *utterly* immersed.

As a regular shooter and firearm enthusiast I find the skills carry over perfectly from real life to sim or vice versa. The sim is constantly being updated on the forums by a very active team of devs who are always keen to engage with the community. You could quite easily become proficient at range etiquette, safety and firearm handling in complete safety before ever stepping foot in a real range.\n\nIf you live in a country like the UK where access to firearms is quite tricky, even after you have your own license it can be a pain travelling distance to often indoor cramped ranges. This offers a fascinating perspective on shooting at home. I personally feel like the experience is on a par with real life shooting when you factor in all the extra expense and hassle of shooting in a country which is not enthused with firearms.\n\nThe developers also have a sense of humour and fun which is evident in the game design so this would also be great for anyone looking for something a bit different. \n\nPosting on my wife's account this is Falandorn from the /r/Vive subreddit and it's been a pleasure watching this simulator develop.", "timestamp_created": 1461407532, "timestamp_updated": 1461407532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.742964", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22574673": {"recommendationid": "22574673", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997862438", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 175, "last_played": 1514297068}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is good; I have a lot of fun playing it. The \"holster\" function is great and I appreciate the ability to make the ammo unlimited. The diversity of the weapons is good (a full size shotgun would be nice though) and the ergonomics of the controls is pretty good as well (dropping the mag on the standard pistol sometimes goes funny though) \n\nBut it could be better. My problem with the game lies with the reloading. In the virtual world you can't feel when the magazine is lined up with the magazine well, and this results in frustration while trying to get the dang thing in before the targets disappear. There is another game that just has shotguns and I can reload them without even looking during the quick-draw mode because the shell and the tube have a sort of \"magnetism\" so if it is close it will go in. Additionally, the player doesn\u2019t even need to be holding the shell for it to load. This is not the case in this game. In this game I have even dropped the shell into the shotgun, it would slide into place, and then just jiggle around, still considered to be unloaded. A fun mini-game that I started to do in the other game is to toss the shell into the air and see if I can catch it in the shotgun. That obviously wouldn\u2019t work here. Lastly it isn't as big of a deal as I thought it was since I found out you can use both hands to close the shotgun/grenade launcher, but the one handed move to close them usually results in my flailing my hand around for a few seconds before it registers. \n\nSo in short, I am pleased with this game, but I feel it would be better if the magazines aligned themselves once they are close (by a couple degrees and millimetres I\u2019d say) and if there was something that allows the shells to fall into place in the barrels. Oh and speed-loaders for the revolvers. I don\u2019t even load them one at a time when I\u2019m at the range. \n\nI look forward to playing the game in the future and I hope the developers add some new levels and guns.

It looks great, there are cool guns with real mechanics but thats pretty much it. We only have 1 pistol and 1 rifle, all the other stuff isn't that much fun to play with. Sure, there is some realism becasue of the guns but for $20 I would have expected a whole lot more. I cannot reccomend this game at this price to anyone. I am a huge proponet for VR and loved every single game I have bought and played so far with exception to this one. \nThe target practic is dull, the different shooting ranges all feel the same, only 2 guns to mess around with with excpetion of a grenade launcher and some grenades and dynamite. Lacking too much content. I see that it says early access so maybe there is a chance they add enough to make it worth it, otherwise they are going to have to lower this price. Maybe if they add a few more pistols, few more rifles, maybe a rocket launcher, at least 15-20 more items are needed to make it feel worth 20.  At this point I wouldn't pay more than 5-10 bucks for it. Also need to improve the target practice stuff and make better game modes. I have the utmost appreciation for the dev of this game and all VR devs out there but I feel like writing a review like this will do a service to people since there are so few of us out there. I'm not saying this is a bad game or to not support it but rather that it is just over priced.\n\nEDIT: 5/27\n\nAfter owning the game for a couple months I have decided to add to the review and edit my stance. This game is a lot more polished than some of the other stuff I have played in VR. it is in early access and I should have taken that into account more. That being said I still think there is not much to do, not many game modes yet but the most important thing to me is the Dev is working his ass off on this game bringing new stuff every week. The guns look great and if you treat this game as just a little gun shooting range simulator you should walk away satisfied. I think there is still a long way to go to make this a full game but just had to revise my review after playing some really crappy games made by some really lazy devs, you can see that in H3 these guys are putting in a lot of effort to make it a good game and worth the price so changing my reccomendation to yes.

It is a pretty in-depth weapon sandbox focusing on firearms in which you more or less just screw with the dozens of guns and other toys at your disposal in a series of firing ranges and minigames. The game is pretty tight, and while there is a decidedly insignificant amount of instruction as to what most mechanics do, the game is easy to master and is certainly a good time waster or tech demo for the capabilities of VR in general.

Although there is a lot of stuff to do, there is very little depth or reason to try out the multitude of similar maps. Although there are some, like the Meatsmas update, that do actually add something worth trying out\n\nUltimately, if you take any interest in guns and have a VR headset (Vive especially), there is really no reason to pass on this game.

For example to fire a gun you need to first have a round chambered and the gun must be taken off safety, but just like in the real world if you were to attempt to rack the bolt on the AKM and similar AK-platform weapons, this would do nothing unless your fire selector was taken off of safe. The 'tactical reload' can be performed on an AK by pushing the inserted mag out with a new one. Rifles and subguns based on the AR-15 all have a 'physically pressable' bolt releases. All kinds of attachments for everything and different types of ammo/magazines. This game will also help/remind you to appreciate using two hands even on handguns when shooting.\n\nFor you fellow gun nerds out there, here's some more just for you. You can attach and adjust the placement of a variety of optics and other attachments to rails, some of which can be attached themselves (such as to the AKM). Plenty of guns have threaded barrels that will allow you to attach suppressors to (where you will need to physically screw them on) your guns, and these produce rather accurate audio when attached as well. As mentioned earlier, AR-15 derivatives has a bolt release, meaning you can speed up reload time by smacking it and getting back to shooting, no necessity to run the charging handle again (although this will work just fine). Practically all the blowback submachineguns such as the MP5 and the STEN gun are capable of having the bolt locked open and then released (yes you can do the HK slap), and open bolt firearms function in good order as well. Honestly, you can put actual shooting stances to use in this game as well, I often find myself in a handful of sitting positions when I want to nail something at medium to long range.\n\nWith regards to performance, this is by no means a graphical hog, and you could more than likely easily run it off of a non \"VR ready\" platform, anything above the GTX 1050 will run it just fine and anything running at 3.3 ghz should be fast enough to give you perfectly smooth performance on this game. You should only really need 8 GB of ram on this either. There are plenty of options for reconfiguring your gear belt/vest, and you can also switch around multiple styles of teleporting and walking, completely eliminating motion sickness for the most of you that would experience it.\n\nWith regards to gameplay, this honestly has a ton of things that can be done. There are multiple ranges, some of which have their own challenges where targets will spawn in, and there is plenty of other minigames, such as a survival horror, and an arena mode that will spawn enemy bots that can be configured with different types of weapons and armor. It's honestly one of the most playable VR games (could go at it for literal hours) for a freedom loving American gun nut like myself. The game also gets plenty of consistent and frequent updates that add more content, at the time of posting the last update added 4 new firearms, and 3 new scopes. Perfect example for an early access game, especially one done fully for VR.\n\nThe only serious complaint to be had is the level of 'shakiness' you may experience when one handing a gun (which I will note you still would encounter in real life to a lesser extent), but this can also be a result of the system you're using. I won't even bother with 'but theres no recoil' as there technically is ingame (the bore axis will move, meaning punching one hole in a paper with full auto is impossible) as well as this would ultimately end up being an issue for controllers to solve in the future when such a thing would be 'physically' possible. \n\nAnd for value?\nA box of .45 at my local walmart is about $21.50...\nH3VR costs $19.99...\nWhen I wrote my first review on this I only had just short of 35 minutes in the game and I know that it had already given more range time than I would realistically spend with a 50ct box of any type of ammo.\n\nAnd for the above segment alone I say this game is an absolute steal, this really does bring me the same joy (albeit maybe if in a lesser amount) of shooting an actual gun, it combines the skills and knowledge of doing so in the real world and puts it into video game form, allowing for sillyness alongside the realism.\n\nI'll also note that while it is a bit more difficult, it is entirely possible to play this sitting (you wont be able to spin around quite as easily, and this is almost necessary in some of the arena games), and it also works just fine with the Windows Mixed Reality headset systems, which is personally what I ended up using the most so far on this.\n\nOne last thing, I should also make all of you WMR users aware that your controllers will be recognized and configured as HTC Vive controllers, this is a problem when attempting to manipulate very small firearms or perform very precise actions where your hands need to be close together. Loading magazines of all kinds is no problem, but using a swing-out-cylinder revolver can quickly become problematic in the combat gamemodes, and you may have a difficult time reaching the slide without moving your hands a little strangely on some handguns.", "timestamp_created": 1516569631, "timestamp_updated": 1516775980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39517056": {"recommendationid": "39517056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194905829", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1396, "last_played": 1516885584}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd like to say my build isnt \"VR Ready\" in Nvidia's words but I have a GTX 1050TI and a FX8350 and i run it fine on the rift.

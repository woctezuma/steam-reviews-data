Now, if NOVICE mode can be easily beat by danmaku veterans, the original ARCADE mode will definitely take some hours to master, and even more time while trying to beat the UNLIMITED mode (although credits are infinite, thankfully).\n\nIn summary, adjustable difficulty and rewarding gameplay. Get it now if you're interested in getting into the danmaku genre or you just want one enjoyable shoot 'em up that does everything right.", "timestamp_created": 1511720207, "timestamp_updated":

The game is fairly short, but if you want to beat it without using continues, you'll easily get a few hours of mileage out of it just by retrying it and learning the stages.\n\nThe game has a 2-player mode, lets you save replays, and has online leaderboards. Apart from the Arcade/Novice difficulties to adjust difficulty, the game has 4 different modes - normal, dynamic difficulty, time attack, and \"explosions destroy enemy bullets but enemies shoot a lot more so you need to blow them up at just the right time or you're screwed\", each with different quirks but nothing super-major.

I thought it was hard then, but this right here is something else completely. I didn't know you can make something more challenging than it was before, and even though I'm consistently getting my sphincter torn apart 10 minutes into arcade BOOST mode and 3 stages into UNLIMITED mode, the bigger numbers, the extra breakable parts, more manic patterns, and autistic routing has definitely made it more enjoyable and satisfying compared to the first time I went through it. Crimzon Heart's second form also feels like an actual TLB now instead of some sad attempt at bullet spam. Being given a taste of my own lock-on attack was a damn nice touch, really added to its ridiculous killing intent in its final desperate attempt at survival. Its patterns, combined with both original and arranged music, gives me goosebumps everytime. Out of all the TLBs I've fought, this one really makes it feel like you're both trying to kill each other, especially so during its final attack in which the bullets get faster and more dense the longer you let it live.\n\nIf I could refund it and purchase this game along with all its DLC at full price, I definitely would.

So when I got this on sale, boy was it worth buying. It was a great introduction to Bullet Hell SHMUPs for me and made me want more to try. The fast Action and Screen-to-screen bullets EVERYWHERE to avoid but I have managed to learn how to manuever out of the way.

This game does a great job of testing one's reaction time, dodging abilities, and resistance to siezures.\n\nHowever, there are a few issues that I do have with this game. It can be too difficult and time-consuming at times. With some over-reliance on save scumming that only becomes more of a problem as the levels get longer and more difficult. Even on Novice mode, the game can be incredibly frustrating if you're trying as hard as is possible to avoid getting killed, having to restart levels over and over. But then again, I'm new to this genre; the best advice I can give if you're like me is:\n- Stick to the Novice difficulty mode and ignore the Original difficulty.\n- Play it purely for catharsis and don't even bother trying to get a high score. It soon becomes extremely difficult to reach the end of a level (let alone the whole game) without losing at least one life, or having to hit Continue (thus resetting your score to zero) at least once.\n\nThe other problem I have is that the second ship that you acquire in the game is basically useless due to it's extremely variable bullet spread, making it more of a liability to use than all the others. Also, the fourth ship feels a little overpowered.\n\nRegardless of its difficulty however, the rules do remain fair and consistent. I'm still having a blast with Crimzon Clover, and I'm sure hardcore Bullet Hell and Shoot-'Em Up fans wil get a kick out of it.

The game fills the screen when there's no need to with points, your bullets, backgrounds that blend into enemies. It's a visual mess in a genre that really requires the exact opposite. It's something I expect most people to latch onto, but a few hours (offline. Steam says I only have 36 minutes on this apparently.) into the experience and I just couldn't get over it. The game was an unappealing mess and I felt like just walking away.\n\nMaybe it's just not for me.

Try beating the level 5 boss without using a continue!\n\n\nNever before has a vertical scroller shoot'em'up been so powerful. \n\nBecome invincible and gain extra firepower when using the Break system, which can be activated to unleash a super powerful shot that covers the majority of the field for a brief period, deflecting most bullets upon activation. Charge it twice and you'll get Double Break mode, an even more powerful version of break.\n\nAdopt various playstyles after shooting down enemy bosses, by looting the different power-ups released by them. Lock-on and unleash various types of damage upon the targeted enemy. The bosses are, in order of appearance:\n\n[b]Titanix[/b] - A ground based mobile fortress defending the Armoured City, \n\n[b]Hecatoncheir[/b] - A six-armed robot defending the canyon that leads to the secret cavern entrance to the base. \n\n[b]Maelstrom[/b] - An extermination type base defense cannon protected by flower petal shaped armour, defending the exit of the cave the player entered from stage 2. \n\n[b]Diabolos[/b] - A flying, modular mobile weapon  with a a fleet of small carriers, protecting the base from the sky.\n\n[b]Gorgoneion[/b] - A massive computer like device constantly absorbing data of unknown content and building new weapons to protect itself. \n\n[b]Crimson Heart[/b] - The true final boss, unlocked after clearing through Gorgoneion without using continues. Little is known about it, except that it resembles the default sprite of Type Z, adding to the mystery of why it would appear after Gorgoneion appears and the player has apparently stopped a kind of apocalyptic event, as hinted at in the text that which appears before Gorgoneion. \n\n\nCollect star points to unlock extra credits and the Type Z shot. Use three shot types. Type I, which is available from the start, and has a slow speed, but higher damage, Type II, which has a \"rolling\" style of shot and higher speed, and Type Z (has a sprite identical to the Crimson Heart boss), which has a very wide and very high damaging shot. Hold lock-on while selecting it and the sprite will change to a re-coloured Type A, causing further mystery by sharing design with the Crimson Heart. \n\nPlay three separate game modes. The first is original mode, which uses the standard gameplay mechanics, with no modifications to the basic break, bomb, and life system. The second is simple mode, which works with a rank system. Break cannot be activated, but is instead triggered by filling the gauge all the way up. Fill the break gauge to also increase bullet speed in three intervals (0%-49%, 50%-99%, and 100%) and game difficulty as power increases. Shoot enemies at point blank in full break to cause massive star points to appear. Finally, unlimited mode, which is identical to original except performing a shoot down with fully charged lock on will release a shower of star points and greatly increase the difficulty.\n\nThese key features truly make Crimzon Clover outstanding. Its name is a reference to a species of clover native to Europe. An indie bullet hell game developed by Yotsubane.

But with that said, while I'm a veteran of the Gradius, Darius, and R-Type series, and I grew up with all the old staples like Xevious and 1942, I've never played what I would term a \"true\" bullet hell before. The closest I ever got was some of the old Raiden games in arcades back in the day. \n\nBut by the time daijun games really started to take off in the West, I like many gamers had moved on from 2D and arcade to more immersive 3D fare. It's only been as I've aged that I've \nbegun to desperately pine for the old ways. And as such, I've found myself this month on a  massive shmup kick. \n\nSo if you're like I was, you might wonder what exactly this game is all about. What makes this game different than other shmups you may have played? What exactly is a bullet hell game \nanyway? Are they just insanely hard? Do you need the reflexes of a Jedi Knight ninja on speed to stand any chance at all? What's it all about?\n\n[h1]The absolute basics[/h1]\n\nBullet hell games are essentially vertical or horizontal (vertical here) scrolling shmups with one defining characteristic that earns them the name: absolutely harrowing difficulty. You will have to be at your personal peak of hand eye coordination to play this sort of game as you meticulously maneuver through razor thin spaces amongst projectiles and lasers which at times fill the screen dizzyingly. This is not a game for the faint of heart. It's brutally difficult, and it's meant to be.\n\nThese games also often lack weapon upgrades or other customization options, as is the case \nhere. Instead it's all about pure twitch gameplay and success against overwhelming odds through sheer skill. It really is a refreshingly \"pure\" form of gaming that goes back to the roots of the industry.\n\nYou have two attacks in the game - your frontal laser, which by default fires forward in a wide spread, and a lock on/homing attack which you can hold until locked on to the maximum possible number of targets, or release sooner for quicker strikes. The longer you hold it, the more powerful the attack will be, and the higher the temporary score multiplier you'll receive for your laser shots for a while. While locked on, you move more slowly, and your frontal lasers condense into a tighter band of energy covering less of the screen. Maneuvering between projectiles while changing speeds and attacks in this way, and knowing which to use when, makes up the entirety of the challenge.\n\nAs you defeat enemies, you earn stars (called stardust in-game,) and these contribute to your \nscore, and your break rate. Your break rate is the speed at which your break meter fills. Once \nfull, you may enter break mode, which intensifies and speeds up your attacks. If you double your break meter, once in break mode you may press the button a second time to enter double break, for even more damage. \n\nBy deftly using this to rack up stardust and points when your multiplier is high, and not allowing your break rate to fall too low (it will drop to half of what it was during break mode roughly once you return to normal,) you can try to rack up your score by continually cutting through the most dense waves of enemies while in break or double break. If your break meter fills beyond a red demarcation line, but is not filled, you can also press the break button to clear the screen of most enemies and projectiles with a \"bomb\" attack. It's usually a panic button in practice when things get overwhelming, especially against bosses.\n\nYou have three ships to choose from at the outset. One is slow but has a broad laser attack. The other is middle of the road in speed, and has a variable laser width. And the third is the fastest, but has the narrowest laser width. I personally find Type-III to be the most effective ship... other than the unlockable Type-Z.\n\nThe game is only 5 stages long... but I haven't beaten it yet on Novice after 20 hours. :) It's glorious.\n\n[h1]Yes the game is hard... really hard. But you can still enjoy it.[/h1]\n\nThe beautiful thing about bullet hells is that they harken back to an era where gaming was still distilled to its barest fundamentals: pew pew. Shoot the things that move, don't get hit. You get hit, you die. It's a simple premise, but if you're never played a game like this before, it can be profoundly overwhelming prospect even for an extremely experienced gamer. But one of the equally great things about the arcade lineage of these titles is that they're all about scoring. As such, when you run out of lives, if you choose to continue your score is completely reset... but continue you can! This means if you're a complete beginner, you can still experiment with the game and try to get to grips with it by dying an unlimited number of times and still seeing all that it has to offer from a sheer content standpoint.\n\nOf course, in my opinion you'd be robbing yourself of the beauty of this sort of game. As I said, I've never played this sort of game before. The closest I ever got to something like this was the Raiden series in arcades. And it's in arcades that the \"kind of gamer\" I really am was forged. I was never a score chaser. I was always someone who loved to play the games, but was primarily in it to challenge myself... not other players. Some games (like Hang On) I was actually pretty decent at. But many I would be happy just to beat at all. I was always the kid who stood around and WATCHED the other more competitive players strut their stuff. \n\nIt's taken until this era of Twitch for people to appreciate spectating games again but back in the day it was almost just as fun to watch someone trying to beat the local high score for hours, as it was to play yourself. Crimzon Clover is a fantastic game for that sort of experience. You can play Novice difficulty if you aren't great at bullet hell style games, and still get an INCREDIBLY stiff challenge. You can also play co-op with another player (local - no online... if only!) if you like, or just sit back and watch them play. It really does take me back to those childhood days in the arcade, just doing my best to get a little further...one more stage... one more boss... one more wave... one more high score.\n\nAnd it should be noted that I absolutely SUCK at this kind of game. But it's still an absolutely invigorating blast to play on Novice. Just hard enough to be brutal, without feeling like there's no hope! Trial and error; Improve. And if you're more skilled, then hop into Arcade Mode. Or if you think you're an absolute master of the genre? Take a crack at Unlimited Mode. There are also time attack modes, and Boost, which massively increases your score.\n\nPersonally, I refuse to use the continues (but did use Type-Z ship ) Set your own goals for yourself! It's a great first timer's bullet hell, but fantastic for vets too.\n\n[h1]Old arcade look and feel[/h1]\n\nYou know that hyper-grainy, yet imminently smoothly animated, high contrast, high color look arcade games used to have? This game, unlike some bullet hells, EXPLODES to life with that precise aesthetic. Even the narrow in-game window contributes to a sense of playing on a cabinet (and there's TATE, rotation, stretching, etc. if you want to.) Just gorgeous.\n\n[h1]Some issues do exist on the technical front. See this topic for details:[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/285440/discussions/0/348292787753336077/\n\n[h1]So who's it for?[/h1]\n\nIf you love straightforward, PURE gameplay driven shmups, and are in the mood for a BRUTALLY HARD game, but one of the best of its kind, give this game a try.\n\n[h1]Who should pass on it?[/h1]\n\nAnyone looking for a long shooter with many more levels, & upgrades or customization.

The game's highly-varied difficulty is a product of precise positioning and mechanical knowledge in equal measure; each mode offers its own twist on the formula.\n\nThe presentational complexity of some core mechanics is rendered moot by intuitive design and a stage replay feature of fighting game-level customization. Learning the game is a joy and a thrill, and a nearly universal control scheme helps speed things along, though usage of a joystick is highly recommended for later bosses, which should hardly deter long-time genre admirers.\n\nThat aside, it would be remiss to neglect the catchy tunes and splendid bullet patterns on display here. There is not a trace of laziness in the boss and enemy design, and this extends to the retro art-style proudly wearing the arcade banner in a sizzling provocation to more modern visual cues.\n\nThe usage of color and contrast is subtle yet pronounced, and there is never a moment where projectiles will be positioned unclearly or blindingly - perhaps mundane, yet crucial, as the varying environments are highlighted well thanks to good placement choices. As far as game design goes, the pace never falters, and neither does the challenge.\n\nWhile never being awe-inspiring as such, anyone fancying electronic melodies will not be disappointed by the melodies showcased.\n\nAll in all, Crimzon Clover: World Ignition is an unfortunately titled yet stylistically endowed shmup, a rare breed in a very niche, even endangered, genre. Even if you are not normally a fan of such products, I would recommend picking it up to test your skills and have a good time doing so.\n\nRating: B+\nA good way to spend some time with no major faults to speak of and good, endearing production.", "timestamp_created": 1476379598, "timestamp_updated": 1476379598, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26010315": {"recommendationid": "26010315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294067734", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504923551}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego es...

They are games that I absolutely adore, where the focus is that primal arcade style of gameplay where the goal is to get good at it and nothing else. And I absolutely suck at them.\n\nSo, i'm not an expert on shmups, if that's what you are searching here. However, my review is intended for the people who don't usually play this kind of game and are somehow interested.\n\nNot only is this a shmup, but it's a bullet hell shmup. Those words might send you imediate images of screens filled with colorful bullets that seem completely undodgeable, and you wouldn't be wrong thinking that.\nIt's a very fast paced and frenetic game where your eyes are completely glued to the screen in awe of the spectacle happening in front of you, making impossible dodges and destroying all kinds of machinery shooting different patterns of bullets at you, complemented by a gorgeous pixel art and a bombastic soundtrack.\n\nThe great thing about the game is how it eases you into it, with a Novice mode, which really isnt as easy as the name might make it sound. The bullets are less intense, but you wont make it to the end without wasting a few continues on your first tries.\nThere is also a great mechanic where you get to use a bullet erasing bomb that is available when you fill a meter, saving your ass alot of times.\n\nSince you dont have to waste quarters to get continues, you have to set your own goals for yourself, otherwise you can just keep on dying and moving forward with unlimited continues.\nLuckily the game teases you with secret content if you manage to beat the last boss with just one continue. Even in Novice mode this proved to be a challenging task. But the thrill and rush I got when I reached that last boss on my first continue, beat him and faced the true final boss really was something amazing.\nA myriad of bullets flashing and homing on me, as I held on for dear life with one life left. Beating that boss on my first try totally made the game worth it for me.\n\nAfter that, you have the Arcade mode and the even harder Unlimited mode , which I have no chance of beating on one continue an im totally fine with that, and other modes that slightly change the way you play the game.\nPeople like to be elitists about Dark Souls being a game for \"real gamers\" and \"not for casuals\", but this game makes Dark Souls look like a Kirby game. Only a handful of players will master this game.\n\nBuy it for a well spent weekend, and if you enjoy it as much as I do, you might find yourself spending time trying to beat Arcade mode in one continue, even if deep down you know your hands and brain have no chance of dodging every goddamn bullet the game is throwing at you.\n\n10/10 would scream at my screen again\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1471985178, "timestamp_updated": 1471985178, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25054188": {"recommendationid": "25054188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104914880", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471789762}, "language": "english", "review": "What a shit port.", "timestamp_created": 1471789898, "timestamp_updated": 1471789898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.338608", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25041411": {"recommendationid": "25041411", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969063315", "num_games_owned": 3608, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471730222}, "language": "english", "review": "Not that great, but managed to give me a headache after one playthrough.

Crimzon Clover was developed by a single person, Yotsubane, for five years and he really did a great job, because this game is great! very tasty and fun to play!

Not only is it my favorite, it has become the new baseline for which I like to judge all others. \n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nLike most vertical STGs, Crimzon Clover follows many of the same rules set down by the genre. You have 3 ships (later 4) with varying balances of speed and weapon spreads, the standard shot/laser with slower movement, a small hitbox, and bullet clearing bombs. Two things which set CC apart are its enemy locks and break mode. \n\nBy holding down the lock button, your ship will attempt to lock on to as many nearby targets as possible. Releasing said button will launch out missiles towards those targets. This design really harkens back to Star Fox; if you're familiar with it, same principle. Unlike Star Fox, though, your score multiplier is based on the continual success of these lock ons. The more enemies you lock onto and hit, in one salvo, gives you a proportionate score multiplier for a few seconds. So, for high score, you\u2019re looking to lock on to a group of enemies, get a high multiplier, use it to gain a lot of points on the next batch, and repeat.  \n\nBreak mode is the main gimmick of Crimzon. After successfully filling a meter, you have the ability to transform into break mode. The transformation itself lends a second of invulnerability, good for saving bombs and lives. Once transformed, you\u2019re granted several benefits. Firstly, and most noticeably, your firepower increases significantly. It\u2019s likely you\u2019ll be clearing the entire screen throughout the duration. Second, you\u2019re given a higher lock multiplier limit. This means everything you\u2019re blowing up with all those flashy lasers is possibly dumping thousands and millions of points down. If you manage to fill both meters, 200%, you can break again for another moment of invulnerability, and double these benefits. Because this mode is so valuable, most score routes are very defined by when you break.\n\nAll other mechanics are simply best in class. The movement feels like any arcade STG. The bosses are challenging yet patternful. The stages do have a nice incline of difficulty and there are certainly a slew of true last bosses to unlock by 1CCing.  \n\n[b]Graphics/Sound:[/b]\nI feel like if the first 5 seconds of stage 1 don\u2019t sell you, nothing will. The bombastic opening fanfare, the emerging of the carrier, launching of your fancy hitbox, and a moment of calm where you\u2019re likely already spamming a screen full of bullets all compose it. That whole slice of cake is a perfect feel for the rest of the game. It\u2019s fast, it\u2019s bright, it\u2019s arcadey, and the music is constantly up-tempo and pumping. This isn\u2019t to say the game\u2019s soundtrack is a cranked burner with nothing in the pot. Stages 4 and 5 especially have these moments where the soundtrack just wanders through amazing moments which fit the onscreen action. I\u2019ve actually come to time many of my routes and timings on the musical cues. The music is there to support the manic action happening on the screen. \n\n[b]Replayability:[/b]\nI know STG games and bullethell shmups are a tough genre to sell people on. Crimzon Clover offers a nice set of different modes, unlocks, achievements, and most importantly a novice mode. I cannot stress how well done the novice mode is. Do not over pride yourself by going straight into the normal modes without being a veteran of the genre. This game will live up to its root and kill you outright on normal and beyond. That isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t fully enjoy it on novice. This is equally true for players familiar with the genre. Novice mode will still kill you, and not an easy 1CC. \n\nIf you just want to spam continues and bombs and get to the credits, then this won\u2019t be a fun game. These games were not meant to be quarter fed for a win, anybody can do that. The point is to repeat them again and again until you\u2019re able to beat it without using a single continue and/or achieving a higher score than your friends (or the world). All of Crimzon\u2019s replayability is crutched by this design aspect. It is very much an enjoyable game to repeat again and again. It\u2019s fun trying out different ships, different tactics, different routes and scoring strategies, learning boss patterns, etc. I encourage anybody new to the genre, playing this, to go ahead and play through the game a couple times over. Count how many times you continued each run and see how it shrinks, see your high score get higher. Trust me, it\u2019s as addictive as modern rogue-likes, and a reason why the genre is still popular amongst gamers. \n\n= = = = = = =\n\nDon\u2019t shy away from the stigma of the genre. It\u2019s a really fun game and well worth the price.

Ho notato quanti shooters, specialmente indipendenti, si rifanno a queste meccaniche. Stanno veramente cominciando a saturare il mercato per questi shooters (rendendo obsoleti shooter come Gradius) ma, fortunatamente, Crimzon Clover World Ignition si pone al di sopra di molti altri bullet hell.\n\nQuesto gioco non \u00e8 un casino dove le strategie devono essere precisissime o dove lo scermo \u00e8 cos\u00ec zeppo di proiettili da non vedere pi\u00f9 nemmeno la tua navicella; Crimzon Clover \u00e8 il perfetto bilancio fra strategia e divertimento senza scadere necessariamente nella follia. Certo, esistono modalit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 brutali, ma Crimzon Clover pu\u00f2 essere acquistato anche da quelle persone che vogliono cimentarsi in questo genere vista la modalit\u00e0 boost che si regola a seconda dell'abilit\u00e0 del giocatore e la bellissima grafica 3D pre-renderizzata (l'ho sempre trovata favolosa) che permette di distinguere ogni elemento nello schermo. Questo shooter si rif\u00e0 ovviamente agli shooter Toaplan/Cave senza essere scadere nel plagio grazie all'interessantissmo sistema break/double break, che da al gioco un tocco di tanta originalit\u00e0 quanta follia, e al radar che permette di eliminare i nemici lontani dal fuoco della navicella. Veramente belle le navicelle, molto bilanciate, gli stage sempre ben disegnati e \"affollati quanto basta\". \n\nAnche i non esperti possono cimentarsi in questo gioco, Crimzon Clover  World Ignition \u00e8 un gioco ottimo. Per i bullet hell questo \u00e8 un gioco validissimo poich\u00e8 non scade nelle solite cose del tipo mettere una ragazzina che spara laser dalle dita o rendere la difficolt\u00e0 ad un labirito di proiettili. \u00e8 veramente bello come questo gioco sia retro ma non troppo poich\u00e8, anzich\u00e8 andare a produrre una, ormai stra-usata, grafica 8 bit, si ferma in un punto fra il 96 e il 97 e riporta quella bellissima grafica di quel periodo. In questo Crimzon Clover vince a mani basse. \u00e8 un gioco veramente old school e se siete amanti e/o esperti degli shooter Toaplan/Cave compratelo subito.\nNon consigliatissimo per una prima esperienza, fatevi le ossa con Gradius o Blazing Star... e poi tornate! :)\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1456424333, "timestamp_updated": 1470703241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21350511": {"recommendationid": "21350511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038760559", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476298938}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "otimo jogo de ... dificil e tela bem colorida cheia de tiro ... otimo desafio", "timestamp_created": 1456006154, "timestamp_updated": 1456006154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21182353": {"recommendationid": "21182353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039552047", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465332086}, "language": "spanish", "review": "+1", "timestamp_created": 1455379539, "timestamp_updated": 1455379539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21170867": {"recommendationid": "21170867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045059915", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496004917}, "language": "english", "review": "for xp", "timestamp_created": 1455345863, "timestamp_updated": 1455345863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21167490": {"recommendationid": "21167490", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240367652", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514122314}, "language": "english", "review": "You'd be hard pressed to find another SHUMP as chaotic and fun as this.", "timestamp_created": 1455332384, "timestamp_updated": 1455332384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21160588": {"recommendationid": "21160588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023981082", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445080879}, "language": "english", "review": "The closest thing to DaiOuJou without being it.", "timestamp_created": 1455308921, "timestamp_updated": 1455308921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21138215": {"recommendationid": "21138215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074882413", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499451419}, "language": "french", "review": "Grosse suprise, un bon gros shoot \u00e0 l'ancienne fa\u00e7on Rtype :\nTout en 2D l'\u00e9cran \u00e9tant r\u00e9duit mais avec un peu d'habitude on finit par s'habituer aux menaces afin de les \u00e9viter.\n2 modes de tir, et un double finish (bombe ou bourrinage) le classic et le lock on avec ciblage plus lent mais d\u00e9vastateur.

You get 4 kinds of ships, one is unlockable, all ships only differ in shot width and movement speed. Basically this is some nice old fashioned arcade action. You fill your gauge up and get breaker and double breaker modes, doubling then trippling your fire power.\n\nWhen you activate that breaker mode, you unload on your enemies, they start exploding, the screen starts shaking, god damn it's a good feeling. You also have this other weapon, basically a missle system. You hold the button down, enemies around you get marked, then when you release the button, missiles get fired at them; while you hold this button down, you move a bit slower.\n\nWhy do I not recomend this game though? Because of 2 flaws:\n\n1.) Your ship moves way too freaken fast, every ship has two speeds, fast as shit, and too fast. As you need to dodge a lot of bullets in this game, many of which slow moving, that means you need to move through some pretty tight spaces. Try doing that at top speed, you can't be precise enough to survive. The slowest speed your ship goes, is just too fast.\n\n2.) The slow down button is also an attack button. So when you hold down the missle button, you move slow, but when you release it to fire the missiles, you suddenly go super sonic speed. And since your holding then releasing the button often, you basically shift from moving ultra fast, to just fast. Try dodge bullets while doing this! In the later levels, there are some things that you need to kill as fast as possible, while dodging bullets. So that means holding and releasing the missle button, which makes to shift speeds. It is agonizing.\n\nAside from that the game is just very generic, theres nothing really new in terms of weapons or level design. Despite that, it could still be fun if not for the above problems.\n\nI must say I do enjoy the game up to the end of level 2, but level 3 and beyond it becomes purely anoying.", "timestamp_created": 1454031393, "timestamp_updated": 1455673625, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464689", "comment_count": "15", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20754089": {"recommendationid": "20754089", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989384558", "num_games_owned": 592, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453760965}, "language": "english", "review": "Clusterfuck/10", "timestamp_created": 1453754633, "timestamp_updated": 1453754633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20721681": {"recommendationid": "20721681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050930113", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485322454}, "language": "spanish", "review": "uno de los mejores Shmups que he jugado :3", "timestamp_created": 1453630487, "timestamp_updated": 1453630487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20691981": {"recommendationid": "20691981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027474775", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453584749}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a popular AAA game whose trailer says: [h1]\u201cDo you know the definition of insanity?\u201d[/h1]\n\nWell, the answer is Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nThere is no story, you just fire!\n\n[h1]Gameplay and mechanics[/h1]\n\nWell, it is quite simple, fire, keep shooting, collect stars and score as high as you can, try not to die and keep firing!\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nThe graphics on these kind of games is the one we grew up playing with, so there is no problem if they look outdated or not enhanced or whatever, we don\u2019t care, that\u2019s why I like these games, it\u2019s all about the fun and the insanity. Crimzon Clover is a good example of old shooters that we don\u2019t see much around, but that clearly keeps that feeling of an arcade machine, the claustrophobic sensation of the screen, the gazillion bullets and effects that barely let you see where you are standing, dodging and avoiding damage!

For the keen eye Cave's two color shot and speeds with score system and hyper mode (aka Break Mode) , some layer locking and secondary shot slowdown, AND even Cho Ren Sha's \"trinity\" Power-up all says you're in for a good time. Seriously the amount of cues to the now staple systems for vertical games is very refreshing and respectful, one could keep this title as a reference for those who are just getting into or interested in the genre.\n\nAnother note is that the whole package feels right, especially for the balanced use of freeware and in-house assets. The shot, ship, and swarm speeds are all there and on point. The different mode further tailor the experience to your battle mood. Simply solid delivery across the arcade board.\n\nAbout the only thing I'm holdong out for, if not hoping for is the incoming titles to have a \"sweet definiton\" - that one token mechanic that you notice that says iconic. Double Break mode is a close second, still leaves me wanting more.\nC. Clover as a whole has near iconic quality, yet for it to make its own would really shine. I want the feels, the excitement is only one part.\n\nMind you though, the above is just an over time sentement.

Whoever composed the music in the game deserves a hundred medals! It fits the mood of the game near perfectly and always helps to listen to when you are feeling down.\nThe only thing i'm dissapointed in with this game is the lack of levels, Having only 5 Levels does restrict replayability value somewhat.\n\nThe difficulty suits both Beginners and Seasoned Veterans of Bullet Games, The Novice mode is great for beginners and returning players looking to sharpen up and unlimited mode is perfect for Veterans with an extremely high difficulty factor.\n\nMy closing thoughts on the game are these:\nCC:WI Is a brilliantly though of game with easy and challenging elements with a rocking soundtrack to boot.\nWhile some game Settings are limited everything you need is there with the option to flip your screen sideways, Change keybinds, Switch between using a Controller or Keyboard and the usual Sound Options.\nI would most definetely recommend this game to anyone looking to get into the Bullet Hell Genre and also recommend it to Bullet Hell Experts because this game will test even the greatest.\n\n--Ratings--\nGame Design - 9.7/10\nGame Soundtrack - 10/10\nGame Options/Settings - 6/10\nReplayability Value - 4/10\nDifficulty - 4/10 -:-

Your ship always starts with its maximum streangth, spay, speed etc, so there is no downside to loosing a life here and there or to worry about reaching a certain power up floating around the stage.\nThis makes it far easier to concentrate on its core mechanics and omits the need to trow a run because you cant clear a certain section without max stats.

The buttons youre looking for are Z (a.k.a. start. wtf) x, c, v and the arrow keys. \n\nThe game screen itself even in full screen mode is about the size of a sheet of paper, since the borders on the left and right (which youll probably never even look at. i didnt) take up a third of the screen. EACH.\n\nI'm guessing that my experience with top down shooters is limited compared to the people who overwhelmingly loved this game. I have played classics like life force, gunsmoke, the rtype series, UN squadron, stuff like that on classic consoles. This game is by FAR nothing like those. In this one, instead of playing a game where you pilot a ship to avoid and shoot down enemies, you play some kind of super powered ship of absolute destruction while you try and rhythmically charge lock-on screen wiping bombs and dodge the bullets that some of the (im guessing enemies since EVERYTHING is constantly obscured by massive explosions) manage to squeeze out. there is no point in trying to manuever for a shot, your shit hits practically everything at all times. The only time you need to move at all is if a bullet is going to hit you. In some rare cases, larger enemies and bosses that take more hits will constantly barrage you with undodgeable on hit kill bullets while you try to maneuver (lel) and hit your. . . other. . . bombs and breaks for the breif peroid of invulnerability that will allow you to not lose a life. Not that it matters. \n\nThis game boils down to ' hold z, rhymically hoold and release x, be ready to press c if bullets are going to hit you and press v to continue. \n\nIf you like shooting at explosions, and wiggling around a little, then this game is great.\n\nthis game looks like someone watcheed someone playing diablo 3 for 20 seconds, and tried to turn that information into a game.", "timestamp_created": 1444512561, "timestamp_updated": 1444512561, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.313362", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18416517": {"recommendationid": "18416517", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973786715", "num_games_owned": 1014, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444504029}, "language": "english", "review": "I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. \n\nOne Hour Reviews #35 - Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION\n\nI haven't really played very many modern shoot em up games.  My history is more with the old school arcade shooters like Galaga and Galaxian.  Playing this is like seeing these old games on steroids.\n\nLuckily for me, the game provides a choice of difficulty when starting a new game.  So novice players like myself can start with the Novice difficulty instead of Arcade difficulty.  You also get a choice of different modes to play in.  For the Novice difficulty I had the choice of Original or Boost mode.  They looked largely the same except Boost mode modifies the difficulty based on skill.  There is also an Unlimited and Time Attack mode, but these aren't available in the Novice difficulty.  I started with the Original mode.\n\nYou get an optional tutorial at the beginning to get a feel of the controls.  I liked that even as a modern shooter, the controls are still pretty simple to pick up.  You have the obvious controls of moving your ship around and firing your main gun.  You also get a secondary weapon where holding down the button will lock onto enemies.  Then when you let off the button you'll fire at everything that has been locked on to.  \n\nThe third button I found pretty interesting as it does a couple of different things.  The game has a break mode gauge that fills as you kill enemies.  If you press the button, you'll drop a bomb which is basically an attack that hits the entire screen, but it also has the bonus of making you invulnerable for a short time.  But if the break mode gauge is full, then instead of dropping a bomb you go into \"break mode\"  In this mode your firepower increases big time for a short duration.  It's also possible to stack up 2 break mode gauges and get a double break mode, which will increase your firepower even more.\n\nAll of these weapons can be fired independently.  So for instance while you are firing your main gun at whatever is in front of you, you could be locking on to enemies to your side.  I found myself hitting the bomb at key times when it looked like I'd be unable to dodge the enemy bullets, so I'd get that bit of invulnerability.\n\nThe game starts out at a somewhat leisurely pace, but it doesn't take long for things to pick up, and the later levels really get crazy.  But I really appreciated the fact that the developers kept the game very accessible.  In the novice mode I played, I got all the continues I wanted after losing all of my lives.  In the latter stages that happened a lot.  But it seems the developers want you to be able to complete the game, and then focus on getting better at it.  So for the very casual player, you can still have fun blasting your way through the levels and dying a lot without any real penalty.\n\nThe 2D graphics are very nice.

Gameplay, Design, Musik - Crimzon Clover perfektioniert alles, was in diesem ja doch schon recht alten Genre z\u00e4hlt! Es erinnert stark an das ebenfalls ausgezeichnete DoDonpachi, und ist somit definitiv nichts f\u00fcr Anf\u00e4nger. Die Mengen an Kugeln welche die sehr sch\u00f6n designten Gegner abfeuern suchen ihresgleichen. Dennoch bleibt meistens ein kleines Loch, durch das man hindurch tauchen kann. Das dadurch entstehende Chaos, in dem es schwer ist, sein eigenes Raumschiff im Auge zu behalten, wird dabei derart episch pr\u00e4sentiert, wie es sonnst nur selten in diesem Genre der Fall ist. Um dich rum explodiert es, die Projektile fliegen in 3d (auch wenn das Spiel an sich nat\u00fcrlich ein waschechter 2d-Shooter ist) und der Untergrund ist detailliert ausgearbeitet. Im laufenden Spiel ist ohnehin soviel los, dass man nicht viel auf den Untergrund achten kann. Trotz allem Kugelhagel wird das Spiel aber nie unfair, so dass mann stets denkt, \"Das n\u00e4chste Mal mach Ich's besser!\", und nicht \"Was ist das wieder f\u00fcr'n scheiss!\".  Insgesamt kann man sagen, dess es sich wie ein typischer Cave Shooter spielt. W\u00fcrde man mir sagen es w\u00e4re ein unbekanntes Shooter-Juwel jener hochverdienten Ballerspiel-Schmiede - Ich h\u00e4tte es sofort geglaubt. Bevor Cave anfing, seine Meisterwerke \u00fcber Steam auch PC-Spielern zug\u00e4nglich zu machen, war Crimzon Clover somit ein ausgezeichneter Ersatz f\u00fcr die fehlenden Cave-Shmups. Man kann das ganze auch zu zweit an einem Bildschrim zocken, was den Spassfaktor nochmal anhebt. Kaum zu glauben, dass Yotsubane dieses Spiel als Ein-Mann-Team entwickelt hat. \nInsgesamt hat man drei Angriffe zur Wahl: Den Standard-Schuss, Raketen mit einer Lock-On-Funktion und einen Hyper-Angriff. Letzteren l\u00e4d  den man mit dem Aufsammeln von goldenen Sternen auf, welche abgeschossene Gegner verlieren. Ist er voll aufgeladen, kann man Break-Schuss abfeuern, der f\u00fcr ein Paar sekunden das ganze Spielfeld mit Feuer \u00fcberzieht. Er l\u00e4sst sich jedoch auch ohne vollst\u00e4ndiges Aufladen stufenweise abfeuern, um um in einem Sekundenbruchteil das Spielfeld leerzufegen, und einem so wertvolle Sekunden zu verschaffen, um sich vor dem gegnerischen Speerfeuer in Sicherheit zu bringen.\nWer auch nur etwas Interesse an Bullet-Hell Shmoot'em ups hat, MUSS Crimzon clover Spielen!\nDie einzigen Shmups auf Steam, welche an diese Qualit\u00e4t heranreichen, sind Ikaruga und die Shoot'm Ups von Cave, bisher hier auf Steam aber nur durch Mushihimesama, Deathsmiles und DoDonpachi Ressurection vertreten. Ich hoffe, dass bald noch mehr hochkar\u00e4tige Shmups von Cave und anderen Entwicklern auf Steam ver\u00f6ffentlicht werden.

While some might argue that such an occurrence is par for the course; given that the genre has always found its roots in arcades which have also become exceedingly rare; there are many who would nevertheless consider it a great shame to see a whole genre on the verge of disappearing altogether. Attempts have been made to breathe fresh life into the scrolling shooter, but the number that has been met with favourable commercial and critical results has always fallen shorter than what most shmup fans would have liked to have witnessed. It should be of great interest then to those invested in the fate of the genre to know that Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION is a shmup that comes of only the highest quality.\n\nCrimzon Clover began as a Flash game developed by YOTSUBANE in 2011. After being re-released two years later in Japanese arcades the game was finally remade into what you have here: Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION \u2013 an international version of the surprise-hit arcade title. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any overarching narrative to accompany the action of Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION and if there is, then it\u2019s safe to say that it\u2019s nowhere to be found in the game. Then again, games of this nature aren\u2019t known for their need of any grand story in order to deliver the experience expected by their target audience.\n\nThe core gameplay of Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION revolves around the concept of the Break Gauge. After choosing from one of four different ships the player is presented with five stages of increasing difficulty, each of which is played in sequence. Defeating enemies using either the standard, forward-firing attack or the powerful homing attack releases scoring items and gradually fills the aforementioned gauge. When the gauge exceeds one of two thresholds the player is granted the ability to use a \u2018bomb\u2019 which could be useful should the bullet count start to pile up beyond what one might find manageable otherwise. Refraining from using a bomb enables the gauge to fill even further and upon exceeding a second threshold it becomes possible to enter Break Mode. Doing so dramatically increases the player\u2019s firepower and includes the added benefit of raking in more points, though it should be noted that Break Mode only lasts a limited period of time, after which the player\u2019s attack power and scoring capabilities both return to the default level. \n\nIt\u2019s a great idea that employs the use of several short-term goals to encourage a very aggressive playstyle, one that sees the player always seeking to make the most of their time spent in Break Mode, and immediately looking to re-enter the mode as swiftly as possible following its closure. Enemy placement has been well thought out: weak but fast enemies appear in great numbers often to shield stronger opponents hiding further up the screen. This provides the player with a good opportunity to build up their score multiplier before going after the targets that are worth the most points. The fact that this formula pertaining to the arrangement of enemy formations persists throughout the entire game; and that it consistently yields itself to create a satisfying set of dynamics; is what makes Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION so impressive. It would be hard to find any obvious flaws in the game\u2019s level designs, and for that YOTSUBANE and Adventure Planning Service are to be applauded.\n\nThe game includes four different modes of play, most of which can be played solo or with a second player through local co-op. The Original mode of play enables the player to extend their offensive capabilities even further upon breaching a third threshold in order to enter Double Break Mode, while the Boost mode of play automatically forces the player to enter Break Mode upon reaching the second threshold. As long as Break Mode remains active, one\u2019s score increases, although this also comes at the expense of the enemies putting up more of a fight too. The Unlimited mode of play is a true test of how well one knows the game and it wouldn\u2019t be inaccurate to describe it as being one of the most satisfying and rewarding aspects of the game. It puts players in the hot zone from the very beginning and doesn\u2019t let up until all is said and done. Players who have the stomach for it will likely come back to this mode of play time and time again. Last but not least is the Time Attack mode of play, a short, single-player venture in which the player aims to earn as many points as possible within a limited period of time on a stage unique to that mode. Lives are unlimited but that doesn\u2019t make Time Attack any less demanding; nor any less enjoyable; than the rest of the game.\n\nCrimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION excels in the aesthetics department too. Each of the sprites has been made with meticulous detail, the bullets and various environments all sport a wide variety of different colours and overall the visual feedback provided to the player is excellent while soundtrack falls nothing short of being amazing. To some extent it looks like some degree of inspiration has been drawn from CAVE\u2019s [i]DonPachi[/i] series, particularly in regards to the appearance of the scoring items and some of the enemy designs. It might be nice to have a centralized element of the UI that displays the remaining amount of Break Mode time the player has left at their disposal, rather than having to take one\u2019s eyes away from the action to check a panel positioned on the left side of the screen, and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a boss health gauge display that becomes transparent when the player\u2019s ship passes through it either, but both of these are minor issues and don\u2019t do any great harm to the overall presentation.\n\nIn short it would be sufficient to say that Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION is everything a bullet hell game should be. Highly polished, highly refined and highly enjoyable, it\u2019s exactly the type of game that arcades could have done with several years ago, and is certainly one that those in search of a worthwhile scrolling shooter could do with today. With developers like YOTSUBANE and Adventure Planning Service around, one can rest assured that the future of the genre lies in good hands.", "timestamp_created": 1442223333, "timestamp_updated": 1442944349, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18026895": {"recommendationid": "18026895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029376571", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486254722}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best Indie titles on Steam.

The game's difficulty becomes crazy and goes at a exciting pace.\n-Great visuals.\n-A super energetic soundtrack that pumps out the adrendaline these kind of games have.\n\nNitpicks:\n-Too much flair and numbers around the screen may make it a bit difficult to see what's going on but the bullets are colored specifically so they are much easier to see.\n\nCons:\n-I don't have any\n\nDiscussion:\nBullet Hells aren't something I really play a lot. The closest I got to one was Galaga Legions DX, and that was in some form way too easy to even match the challenge of Crimzon Clover. Crimzon Clover is freaking awesome. It has so much stuff cluttered (Which is kind of something I'm a bit ehh at) but the bullets and enemy fire are much easier to see. You have to focus less on shooting enemies and more about dodging the fire, since your bullet spread is pretty much 1/3rds of the entire screen. It's a full embodiment of the Bullet Hell genre.\n\nIt almost seems bizzare that the Japanese indie scene isn't that large here. Like seriously, if indie games were the face of powerful innovation and fun, the japanese market is a great example of that.\n\nIf you are looking for a Bullet Hell, say no further to Crimzon Clover: WORLD IGNITION.

Turns out (as far as I can tell) that the game doesn't like it if you haven't rebooted Windows 7 in over a month (I use my computer for various other things that require it to be on 24/7, such as Folding@Home and/or BOINC), in combination with running in windowed mode.  I'm leaving the original review up at the tail end.\n\nInterestingly enough, this is the first time someone's gotten me to actually revisit a game through commentary, and definitely the first time I've gone from a \"could be great but UI needs a lot of work and optimisation, therefore I'm definitely not a fan\" to \"I actually like it\".\n----- ----- -----\n\nHaving acquired the game through the Humble Game Creators Bundle, I figured I would give it a shot based upon the fact I used to absolutely LOVE playing Tyrian in the mid-90's, and also rather enjoyed playing Tyrian 2000.  After dealing with some initial lack of key response (or even recognition) issues alongside some gameplay fluidity problems that turned out to apparently be caused by not having rebooted for some time (despite having no such issues whatsoever with any other games), I found myself rather enjoying the game.\n\nWhile it doesn't have a lot of the various gameplay additions other games have such as modification of ship's weaponry, additional/changing special weapons, XP system, or the like, such things would wind up making this game a lot less enjoyable.  You're given a choice of gameplay type, and then the choice of three types of ships, each with different playstyles.  That's it.  No arduous grind to be able to use the top tier gear, no idiotic levelling system, just plain run and gun while dodging a rather large amount of projectiles the enemies send your way.\n\nAnd that's what makes it so much fun, even my two main issues are that the controls aren't easy to find in game (in fact, I had no choice but to randomly push buttons on the keyboard just to get in the first time, and then it wouldn't let player 1 sign in, just player 2), and that it's rather difficult to know whether a particular space is safe or not.  While the controls make sense once you've found them, it's kind of odd that unlike most other games you can't just hit the enter (or depending on your keyboard, the return) key to get into the main menu as a great deal of games let you do this, then you can look up the actual controls in the menus.\n\nAs for my complaint about what essentially boils down to hit boxes, it really is difficult to tell at a glance whether a place is safe or not.  Sometimes it's okay to have an enemy under you, other times your ship explodes rather unceremoneously.  Sometimes it's okay to barely graze an enemy projectile, and other times if it gets within three pixels your ship goes poof.\n\nWith all that said though, the main question that comes to mind is do I actually recommend it to others?  It depends.  If you want a semi-relaxed experience like Tyrian is in the initial levels, this isn't the game for you.  If you want a game where you're rewarded (or punished) for split second decisions and need to constantly be on the move, and don't mind a potentially aggravating learning curve (but nowhere near EVE's learning chasm of death, at least for basic gameplay) then by all means, give it a shot.\n\n\n-----Original review (now outdated)-----\nGot the game with the Humble Game Creator's bundle, and it looked interesting....  Sadly, the controls are somewhat of a mess (you have to actually spend time going out to FIND what the controls are), and despite having a i7-4770k running at 4.6GHz, 16GB of 2400MHz DDR2, and a GTX 980 it runs at horrific frame rates.  In game counter says close to 60fps, but there is a rather visible delay between when you press a button (say movement) and it actually shows on screen, and the overall rendering on the screen just doesn't have any resemblance of fluidity.\n\nQuite the pity, since I was looking forward to getting the same joy out of a game that I did with Tyrian waaaaay back in the day.  Yup the original Tyrian, not 2000 (although that one was fun too).", "timestamp_created": 1438472700, "timestamp_updated": 1438662129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17308782": {"recommendationid": "17308782", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091641424", "num_games_owned": 309, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452214787}, "language": "english", "review": "Really brilliant for what it is.

Mas n\u00e3o se preocupe, ele n\u00e3o \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel de se jogar e, no fundo, \u00e9 bem simples de se entender depois de uma ou duas partidas.[/h1]\n\nAqui temos mais um exemplo de um game que resgata toda aquela nostalgia da \u00e9poca em que gast\u00e1vamos fichas nas m\u00e1quinas dos fliperamas. Se voc\u00ea, assim como eu, passou parte da inf\u00e2ncia maravilhado com todo o caos dos games SHMUPS (o famoso \"jogo de navinha\" para os menos \u00edntimos), Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION resgata tudo isso com uma maestria que poucos games hoje conseguem repetir. S\u00e3o tiros, explos\u00f5es, inimigos de todos os tipos e tamanhos e muita coisa acontecendo ao mesmo tempo. Assista ao v\u00eddeo na p\u00e1gina da loja (que deve estar a\u00ed em cima) e comprove.\nFalando e vendo assim, pode at\u00e9 parecer muita coisa para seu c\u00e9rebro acompanhar, mas acredite, depois de uma ou duas partidas voc\u00ea estar\u00e1 acostumado com todo o caos visual e saber\u00e1 diferenciar o que \u00e9 tiro do que \u00e9 b\u00f4nus de pontua\u00e7\u00e3o e demais efeitos visuais.\nA f\u00e1cil diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o entre o que voc\u00ea pode e n\u00e3o pode deixar te atingir \u00e9 um dos trunfos de Crimzon Clover: s\u00e3o poucos os games do g\u00eanero que abusam de efeitos visuais sem comprometer a integridade da jogabilidade, tornando a experi\u00eancia frustrante.\n\nA jogabilidade \u00e9 simples e apresenta algumas fun\u00e7\u00f5es interessantes. Temos tr\u00eas naves para escolher, cada um com diferentes n\u00edveis de ataque e velocidade. Todos os tr\u00eas possuem uma arma principal e um ataque secund\u00e1rio que trava o alvo em um inimigo pr\u00f3ximo. Esse ataque secund\u00e1rio \u00e9 infinito, mas deixa sua nave ligeiramente mais lenta quando usado. At\u00e9 a\u00ed, nada de demais.\nA coisa muda, entretanto, quando voc\u00ea consegue carregar sua barra especial depois de destruir v\u00e1rios inimigos (o Brake Rate): ao carregar seu m\u00ednimo, voc\u00ea tem acesso a uma bomba, que, ao ser usada, reseta a barra. Assim, voc\u00ea tem praticamente acesso infinito a bombas durante a partida, ao contr\u00e1rio da maioria dos SHMUPS que existem por a\u00ed. Al\u00e9 disso, se a barra carregar ao m\u00e1ximo, seu ataque se torna muito mais forte - e o caos se torna ainda mais expetacular. Os inimigos, por\u00e9m, tamb\u00e9m reagem com mais for\u00e7a quando voc\u00ea atinge esse n\u00edvel.\n\nA trilha sonora agrada, embora n\u00e3o se destaque tamb\u00e9m. Os efeitos sonoros, entretanto, s\u00e3o muito bons e n\u00e3o se limitam a meia d\u00fazia de sons gen\u00e9ricos de explos\u00f5es ou tiros.\n\nO game n\u00e3o \u00e9 longo. Na verdade, ele \u00e9 bem curto. Se voc\u00ea for um jogador experiente ou com habilidade o suficiente, voc\u00ea ser\u00e1 capaz de terminar o game em quinze, vinte minutos.\nMas \u00e9 preciso ressaltar o modo infinito. Basicamente, nele temos ondas infinitas de inimigos, at\u00e9 que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tenha mais vidas. Garante um bom desafio, mas nada que o v\u00e1 prender por muito tempo.\n\n[b]Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION \u00e9 um game obrigat\u00f3rio para os f\u00e3s do g\u00eanero SHMUP.

That, and Steam would replace the word with heart symbols. \n\nBut why is this game, as you put it, \"FRICKIN' AMAZING\"? Well, my friend, as per most modern day shmups go, this game is ridiculously fast paced, and on top of that, a vast amount of challenge and reward (in the form of big scores and shiny stars). Also, bullets and laser beams will be filling your screen around a good 90%-95% of the time in a playthrough. \n\nThe game comes with four modes: Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack. \n\nBoost is a mode that adapts to your skill and playing style (but mostly the former), in a mode where you have unlimited Break Mode (there will be more on that later) once you get it activated. Truly a fun mode for those who are into earning big points, big stars, and firing gigantic, powerful lasers at a barrage of enemies.\n\nOriginal, as you may expect, is a mode that emulates the original Arcade release of the game on your computer within the comfort of your home (or in my case, all over the place, given the fact that I play on a laptop). \n\nUnlimited is essentially Original mode but with the difficulty pushed to the absolute limits. For those who can 1CC Mushihimesama Futari or reach the second run of DoDonPachi with ease, this is for you. \n\nTime Attack is a mode that asks you this question (not in the game, but in the case of me trying to explain this mode): \"How many enemies and how many points can you score in the time given?\" You have unlimited lives, but, as expected, you don't have unlimited time. If you ask me, it's one of my personal favorite modes in the game.\n\nAll of the modes are fast paced and fun to play around with. I suggest tinkering around with each one and see if you can find your favorite. \n\nIn addition to the four modes, there just so happen to be four ships to play as: Type-I, Type-II, Type-III, and Type-Z; the last one being an unlockable through playing the game and collecting medals associated with completing certain tasks in each mode; such as completing the first level without dying with each ship.\n\nOne mechanic that definitely had me grinning was Break Mode; a mode where you can wreak havoc on many ships with a temporary damage upgrade to your ship by filling up the meter (that also acts as your bomb once it passes a red line) in its entirety. There is also a narrow bar under the bigger bar that you'll be focusing on, and this can play a major role in storing up a Double Break Mode opportunity. Double Break Mode is essentially Break Mode, but twice as powerful as regular Break Mode and the Break Mode timer is twice as long; and from there, the points start piling up at a rapid pace. \n\nIf anything, all I can say is: BUY THIS GAME. And at the time of this writing (during the Steam Summer Sale), it's only $2.49; so there's no reason not to get it.\n\nHappy shooting down ships!\n...And insects.\n...And tanks.\nYAY.", "timestamp_created": 1434179512, "timestamp_updated": 1434179512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16320738": {"recommendationid": "16320738", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988664074", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494202486}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not the biggest SHMUP guy in the world, but I think I just took a hell of a gateway drug.\n\nThere are so many explosions in this game that I'm convinced the enemies actually shoot explosions at you.\n\nI have no idea what the story is or was, but I really don't care.

It really nailed home why I fell in love with the genre as a kid and fell in love all over again when I rediscovered it as an adult.\n\nAt first it doesn't seem much to look at, and sonically it borders on the annoying, but give it a few minutes. The detail in the pixel art I can only describe as beautiful. It's not traditionally aesthetically pleasing, but it challenges that notion affably. The music? It quickly becomes part of the game. You don't hear it as much as you are involved in it, as a player of the game.\n\nOn the challenge front, it starts somewhat slowly. The first level felt more akin to a run'n'gun than a dyed-in-the-wool bullet hell, but the game takes that perception and slaps you round the face with it. By the time you're on the final novice level, you're dodging more bullets than some of the genre's big-hitters, twitching more than dodging due to its sheer pace.\n\nFinally, the bosses. Man I had fun beating Diabolos. There's just something about the way they're designed. They're not your typical shmup boss with different bullet patterns and transformations alone setting them apart.

I was giggling with glee as I played this through. The lock on mechanic gives you the normal focus slowdown along with a bigger arc of fire.

Maybe it's just me, but this game requires some serious aggression to survive with a no CC (more then i may do.). Who knows if ill ever no CC this one.\n\nThe different modes of the game change the script. Original is good enough, but adding Time Attack, Boost Mode (managing it), and then the BRUTAL Unlimited mode... combine it with the overall feel of flight (and speed) and some of the neat pass through effects (moving through some of the clouds in one of the levels.), and this has been an utter JOY to play.\n\nTLDR: Rended to shreds by the bullet fire, and enjoyed it to crazy degrees.

Mastering in what parts to use this and when simply dodging bullets is the basis of this game. But it goes even further mechanically as it allows you to fill the bar faster by getting a higher multiplier with the lock-on laser and also has a slower filling secondary break bar which fills your break bar when you enter break mode which allow you to enter break mode while being in break mode into a double break mode that is one of the most insane things I ever saw in a shmup... But however leaves your break bar completely dry.\n\nThose mechanics completely change how the game feels, while is still a bullet hell, it also remembers shmups of memorization and optimization like r-type or ikaruga as you have to menage your break bar and know where to use it. \n\nNow add the fact that it looks great, has a awesome soundtrack, a good novice mode, great bosses way above your usual bullet hell boss(well maybe not the first one) and a scoring system that is actually sane. Then you end with one of the best smups ever done and definitely the best shmup on steam. \n\nIf you like bullets hells then you need to have this, if you like shmups but was never keen on bullet hells you might find one you enjoy here and if you ever had a passing interest in shmups but never knew where to start this is it.", "timestamp_created": 1427943808, "timestamp_updated": 1427944355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15163844": {"recommendationid": "15163844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139859019", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 155, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507159526}, "language": "english", "review": "very fun bullet hell", "timestamp_created": 1427943216, "timestamp_updated": 1427943216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15163135": {"recommendationid": "15163135", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978608285", "num_games_owned": 1173, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427950134}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy fucking shit yes.", "timestamp_created": 1427938038, "timestamp_updated": 1427938038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15160044": {"recommendationid": "15160044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013598973", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512826284}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon shoot em up, similaire \u00e0 dodonpachi.

Algunos patrones enemigos son tremendamente originales, y acercan la experiencia a un juego de la factor\u00eda Taito; inevitable hacer comparaciones jugables con RayStorm y RayForce. Tal vez a la saga que m\u00e1s le deba su mec\u00e1nica es a DoDonPachi, pero tal vez a sus primeras 2 entregas, debido a su aspecto militarizado, con m\u00e1quinas, chorros l\u00e1ser y patrones mucho m\u00e1s originales que sus secuelas, que pr\u00e1cticamente est\u00e1n basadas en balas. En este juego tendremos que esquivar l\u00e1seres, jefes que se mueven hacia nosotros, encerronas, y en resumen, combates contra jefes 100% originales. Igualmente nos recordar\u00e1 a la m\u00edtica saga Star Soldier debido a su enorme tributo al caravan (Time attack mode), una competici\u00f3n a la antigua, de los 90.\nEl modo de juego es espectacular y aqu\u00ed es donde se nota que esto viene de donde viene, de Jap\u00f3n: Nuestras naves tendr\u00e1n unos ataques especiales llamado BREAK y DOUBLE BREAK, que duplicar\u00e1n o triplicar\u00e1n nuestra potencia de fuego, aumentando la puntuaci\u00f3n que los enemigos nos otorgan.

Plus, it's so much fun to go into BREAK MODE and DOUBLE BREAK MODE for maximum destructive power.

It's one of those bullethells that goes out of its way to be over the top and flashy. It follows standard bullethell ideas, three ships, a stage where you go forward, shoot things, your overpowered, and everything explodes. What it does differently is that EVERYTHING IS BIG AND LOUD AND IN YOUR FACE! You can fire, shoot homing rockets, and do something called Boost Mode where you get even more overpowered and the screen becomes a deathtrap to increase your points. In the first stage alone there are almost 700 things to make boomies out of, and it has your fair share of difficulties. Well... 4 of them. You got Boost Mode which means infinite Boost Mode (Very Easy mode), Standard (Easy), Unlimited (Shit on a Dick Extremely Hard), and Time (egh?).\n\nPros - Over the top madness mixed with standard bullethell ideas makes for a tasty treat of death and destruction. Very well made means good FPS, score is very large treating you with a nice 10 Billion points for no lifes lost so scores are more diverse, good fun all around.\n\nCons - Since everything is dying horribly it's hard to see your ship very well. Most of the time you caught up in killing everything that you commit suicide out of pure fun and it gets really annoying mixed with the very very tight controls. Recommend using something that will help movement, it's very wild and fast and sometimes unpredictable. Lack of settings mean smaller screens will be shot down, lack of settings to control to mass destruction of death from keeping you from suiciding, and last but not least only 4 modes and it wouldn't be so bad if the difficulty wasn't so wonky.\n\nIt has a lot of downfalls but the pros keep it standing firmly.

It was good. Let me write four sentences about it to let people know I checked it out.\" - After playing this game for an extensive amount of time, I feel like I've got to do a re-review on this title.\n\nThis is the first Shoot'em up that made me want to beat my old score. This is the first one to make me want to memorize bullet and enemy patterns. This is the first out of the genre to make me want to 1CC it.\n\nCrimzon Clover is one of the best Shmups I've had the pleasure of playing in the last 24 years or so of me enjoying the genre. The game comes with necessities I feel that every Shmup should have this day in age. You've got training, local leader boards, online leader boards, multiple game modes, and play back. Along with viewing options for those who want to play in the TATE view. \n\nThe game's design is just amalgam of awesomeness. The art direction is fantastic and, in my opinion, blows anything since its inception out of the water. The ships and enemies look detailed and aren't static, characterless bullet sponges just floating across the screen. The bullet and enemy patterns are fun and actually interesting and aren't \"impossible\" for those who want to put in a reasonable amount of time at 1CCing this. The game does a fantastic job of making the player feel empowered with the use of BREAK and DOUBLE BREAK. Pair that with an addictive scoring system, and you get a damn fine shooter that I feel is the best Bullet Hell out of any platform.\n\nThe game is so good that I actually felt guilty afterwards only paying $9.99. If you see this game on sale you need to snatch it up if you'r even REMOTELY interested in this genre. You can really feel the passion that was put into this game from the single man developer, Yotsubane. Also, there's some DLC planned in the not too distant future that brings an arcade flyer (for those more serious about the genre than me), Superplay Demos, and NEW music by Gryzor87. \n\nI really wish this game got more recognition for how awesome it is.

This is the first time I've found a scoring system to be both intuitive and entertaining in an arcade style game and the two game modes I've tried managed to offer different game experiences without changing fundamental mechanics (Deathsmiles, I'm still mad at you).  Almost all of the enemies and attacks are well choreographed with the appropriate lead in making the whole game feel \"fair\" and drastically reducing the number of insta-gibs on bullet spawn on the first playthrough.  \n\nThere's no real story or plot to speak of here and while the sound track does a good job setting the pace and mood of the game, it doesn't particularly stand out compared to other titles in the genre.  The artwork is great and there's plenty of juice to go around, but it may seem busy at times or come across a bit dull to those who are tired of sci-fi/spaceships.  Your profile won't get wrecked by achievements, the vast majority of which can be earned with persistence rather than skill.  After playing through each ship and once in boost mode on the novice difficulty I've \"earned\" over half of them with a few challenge types left for those who want to show off their skill.  \n\nTL;DR - This game excels the most where it counts, awesome core gameplay.

Alright, where do I even get started. \nThis game has only one question to ask you- EXPLOSIONS? And said explosions are usually from the hordes of enemies that you cut down. This game has possibly the best ratio of awesome per minute of any game i've ever played, considering it takes about a half hour to beat. But beating the game with the unlimited continues you are given isn't the real point of the game. You are supposed to beat it with one credit to get the maximum score, and even if you don't care about score, you have to do that to unlock the secret boss. I dare anyone to play through this game once and not want to do it again. \nThe rundown:\nStory: \"lol\" Nezter, 2014. But seriously though, the only story this game has is your epic quest to beat the game without continuing. Which will probably take the casual player a while.\nGameplay: It's like an arcade shooter that time forgot, with gameplay concepts seamlessly integrated from the genre's bests. You hold down the shoot button, time your lock-on attack, weave through curtains of bullets, and **** your pants when you decide to try Unlimited Mode and realize THAT YOU AREN'T MAN ENOUGH YET. And YET is the key to this game's enjoyability. Action movies are one of the greatest media because they depict one or two people standing against impossible odds and winning in spectacular cinematic fashion. Most games have been inspired by this concept, and face a choice- either make the game so easy that anyone can look cool and win, or to make the game really hard and tell it's players to GET GUD. Crimson Clover strikes a balance between the two. Novice Original is a great starting point for newcomers to the genre, unlimited continues make it so that death is never very frustrating, and the BREAK MODE and DOUBLE BREAK MODE and the screen clearing bombs and the slow movement mode when locking on make dying feel like your fault. The game mixes pre-set bullet patterns with attacks launched from moving mooks, and as long as you know what's going to happen next, you can dodge it. Even if Unlimited mode makes it seem impossible. \nSound: Music is sick beats that have a slightly retro tone, fitting in with the late 90's asthetic the game has. Sound effects are good, especially the explosion noises and the sound of BREAK MODE activating. It really lets you know you're about to lay a beatdown on the poor sap you're fighting. \nGraphics: Sprites and backgrounds look great, at least what I could see of them looked great, because of all the stars and explosions everywhere. Said explosions look great, and DOUBLE BREAK MODE lets you give the bullet hell back to the enemies in a gloriously beautiful fashion.\nPrice: Ten bucks. I got it on sale because I'm cheap, but it's easily worth the original price. It'd be worth twice as much.\nReplayability: Two difficulty levels, Four unique game modes. As long as you want to 1cc the game, you should get more than your money's worth out of this game. \nFinal opinion: If you don't like shooters, this game has the best chance of converting you. If you like shooters, than this game should already be in your collection.

Stop reading and buy it.  Don't wait for a sale, it's a bargain at twice whatever it costs now.\n...\nSince you haven't stopped reading to buy it, I suppose I could go into more detail.  This game, for me, has been the perfect gateway to the modern 'bullet hell' shooter genre.  Now, I'm no shmup ace.  I've never 1cc'd anything, and probably never will--I'm average (at best).  For the last decade and a half or so, I'd been intimidated by the direction shooters had taken when they started dramatically increasing the number of bullets on the screen.  I still played old shmups on fairly elaborate retro setups, but nothing new.  I thought the genre had left me behind.  No way could I clear even level 1 of one of those 'bullet hell' games.\n\nThen one day, after picking this title up in a bundle, I plugged in the trusty arcade stick, and gave novice mode a real try. Much to my surprise, I could play it.  Hell, for the first couple levels, novice was too easy.  I'm now gradually easing myself in, using the training modes to perfect my play and see boss patterns.  Replay modes give me a chance to marvel at how long I actually managed to survive, and finally get a look at that fantastic background art.  The soundtrack is another wonder--it never seems to get old.  Control is simple (and should be), but there is a lot of nice complexity offered up by the risk/reward of the boosting mechanics.\n\nI will say that I did have one (major) problem, however.   Starting the game up for the first time on my 720p screen didn't work.  I troubleshot it using tips from the forum, and after a few tries found a walkthrough of blindly changing the resolution that worked for me.  I shouldn't have had to do it, but once it was done, it was fixed forever.  Outside of that, the online highscore system is pretty slow, and I haven't found a way to disable the pre-game tutorial.  So Crimzon Clover is just one major, and two minor gripes away from being a perfect game, IMO.  So now buy it.

I can't beat games on hard difficulties, or on only one continue, and I don't have a vertically oriented monitor/television to play them on.  But there's something incredible about playing a great shmup, when everything comes together - great music, varied enemies and bullet patterns, and game mechanics/controls that just make you feel powerful and make everything fun.  This is what Crimson Clover is to me: a fun, extremely difficult bullet-hell shmup, but one that can still be enjoyed by the casual fan.  I probably had to use an average of 10+ continues each time I've played through the game so far, but it was still a fun and interesting experience.  The three ships have different bullet patterns and stats (Type III moved around the screen quickly but has a narrow bullet spread), and it took me a few plays to even realize that you could press a button that not only narrows your bullet spread to help concentrate on a larger enemy/boss, but also locks onto a bunch of enemies and fires off some lock-on missiles (reminds me a bit of Panzer Dragoon, or maybe Raystorm?  I think it's a fairly common feature in a lot of shmups - and speaking of powerful, Type II's lockon attack is badass) - I guess I would have known it earlier had I actually watched the tutorial but I really was able to just jump into the game without having done so and it was still fun as hell.  Bombs erase all bullets on screen at the time and destroying certain enemies also removes their bullets from the screen, and you can (and must, in many cases) use these features in order to survive.  The first I activated Double Break, wow, talk about a bulletstream.  There is an arcade mode with an Unlimited Mode available, and should be perfect for veterans of the series who might find novice mode too easy (novice mode still has a ton of bullets on screen at once, but even after 3-4 playthroughs, and as someone who isn't all too good at the genre in general, I was starting to excel at dodging/memorizing certain patterns or using my bombs/destroying enemies to remove bullets).  Most of the shmups I've played are on the Dreamcast or Xbox 360 (or Jamestown or other indie ones on PC) and I have to say that this one ranks up there with one of the most fun I've played (I'd have to put it up there with Jamestown and Deathsmiles).  The framerate fluctuated between just under and just over 60 FPS no matter how much was going on on-screen (and with the amount of explosions, stars and bullet sprites that can be on screen at once, especially with double break activated, that's nice).  The only real complaints I have are that it took me a little while to figure out how to get my controls working (I wanted to use a 360 controller and start is not mapped to start [it's mapped to Y, which is actually helpful if you need to pause in the heat of the moment, but the game doesn't have button prompts for the 360 controller, hence \"partial controller support\", but it works fine out of the box], so I had to press random buttons on the keyboard until it activated the menu, and it turned out I had pressed one of the second player keyboard buttons, so when I first started the game I had to select two ships and then just let the second player ship get blown up).  It also took a few tries for the game to properly keep track of my video settings, and you need to tweak the stretch settings to get the game to fill the screen on 1920x1080 resolution.  A patch to include native 360 controller support and to make the resolution settings a bit less cryptic would be cool, but are not really all that necessary since you'll probably get the hang of it quickly.  Whether you're a casual fan of shmups or a hardcore bullet-hell player, I can't recommend the game enough.  It is also forgiving enough with the continues that it could serve as a great introduction to the genre, mainly because it embodies much of what I like about any shmup (cool looking sprites, great music, varied ship types and the explosions, bullet sprites and the way the ships control and destroy everything in sight just makes you feel powerful).", "timestamp_created": 1417301329, "timestamp_updated": 1417301366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572580", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13133879": {"recommendationid": "13133879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110431990", "num_games_owned": 729, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451733096}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "Awesome scroll-shooting game and amazing BGM, hot hot hot!!!", "timestamp_created": 1417231469, "timestamp_updated": 1417231469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13133846": {"recommendationid": "13133846", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998222602", "num_games_owned": 1112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414306256}, "language": "english", "review": "Game plays very smooth and is quite fun... if you can survive long enough.

I really liked this aspect as it rewards you for not relying on bombs heavily.\n- Tons of unique enemy designs.  It never felt repetitive.\n\nCons\n- None.\n\nThough there were a couple very small things that went outside my own personal preference...\n\n- The movement should be just a little bit slower for the amount of bullets on the screen.  However it seems this is a bit of a trade off depending on the ship you choose.  Not exactly a con -but i wish there was a bit more control over that as I like very slow precise movement in these types of games.\n\n- Later in the game some of larger bullets that spread fully across the field that require you to touch them without hitting their hitbox against your own were layered over the depth of ship making it very difficult to judge youhr position when weaving between them.  This didn't happen often and could just as easily be considered a part of the challenge.\n\nThat said, I can't praise this game enough.

Adding super sonic fast suicide bullets on top of that.\n\nOriginal would be a mixture of Mushihimesama Futari Maniac and Dodopachi Daioujou/Saidaioujou. Slower bullets but more busy partterns. In my opinion this is the \"easiest\" mode of the game.\n\nUnlimited is not for beginner, extremely busy pattern all the time, nothing comparable to this, it's all about cancelling the bullet with your lock before the screen gots too busy. Euphoric, yet very very very hard.\n\nA Time attack mode is also available, only one stage that you have to score as high as possible before the timer reach 0.\n\nTo resume, it's a fantastic game that you can play (sort of) cajually or with very complex strategy to optimise your score.

It's one of the best games in the genre I've ever played and I can think of no reason it isn't more than worth your money. But simply saying that doesn't make for a very compelling review, especially for the people that for whatever reason aren't already in love with the screen filling insanity of bullet hell games that no doubt take one look at an incomprehensible screenshot and pass it off as just not their thing.\n\nAnd that would be a huge shame, as more than virtually any game in the genre (save Jamestown), Crimzon Clover is remarkably accessible so much that even a scrub like me was able to clear the game (in only several dozen continues). It's still not an easy game, but it offers a point of entry that's often completely forgotten and makes it immensely simple to enjoy regardless of your skill level, and gives a starting point for those new to bullet hell games to build off of before tackling the higher challenges (of which there are many, ready to break you).\n\nThe bread and butter of any bullet hell game though, is the feel of the composed chaos constantly happening on screen, which is something Crimzon Clover understands and executes to near perfection. You're ship moves with a swiftness and maneuverability to allow you to dodge any obstacle, regardless of how overwhelming things can get at times, and this is matched by the sheer power behind every shot which is nothing if not outrageously satisfying. Crimzon Clover also balances nondescript grunt hordes with memorable bosses, sub-bosses, and distinct enemies, leaving little time to get complacent or bored from fighting the same things again and again. It moves at a ridiculous speed and packs so much into every moment that it's almost draining to play for long periods of time. It demands your attention, so much that you almost need to rest between rounds to be able to take it all in.\n\nAnd what a lot there is to take in. In every background shot, enemy design, bullet cascading across the screen, and even the menu designs there is a level of detail and distinction that almost seems unnecessarily robust, as it's hard to appreciate most of it with how quickly everything moves, but goes a very long way into making a stimulating and interesting visual experience that I kept finding new things in every time I revisited a scene.\n\nMaybe I'm sounding a little overzealous, praising something high and low prior to playing I'd virtually no idea of, but Crimzon Clover is such an amazingly fun experience that it really requires no introduction. It's packed with so many modes, made with such a high level of polish, and fine tuned to near perfection that I can't help but sound so absurdly enthusiastic when I talk about it, nor spend anymore time doing so and continue being held up from playing more.\n\n[b]Full disclosure: Crimzon Clover was reviewed using a copy provided by the developer.

Its hard to beat the feeling of satisfaction when you enter Break/Double Break Mode and just fill the screen with lasers, explosions, and stars.

There's like not a moment in this game where blowing up a bunch of stuff isn't an option.\n\nThere's 3-4 different ships to pick from and they all play differently.  Another good thing, at least for me, is the game has an unlimited continue mode that lets you just play and explode stuff at your leisure, without worrying about getting a game over or necessitating the type of memorization needed to progress very far in most SHMUP's.

DoDonPachi seems to be the largest influence, from the enemy designs to your ship and its abilities. \n\nThose are big boots to fill, certainly, and I'm happy to say that Crimzon Clover achieves it. For the particularly masochistic, its difficult modes offer screens filled with projectiles that you'd be hard-pressed to avoid, and, as with all shooters of this ilk, getting in 'the zone' and figuring things out elicits a warm, zen-like feeling that I don't seem to get with other genres of games. \n\nThe only thing I find problematic is the fact that I don't have a good arcade stick. The Xbox 360 controller, while usable, doesn't offer me much in the way of precision. As a result, I constantly found myself scrolling a little further than I wanted to and, inevitably, into a wayward blue or purple dot that ended my run prematurely. I don't know that this is particularly a fault with the game because the game itself is designed very well.

Hell, you've probably already bought it. This is a Steam port of the Arcade version of the 2010 Comiket shmup, with all the bells and whistles that you'd expect: TATE mode, more ships, better graphics (in higher resolutions!), better controller support, and all the modes and stages unlocked right off the bat. This is probably one of the best shmups you'll find here on steam, bar none. \n\nFor the non-shmup fan / the shmup curious: This game is like taking Giga Wing and giving it a shot full of Michael Bay's explosion wet dreams. Not only are you going to be dodging bullets left and right, but with the break and double break modes (modes that boost your score, speed, and strength exponentially for a few moments by filling a gauge on the top of the screen) you will be seeing nothing but lasers and stars, but not so much that you can't see the enemy bullets that are coming at you over said lasers and stars. While this game is ridiculously difficult, it's well-made and not difficult merely due to a lack of polish. \n\nSeriously, you guys. Get this game.

There is quite a bit of room for individual game play improvement with the multiple modes catering to one's skill levels.

With the new resolution feature in the latest update, I will now be able to play this on my \"Tated\" (vertical monitor orientation) Candy Cab arcade machine.  Indeed, as other reviewers have mentioned, this indie game was given a true arcade release in Japan via the Taito NESiCA LIVE arcade System. \n\n  I stated \"Crimzon Clover Dev team\" but this true indie STG  is created by one individual from Japan whose background is that of a literal arcade Shoot em up scoring world champion who initially made this for the Doujin (PC home brew) scene. It was obviously good enough for Taito to bring it on board with revamped graphics and game play tweaked for the arcade.  \n\nThis is a master product. \n\nThe price point for this arcade quality STG gem is a jaw dropping value for the level of content within. \n\nPlaying through the game , I get the feeling that it's a homage to certain prior shoot em up titles regarding stage set design.  I am loosely reminded of Dragon Blaze in the third level with the giant red flowers. CAVE influence with other subtle nods to other shoot em up titles/companies weaved throughout the game levels  adds to the richness without becoming a clone. \n\n A sort of labor of love encompassing aspects of the STG or Shoot em up Canon. \n\n\nSurely, this may seem like a gush review but it's excellent.

Then you have a meter that builds up as you blow stuff up which you can use a portion of to use a bomb which clears the screen of bullets & (most)enemies, or if you let it fill up you can enter a powered up mode, called \"Break Mode\", where your shots are much wider and do much more damage for a limited duration.\n\n4 different gamemodes, with \"Boost mode\" standing out from the rest; once you enter Break Mode, it doesn't run out untill you die and you have a timer that keeps track of how long it's been active.

Crimzon Clover WORLD IGNITION is probably one, if not THE best shmup to come to Steam so far. I\u2019m sure some would make arguments for some other games that have tried new things (like Ikaruga) but for me this one is king. Clean lines and smooth gameplay just win me over any novelty factor others have had.\n\nThis is a game you play for hours on end trying to slowly get better, not just something fun for a laugh or two. Beyond the graphical clarity there\u2019s also an excellent soundtrack, and the systems while very traditional shooter concepts are executed almost perfectly.  Wrack of combos, shoot everything that moves, use your bomb or save it and use multiple bomb charges to activate a mode called Boost which functions as a supercharge to the weapons as the meter slowly builds up to get the best combo, and try your best to 1cc it. It\u2019s all very standard fare (save for Boost mode, where the goal is to stay in the Boosted state as long as possible, being hit taking you out) but it\u2019s just done so well that you\u2019ll keep coming back.\n\nI find it hard to make a long review with a deep explanation because in truth it\u2019s something every shmup fan knows well, all the usual mechanics are in place. But at the same time I want to say it\u2019s a special form of that, expertly crafted, that\u2019s going to be a highlight in any STG fans library. \n", "timestamp_created": 1404165460, "timestamp_updated": 1404165460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10979203": {"recommendationid": "10979203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982898096", "num_games_owned": 1163, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440275404}, "language": "english", "review": "For those that are into fast-paced bullet hells, this one fits right into the category.

I also like the music, fits in all of the right places and fits the setting of each area.\n\nSo in closing if you like Cave style shmups, bullet hells or just a fun and challenging experience, you should buy this game now!", "timestamp_created": 1403799181, "timestamp_updated": 1403799181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10758165": {"recommendationid": "10758165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124557492", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430739498}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u307b\u3068\u3093\u3069\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u3057\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u304c\u59cb\u3081\u308b\u304d\u3063\u304b\u3051\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3001\u975e\u5e38\u306b\u697d\u3057\u3044\uff01\n\u4eca\u306f\u5e73\u884c\u3057\u3066\u7bb1\u25cb\u3067\u6012\u9996\u9818\u8702\u5927\u5fa9\u6d3b\u3092\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\nSTG\u304c\u3053\u308c\u307b\u3069\u697d\u3057\u3044\u3082\u306e\u3060\u3063\u305f\u3068\u306f", "timestamp_created": 1403624521, "timestamp_updated": 1403624521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504950", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10732481": {"recommendationid": "10732481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055798802", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509717932}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub3c4\ub3c8\ud30c\uce58, \ub808\uc774\ud3ec\uc2a4 \uac19\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc288\ud305\uac8c\uc784\uc5d0\uc11c \uc801\uc808\ud788 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc798 \ubf51\uc558\uace0, \uc2dc\uc6d0\ud55c \ud0c0\uaca9\uac10\uacfc \ud638\ucf8c\ud55c \ud3ed\ud314, \uc3df\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \ubcf4\ub108\uc2a4 \uc544\uc774\ud15c\ub4f1 \uadfc\ub798 \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc288\ud305\uac8c\uc784\uc758 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ub2f4\uc740 \uc218\uc791, \uc544\uc26c\uc6b4 \uc810\uc774\ub77c\uba74 \ub178\ube44\uc2a4\ubaa8\ub4dc\uc758 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \ub192\uace0, \ud50c\ub808\uc774\uc5b4 \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uae30\uccb4\uac00 \ubc30\uacbd\uacfc \ucd1d\uc54c\uc5d0 \ud30c\ubb3b\ud788\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uad6c\ubd84\uc774 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uacbd\uc6b0\uac00 \ub9ce\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ud310\uc815\ub3c4 \ud070\ud3b8\uc774\uace0...\uadf8\uc810\ub9cc \uace0\uccd0\uc838\ub3c4 \uaf64 \uccb4\uac10\ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0b4\ub824\uac08\uac70\ub77c\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1403566005, "timestamp_updated": 1403566005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10727206": {"recommendationid": "10727206", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998600343", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 652, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486409084}, "language": "english", "review": "Best shooting game on steam.\n\nIkaruga can go home.", "timestamp_created": 1403556674, "timestamp_updated": 1403556674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10719959": {"recommendationid": "10719959", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989476084", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2029, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494349754}, "language": "french", "review": "Un shoot grandiose dans le pure esprit danmaku (manic shooter).

On the other hand, fans of bullet hells have little excuse to pass on this gem. \n\nCrimzon Clover doesn't have extremely elaborate attack patterns like you would see in a Touhou game, but what it does have is bullets, lots of bullets, so many bullets that if you tallied up all the bullets in Mars Matrix, Jamestown, and Ikaruga combined Crimzon Clover might very well still have them beat - and that's on the standard difficulty. The enemies aren't the only ones with lots of firepower though as players can fairly easily fill up part a gauge to use bombs (though the amount the gauge needs to be filled increases with each bomb usage), wait until the gauge is full to enter the destructive and score-multiplying 'break mode' or fill up two gauges to enter the absurdly powerful 'double break mode'.\n\nCrimzon Clover also provides a good chunk of variety for players. There are two difficulties (and possibly even a third, hidden difficulty of some sort) as well as four distinctive modes of play, three different ships, local and online leaderboards, and the option for local co-op. Crimzon Clover also graciously provides the option of unlimited continues for less-skilled fans of the genre (I lost track around the 30 continue mark on my playthrough) and comes with a customary 'true' endboss for anyone capable of performing a 1 Credit Clear. In terms of stages, Crimzon Clover is a bit on the low side at 5, but these are five fairly lengthy stages, non-boss enemies very much pose a threat and do not simply exist for the sake of points, and many stages even have a full-on midboss.\n\nLastly, Crimzon Clover is simply beautiful to look at. There is an astonishing sense of speed to the game as panoramas rush past the player and nearly every enemy has multiple moving parts and intricate animations.

It's hard to tell it's a doujin game as opposed to a commercial one The general gameplay may remind you of a mix of things (Dondonpachi, Raystorm), but the main thing that makes this stand out? The break mode system, which not only allows the bulk of the scoring but also provinging a boost to your firepower. Double Break mode is something that has to be seen to understand what a boost to score and firepower that is.\n\nThis is a port of the Arcade version which was previously japanese only, and with it come some changes, mainly the limiter shop being removed but in return you get 3 ships to start (and one to unlock, though easier than the original), all levels accessible in training and free play in most modes (gotta 1cc if you want to see the True Final boss). The general changes are double edged, making the game easier in some ways and harder compared to the original game (stage 3 in particular). But for less confident players, there's Novice versions of both original and boost mode (I'll get on to this later)\n\nThere's three modes to the game:\n\nOriginal: The game's normal mode, where you can see the full scoring system in effect.\n\nUnlimited: This is basically to CC what Ultra is to Cave games and Lunatic is to Touhou games: The game unleashing bullet hell to its fullest extent.\n\nSimple (original game only): A toned down game in both difficulty and mechanics which used your break/bomb bar to determine rank/points/attack power.\n\nBoost (World Ignition only): It's Simple Mode's rank dynamics taken up to 11 as when your Break/Bomb bar fills, you will enter break mode that goes on until you lose a life or you bomb and the longer you're in it, the more the game's difficulty ramps up during it.\n\nTime attack: in the spirit of the old Hudson star soldier caravan games, this has you with a limited time (and unlimited lives) to score as much as possible.\n\nAnd each mode has a small tutorial bit before you start that explains things pretty well.\n\nThe sound track is very good with separate stage musics for normal and unlimited (by default but you can change them around in the options) with its bosses each getting their own theme. Not sure if it'd justify spending extra for the soundtrack, though it slightly makes up for the removal of the sound test that was in the original.\n\nAnd the plot? There is none beyond \"Blow them up\"\n\nUpdate:resolution/screen issues fixed.\n\nHighly recommended for any shump fan.", "timestamp_created": 1402564765, "timestamp_updated": 1404986218, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10435299": {"recommendationid": "10435299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119901791", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419067425}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5c0f\u7d30\u5de5\u306a\u3057\u306e\u30c9\u76f4\u7403\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\uff01\u3068\u516c\u5f0f\u304c\u8b33\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u901a\u308a\u3001\u4f59\u8a08\u306a\u8a2d\u5b9a\u306a\u3069\u4e00\u5207\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u6483\u3066\uff01\u907f\u3051\u308d\uff01\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30aa\u30f3\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8\u3067\u5168\u3066\u3092\u8599\u304e\u6255\u3048\uff01\n\u521d\u5fc3\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306e\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6NOVICE\u304b\u3089\u8d85\u4e0a\u7d1a\u8005\u5411\u3051\u306eUNLIMITED\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u5e45\u5e83\u3044\u5ba2\u5c64\u306b\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3002\n\u30c9S\u5411\u3051\u306eBOOST\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u5168\u3066\u3092\u8599\u304e\u6255\u3044\u3001\u6700\u9069\u5316\u304c\u5927\u597d\u304d\u306a\u65b9\u306fTIMEATTACK\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u98fd\u304d\u3055\u305b\u306a\u3044\u3002\n\u5145\u5b9f\u3057\u305f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30aa\u30d7\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3084\u30ea\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u6a5f\u80fd\u3001\u30c8\u30ec\u30fc\u30cb\u30f3\u30b0\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u4e0a\u9054\u3092\u5f37\u529b\u306b\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3002\n\u3053\u3053\u307e\u3067\u63c3\u3063\u305fSTG\u304c\u3053\u306e\u304a\u5024\u6bb5\u306f\u5b89\u3059\u304e\u308b\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u3056\u308b\u3092\u3048\u306a\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1402549670, "timestamp_updated": 1402549670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10428400": {"recommendationid": "10428400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138771706", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1378, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402760035}, "language": "english", "review": "It's ok I guess but hardly as polished or sophisticated as Sine Mora.", "timestamp_created": 1402499702, "timestamp_updated": 1402499702, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.080191", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10425796": {"recommendationid": "10425796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035226905", "num_games_owned": 673, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458974620}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a fan of shmups, especially vertical ones like this, and I have to say I'm honestly quite impressed with this one and enjoy it. I actually read a few reviews before purchasing this game for myself and saw quite a few saying that Crimzon Clover is similar to the DoDonpachi games from Cave, and while I have never played Dodonpachi I have played some of the Cave shmups and have always found them quite fun and I honestly believe the people that compare this game with Cave developed games were spot on. It's a really fast-paced and visually stunning game with really awesome music which are really three things that every good shmup need at the very least, I also appreciate the fact that the controls themselves are very responsive and things such as enemy bullets standing out amongst all the crazy action (a feature I also noticed in Danmaku Unlimited 2, which I also recommend) make the game very fun to play rather than being just a generic shmup that often end up more difficult just because they're not very well defined.\n\nAlso, I want to point out above all else that the Boost Mode is pretty amazing and makes this game at least twice as fun as it started at. I'm sure other games have similar mechanics, but it's the first time (at least in recent memory) I've seen a mode as interesting as Boost. Not only does it make the game 100% more explosive and hectic, it also gives you an additional challenge in trying to make sure you don't lose your Boost and go back to (temporarily) being a peashooter. Also, with the addition of the Type-Z (which requires progessive unlocking, which I honestly haven't completed yet but am working on), the game actually has additional replayability, which is a nice plus for a shmup.\n\n10/10 would danmaku again.", "timestamp_created": 1402479590, "timestamp_updated": 1402479844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.998775", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10422740": {"recommendationid": "10422740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039967463", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467476947}, "language": "english", "review": "A haiku. \n\n[i]Double Break Mode, go!\nStuff f-ing blows up.

Now, the even further polished and refined arcade version arrives on Steam, and it's absolutely essential for anyone with even a fleeting interest in the shoot em up genre.\n\nCC's bullet hell action has you dodging and shooting manically through a series of 5 stages and a host of boss fights. Aiding you are a lock on laser, that allows you to target enemies around you and awards a score bonus for destroying multiple enemies simultaneously, and \"Break Mode\", a super powered state which is recharged the more aggressively you play, and allows you to double your speed, fire power, and points gained when active, and then quadruple them if you can fill up the break meter a second time before it ends.\n\nCC is an absolute blast to play. The stages are creative, varied, and intense. Some of them are quite long, but never overstay their welcome and always stay interesting throughout. The bosses feel fresh and exciting with cool gimmicks and fundamentally fun patterns.  And targeting and breaking feels incredibly unique from any other game in the genre. One minute you're passively biding your time to get the maximum lock on while dodging bullets, the next you're turning the dodging action of the game on its head as you rocket around at break neck speed unleashing your own bullet hell upon enemies. Every moment of the game feels unique and compelling. \n\nIt's also very content heavy. It's got 4 modes and 4 ships with their own unique play styles.  The game is very challenging as well, on the arcade difficulty (there are novice modes, for less confident players) it may take some more time than a full length rpg to 1 credit clear it, and the scoring systems provide immense depth and competition with other players that could take years to master.

Crimzon Clover is one of those games, but contrary to popular belief, bullet hell games are not impossible; very difficult yes, but not impossible. In fact, Crimzon Clover is one of the more forgiving games in the genre in most modes, and it's a great game to get into the genre with as I'll later explain:\nThe original Crimzon Clover was an indie game released by CLOVER-TAC, a player with a few world record bullet hell game scores: this original release was a Japan only, physical disc only release (which is now out of print). Despite the fact this was an indie release, the original game had pretty impressive production values, comparable to bullet hell games released by major developers like CAVE \n[ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAVE_(company) ]\nDue to this success, the game was picked up for distribution in Japanese arcades by Taito through their line of Nesica digital download capable arcade machines. For this arcade release the game recieved a new shiny coat of paint, a new game mode (replacing an old mode in the original), and a few gameplay touch ups. This Steam release is a port of the arcade version.\n\nNow onto the actual game: You can select from two overall difficulty settings: Arcade and Novice. These names explain themselves, as Arcade difficulty is the same as the arcade machine's difficulty setting (tough but fair), while novice mode tones down the difficulty a bit to allow new comers to try out this genre of game without too much frustration. Once you select a difficulty, you get to pick from three different gameplay modes: Original, which is basically the default style of gameplay, Boost mode, where the game difficulty dynamically increases based on how long you stay in break mode (explained later), and Unlimited mode, which usually looks like that video I linked above. Gameplay is standard, fly, shoot and dodge, with bullets only killing you if they hit the small golden orb in your ship's center, but there are three mechanics that are a bit different from most bullet hell games: in most bullet hell games you get a few smart bombs every life that you can trigger instantly to destroy all bullets on the screen. In crimzon clover however you get an energy meter that fills up as you score points; once you reach a certain point on the meter (the point goes further up the meter with each bomb you use in a life), you can trigger a bomb. However, if you let the meter fill all the way up, you can enter Break mode, where your ship gets a big power increase and your main point multiplier is pumped up until the timer runs out (except in Boost mode where you have to manually end break mode with a bomb). Furthermore, if you can fill up the meter a second time before break mode ends, you can enter double break mode, where your ship gets even more powerful and your multiplier jumps even higher. The third mechanic that's a bit different is the lock on system. Besides your standard forward shot, you can hold the lock on button to create a transparent barrier around you: any enemy that enters this barrier gets locked onto (you can lock onto the same enemy multiple times as well), and as soon as you release the lock on button, you release quick homing lasers or missiles at whatever you targeted; furthermore the more enemies you destroy in a single lock on burst, the higher your secondary score multiplier (which vanishes after a short time) becomes.. With these mechanics in place, Crimzon Clover is much more forgiving than most bullet hell games, but that doesn't mean it's not a challenge to beat without continues: you will be beaten down over and over until you memorize bullet patterns and refine your dodging skills (beating a bullet hell game by using continues means nothing by the way!). However, if you do manage to conquer this game, you'll feel an incredible sense of accomplishment and pride that you could never get from the majority of mainstream AAA titles that hold your hand every step of the way. Despite the game's short length (5-7 stages, I can't remember the exact number), this game holds tremendous amounts of replay value for those who are willing to take it seriously: the inital challenge to beat original mode without continues could take a player any amount of hours from 10 to 100, and afterwards there's always the allure of a new high score, not to mention the other two modes.\n\nBottom Line: if you like retro games like those for the NES, incredibly tough modern games like Dark Souls or I wanna be the guy, or if you just want a change from the other games on the market, give this game a shot: it's very rare for bullet hell games to be released outside of Japan, and this happens to be one of the best in recent memory.\n\nEDIT: I neglected to mention two other features: There is also a time attack mode where you're thrown into a unique stage with unlimited lives for three minutes to try and get a high score. Speaking of high scores, there are online leaderboards, and you have the ability to save replays of your playthroughs.", "timestamp_created": 1402265756, "timestamp_updated": 1402424355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499897", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10399376": {"recommendationid": "10399376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998758689", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478581134}, "language": "english", "review": "Been waiting for this game to get on Steam for awhile, finally it's on here.

It now features more game modes, one extra ship, better graphics in higher resolution, TATE mode, plus many Steam goodies like Cloud, Achievements and Leaderboards. In my opinion, Crimzon Clover World Ignition is THE shmup of the decade and on no occasion should it be missed or ignored by gamers, shmuppers and non-shmuppers alike, that enjoy great video games made with care and attention by their dedicated developers. \nThumbs up, all the way!", "timestamp_created": 1402115727, "timestamp_updated": 1402115727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888556", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10375978": {"recommendationid": "10375978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001460904", "num_games_owned": 889, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3211, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492567917}, "language": "english", "review": "The single best shmup on Steam.

Few non-Japanese gamers were destined to ever try it...until now, that is, since that version has beaten the odds and made it Westward as \"World Ignition.\"\n\nIn case you needed to hear it, your goal here is to blow up lots of stuff, collect lots of shiny stars, and not die: you've got a handful of aircraft to choose from, each of which is armed with both a standard shot (which is always at \"full\" power, so dying won't hamstring you) and an unlimited-use \"lock-on\" weapon, which covers a large chunk of the screen and can zap lots of enemies at once, but deploying it slows your movement, so take care not to unleash it if you need to boogie. As you wreak havoc you'll fill up an energy meter, visible in the upper right: once it's got a bit of juice you gain access to a smart bomb, which will damage everything onscreen and give you a moment of invincibility to catch your breath: you can only stock one at a time, but refilling the meter enough for another one doesn't take too long, so definitely use it when you need it.\n\nIf you let the meter continue to fill all the way up, however, hitting the bomb button will instead activate \"break mode,\" which is where things get interesting: while this state lasts, your firepower is boosted, and so are the points gained from blasting baddies (and if you can get the meter all the way up again before the \"break\" runs out, you can enter a \"double break,\" which juices things up even more). While surviving is just a matter of moving, shooting and bombing at the right  times, racking up high scores involves constantly juggling your shot, lock-on, and energy meter to get the most points possible out of every target - enemies send loads of attacks your way, but only the small, shining \"hit area\" at the very center of your ship can take damage, so if you can weave that tiny bit of yourself through the dangerous bits you'll make it out the other side in one piece.\n\nWhile the basic idea of the game never changes, there are several modes here that put a different spin on things: aside from the standard \"Normal\" mode, there's \"Boost\" mode (\"breaks\" are activated automatically and don't run out until you bomb or lose a life, but enemies get tougher the longer you can keep it going), \"Unliimited\" mode (an extra-tough challenge for veteran shmuppers), and \"Time Attack\" mode (a fixed course where you have infinite lives but only three minutes to rack up as many points as you can). Normal and Boost also have \"Novice\" variations, which are easier than the standard ones and well-suited for those looking to get their feet wet and build some confidence before moving up; you can also practice individual stages to shore up spots that are giving you trouble.\n\nThough certain sections of the game will smack you down hard and suddenly enough to make you wince, don't let that dissuade you from giving it a shot: if you can manage to get through the front door without feeling intimidated by the screenshots full of unfriendly fire, you'll find one of the most polished PC shooters in existence waiting for you: moreover, it's a bit of a miracle that the gaming gods have even seen fit to bring such a little-known gem to our shores in any form, at a steal of a price to boot, and they deserve recognition for making it happen. If you still hold any love, or even curiosity, for the simple, deep, hard-edged and irrepressibly pure arcade titles of old, by all means look this one up: releases of its caliber are all too rare these days.", "timestamp_created": 1402106583, "timestamp_updated": 1402106787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584047", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10375097": {"recommendationid": "10375097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062135979", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412909301}, "language": "english", "review": "In this review, I will cover how this port compares to the original doujin version.\n\nCrimzon Clover was originally released as a Comiket doujinsoft CD in 2010. Brilliant of a game as it was, the act of actually playing it presented nothing but headaches for non-Japanese players. As a western PC gamer, playing CC required either changing your Windows region (provided you could get a hold of the physical game), or downloading a pirated version. And after that, the game wasn't 100% controller-friendly. I remember having to use JoyToKey to get the joystick of my Fighting Stick 3 to function. Nothing too horrible, but the UI of the initial release just wasn't polished enough.\n\nNow we have World Ignition, which is nothing short of a blessing due to the simple fact that it makes CC so easy and painless for newcomers to dig into. No need to hunt down the physical disc or feel any of that pirating guilt! Here's a breakdown of the improvements of this port:\n\n-TATE (vertical screen) mode, which was not available in the doujin version. Nice.\n-Training mode now gives access to every stage and boss out of the box, no unlocking required. In the doujin version, you had to unlock each stage (and their respective difficulties) to practice with using the medals you accumulated through each playthrough.\n-A new soundtrack has been added. I prefer the original one, but thankfully you can decide in the menu which one you want to hear.\n-UI presentation is simply much more pleasing to view and navigate.\n-Many, many languages have been added, which is interesting for a game that requires no reading skills whatsoever to properly enjoy. But hey, they're there!\n-Online leaderboards, which the doujin version didn't have for some reason.\n-Surprisingly, there's a name entry screen (which is odd considering that they could've just used your Steam name), but sadly in this version, there's no tanks in the background to shoot with the cursor. :(\n-Gameplay is pretty much the same and unchanged.\n\nThere's quite a few shmups on Steam, some are excellent, while many are meh or just plain garbage. CCWI is one of the excellent ones.

[b][i]WORLD IGNITION[/i][/b], a port of the later arcade release on NESICA coin-ops (again, only in Japan) takes that insanity and cranks it up to twelve - no, [i]twenty[/i].\n\nNow, you don't need me to tell you how to play a top-down shmup, it's like sucking eggs, everyone already knows how it's done. What's different about CC is the Lock-On weapon radar, which locks on to any enemies within its radius and showers them with homing lasers/rockets/sniper bullets of Death (depending on the ship you're using) and the Break System, which amounts to filling a bar at the top of the screen by shooting down enemies. When it's full you can press a button to instantly power up all your ship's weapons for a few seconds, and the display of wanton laser-green devastation is nothing but impressive. But wait - fill the bar again while in Break Mode, and you can press the button again for (wait for it) Double Break Mode, which is like holding a lit match to Magnesium - the brightest lightshow seen in shmup history. It's also good for your score multiplier, too, which helps.\n\nIt's a pity that the original game's Shop mechanic never made it back in - it was one of the most original things about the game, and made it a meaty single-player experience, but this seems to be a faithful port of the arcade release, which obviously didn't have the shop, so I can see why it wasn't included.

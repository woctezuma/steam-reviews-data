Honestly, it probably heavily contributed to my interest in visual novels.

It can cause the reader to feel empathy toward both characters, as some scenes are quite emotional.\nThere is also implications of the female character being queer, as she talks about another woman in an affectionate, loving way. \n\nI definitely recommend this visual novel to those who enjoy the genre.

With no way for the fiend to leave the magic circle, the fiend made an offer for the boy to stay with her for the day and to exchange stories with each other in return for roasting the boy's collected chestnuts. Feeling fascinated rather than afraid of the fiend, the boy decided to stay with the fiend and as the day draws to a close, the boy gradually develops a friendship with the fiend.\n\nAfter spending an hour to read through and listen to the accompanying background music in this visual novel, I decided to give the game a score of 8/10 based on the following factors:\n \nPlot and character backgrounds: The plot is written as a fantasy dramedy and has a nice happy ending. As a short kinetic visual novel, there are a few plot holes that are not explained in the visual novel such as how or why the fiend ended up being imprisoned inside the magic circle and what happened to the former inhabitants of the ruined building. The names for both the boy and the fiend in this visual novel are also not mentioned.\n \nAmong the positive aspects, the storyline pace in which the boy and the fiend develop their friendship with each other leading to the happy ending are appropriate with adequate coverage on the backgrounds of both characters together with multiple different emotional moments in the story ranging from curiosity, annoyance, anger, despair, hope and joy.\n\nArtwork, backgrounds and CGs: The character sprites, backgrounds and CGs are nice. The DLC also has an equally nice and attractive Thank You CG artwork featuring the fiend for supporting the developer.\n\nBackground music: The game has nice BGM which match the various different moments in the game that is also included as free MP3 and FLAC files with the game. My favourite BGM are Politely Honest when the boy is seeing the fiend for the first time, Bleeding in the promo video and middle part of the visual novel and Stella during the happy ending moment in the game.\n\nRecommended for those who like a short fantasy visual novel with a nice happy ending as a free to play game with optional DLC.\n\n[h1]Review with accompanying screenshots and BGM[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/single-post/2018/01/11/Junipers-Knot-Review\n\n[h1]Game info page on Sinical Anime Network[/h1]\n\nhttps://www.sinicalanimenetwork.com/forum/visual-novel-jrpg-anime/juniper-s-knot\n\n[h1]Visual novel, JRPG, Anime Steam group[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/vnislife", "timestamp_created": 1512922144, "timestamp_updated": 1515739911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830871", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38192954": {"recommendationid": "38192954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081536533", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512855952}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Visual Novel, with simple, but lovely illustrations.\nThe VN is a bit short (It'll take you an hour or so to finish it), but the story is fantastic.\nIf you love Visual Novels, and have an hour or so to kill, play this game.

Given that this was free and also rather short, I decided to see what their first venture into VNs were like. Much like Dysfunctional Systems, the story is written with a rather intricate hand, and the art is superb and complements the tone of the VN. Despite being short, they managed to pack a bunch into this story without compromising execution and pacing, something that I really appreciate.\n\nThe story is centered on a female fiend and a human boy who happens to chance upon her after he got lost. They are never given a name (I will refer to them as Fiend and Boy, respectively) but their personalities are developed quickly and concisely. Immediately, based off of their dialogue style, you can tell when Fiend is speaking or when Boy is speaking, and you can also tell their ages as well as their personalities without much effort. There is even some world building, which is incorporated into the VN as the characters telling stories about their lives. This all leads into a tightly written story that, while linear, gives a strong sense of depth despite the shortened length of the VN.\n\nArt and music help to enhance scenes further, especially with art that both accentuates aspects of a character as well as subtly indicates a trait. Music is never boring to listen to, and its quite pleasing to loop. Dischan has a good grasp on sound design as well, as music will fade away into other sound effects to help immerse the reader into the world, such as the crackling of fire. I also want to emphasize the UI in the game, as Dischan has some of the more stylish and interesting menu screens that I've seen in VNs.\n\nIf you want to see what Dischan is capable of producing and don't want to place money down for Dysfunctional Systems, I recommend playing this first. Not only does it offer one of the better stories from the free VNs on Steam, but it does it in a package that is highly polished with great art and music.", "timestamp_created": 1512639574, "timestamp_updated": 1512639574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37978104": {"recommendationid": "37978104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202911714", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512139127}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430 \u0441 \u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0439.", "timestamp_created": 1512139786, "timestamp_updated": 1512139786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37946863": {"recommendationid": "37946863", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987696775", "num_games_owned": 3265, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512025987}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a cute short story.

Where many Visual Novels as of late rely heavily on archetypal \"moe\" characterization, in tandem with, admittedly, impressive \"cutesy\" artstyle, this sort of story this game depicts is something that is much more than most of the Visual Novels of recent release here in Steam. This was a sort of passion project by the once defunct Dischan (they were dispersed some time ago, but had since convalesced and are now active once more only recently). The artwork, music, sound direction, and the general literary acumen, is simply gorgeous--and their quality is even more accentuated by the fact that this project was made in the span of just under a MONTH. \n\nThe premise of the story revolves around two individuals--and the duality between them will be that for the entirety of the story. Yes; there exist only two characters, with several other characters only merely being mentioned in utterance, and not actually shown--but disregard that, the two main characters is the fulcrum of the story. Their personalities, interactions, and histories, is--quite literally--the entirety of the story. Yet, this visual novel delivers it in such magnificent execution that it simply fazed me in awe the first time reading it. The dearth of characters is readily compensated by how much detail went into these two characters. \n\nThe ambience is quite bleak, being set in a desolate place, where a vestige of what once stood a town now lies a menagerie of ruins and moorish land, where much of the flora and trees have since withered; scraps and swaths of stone and dirt laminate the cold, unearthed pavement. The narration delves deep into detail about the surroundings, and it is also clearly illustrated in the artwork. You immediately feel this sort of wistful, melancholy at the ambience--the sort of feeling of one of the main characters know all too well. The destitution of the land is palpable. \n\nNow, it is actually the execution of the narration what sold me on this story. We enter the story in First Person--as in, we see the thoughts of the Main Character, and we are intimately greeted by the emotions they feel at any given time. Now, in the story, it actually switches between perspectives--from the Fiend, to the Boy, and back to the Fiend once more. Ahem; apologies from not denoting this earlier, but the Fiend and the Boy are the story's sole characters. \n\nThe story itself is wonderfully crafted. It explores themes of racial disparity, of trust and hope, and of sullen and haunting past lives. The story, and I say this utmostly confident, executes each theme and blends them seamlessly with one another.\n\nA truly good read, and it doesn't take much time too. I implore you to at least give the novel a few minutes of your time. This is simply too good of a free, indie novel to pass off as just another piece of fodder in Steam's endless catalogue of Visual Novels.", "timestamp_created": 1508584484, "timestamp_updated": 1508584484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35799008": {"recommendationid": "35799008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099314190", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508248240}, "language": "english", "review": "A great, light-hearted visual novel, nice art, music and all.

And it costs nothing. [b]Juniper's Knot is a treasure worth every time you have.[/b]\n\n[h1]The Story[/h1]\nUsually it is harder to actually grade a short visual novel as I can not know for certain if the story is good because it is short or the story is good because it is actually good. For Juniper's Knot, I think it is the latter. It tells the story of only two characters, changing perspective between each other, and it paints the relationship and their respective personalities directly to the mind of the reader. It is written so that you can sympathize with both characters even considering how contrast their characteristics are. It is easy to tell that they planned the story really well.\n\n[h1]The Musics[/h1]\nI actually got goose bumps in a good percentage of my run of the game. They managed to put little details as sound effects and every BGM fit perfectly to the scene and they are beautiful. The sound of the waves and fire crackling are especialy good. I did not notice any BGM being overly used. Maybe because it is short, but it is a good thing nevertheless.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nAs I said above, Juniper's Knot is a treasure. Not because it is a free game but because it got the quality other Visual Novels seems to lack, especially indie ones. It is very short and can be played through in under five minutes if you want to. I am very interested in the back story of both the characters and chances are I will buy it if they were ever to release it. All in all, there are really nothing bad to say about the game as the developer team really did a good job here.\n\nI notice that there are blank entries to the arts in the extra menu after I finished the game. It might be a clue that the developer is going to update or release a continuation/backstory to Juniper's Knot.", "timestamp_created": 1507467404, "timestamp_updated": 1507493148, "voted_up": true,

The art is pleasant. I like how it isn't a stiff art style like many VN games tend to use. For me, it made movement from the models look a bit more fluid.\n\nThe pacing was swell enough that it kept me reading. It was nice to see both characters get some time to be in the spotlight and see their perspectives as they tell each other stories and information about themselves. The solution to the issue at heart of the tale was clever, and very symbolic.\n\nMy only complaint is for something so short you'd expect the writing to be on point. It sometimes dragged on in points that were not that important to the overall plot.\n\nDefinitely recommend, especially if you got the time and are in the right mood for a light read.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1506400027, "timestamp_updated": 1506400027, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35083107": {"recommendationid": "35083107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063301812", "num_games_owned": 4257, "num_reviews": 173, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505909498}, "language": "english", "review": "23 positive reviews and 0 negative reviews as of this sentence.\n\nThis is wrong on so many levels.  The story and the length, that is.  \n\nBecause the artwork is darkly pretty and the music is annoyingly nice.  \n\nBut the length of the kinetic novel is not 30 minutes.  I had the auto-speed at the midpoint setting and ran the novel on auto from the start, it took a bit over two hours.  This is a decent auto speed where at least half you people could probably keep up.  Full auto-speed, or to read this novel in 30 minutes, is for the gung-ho speed-reader of novels on monitor display.  This is rare.  I dare you to read this novel at full autospeed and keep up the entire time.   \n\nAs for the story:  its devilish, and subtle in its devilishness, at times.  To illustrate it would mean to spoil it.  So I'm going to silhouette this.  It\u2019s true, its about a demon and a boy.  The perspective bounces between both, but most of it, about 80% of the story is from the perspective of the demon.  Check her out; isn't she sexy?   Cute boy:  what age is he, twelve?  Keep the age in mind.  The demon does what a demon does: attempts to place the boy in a spiritual bondage.  The boy is apparently knowledgeable enough to know she is a demon, that demons attempt to ensnare humans every time, and that this demon will attempt to make a pact with him and, last but not least, the boy knows never to have any dealings with a demon!  But, unfortunately, the boy is not wise enough to put all that good knowledge into good practice!!  So, what does he actually do?  I'll put it this way... only a devil could write this particular story to its sad conclusion.  But, hey, let's all overlook this Satanic conclusion, and overlook the lack of 18+ age limit needed for this bad, bad story depicting a young boy (which gives the impression that this is the targeted age group: pre-teen to early adolescence), and simply write positive reviews to give the impression this story is a good story for young adults.\n\nIt\u2019s not. \n\nIn reality, you never converse with a demon.  Ever.  Why?  Because\u2026\n\n(Genesis 3:1) \u2026.the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.\n\nThe key word is [b]subtle[/b].  The demon will talk circles around you.   Just as this novel depicted very nicely, they are deceptive and clever enough to talk someone into making a pact with them, even though the person knew the danger.\n\nUnfortunately, the story never touches upon how to actually deal with a demon, proper.  You don't talk with them.  And if you ever do, do what Archangel Michael did.  Or what Jesus did.  Or what Paul did:\n\n(Jude 1:9)  Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, [b]The Lord rebuke thee.[/b]\n\n\n(Mark 1)\n\n23 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,\n\n24 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.\n\n25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, [b]Hold thy peace, and come out of him.[/b]\n\n26 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.\n\n\n(Acts 16)\n\n16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:\n\n17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.\n\n18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, [b]I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.[/b] And he came out the same hour.\n\n\n\nThe end.  The way it should have ended.  Short and sweet, less than five minutes!\n\n=)", "timestamp_created": 1505911255, "timestamp_updated": 1505911811, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.182236", "comment_count": "31", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35018836": {"recommendationid": "35018836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137081930", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505640398}, "language": "english", "review": "So I actually haven't played a lot of kinetic novels, but they're interesting.

However, a boy, who has been lost on travels, comes across the place and encounters the fiend. Without much else to do, he settles in for a little while and they exchange stories and learn about each other.\n\nThis game is a kinetic novel, a type of visual novel with no branching storylines nor any choices. It can be played through as fast as the player can read it. I would estimate that a complete play-through should take no more than an hour.\n\nThe game itself was originally released in 2012, but only made its way to Steam in August 2017. Considering the short length of the game, I generally found it to be a nice, little gem.\n\nTo start off, the art in the game is very good. There is not much of it because the game is so short, but what is in the game is quite professional looking. The music is also a very nice addition.\n\nThe main purpose of any visual novel is the story and writing. The game features a minimalist cast, only two characters. However, I found that the two characters are well-written and both get a decent amount of development in the short span of the game. The same praises can go for the writing in general. While it does not have the deepest plot, I thought it was a satisfying experience.\n\nIn conclusion, this short kinetic novel is not a bad way to spend about an hour.

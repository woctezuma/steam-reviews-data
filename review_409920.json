Her future, and eventually even her safety, are no longer guaranteed. Who, or what, is she bonded to? What does it mean for her and those around her?\n\nThe Good:\n* First things first. This game is absolutely gorgeous. It has some of the best art of any visual novel I've played, done in a unique and consistent style that really meshes with the story.\n* The worldbuilding happens naturally, over the course of the story, and is very solid.\n* Ash's story is easy to get invested in, and it's impossible not to care about her.\n* The soundtrack and sound effects are great, and pulled me in even more.\n* The game is fully voice-acted, and the casting was very well done. I loved Ash's voice.\n* The game gives feedback on choices that makes it easy to tell which ending you're moving toward.\n* The game has some good representation. For example, Ash is gay, and it's important to the story without being the primary source of conflict.\n* The game rewards multiple playthroughs by having things that are only meaningful with information from late in the game.\n\nThe Not-So-Good:\n* While some choices have far-reaching consequences, others only change a few lines of dialogue and are quickly forgotten as the story gets back to its mostly-linear path.\n* The good ending and the neutral ending are a little too similar.\n* There is no CG gallery, which is a shame because of how beautiful the CGs are.\n* There's a little bit at the end of the game that helps set up the series but feels very out-of-place in the story of this game.\n* The worldbuilding can occasionally be a little fuzzy, especially the paladin/necromancer binary when confronted with later information.\n\nI really loved this game. It wasn't without its issues, but they don't mean much next to all of the things the game did right. I really resonated with Ash, and I'm looking forward to getting more of her story in the sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1511858343, "timestamp_updated": 1511858343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36985582": {"recommendationid": "36985582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278245910", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506947829}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c31\u4e2a\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u5c0f\u8bf4\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u62ab\u7740\u897f\u65b9\u7384\u5e7b\u5916\u8863\u7684\u4e3b\u89d2\u4ee5\u53ca\u8eab\u8fb9\u5c0f\u4f19\u4f34\u63a2\u7d22\u771f\u7231\u548c\u6027\u5411\u7684\u9752\u6625\u5c0f\u8bf4\uff0c\u548c\u9884\u60f3\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u5927\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u2026\u6bd5\u7adf\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u6545\u4e8b\u4e00\u822c\u4f1a\u7528\u6765\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e3b\u8981\u4eba\u7269\uff0c\u5c31\u514d\u4e0d\u4e86\u8981\u6709\u4eba\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u611f\u60c5\u7ea0\u7eb7\u3010\u4e0d\u3002\n\u8001\u5b9e\u8bf4\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4e2d\u95f4\u7a7f\u63d2\u5f88\u591a\u8868\u73b0\u767e\u5408\u4e3b\u89d2\u5b64\u72ec\u5bc2\u5bde\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u4e3b\u7ebf\u8fd8\u662f\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e00\u76f4\u6709\u94fa\u60ac\u7591\u70b9\uff0c\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u6027\u683c\u4e5f\u5f88\u9c9c\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u611f\u60c5\u7ebf\u63cf\u5199\u7684\u6211\u6700\u540e\u8fd8\u662f\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u4f46\u662f\u5c31\u662f\u79bb\u597d\u6545\u4e8b\u5dee\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u3002\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5bf9\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6bd4\u8f83\u6cdb\u5584\u53ef\u9648\u3002\u4eba\u7269\u611f\u60c5\u4e5f\u4e0d\u591f\u7ec6\u817b\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u6d6e\u4e8e\u8868\u9762 [spoiler]\u5c24\u5176\u662fPrudence\uff01\uff01\u81ea\u5df1\u6700\u597d\u7684\u57fa\u53cb\u539f\u6765\u771f\u7684\u662f\u59ec\u53cb\u8fd8\u559c\u6b22\u81ea\u5df1\uff01\uff01\uff01\u96be\u9053\u4e00\u822c\u4eba\u4e0d\u4f1a\u88ab\u9707\u60ca\u597d\u4e45\u4e0d\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u5417\uff01\uff01\u5e26\u7740\u6127\u759a\u9762\u5bf9\u59ec\u53cb\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u5c34\u5c2c\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\uff01\uff01\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e00\u4e0b\u5b50\u5c31\u6062\u590d\u4e86\uff01\uff01\u6211\u660e\u767d\u8fd9\u662f\u4e1c\u897f\u65b9\u6587\u5316\u7684\u5dee\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd8\u662f\u89c9\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u53ef\u60dc\u7684\u2026\u767d\u767d\u653e\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6df1\u6316\u7684\u8650\u70b9\u3002[/spoiler] \n\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bb2\uff0c\u65e0\u529f\u65e0\u8fc7\u7684\u6545\u4e8b+\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u914d\u97f3+\u7279\u70b9\u5341\u8db3\u3010\u867d\u7136\u4f1a\u65f6\u4e0d\u65f6\u5d29\u574f\u3011\u7684\u7f8e\u672f\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5bf9\u5f97\u8d77\u5b83\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u3002\nps. \u9760\u8fd1\u7ed3\u5c40\u90e8\u5206\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8725\u8734\u8ba9\u6211\u773c\u524d\u4e00\u4eae\u2026\u2026\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4e86\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u8725\u8734\u548c\u5df2\u7ecf\u57cb\u4e0b\u4f0f\u7b14\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u89c2\u611f\u53d7\u4e00\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1511427011, "timestamp_updated": 1511427011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36764593": {"recommendationid": "36764593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067613082", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506813861}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein kleines und unerwartet feines Spiel.

This was actually one of the first VNs where I cared more about what would happen next then what ending I wanted to get, which I was not expecting at all.\n\nI feel it's probably good to get all the cons out of the way first, because there aren't too many, and they are balanced out well.\nFirst off, the voice acting and diologue sometimes seem a little bit amateurish. It doesn't come up too often, but occasionally you get the idea that these people have not done this before, and aren't too settled in it.\nSecondly, there are some times when you really start to feel the exposition heavily. This is mostly when characters are talking about how sexuality is viewed in the world, and they are speaking more towards the reader than what someone would naturally say in the situation.\nAnd finally, there are one or two choices where it's not entirely clear what you are selecting. Nothing too drastic, or that would get you a suprise bad ending, but I did get surprised at what happened from a few choices.\n\nThose issues, however, are pretty few and far between. And never so drastic to break the narrative, which is really uite good.\nThe plot is first class. Period. This is a well realized world, with a lot of things left unexplained that make it feel more alive. You can tell a lot of thought went in to all of it, and it pays off. The story going on in this world, too, has a couple of good twists, but also the meat to keep you going between them. The twists are also payed off quickly enough that you don't feel like anyone is particularly stupid. And, despite being the first part, it has a fairly satisfying ending, without any cliffhangers stapled on to the end. \nThe characters are also quite good, and all the mains seem to have greater depth than I normally expect from this type of game. They also deal with some issues that are rarely addressed by any game, which I won't spoil, but really struck me as things that real people deal with more often than is represented.\nThe art is great. Pretty much perfect. Each character has many expressions that fit whatever is going on at the time and nothing is reapeated enough to seem lazy or anything. It also just looks gorgeous. \nAnd finally, the voice acting. Yes, I mentioned there are some less than great moments, but when it is good, it is really really good. The voice actors definately care about their characters and care about doing well, which is missing from some games with much bigger budgets. Nobody is bored and nobody is phoning it in, and everybody gives the emotional stakes they need to. Also, The mains have very nice voices to hear. \n\nAll in all, a great VN, not exactly the Dating sim I had expected, but it fulfilled that need and so much more. \n\nAlso, blooper reel at the end, very good!", "timestamp_created": 1485065852, "timestamp_updated": 1500709676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505114", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29402912": {"recommendationid": "29402912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042228090", "num_games_owned": 831, "num_reviews": 191, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467385554}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant Shadows is a fantastic VN with an intriguing plot, a superb cast of characters, great art, and solid voice acting.

I do recommend it, but be warned--it ends suddenly.  The game world has two interlocking systems of magic.  Paladins develop a rosy glow, and their partners, the necromancers, have a pasty look.  (This does interesting things to the wide variety of skin colors on display.)  The main character is a necromancer who expects to be partnered with her lifelong friend and crush, now a paladin, in a graduation ceremony.  But she instead is partnered to a mysterious unknown who may or may not be horribly evil.  The friends, and Prudence the Paladin's new partner, try to discover the truth about Ash's partner, despite opposition from all corners.  You have the option to play as a good version of Ash, the main character, or to turn her evil.  There are also various smaller choices.  Unfortunately, the game does cut off rather quickly, with a lot of last-minute mythology being rapidly introduced.  It does have a complete arc, but it felt as though the game just...stopped.  There is a sequal coming out soon, though.\n\nThe art is good, although I'm usually not a fan of the \"what happened to my nose-bridge?\" style.  Here, though, the pudgier characters are missing their nose-bridges, and the more thin, angular characters have sharper lines, so I'll give it a pass.  The writing is better than average, though not spectacular.  The worldbuilding is interesting, and the magic systems are carefully internally consistent (good, because the plot relies on them), but I did wish for a little more concrete detail.  (The world is that standard fantasy world we all know with only some specified variations.)  Mechanics are par for visual novels.  Some of the voice acting is too high-pitched for my taste, but that is deliberate, and it is well-done.\n\nOverall, I would say give it a try unless you can't stand cliffhangers, in which case I would wait until the next part is released (currently set for April 2017; currently called Pale Spectrum, according to the Kickstarter page).\n\nNote:  I received a key through the Kickstarter backer campaign.

I completed the good path, don't care for the neutral, and my friend completed the evil path because she's a toot and I can tell you a LOT about this visual novel.\n\nFirst off, it's more like a book, less like a visual novel as visual novels tend to have 3-6 endings deciding whats your waifu, this is not one of those visual novels.  In fact, if you hate visual novels but love books, pick this up.  It's basically a book because the writing is REALLY well done.\n\nI'm going to stop rambling and make more readable explanation off the bat.  I hate, HATE visual novels.  They are disgusting anime waifu trash that pits a male protagonist in a room with ten half-naked cutsie girls of various personalities and animal ears... or tanks... or ships.  Whatever floats their boat I guess.  However, this is not one of those stories. Your character first off, is a woman, and though she has a heavy romantic interest with a character, it is just one specific character and not the waifu tray to choose from.\n\nIn fact, that's what makes this story so great.  The romance COMPLIMENTS the story, where as most visual novels, the story compliments the romance... or is just kinda shoveled on... looking at you Bird simulator dating... crap.\n\nSee, it sparks a tension in the pages you read through.  Deliciously juicy drama but no clear indication of 'will you get the girl or not', in fact, there is this dreadening atmosphere as you FEEL the character's hopes and dreams scatter multiple times but she picks herself up time and time again.  It's a really good heartening experience.\n\nNow let me explain the characters role.\nMain character: An interesting and dynamic character.  She FEELS so real, and her attitude can change from spiteful and depressed to straight up malicious depending on your choices.  I have felt her concerns myself in the dating gig so I know how it is.\nLove interest:  A character where drama revolves around but she isn't the driving force behind the plot (not directly anyways).  She brings the main character's tension along and is a point of interest, but isn't a mary sue princess that needs saving.\nThe 'will he betray us' guy:  Okay, sometimes you see a 'plot twist' coming from a mile away.  Sometimes you think 'no it's building up to reveal he was the good guy all along.  It isn't obvious in this one, it just isn't.  Sometimes I'm like OH YEAH HES SO GOOD, and other times I'm like HOLY SHIT STAB HIM HES SO EVIL!  But I didn't know, I never did until the end segment. I'm not going to spoil whether he is a good guy a bad guy.\nThe tag along characters: Well, these two people are basically extra spicing to flesh things out.  They fufill their role... they flesh things out, they add more dynamics but they are indeed, tag along.  Don't expect too much from them as they are a basic package.  NOthing too interesting but they add more perspective.  All in all well done characters if, a bit dissapointing.\n\nI'd describe more characters but I feel that it may be too spoilery so let's just say this.  Some characters will be completely meaningless and useless, while others will actually have a lot more involved with the plot than you would first think.  So just play it safe and pay attention to all characters :3\n\nNow, the story itself.  The plot is very interesting.  Once more, I won't describe in detail what it is but I will say the beginning is WAY Too slow and the ending is WAY too abrupt.  That's my only complaint, your first hour will be spent reading the beginning while the next will be speeding by the middle and the end as the plot snowballs down.  The story and even the world itself however, is very facinating and this DOES excuse the speed and pacing.  The beginning had to EXPLAIN the world, show you how it is.  And it doesn't do it in a stupid ass naruto way, no... it expects the reader to be actually intelligent and piece things together with solid information.  So that perhaps may be why the beginning is so slow and the ending feel so sudden and fast paced.\n\nTL;DR?\n\nStory 8/10\nPacing 7/10\nRomance 9/10\nCharacters 10/10\nWorld 10/10\n\nIGN 7.8/10.

It's very well done and really helps the characters come alive. The art is great, sort of Burtonesque instead of the typical anime style, and even the most minor side characters have unique sprites. The UI is a little awkward (I consistently had trouble finding the hotspot for save slots), but the text is large and easily readable.\n\nThe story feels very much like an introduction to a series. Most of the plot is focused on developing a small part of the setting, and then an epilogue abruptly shows a window into a larger world. It's also very linear; choices can give you evil points (too many and you get the bad end) and sometimes branch off into an extra scene, but the overall plot stays on the same path, and the good/neutral endings are very similar in both content and tone. Linearity isn't necessarily a weakness, especially since it leaves a clear starting point for the sequel, but saying there's three endings is kind of misleading.\n\nThat's a minor complaint, though.

There were several smaller mentions of things that I would love to see explored in other ways, even as small as a short story or something of that nature.\n\nThe main character goes through a few points where it is difficult to like her, however, during these points her actions and mannerisms really sell what she is going through and seemed like very human responses. Being honest I think I only felt that way due to her being upset with a character I found very charming!\n\nThe relationships felt real and there were a few times I expected the story to focus on some of the negative emotions of a character for longer than needed and I was pleasantly surprised that the development felt organic.\n\nThe ending leaves alot of questions, but its very clear (the title..I mean..) that this is but one part and that we can expect to see more. It doesn't leave on a cliffhanger so much as a hope for the future of the characters.\n\nIf you like visual novels, I gotta say to give this one a try, worth your time and money.

It builds an interesting world with a lot of potential and I hope that for future parts we get the opportunity to explore it more.

However sometimes I would've liked to have more options, [spoiler] like when we had the choice to kiss or slap Hector I would have preferred one where we just talk or do nothing. [/spoiler] I also feel like the finale had a lot of missed opportunities for possible choices. But maybe I'm just too used to Telltale Game's sort of choice-system.\n\nI also had some trouble with the story from time to time. While I love that it tries to be progressive, it sometimes feels forced and takes away from the main plot because of that. It has trouble finding a balance between world-buliding and character-/romance-building. While it doesn't give a lot of exposition on the first, it just drops a lot of it on the latter. That bugging me  can of course only be my personal preference.\n\nAll in all I would definetly recommend Brilliant Shadow to anyone looking for an intiriguing Visual Novel set in a refreshing fantasy world.

In fact, I'd probably not pay attention to this game were it not for a YT vid showcasing it in my feed. But it instantly caught my attention with really polished production values for that kind of game- the artwork is detailed, pleasant to eye with good mix of earthy and vibrant tones and manages to vary enough to make it look like it's not all taking place in one white hallroom. The character artwork is animate and expressive (again, within the limitations of the medium- the horseriding sequence really could've used a separate character model) and the style fits the setting of the story.\n\nThe other thing I have noticed is the voice acting. That is, to my knowledge, a rarity in VN's, and most characters seem to be cast well. A few minor issues with delivery here and there, but nothing glaring. My one real issue would be sound volume- I assume the reason is that the VA's were recording in different studios, but some of the lines sound clear and crisp, while some sound muted or muffled. Still..it's fully acted and the three main characters are very easy on the ear (Hector's performance in delivering the deadpan lines was perfect).\n\nMusic is very good, and I'd gladly use it as a background for pen and paper RPG session. \n\nNow, as to the story itself, it's decent. The writing isn't Hugo-winning, but it got me invested into what seemed at first to be a simple  coming of age story. The characters are all easy to like, the plot flows fairly fast and without major stuttering, and it even manages to build good suspense, and there wasn't a single moment where I cringed...a feat that not all mainstream dev studios manage. The writers were well aware of the trappings of the genre, and delivered a solid story (not without some plotholes) within it. Solid enough that I definetely want the next chapter.\nI would also love for the world to be more populated. The Mountain seems to be existing in a desolate void. We know there's the kingdom, and in the last few minutes of the story we get rushed attempt as establishing the world, but still, a rough sketch of the world as known by the characters would be great.\n\nOne minor thing that was slightly grating: Dear writer,we get it. People of all genders, sexes and walks of life have the right to love and should not be prejudiced against. Pretty sure no one who disagrees with that notion will be playing this game, so...spare us the heavy-handed \"only a primitive would\" lines next time, it's preaching to the choir.\n\nDespite minor flaws, I'd still recommend the game if you want to read something nice, romance-themed and in fantasy setting. The visuals and soundwork are high quality, and the story solid if not breaking any new grounds. I'd liken the experience to Old Kingdom trilogy in terms of tone, or one of Gaiman's earlier novels, like the Stardust.\n\nDo not play if girls kissing girls and not kissing you make you upset.", "timestamp_created": 1448219634, "timestamp_updated": 1448219858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19186451": {"recommendationid": "19186451", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994057162", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448238964}, "language": "english", "review": "A very entertaining and beautifully-illustrated story.

At the beginning the protagonist and her true love's relationship is set up very nicely, they're best friends since childhood and now that they're adults they're set to complete their magical bonding ritual which will be the beginning of their lives together.  It's great stuff, you're definitely invested in their relationship.  But something goes wrong, leaving your main character bonded to an alien (who you don't even really meet until near the end of the game) and your true love bonded to a super annoying dude.  Of course that's all OK, since, you would assume, True Love will overcome even the power of magic, and it'll lead to a great and happy ending, or so you would expect.  The problem is, at least in this game, True Love doesn't overcome the bonds of magic, you'll spend the entire game trying to overcome it, but you'll fail at every turn, all your choices essentially lead to the same depressing result.   Eventually your character is simply alone and miserable, and as a conclusion to this terrible story, the only two other lesbian characters in the game are revealed to be bad guys, and your character has to kill them.  But wait, after everything's been terrible and depressing the entire game, at the very end you meet the alien you're bonded to, and, since your character is going to be extremely attracted to it no matter what it looks like because of the power of the magic of the pairing ritual, it's a good thing that it at least appears to be female.  The end.  Of course, the Title suggests that it is 'Part One' so perhaps in the next game your character will be able to finally break the bonds of the 'pairing ritual', get away from the alien and get your true love away from the super annoying dude, and finally live Happily Ever After, but there's no happily ever anything in this Part One, so I'd suggest waiting to see if things get better in the next one before playing this one.", "timestamp_created": 1448074762, "timestamp_updated": 1448074762, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.239384", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19183955": {"recommendationid": "19183955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042405542", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448062081}, "language": "english", "review": "It is an amazing game, I love the art and choices, the world and story is an amazing fantasy world, that I want to explore more with the possibility's the end presents, while also feeling satisfied with the endings at the same time, which is a task many games fail to accomplish. as with everything however, there is a downside, I felt as if the sudo animations where odd, the visual of a horse head moving up and down while the characters are moving out of sync with it, the characters are just in there usual pose making it strange when its obvious they aren't actually riding the horse, all while the background is also moving at an odd pace in the wrong direction, this does take away from the game, I still love it, but it is a complaint.

[spoiler] I'm pretty sure he is suppose to be autistic and while I do think it is realistic that characters will be annoyed by him at times. It's a bit jarring to see people hit him and even describe him by using abelist slurs. [/spoiler]\n\nI'm also disappointed with writing at times. There are moments where there should dramatic tension yet seems to be brushed off or ignored. [spoiler] Two examples, I can think of this is when Prude finds out Hektor is a Gray Mage and is clearly upset about it, to the point of being brought to tears. Yet almost immediately in the next scene we see Prude seeming completely okay by it. Yes, time may have past but the audience still need to see how Prude came to terms with her lover being what she considers a monster. Also, the scene where Ash finds a dead gray mage in her room and the characters seem to talk about it as if they are discussing the weather??? The game tries to explain it away by saying 'they're use to it because it's been happening to them a long time' but this only has been happening to them for a few weeks at most. [/spoiler] \n\nAlso the ending felt rushed. I also think that certain revelation in the end could have been saved for the next part of the game.  [spoiler] Ash suddenly being in love with Terra, even with the whole 'pairs' concept, seems unrealistic to me.[/spoiler] That's something that could have possibly been developed better in the next part of the game\n\nHowever, despite my complaints the game does have an exciting plot that makes me interested in the next part of the game. And the characters are all interesting and unique which makes you truly care what happens to all of them, even the villians.\n\nSo, yeah. I think Brilliant Shadows is a cool game that needs just a bit more work with it's writing. \n\n3.5/5", "timestamp_created": 1447860123, "timestamp_updated": 1447860123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498502", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19141562": {"recommendationid": "19141562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015041100", "num_games_owned": 879, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447547258}, "language": "english", "review": "6/10.\n\nThe game starts out good, the voice acting is great and the art is sufficient.\nWhile the setting is unique the game has a lot of similarities to bad fanfiction, (the primary characters are significantly more powerful than any other character in the game doing things that seem 'impossible' to other characters in the setting, they fall prey to 'special snowflake' syndrome, (ash doesn't know who her pairing is for most the game, merely that they are mysterious and extremely powerful, she is capable of ressurecting plants something noone else can do, as well as inexplicably being capable of casting spells and magics that others can't, handily defeating foes that would have killed her otherwise. Prude is a princess, and is the object of half the primary casts affections. Hek is stronger than the Heads of the school, and has powers that essentially have 'mary sue' written all over it. SPOILERS, DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT: Ash's pairing partner turns out to be a changeling/elf thing, and not only does it handily solve the final confrontation, but it also saves their lives thruoghout the entire game, demonstrating overwhelming power and skill for no reason, this character, (as we have seen it so far) is just a straight up mary sue, she has no real negative characteristics, being an extremely power magical creature, when she meets her ash seemingly just decides that she is over prude, dismissing what had up until that point been a major plotpoint) to further reinforce this similarity to fanfiction is the 'pairing' itself, which anyone with a passing familiarity with the Harry Potter fandom will probably recognize as a extremely cliche trope of that genre, it's essentially just soul-bounding or veela mates or whatever other flavor they choose to call it that week, with the pairing making both parties stronger, as well as somehow magically determining that they are 'destined for eachother' or some bullcrap like that. This makes the overall story feel weaker, at least for me, but since it is the central conceit of the story I will overlook it.\n\nYou may have noticed that the (horribly rambly) paragraph above is very critical, yet this is a positive review, and there is a reason for that: Hek. Hek single handedly makes this game, his characterization is amazing, and while the rest of the plot is a load of BS Hektor is interesting enough to keep you playing.\n\nOverall it's story is nothing special, it's plot being a collection of cliches that have been overused so often that there is no way to take them seriously anymore, but it's still interesting enuogh to pick up.

It's not that they were non-traditional, it was more that it almost felt like the author tried to jam as many non-traditional families and parings into the story as possible.

Presenting a very different world from the norm in most media, with Necromancy not necessarily being evil but instead another school of magic that's balanced out by Light magic, the game does a good job presenting the basic principles of the world at a good pace, and the player also gets the opportunity to learn more about the world if the right choices are made.\n\nI learned that the voice acting in the game (FULLY voice acted) was actually a stretch goal of it's kickstarter, and I have to say it helped breath life to the characters, and it was quite refreshing to hear new and different talent in an industry that sometimes feels only a handful of voice actors are always given work. (I hear voice actors like Jennifer Hale and Steve Blum across a LOT of titles, across different mediums, and while definitely great voice actors, it's once again so refreshing hearing new talent).  While the writing can also stand on it's own, the acting definitely helps you understand what kind of personality each character exhibits, and makes them that much more memorable. From the character designs to the backgrounds, the artstyle is also beautiful to look at, and speaks of the artist's talent in presenting this world and the people who live in it.\n\nThere are some games, or even TV shows, that you can play or watch for a while, and then you need to take care of something else.

As a backer from their kickstarter campaign, I had high hopes after sampling Ithaqua Labs' prior work, Jacob's Island, and after finishing my first playthrough of Brilliant Shadows, I am delighted with this game. Suffice to say my expectations were exceeded.\n\nIf you have never played a visual novel style game before, or even if you have and maybe didn't take to it very much, I think Brilliant Shadows is a great starting/re-entry point to visual novels in general.\n\nIt is very well presented and well written. Characters are believable and relatable. You start to feel for their predicaments with surprising ease, and the story sucks you right in.\n\nPlaytime for a single playthrough took upwards of 3 hours for me, which is fairly good for a visual novel game. As it is not a so-called \"kinetic\" novel (one with a single story and no branching paths) there are thankfully multiple paths that can be taken, and multiple endings to receive, so this will increase play time considerably. Even assuming you use the skip feature on subsequent playthroughs, getting all the endings is likely to take at least 5 hours or so I would guess. Playing through it normally, probably more like 8 or 9.\n\nI was graced with Ending #1 upon my first completion, and it was quite a satisfying one. Despite the \"Part One...\" in the game's subtitle, while it is clear there is more to come in future games, this first part doesn't exactly leave you hanging either. It felt like a satisfying place to end the first \"book\" if you will, and since there are multiple paths in the story to take, I look forward to seeing the significance of the other available routes and endings in subsequent replays of Brilliant Shadows.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, I'll just say the final moments of Ending 1 and the epilogue were quite touching, thanks to a very creative surprise twist.\n\nAll spoken dialog lines in the game have actual voicework, and it was well executed. The voices took me a bit to get used to at first, but that sensation quickly faded.\n\nUsually adding voices to visual novels is a bit of a gamble. The quality usually ends up polarized from what I have seen, but those fears are unfounded in this case. Everyone did a great job with their delivery of the lines, none of them seemed unnatural or like they were a poor fit to their characters. It all just worked out quite well, and I hope to hear more from this talented cast in future Ithaqua Labs games.\n\nArtwork was incredible. There's really no beating around the bush there. Characters, background scenery, UI flourishes, CG scenes, animations....all of it gorgeous and very fitting to bringing the world to life. Just excellent.\n\nThe music score was pleasing as well. It felt fitting to various scenes. While I didn't get the feeling that it stood out as incredibly memorable per se, it also didn't need to be. The important point for me to drive home is that it wasn't distracting. It didn't feel out of place. It's a good solid score for evoking and complementing the scene-appropriate emotions, and I really have nothing bad to say about it.\n\nI highly recommend Brilliant Shadows. It has all of the things a great visual novel should, and I'm eagerly (but patiently)  awaiting Part Two of the Book of Gray Magic (and part three? four? .... alright I'll stop being greedy.)\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1446929805, "timestamp_updated": 1446929805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551282", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18934031": {"recommendationid": "18934031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077907555", "num_games_owned": 484, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446949402}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm still not very far into this game and honestly, I wasn't expecting to like it all that much.

For fourteen years Veronica Ashmar has studied and prepared as a necromancer alongside her best friend Prudence who is training to be a paladin. They both have had high hopes since they were children that someday they would be paired together as mage and warrior for a life full of knowledge and adventure. The \"pairing ritual\" entails binding together a necromancer and a knight for a lifelong intertwining that serves to balance their opposing powers and bond their lives together forever. Finally the day has come as Veronica and Prude's group of graduates of the Mountain gather for the ceremony. Once completed it will inscribe each person's hand with a particular mark and those two people with the same mark will thus be paired indefinitely. The pairing ritual has always successfully bonded two marked individuals together...until now that is. Upon completion of the ceremony, Veronica suddenly finds herself marked but without another graduate with a corresponding mark to bind with? In this delightful visual novel, follow Veronica Ashmar on her fantastic adventure filled with intrigue, combat and romance to uncover the mystery of her suspicious mark.\n\nVisually, this is a truly beautiful V.N. with a very lovely art style that steps away from the traditional manga influence that you typically see in most visual novels on Steam. It's really refreshing to come across visual novels that try something different with the artwork. Don't get me wrong because I love manga but it's great to have a different experience from time to time. With that said, the illustrations here are gorgeous and nicely shaded while also filled with bright vibrant colors and depth of field as well as lighting effects. For the immersion factor, the characters facial expressions change depending on their mood and they blink their eyes which is also a nice little touch while adding some much needed life to the typical static nature of the visual novel genre in general. Also, this V.N. has voiced dialogue and it is handled quite well in my opinion even though I tend to prefer my visual novels without it. Nevertheless, the voice actors sound endearing, genuine, believable and follow the script quite nicely throughout the captivating narrative. Speaking of which there are a few choices that you will have to make as the storyline progresses so choose wisely...or not. In conclusion, Brilliant Shadows-Part One Of The Book Of Gray Magic takes you on a nicely stylized visually alluring journey filled with emotions, romance, just the right touch of comic relief and a fascinating mystery to solve.\n\nThis visual novel was a very entertaining experience for me and just highly enjoyable from the beginning to the end. The compelling story was well written while also thought provoking and that was coupled with some wonderful sound quality and absolutely fantastic illustrations. Speaking of which, this titles unique artstyle was quite eyecatching and something that I would like to see more of. This was a visual novel that I just couldn't put down and I really wanted to continue the thrilling adventures with this very memorable group of people. Thankfully that wish has been fulfilled because a sequel, \"Pale Spectrum-Part Two Of The Book Of Gray Magic\", has been recently released which I very much look forward to reading. As far as options go, there are the basics like sound and music volume. There are no Steam Achievements to hunt down but Steam Trading Cards are available for collection and the wonderful original soundtrack by Johnathan Johnson is also included. And as a final treat, there is even a \"blooper reel\" of sorts available at the end of the novel where you get to hear all the highly talented voice actors totally mess up their lines during recording. It's completely hilarious and highly entertaining to listen to. This is something unique that I've not seen implemented in any other visual novel before and I would like to see many more voiced V.N.'s do something similiar. In summary, if you are looking for a thrilling fantasy story ripe with adventure, romance and suprising plot twists then look no further because Brilliant Shadows-Part One Of The Book Of Gray Magic is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of the visual novel genre.

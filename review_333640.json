Since every review talks bout how fantastic it is, and it is, I'll tell you what i find lacking.  There should be more quests.  There needs to be a better system for tracking down the magical items and locations that you hear about in sultan histories. The enchanted items that you find are usually kind of functionally worthless by the time you find them.  Rusting an item happens too frequently and is too hard to remove currently (repair doesn't seem to do much and there isn't always fixing spray), NPC's traders should have a repair function similar to identifying an artifact.  Ego is way too powerful when it comes to merchants. My dumb mutie shouldn't have to pay an entire skin of water for a water skin. I'd like to see more faction interaction. I'd like to see more base building (you can do it currently, animate walls, then move them into position, throw in two chairs, a hookah, and a chest).   Character generation was fantastic, but I would like for the option to build your own class, or have more concrete class interactions in the world.   Wardens should crack crimnal's skulls and get rewarded for it.  Hearth Children should have to protect homes from raiders. Overall, the game is fantastic and nuanced.

You can roll truekin humans with cybernetics or mutant humans with all sorts of biomutant properties.

The writing and generated lore will have you exploring purely for curious enjoyment. You will marvel at the inhabitants and the monster diversity on offer. The game is constantly being updated with more content, both systems and lore.

It is inevitably going to be terrible. It is worth getting past that, the easiest way is just looking up a good starter build online. There is a very useful guide for getting started in game, though it could use a little updating - for example, it took about a dozen hours before I noticed the \"Hit Tab to trade\" in the bottom of the screen when talking to people, and boy howdy did that help. \n\nBUT! Once you get past the hump of knowing what is what and what you can do, the greatness of the Qud really shines through.

I started a new game with a 4 armed, axe wielding, horn having, stinger waving, flurry of doom. I made it through the first quest area did just fine etc. Then there was nothing, no direction...so I decided to follow a marker that I got from a dagger I inspected. I got lost and died on my way there, getting one shotted by some random monster. So I thought with a game this huge I'm just not hardcore enough of a gamer. So I decided to do what any sensible gamer would do, I cheated, turned off perma-death, enabled a save system, and even gave myself lots of xp and levels to get started. So now I was frustration free and able to dive into the meat and depth of this game and really enjoy myself. What I found was a very common, boring shallow RPG that has been done better countless times, its really just the fanboys and convoluted systems that give this game any mistique, and its appeal. Don't buy this game play a CRPG from the 90s, there are no redeeming qualities here just fluff and misdirection.

Then, it lessens as you bite into the corpse of a giant centipede, knowing you have bought yourself a few more hours, another chance at escape. Then, one day, after you've nearly accepted your new life underground, you hear something and find a Dromad caravan wandering the caves, and upon investigating, you see a space time portal as Dromad merchants fight off creatures in the dark. I knew I should stay and fight with them, but the thought of seeing daylight once more was too much... I abandoned the merchants, and found myself in the wilderness above, and eventually home... but perhaps at the cost of many lives whom I had yet to learn of or trade with. \n10/10 would recklessly enter strange portals again.", "timestamp_created": 1505706941, "timestamp_updated": 1505706941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530686", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35036938": {"recommendationid": "35036938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095741779", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1057, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511398101}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u73a9\u662f\u597d\u73a9\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7248\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e22\u5931\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u771f\u65e0\u5948\u3002\u751f\u50fb\u5b57\u592a\u591a\uff0cWe need Chinese\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1505699749, "timestamp_updated": 1505699749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35026092": {"recommendationid": "35026092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034916155", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512586266}, "language": "english", "review": "Such a fantastic game.

Because Caves of Qud is the most complicate game to rate i've ever seen.[/h1]\n\n\nThat's why I will be straightforward.\n\n[u]Why would you buy Caves of Qud ?[/u]\n\nIf you want to try the hardest  rogue-like rpg up to date  with minimalistic graphics and rich story then you can buy this game.\n\nOtherwise forget it.\n\nBecause you can have a lot of fun and really rewarding moments as you can become so frustrated and angry to smash your keyboard (wich is actually the only controler).\n\n\n[h1]If you still want to buy this game: Few things you must know before playing.[/h1]\n\n[u]The Game Developpement/ Community:[/u]\n\nCaves of Qud is in early access. Supported by a great dev team (these guys are awesome ! ).\nThe minimalistic render of the game permits amazing possibilities regularly updated by new stories, content and bug fixes (Sorry you won't fall in love for a wood sign again ). Caves of Qud is one of the most promising early access around. Most of the ones who played it have barely scratched it's surface ! Also the developpement logs are some of the funniest i've ever read.\n\nIf you enter this world you will find  a friendly community. Forums are  full of nice and helpfull people. Plus there's already implemented Steam Workshop to add new stories, items, character presets or skills. \n\n[u]Overall difficulty and Survival tips:[/u]\n\nCaves of Qud is a brutally difficult game. Maybe the hardest i've ever played. Hours of efforts can be lots in seconds. There is no space for errors and lack of planning.\n\nEspecially when you build your character. Don't trust reviews talking about weird stuff with character creation.\nOf course you can do amazing things in this game. But taking risks leads to a game over and nothing else.\nNo exp for your highscores. No unlockables after death. Just lessons, regrets and your tears...\n\nYou can save your starting character sheet and also the world seed: wich is one of the most important feature regarding difficulty. Everything is random except tilesets if you save your world seed. It makes adventures way more manageable for your successives tries. So keep that in mind !\n\nSurviving requires you to gather food and water. Depending of your character you might have different habits to fullfill your needs. Also be ware water is a currency and can overload you. It makes trading a bit tedious because you must trade water for items with the same trading price but lightweight.\nTo set a base in a village is a good thing, you can lift chests and drop them anywhere. If you store items inside nobody will steal them.\n\nRemember to always have a backup plan when you create a character. By plan I mean: a way to escape fights !\nBecause almost everything is random you fall rather often on huge packs or a really vicious enemies just around a corner, down some stairs or in the wilderness on the border of  a new tile.\nThat's why you must be able to set up a decent escape plan for every situations.\nRun, jump, lay mines, throw grenades, freeze with your hands, stun with your cudgel or just teleport yourself and run away ! (teleportation is my favourite skill in Caves of Qud. Nothing can beat this).\n\nYou can inspect the world around you. Helps you to know  your enemies , there's a cybernetic augment that give you detailed informations about your target. If it's tough or impossible and angry .... Run ! !\n\n\nNote that you need to light your environment or get the appropriate skill to see whenever the conditions. Temperature matters, check your body temperature or when it's too late pour something on you !\n\nDoing regular faction checks and inspecting new people helps to prevent bad surprises. \n\n\nAnd take your time, you might survive longer....\n\n\n[u]Character creation:[/u]\n\nEven if the possibilities are almost limitless when you create your character you have to choose between Mutated humans and True Kins.\n\nMutants can tailor their skills by adding new limbs/organs or spychic powers (teleportation and some other cool stuff). One of the starting mutations is really interresting: you can be versatile, choose an unstable genome and get amazing results or focus on one type and exclude the other (Physical or Mind mutations). You can also select a Caste that gives skills/bonuses/equipements and serves as your background.\n\nTrue Kins could be seen as fresh \"Fallout\" Vault Dwellers.\nStronger starting attributes and unable to get mutations. They get more skill points every level and have access to cybernetics: the weaker cousin of mutations, at least for the moment.\nYou can also choose castes and they get slightly better starting equipement (wich is sometimes really unfair compared to mutants).\n\n\nYour equipement is really important no matter what character you create. Try to spend enough Ego points so you will sell your loot at decent prices. No other attribute can affect bartering.\n\n\nTake time to understand how attributes and skills works. If you fail to stick to one character type you won't be able to reach your full potential. Saving and practicing a character in the first tries is a good thing... especially True Kins, they are easier to handle when you start.\n\n\n[u]Progression:[/u]\n\nCaves of Qud is very grindy.

A bit of a problem sometimes because related to intelligence and gives access to tons of receipes unavailable to other builds without itl. Especially restorative injectors and grenades.

It's as if the game was tailor made for me.  But if I am the ideal consumer of this game, why should the rest of you want to play this?\n\nFirst of all, this game should be purchased sight unseen by anyone who loves classic Roguelikes, especially the ones from the 1990s and before.  It is one of the most complex games in the genre, has had a long development and is now seeing regular updates with lots of content and features being patched in every month.  Imagine a game similar in scale to Adom with a fixed quest played out in world and local area maps, but not really, because the \"world map\" is just an abstraction of the game world, which is a patchwork of hundreds of local area maps, with each surface map having dozens of maps in Z levels underneath.  You have procedural generation of the game world, movement, combat, exploration and inventory/character management similar to other classic roguelikes, but with a streamlined modern interface.  \n\nIn addition to what you'd expect from a true roguelike, you get complex skill trees, mutations, destructible terrain, crafting, factions  (you can also use faction reputation to barter with people) and procedurally generated world lore.  The game challenges you not only with combat, but also survival issues such as hunger, thirst and fungal infection. Add to all these fun features some truly great writing as well as world building embedded into all facets of game content, and you have a real gem of a roguelike here that is unrivalled in terms of depth and scope by pretty much anything with the possible exception of Dwarf Fortress (but this game is much easier to play and the setting is hand-crafted rather than the worlds of chaotic proc-gen stew that DF serves up).\n\nQud has beautiful minimalist tile graphics, but if you really want it you can play in classic roguelike fashion with all tiles represented by only letters and symbols from the good old IBM Code Page 437.\n\nFor those of you who are not familiar with old school \"roguelikes\", this game is not hard to pick up.  It it turn-based, uses a character sheet and maps similar to classic computer RPGs, but set in an exotic far-future wasteland setting unlike anything seen in other roleplaying games.  This is not the setting of Mad Max or Wasteland, but a world so far in the future that the memory of our own civilization, ecosystems and ways of life have long since eroded away into nothingness.  \n\nThis is a game for people who enjoy challenges, emergent problem solving, reading and experiencing new settings through gameplay.

Static overworld. A fair choice, but for now it feels empty. If you go with static then every village should have a fair amount of interesting NPCs with many different quests. Right now there's like 1 main quest with a sidequest or two. The main quest jumps in difficulty from a level 1 dungeon to a place where it's recommended to go at lvl 17 with a set of gear. So from levels 7-17 you're supposed to go grinding in a random cave or ruin, and after you finish it, maybe grind again for a little more. If i wanted to grind for the sake of grinding, i'd rather play poschengband.\n\n2. Stats and skills. Physical mutants feel kinda boring. Many mutations have drawbacks, so you have to use mutation points to level them up, so their advantages become stronger. That means you either level up your 3-4 starting muts(boring) or have many semi-useless random mutations(ineffective). Any drawbacks except maybe a beak are cripplingly bad and they basically mean you play on challenge mode. That makes build variety for phys mutants really limited. Look at cataclysm DDA how to make mutations right. Every bonus is not super good, but every drawback is not super crippling.\n\nAnother point is skills, so as a mutant you cannot afford more than 16 int, because there are no real dump stats. So any mutant builds feel kinda one-dimensional because you're starved of skill points.\n\n3. Design flaws. Just naming a few.\n-Slumberlings. So this monster is supposed to teach that not every dude should be killable. They can spawn in red rock and rust wells(first two dungeons) and if disturbed by someone else they charge you and literally oneshot you. Fun times. Now let's look how DCSS adresses the similiar issue. They have a red imp, who regenerates, blinks and has decent magic resist BUT he deals almost NO damage. Surely, this is the more elegant way to teach that principle, don't you think?\n-Water-based economy. This is a cool concept, but in game with a low str character it translates to the endless recoiling, dropping water to stash, getting water from stash to merchants, all this pointless micromanagement.\n-Confusion. The confusion in this game is absolutely ridiculous. You don't just take random actions and may fail using of items\\spells\\potions. The entire map turns into gibberish, along with your inventory. The one time i got to bethesda susa boss, i easily killed the welcoming party at the elevator, but then the boss permaconfused me and nicked me to death, and the worst part is that you cannot even escape because every item in your inventory gets renamed to \"fgsfds\" of something.\n\nOf course there are some minor flaws that add some inconvenience like why do i have to choose the waterskin every time i pick one dram of blood and why do i pour 20 drams of water in 3 waterskins instead of filling one with 60. So the final verdict, as i said, Caves of Qud has potential to become a great roguelike, but if you're looking for a sort of finished product with a flawless gameplay(i know this is still the early access, but it has been in it for a while), i cannot reccomend this game for now.\n", "timestamp_created": 1503756227, "timestamp_updated": 1503756227, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575908", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34504637": {"recommendationid": "34504637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072772325", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499475381}, "language": "english", "review": "Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!\nNnnn!

Therefore, I took the time to dispel a few things that people might not realize about the game. I can not say it enough that I absolutely love the game but I want to at first go through some things that I notice get negative reviews and explain them.\n\nThis game has old school ASCII art like the nethack game except they use custom tiles and not all ASCII art from what I can tell. If you like something with high quality graphics then this game might be confusing or difficult. I am not saying you will not like it but you should beware. To me the graphics are high quality but they are just not 3D or dense. It requires some imagination to sort of realize a more comprehensive environment. This is expected from this type of game and you can tell by looking at the videos and screenshots; however, beware if your not sure. Steam offers a refund but make sure you stop playing before two hours.\n\nThe user interface is actually really easy but at first it will be really hard if you have never played any games like this before. It is all keyboard commands; however, its not too terribly difficult to learn. But, if your not into using the keyboard and learning the commands then its likely going to not be fun. It does have an experimental interface that you can use a mouse on from what I have seen but I never play with it because the keyboard works great for doing everything with minimal movement on my part.\n\nThe game is hard but it is not hard like Dark Souls; however, by default, just like other rouge games it has permadeath by default. However, you can turn the permadeath off in options. The key to this game is to farm a while at the beginning at least. You need to gain a few levels. Also, use the L key to look around at NPCs to determine if they are hostile and how powerful they are. Without using the L key you are going to end up walking blind into battles that you can not win. Even if you use the best tactics and have tons of experience you will still eventually die.\n\nIt is an RPG but its really a rouge game which means it does not play like a normal RPG where you can load a previous save when you die unless you disable permadeath.  It has all the RPG features but the game's super genre is rouge which is where the permadeath and randomized play through comes from. It is also the reasoning for a significant amount of randomness. \n\nThe randomness can make you lose to something that is lower leveled then you if you are already in a weak condition or state; however, being prepared if the key. You have to be really cautious in this game. If you like a fast paced hack and slash game then be careful. This game can be fast paced but its might not be the style of fast paced you like because of the randomness sometimes. You can see some powerful enemies in the beginning area so you have to be prepared by gaining levels and taking it easy.\n\nIt is also very open world - to the point where some players can feel lost or aimless. It does have quests but only a few at the beginning since you have to find the others, therefore, sometimes your going to be exploring just to explore and see what is out there. It is also a fairly big world and a large part of the experience is down in the underground areas. These appear as stairs going down.\n\nSome of the books (not sure how many) are randomized and many of the things about the game can be that way too. It can make you feel like there is no story to the game. There is a story but its in the quest line and from some of the static things in the game. The random books and things are just kind of interesting because they make you try to figure out if its something important. If you are not proficient in English then you might find the game a challenge.\n\nI have experienced one bug in my ten hours of play. The game locked up and I guess it did not autosave before I had gained a level and one of my mutations stabilized, therefore, I lost my four arms I had gained. My point being is that there are likely a few bugs and they could cause you to lose your game and progress. Its not as terrible as others games since it is a rouge type game and you will eventually die but be prepared for a few bugs at least. I would generally say the game is almost bug free from my experience but that also comes with early access. Its essentially an almost finished game but just beware.\n\n====\n\nOne of the craziest games I have ever played. A real rouge-like adventure. You can play with four arms, contract fungal spore infections that cause you all sorts of misery and do damage at the same time, get all sorts of crazy abilities I have never seen in a game before, and its all fairly randomized so no play through is the same.\n\n** Novel mechanic: Analgesia - No hitpoint numbers! Only general state! **\n\nThere are a lot of games that claim to be random and this one does have static places and events. Its a hard game so you will die a lot and believe me each play through is different. That is something I have never experienced with any other game. It has permadeath enabled - BUT its actually fun. It is also a game where skill and experience helps you to last longer and get further. It has randomness but its not overwhelming or crazy.\n\nWant to gain a mutation to release corrosive gas that eats through walls, have precognition to travel backwards in time to fix a mistake you made before you die, or play with amnesia? This game amazingly brings some of the most novel game mechanics I have ever seen.\n\nI guess the developer was able to spend more time with actual game mechanics and content instead of graphics and it turned out to be a great game. \n\nI recommend playing the weekly and daily challenges. You get a interesting build and you can play it at least a few times before it changes. Also, you get ranked on how high of a score you got. Where the score is computed from various things such as turns survived, experience gained, complexity of items in inventory, and all sorts of things. It is interesting playing a new build and trying to see how well you can place on the leaderboard for the weekly and daily challenge. \n\nThis is also one of those games that is cheap to buy and gives you lots of hours of play here and there when you get board.

Based within a post-apocalyptic world of a world that was once thriving from a golden era with unimaginable tech, now has both fallen to rubble and has crept back into life. This world has a wonderful and colourful world to explore, with new things to explore with every run. \n\nAlongside the intriguing backstory surrounding the game, there is of course the gameplay. The game plays like you would expect most old-school rogue-likes to play. The mechanics are somewhat complex and you might have a tough time figuring them out at first, especially because there is a lot of different things you can do. While this is a downside that should be corrected, it can be lived with because it gives you increased capabilities once the controls are learned, with ease of access. \n\nThe AIs are more intelligent and diverse than in most games, to the point that the \"mobs\" will attack each other if they were already in a fight or per chance hate each other more than they hate you. There are civilizations and factions of all kinds of creatures that you can either befriend or attack. This is a refreshing change of pace from any other game I have played recently, and one reason I always return. \n\nOverall, this is a great game for anyone that likes a more complex or in-depth rogue-like (if you have liked games such as: Brogue, Don't Starve, etc). The game is great and there is just so much to be done or that you can do. As great as the game is, I do have a few reservations; I feel they should work on the UI to make it easier for people to start off the game, even though it is playable as current. Also I feel there should be a better way to make a keep or home or some place of residence. Most times I end my runs because I feel I'm continueing on hoping to get somewhere, only to realise that place doesn't exist (end game). Regardless, this is a great game, give it a try.

Should I approach the review from the angle of \"this game has the most active devs imaginable and new stuff is added every Friday with development streams on Twitch every Thursday\u201d? Or \"Holy f*cking sh*tballs, you can play a psychic turtle gunslinger who has four arms and is bros with Fungi and is not welcome in the holy places of Cats\u201d? I mean the first option seems most appealing on paper, as it is the most measured and most rationally persuasive, but I know that it has usually been the *weird* reviews that get me to buy games.\nSo I\u2019m going to do both.\n\n\nIn the last two months, a major feature arc was added to the game, The Water Ritual. Fresh drinkable water is scarce in Qud, so much so that the standard unit of currency in the game is about an ounce of water. To gift your life-preserving water to someone is a show of great respect and brotherhood, doing so is so culturally important in Qud that it happens in a form of ceremony that is acknowledged and respected by all of the 40+ factions of Qud. Commencing this ritual boosts your reputation with the faction whose leader you gifted the water, but it also decreases it with the enemies of that person. Each named NPC in Qud has a generated history and reputation with every faction in the game, which is different each time you play. This means, depending on who you encounter in a given game, you can make friends with even the most initially hostile of factions.\u2028\n\nNow lets talk crazy. You know how most games when they do something unbalanced that breaks the game, they usually nerf that power by making it less powerful? Caves of Mud had that problem with its Psychic class of mutant. So did the debs make the Psychics less powerful? No. They created an in-game multiverse and sent extra-dimensional enemy Psychics to hunt you down if your psychic power grew to such prominence that it threatened the stability of the universe. That was a nerf. Adding a multiverse was a nerf. They did that three weeks ago.\nI have bought this game for friends and family just so I could be able to talk to them about it. I have offered to buy this game for complete strangers who were on the fence about it. If you aren\u2019t already playing it, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. Don\u2019t let early access tag fool you, this game has more polish and devotion poured into it than Chrome on the Towering Spindle that pierces the skies to the far east.

My only other complaint is the fact that I need to go through the same initial routine every round, I think you might be able to macro this, if not I'm going to write a python script to handle this.

CoQ does feature permadeath, and can suddenly spike in difficulty at times, but between the quick turnaround time on rolling up a new, interesting character, and the partial randomization of the world every new run, the game is designed to abide by the classic roguelike credo of \"death is fun.\" Even after an untimely death well into one of my luckier, lengthier runs, I'll still often find myself itching to come back again and start a fresh adventure no more than a few hours after the fact, eager to try out some wild, ridiculous new combination of mutations, or hoping to stumble across a back-mounted set of mechanical arms not two minutes out from the starting village.", "timestamp_created": 1501155066, "timestamp_updated": 1501155186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495098", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33822443": {"recommendationid": "33822443", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201209477", "num_games_owned": 1349, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 2174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512996914}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all, I would like to get this out of the way..

I believe it reminded me of DOTA 2- I enjoyed aspects of and greatly disliked others, and all too often I found these were things I could not avoid running into. Among my initial complaints, I felt like things quickly became samey and that it was difficult to feel accomplishment or get anything rewarding when your stuff could be quickly erased with a death.\n\nI tried to use the quicksave/quickload feature but I found it didn't really help me. I tried to go about the game slower and be more cautious, and while I still find that at times there's really nothing you could've done other than die, I've found my footing a bit better. Things that got me killed before, I've figured out how to approach or avoid. I've gotten better at not just rushing in, and examining things before I act. The learning curve was steep but now that I'm actually getting into the game it's so much more enjoyable.\n\nPros:\n+ Small, helpful community akin to Dwarf Fortress.\n+ Devs are active and responsive, which is unbelievably refreshing for an early access game.\n+ There are a lot of different ways to play the game.\n+ The world, and pre-generated lore is overall interesting and diverse, and there's still more that the devs are planning on adding.\n+ Once you get over the initial difficulty the game gets much more enjoyable.\n+ In particular, this new update with espers being watched has added some more interesting stuff to the game for me.\n\nNeutral\n= The game requires some creativity to play if you need visuals to enjoy stuff, as the game is ASCII centered.\n\nCons\n- The learning curve is, as I said, very steep. It's not impossible to overcome but most people who are new will probably want to start off with reading a guide or maybe trying a build.\n- Some things in the game are repetitive. In the early game, fighting the same, relatively basic enemies is boring (since the cool enemies are harder and kept in the later areas), or you read the same sultan histories over a hundred times.\n\nTL;DR game has a crazy learning curve but it's not insurmountable, use guides and possibly builds to lean on. Community and devs are active and responsive so if you have questions ask them. The game can be a bit boring in the early stages but once you've overcome beginner problems you'll find the game much more enjoyable.

Hard to give that a negative review for certain, and I don't intend to. Qud does a far better job of creating world immersion by having an actual world setting, rather than endless and fairly nameless levels of dungeons like other roguelikes. Although at times charmingly clunky, the pregenerated books and stories of the world add a wonderful touch to the world feeling alive and lived in. Very much takes after Dwarf Fortress adventure mode, but with far more progress and polish.\n\nThat said, the game isn't without its flaws. With additional complexity, ontop of the Roguelike genre's brutal approach to \"difficulty\", this game should not be your first delve into the genre. After cutting my teeth for a couple years of casual play on Stone Soup and getting my first win, Qud is a welcome step up in breadth of features. As to the game itself Inventory management needs some cleanup, autopathing needs a couple travel exclusions added to it, and friendly spore path exclusion needs to be removed at the very least.\n\nIt's under active development though, so I have high hopes small issues like this will get smoothed out.

As soon as I found out what it was and got into it, Qud cemented itself as an immediate classic in my mind. Even in its incomplete state it's won me over completely; definitely in my top 15 favorite games of all time, at least. Don't let the early-access designation and minimal graphics throw you off; it's an absolutely engrossing, deep, gorgeous experience that's worth every penny and more. It is permadeath and is intended to be played that way, though there are ways to disable that. But the difficulty is, for the most part, fair and predictable enough that I never felt the need to do so. My biggest complaint is how monotonous the early-game can be, and it's the part of the game where RNG has the highest chance of getting you killed, which is both a good and bad thing I guess.\nIt's far from complete, but it's also being very actively developed, with weekly updates and lots of developer communication. What's here already is a substantial, enjoyable and truly unique experience. As far as overall feel, I suppose parallels could be drawn between it and games like Wasteland and Fallout, but the setting is truly unique, bizarre and esoteric, with a quirky and fascinating mix of post-apocalypse and otherworldly fantasy elements. You've got lasers and robots alongside plate armor and talking plants, and while it's often wacky it never feels nonsensical or obnoxiously absurd. The biggest hurdle for most people to overcome would probably be the somewhat convoluted controls, but they're more than tolerable once you get a hang of them and the devs are actively making efforts to make the controls and interface more accessible, which I think is great. This game deserves a huge following and anything that makes it more accessible is wonderful.

It plays a bit like a tabletop game, both in the way things are calculated, and the way you perceive it. You'll have mutations and stats like 'multile arms' or 'horns' but aside from the label you don't see any of these elements on screen. Functionally they make a difference, but you kinda need to imagine what's going on.\n\nBefore even starting, note that you're expected to use a numpad to move, allowing you to move diagonally or use the 5 key to even wait. And if you're not up for a hardcore experience, there's a lot of debug options, and one lets you turn off permadeath. While permadeath is a great way to play, it's not mandatory to enjoy the game. The game does encourage you to make multiple characters and try different things.\n\nThe biggest strength in the game is how many different character builds you can construct. There's a lot of skills that affect combat ability in a really satisfying way, or if you want to go more of an esper, a ton of psychic mutations to use. And of course there are physical mutations as well which can give you attacks such as going a target with horns (apparently robots can bleed as well?), or multiple limbs to fight with.\n\nAlmost any encounter can be approached differently. Some may have an easier time than others, but I've successfully played a psychic, a knife-wielding rogue, and an axe-wielding barbarian. (All mutant, you can play as a non-mutant as well which a lot of people say is easier for beginning characters.)\n\nThe encounters and trials you face are super diverse. Robots, trolls, sentient bears, hordes of worms, etc.\n\nThe biggest frustration I ran into (as with any RPG) was inventory management, specifically weight. Water is your currency, and it also has weight, as does food. There's a pretty nice sorting system that allows you to navigate menus entirely via key inputs, however. Since there's no despawn time on items, you can also drop your excess equipment in the starting town or put it in a chest of your own for safekeeping.\n\nIt's also not complete yet--later elements of the story are currently missing, and major updates result in your prior saves becoming unusable. You can roll back an update to play old versions, however. Luckily losing a character isn't TOO major a concern normally, just because of how the game is built around being a hardcore experience.\n\nAll in all it's a very strange game that appeals to very specific tastes.

While the game isn't fully complete yet, it already has a special place in my heart next to ADOM. In the hierarchy of great roguelikes, this one is destined to be at or near the top, depending on how much they keep adding content and flesing out their world. \n\nPros:  Like ADOM, this is an open questing roguelike world, but turned up to 11.  There's a main story quest and various branching sub-quests, but you can literally just start exploring and keep going down until you encounter something that eventually kills you. The game is effectively infinite since every square on the world map correponds to a large overland area tons of random and not-random content, and underneath each of these screens are even more randomly generated linking caves, so you can effectively explore in any direction (except up) until you die from old age or your computer eventually runs out of memory. (which is going to take a long time since my biggest savegame is currently 43MB)\n\nGameplay is very like ADOM, ...but in a post-apocalyptic setting with lazer weapons and robots, crafting (if you have the Tinkering skill), and the ability to replace your own bodyparts with cybernetic implants! Plus, water as a currency and a consumable is a nice touch. Also, instead of corruption, you can catch various diseases and fungal infections that can make your life miserable until you find the correct cure (Hint: There's a book in the game that tells you how)\n\nIt's moddable! And even this early access version has some great workshop content.\n\nThere's lots of character customization and fun mutant powers to be had, though this early access version could use some tweaking in terms of balance and starting points. Since it's all XML, I ended up modding my version to add additional mutant points per level so it felt a little more like my character was actually growing and getting something more than a few extra hitpoints with each level.\n\nMeet friends and make enemies. Through the miracle of the water ritual you can even sometimes persuade them to join you. My best game had a sidekick flying serpent who was essentially Trogdor the Burninator, but unfortuately, while he was great at carrying supplied, he sucked when it came to randomly letting fly with jets of flame and acid gas attacks that inevitalby damaged me and destroyed valuable items on the floor.\n\nYou can sever body parts. And if you sever a creature's face off, you can then wear that body part on your own face as a mask. Yes, this even includes your own face if you happen to have the two heads mutation and can survive having one of your faces chopped off.\n\nCons:  The variety of Monsters in early access is currently extremely limited. This area needs to be massively expanded, as it gets boring fighting the exact same crabs, spiders, and slime blobs, but I'm sure it will be.\n\nMonsters that create pools of liquid (especially slime and acid) needs to be scaled back big-time. Default puddles size should be maybe 1, 2, or 3 tiles, not 9. Considering how many slime blobs are in a dungeon, any given floor can quickly degenerate into a slippery mess, where everybody just careens around blindly, and lots of good loot (and water) gets ruined.\n\nIt is currenly possible to get key NPCs killed, especially during the attack on Grit Gate, which effectively kills the primary quest dead in it's tracks. It's not that big a deal yet, though since the game isn't complete yet so you can't \"win\" it anyways.", "timestamp_created": 1495006151, "timestamp_updated": 1498201173, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31773700": {"recommendationid": "31773700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031490327", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514336918}, "language": "english", "review": "The free ASCII version of Caves of Qud is what really got me into classic style Roguelikes (nethack, angband, etc.) and I haven't been able to find another comparable Roguelike (outside of adventure mode Dwarf Fortress which, unlike Caves of Qud, lacks direction.) \n\nEvery time I start the game up I am pleasantly surprised by what Freehold Games team of 2 (3?) has come up with and I am looking forward to seeing more.", "timestamp_created": 1494871476, "timestamp_updated": 1494871476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31741496": {"recommendationid": "31741496", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291536459", "num_games_owned": 531, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483807204}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a very fun rougelike.

Seriously, it was early one of the best looking ASCII games in existence, and that coupled with an utterly massive far future setting with a lot of Gene Wolfe styling in it.  Seriously, the otherworldliness of the original was great.  The only thing that the original was only average in was in UI, but that was because there are games like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup in existence.  It combines some pretty good mouse controls with very intuitive menus and a very good looking tileset.   The way controls work was and continues to be one of the few roguelikes I feel comfortable playing with a TKL keyboard (QWE, ASD, ZXC as movement with Ctrl + Movement as basic hotkeys, and 1234 as abilities is my go to, if anyone wants to play with one hand for keyboard and one for mouse)\n\nAs for this new version, I'm glad to say that it (I hate to call it just a graphical version) is easily on course to be one of the must play games for gamers in general.  Their included graphic set is the only one I've seen that fits the TONE.  Instead of being just good enough to not hurt the game, I can already tell just by exploring for 10 hours that this will be the best way to play Caves of Qud.  And it's not just a regular tileset, the UI has been so fully integrated that both mouse controls and keyboard feel more natural.  \n\nAs for the game being Early Access, don't worry.  This team had been with this game since about 2010 I believe, and are very dedicated to the game.

Caves of Qud has been on my following list for ~2 years and after seeing consistent weekly updates from the developer and a recently released roadmap of future features planned I decided to pick this up.\n\nI've played ~26 hours at this point trying out a variety of characters and haven't had this much fun playing a game in a long time.  I think the difficulty in this game is just right - I am given more leniency to try things out without being killed immediately as in some of the more hardcore roguelikes, but I am still punished with YASD for acting foolishly - but learning from deaths is part of every roguelike.\n\nYou start the game deciding to play a mutated human or a True Kin/non-mutated human.  Mutants can be made into physical monstrosities (paralyzing scorpion stinger, burrowing claws, regeneration, body full of quills, etc)  psychic beings (teleporting, charming, shooting concentrated light/lasers, conjuring fire, etc) with you being able to improve each mutation upon leveling up, or spend a few mutation points to choose between 3 random ones.  With a wide variety of mutations you can make some really unique builds.   True Kins don't have access to mutations, but generally start with better gear and attributes, and gain skills at a much faster rate - sills like dismembering (cut of someone's face or legs... and eat them!), charging strike, meditation, tinkering/crafting, etc. As with mutants, you can choose to play a strong dumb oaf, an agile gunslinger, an artifact collector slinging grenades or freezing his enemies.\n\nThe world itself has a few set static locations but for the most part is procedurally generated (including procedurally generated quests that lead you to interesting locations) that keeps things fresh and interesting.  You may stumble upon a ruins, a legendary creature's lair, or simply get lost when wandering on the overland map.  Instead of traveling on the overland map, you can choose to travel on the local map where every few screens/zones is considered passing one tile on the overland map.  side from the overland map, there is also an underground biome that spans the entire game world, filled with treasures and monsters.  \n\nAs nice bonus for players who aren't used to traditional roguelikes and memorizing 50 keys, CoQ streamlined actions into a single key that will perform the most logical action in the square you are targeting, such as looting and chatting to NPCs.  The game is easy to get into, and if you prefer to have less clutter in the UI you have the option you can change around the overlay to a few different options.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who likes roguelikes - for early access it is an extremely well fleshed out game with tons of content and AMAZING lore.  I think the reviews speak for themselves with a 98% overall thumbs up.", "timestamp_created": 1492948011, "timestamp_updated": 1492948049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31315244": {"recommendationid": "31315244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063492680", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514004551}, "language": "english", "review": "This game filled a hole in my life i didn't know i had.

This starts with character creation, you can choose to be a True Kin, a pure human with advanced skills, or a mutant with the ability to modify their genes and attain obsurd powers and abilities. These mutations can manifest as physical traits, such as multiple arms to use more weapons, Nightvision to see in the dark, Regeneration to restore lost limbs and hitpoints. Mutations also add supernatural/psychic powers such as creating portals in space-time to banish enemies to a random location in the world(Or yourself) Pyromancy/Cryomancy, creating barriers or even cloning yourself to assist in combat. Both mental and physical mutations can be negatives to increase your creation points (Or challenge yourself). You may also choose a background that will buff your stats and start you off with random gear and some skills.\n\nAfter character creation the game opens up to you. The world of Qud is a retro-future, post-human apocalyptic Tophet, the denizens here struggle everyday and the running currency is precious clean, drinkable water. The landscape is rife with tunnels, wells, caves , ruins, towns,  holy sites and fallen cities, quest specific areas (caves are procedural) are always the same but the land is dotted with randomized locations so each playthrough offers new exploration. Every creature belongs to a faction that exists in the world, flaura and fauna, and you can piss them all off, or try and befriend them, or instigate war between them.  \n\n You can choose to follow the main questline, or just wander the world in search of treasure/glory/scrap/artifacts or forbidden knowledge. The first few levels can be difficult, the first major quest you can recieve sends you to a low level dungeon to kill a creature and bring its corpse back to town, but this can prove difficult when a shotgun weilding,upright walking canine beast shoots a hole through your chest. I recommend killing creatures outside the starting town to gain a few levels. Whn you're ready, head out into the rust and find yourself, and die in increasingly hilarious ways. The game offers much more than I have experienced at this point and thats the beauty of it.\n\nCaves of Qud is a masterwork Roguelike up there with Dungeoncrawl and Dwarf Fortress, winning isn't always possible but you'll always have a story after each playthrough.\n\nAll in all, for $10 bucks theres no reason this game shouldn't be in your library if you're looking for an endlessly fun Roguelike/RPG title.\n\nTL:DR\nIf you combine Fallout, Dwarf fortress and Dungeoncrawl into a single game you get CoQ.

They've also done lots of interviews about the game and engage with their community regularly. If you're looking for your first EA game to see a game grow and what developers put into a project, please consider supporting the development of CoQ. If there's any team that deserves your support, it's this one.\n\nAs for the game, I've put in a hand full of hours into CoQ, but the game is so vast and deep that I'd be remiss to say I can provide anyone with a worth while review on the game itself. What I can say is that the character creation process is very, very deep and the world you can explore is extremely open and full of unique situations you will not find in other games. The game is also very challenging depending on how you apporach it and the potential for RP (if you're into it) is there in spades.\n\nOverall, Freehold Games is creating a very fun world to explore full of sentient doors, mutant heroes, and off the wall creatures that will kill you many, many times. It's well worth picking up in its current state, as even just a few minutes with the game will show you its depth and amount of customization, and a few hours will show you the size of the world you'll be exploring.

This looks awful!\"\nLet me tell you, once you ease yourself into it, like a somewhat chilly top layer of a mud bath - it gets really awesome very quickly.\n\nYou essentially start off in a small village, and once you've navigated the difficult systems, you're off and away exploring an ENTIRE WORLD of procedurally generated environments. It's really sweet, displaying the sort of potential that failed games like No Man's Sky didn't achieve.\n\nIMPORTANT: Learn the keybindings, and READ THE MANUAL. It sounds boring, but you will thank me later. \n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1492189197, "timestamp_updated": 1492189197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31131070": {"recommendationid": "31131070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048822982", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502216984}, "language": "koreana", "review": "One of a few decent ealry access games.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1492157680, "timestamp_updated": 1492157680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31109100": {"recommendationid": "31109100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031754113", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512271951}, "language": "english", "review": "I asked about a goat man's name, he asked me to stop, I persisted.

Across Moghra'yi, The Great Salt Desert, through teeming forests and dense jungles, past ancient ruins and foreboding caverns. Qud is full of exotic dangers, and i've had my fair share of close calls and narrow escapes along the way. I don't know that i would have made it through my last few encounter if not for my trusty new Vibroblade, which i recently bought off of a merchant who happened to be a sentient potted plant living in a city of talking albino gorillas.  The additional health provided by my mutant second heart also proved to be very useful. But now I'm in trouble. I'm surrounded by snapjaws, a sort of mutant human-hyena hybrid that i've encountered numerous times before with little problem. This time, however, their ranks are joined by an imposing figure named Fungus-Ridden Oofooflowuf. He appears to be some kind of snapjaw leader or hero, and a quick examination reveals that he inspires any other snapjaws in his vicinity to fight more effectively. He also happens to be infected by a parasitic fungus which allows him to emit deadly toxic spores from his body at will, and he is hated by The Wardens for having previously burned one of their leaders in effigy. All in all, not the most pleasant individual to come across. I try to beat a hasty retreat, but there's a wall blocking my path. If only i had the Burrowing Claws mutation i had chosen in a previous life so i could dig my way through the wall, or perhaps the wings so i could attempt to simply fly over my enemies and escape. I do have one ace up my sleeve, though. I haven't used it yet, as i feared what would happen, but now i seemingly have no choice; i activate the mental mutation that allows me to create a portal in the space/time continuum and stumble through it, near death. I step out into a completely unfamiliar landscape, lost but alive. A few yards away a unicorn appears to be fighting some kind of large dragonfly. I set out once again, trying to find my bearings.\nJust another day in Qud.\n...\nAbove all else, Qud is an absolute wonder of emergent storytelling. Every playthrough is completely different, and each one will ultimately form a completely unique story. Some of my favorite video game moments and stories of all time have emerged from Qud. Every character in the world has a detailed history, and you never know who you will encounter or how it will play out. There are a wealth of factors at play in every aspect of the game, and each one influences how your story will ultimately unfold, from the mutations at your disposal to the way your build affects your relationships and standing to the personal histories of each NPC and so on. I could tell you dozens of stories of my various journeys in Qud, because each one was completely unique and highly memorable.\"\n\nPlease check out the full review at:  http://thecrankymessiah.com/caves-of-qud-review/", "timestamp_created": 1490064498, "timestamp_updated": 1490064498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30638779": {"recommendationid": "30638779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052463354", "num_games_owned": 629, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 3283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513526536}, "language": "english", "review": "I've barely scratched the surface of what this game can do in terms of it's mechanics  - I've probably uncovered maybe 10% of what is possible, even after watching tutorials, playthroughs and series I keep discovering new things, places, creatures, items. The simplicity of the sprites and graphical side hide just how complex and intricate this game is, this is a prime example of \"Don't judge a book by it's cover\". This game...This world... It's intoxicatingly beautiful, mechnically complex and intricatley and lovingly crafted and just overwhelms you, making you want more and more...and more.\nThis isn't a love letter to the old ASCI Roguelikes, this is the true rebirth.\n\n\nPros -\n\nActual Rogue like, bearing this title with a proud and well deserved fist to the face of those who falsely claim to be similar.\nThe game is Bru...fucking...tal.\nSimple graphics, a clear call back to the days of ASCI and it's ilk. Actually very endearing when you get to know the various sprites and what they are/represent.\nIncredibly deep character building.\nIncredibly Interesting lore.\nOddly endearing sense of humour.\nMixes the old \"Roguelike\" gameplay loop with a basic survival aspect of hunger and thirst, food can be collected with the right abilties or bought.\nCrafting is pretty nifty needing both knowledge, proper character set up, and a good array of materials found in the world or bought.\nA lot of features, mechanics, potentially hundreds, if not thousands of character builds.\nProcedural generation allows for a hell of a lot of replay ability.\nOne of those titles that can either be a short and sweet run before work, or a good solid friday night with a can of juice/beer and a load of snacks.\n\nCons -\n\nEarly Access, though proving to be incredibly useful for this game, does mess with saves from time to time.\nBrutal learning curve, needs a fair deal of research and patience to actually survive.\nA lot of people may be put off by the simplicity of the graphical side.\nNot for the impatient or temper prone.\nVery, very unforgiving to those who just rush in head first without thought.\nCould be considered tedious in terms of the hunger and thirst, as many have and probably will utterly forget that the two exist and can kill you.\nPermadeath is a thing (I know a great many folk who utterly hate permadeath, thought it was worth a note).\n\n\nTip for newbies- Food can be scarce thanks to RNG. Kill \"Glowfish\" in the areas surrounding the starting town (Joppa) and pick up their corpses, the more the better, just don't overload your inventory, they are plentiful and food will be less of an issue for you at the begining few areas and levels.\n\nLive and drink friends and may you find shade where you choose to rest!", "timestamp_created": 1490031809, "timestamp_updated": 1493046516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700995", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30626622": {"recommendationid": "30626622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012008918", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 3972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "last_played": 1513633019}, "language": "english", "review": "Easily one of my favorite roguelikes, along with Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Crawl. I did an interview (an admittedly awful and nervous one) with the devs a long time ago when it was still free on their web page and they're cool people with a good vision for their game and dedicated to it. It's been in development for a while but don't be afraid of that, it was simply set aside for a while as the Devs worked on Sproggiwood. Now they are back going full force developing this and significant updates are posted weekly, consistently on every Friday, and has been that way for many months now. \n\nThe post-apocalyptic, low-technology setting is really compelling to explore. The builds you make all feel pretty well balanced and varied enough to want to try out all types of combinations, and combat is just tough enough to kill you plenty but still give you a taste of your mistakes and what you need to change for your next run. The item variety, descriptions and writing are also done particularly well.\n\nThe only thing I don't care for is in the early game a snapjaw can randomly have a grenade that will one shot you and they can throw it as soon as they see you. You can be moving through caves, turn a corner and blow up instantly from full health. It's happened about 3 or 4 times out of all my runs and seriously not a big deal, it can be avoided by grinding a couple levels for a little more max hp before you face them which I typically like to do, but I just had to find something to be a devil's advocate about.", "timestamp_created": 1489967311, "timestamp_updated": 1498561484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30624982": {"recommendationid": "30624982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118199386", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2616, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512325819}, "language": "english", "review": "This may be the best early access game I have ever played.

Game play wise, it offers a totally nonlinear experience, where you are free to do what you want, including a \"story quest\" style system. Combat is open-ended as well, with tons of weapon types that are all decidedly different from one another, each synergizing perfectly. Speaking of synergy, this game has mutations! Characters don't just have a role in class when starting- they have superhuman mutations too! These drastically change gameplay: If you have photosynthetic skin, you don't need food, but can't stay underground too long. If you have four arms... you have two more arms to beat people up with. Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone familiar with ASCII games as well as newcomers. \n\nAlso note: The game plays best with a numpad.

It's still early access, so there's some typos here and there, but I have not run into any game-breaking issues in nearly 10 hours.

It may even look like a joke game if you don't understand the deep roots of the genre, but I cannot stop recommending this game. \nCaves of Qud isn't just an homage, living in the shadows of the old Roguelikes.

Having minimalist graphics means Caves of Qud can put all of its resources in to gameplay which supports a very detailed player-driven experience that is simple and relaxing. There are quests, but you're free to roam where ever and do anything.\nThe setting is rich and vivid, and supports those with a deep imagination and a craving for story-telling.

I don't know if I've been duped by some clever trickery, but I've encountered situations that have simply left me dumbfounded (in a good way). If a tough as nails tactical roguelike with incredibly complicated world building and NPC mechanics sounds fun, go ahead and give it a go, you'll definitely enjoy Caves of Qud.\n\nThat being said, I do have one gripe so far.

I don't mind setting up the mappings, and while it would be nice to see controllers officially supported, there are some fundamental control flaws that make a couch-session near impossible (without a wireless numpad). The key bindings are needlessly convoluted on top of an already complicated game. I won't waste the reader's time getting into specifics so I'll just say this:\nThis game doesn't NEED a good 20% of the key bindings. I know the talent of this team could simplify the controls in a sensible manner, and it would make the game significantly more enjoyable.

I really love the setting, mechanics, and even the look of the game. While I think there could be some better diversity in equipment, the unique skills and mutations really make combat feel satisfying no matter what you're using. It reminds me quite a bit of Cataclysm: DDA, but with less focus on survival and more on combat and exploration. There aren't very many quests to do currently, but I hope there will be more to come because the ones already implemented are engaging with interesting locations and enemies. Also, this game got me to read A Canticle for Leibowitz, one of the inspirations for the game's setting, which was a great read- and it made me appreciate the game even more in turn.\n\nThis game has two huge successes which make it special in my eyes. The first is the combat system, which manages to be fairly deep with plenty of moments where you really have to think smart and plan ahead to survive, while also being simple to pick up. There isn't an overabundance of tools at your disposal like in some other roguelikes, just a good number of useful and flexible skills and items, which helps combat keep its flow. The second strength is the setting, which is a bit harder to explain. It's a type of post-apocalyptic environment which is not normally seen in games, where humanity has regressed so severely thousands of years after the initial disaster that even simple batteries are artifacts of an ancient time that an average person might not even recognize. Like I said, it's a bit hard to put it into writing, but it's such an interesting concept that is so clearly present everywhere in the game that it elevates the entire experience.\n\nI give this game a 10.

There's a lot of different options and a ton of fun and viable builds to play with, so you'll have a hard time running out of ways to die horribly. The main thing that sets it apart is the world, which is apparently retrofuturist, but most people will just call it post-apocalyptic and call it a day. There's a lot to do and see out there, but unfortunately most of it is obsfucated behind a pile of purposefully obscure words. Mostly QoC just does it in an attempt to make the world sound as exotic as possible, but there's only so many $5 words one person can handle before you just start glazing over the descriptions.\n\ntl;dr - It's an amazingly good roguelike if you like roguelikes.

Honestly speaking, CoQ is better enjoyed when you have time to sit down and immerse yourself, as opposed to favoring the pick-up-and-play nature of many other roguelikes and roguelites. If that sounds like your cup of tea, definitely give this a shot.\n\nCaves of Qud is a roguelike that brings something fresh to the genre, not in its entirety, but in enough ways that I feel it's worth highlighting if you're tired of the same-old Nethack and ADOM experiences. Your direction is not given through narrative exposition, but rather by talking to people and forming your own understanding of what's going on in the world, with the choice of how best to proceed being left entirely up to you. This particular aspect of the gameplay isn't original, but the setting and lore behind the realm you're thrust into definitely is.\n\nThe style of the game aside, the controls deserve being commented on due to how much they affect the enjoyability of the game. They're a mix of old and new that most RL veterans will appreciate. It's not quite as modernized as something like Tales of Maj'Eyal, but has enough improvements over the retro fare to be appreciable and praise-worthy. The controls may take some getting used to for those new to the genre, but are otherwise standard fare, with some level of customizability allowing for streamlining use of abilities and talents. It's even possible (using Joy2Key) to map most standard actions to a controller and play the game almost entirely through that, which is something that very few true roguelikes allow for. This is just a quality-of-life thing, but it's a huge one, and one that makes CoQ a perfect intermediary even for people looking to dip their toes in the waters of more complex RL titles. In short, the controls are varied enough to require some minor memorization, but simple and intuitive enough that picking up the many controls doesn't take much time at all.\n\nLast, but definitely not least, is the gameplay itself. God damn does this thing deliver on what makes a great roguelike great: options. This may be best expressed by recounting my initial experiences with the game, as compared to my current one:\n\nMy first character was a multi-legged, winged chimera Gunslinger who I intended to be the fastest gunner the game world had ever seen. I took traits to make him faster than almost anything I could run into, gave him the ability to see in the dark, and specced to prep myself for sniping my foes with impunity. He lost his life to thirst, as I had no idea that you could harvest any one of the thousands of vines surrounding the common salt-water pools in the world for an abundant source of fresh water. I made the mistake of using my sole fresh water container to scoop up salt water, intending to attempt to purify it using fire. Not only did that prove not possible (to my knowledge), but I was soon parched and without water to afford... well... water.\n\nLesson learned: Harvest water from watervines, and treat the liquid as an emergency reserve.\n\nMy second character, along with the three or so after him, were all re-attempts of the same initial Gunslinger. This time, I made it to the end of the first 'dungeon', accomplished my mission, and as I was preparing to leave, noticed a massive sleeping mutant Bearling in a corner. I was careful, inspecting it from a distance and assessing that it was far too risky to attempt to wake it. As my luck would have it, a bat in the same room as the Bearling\u2014friendly towards me due to my wings improving my reputation with winged creatures\u2014decided to 'help' me by attacking and waking the hibernating beast. Within the span of two turns, the bat was eviscerated and the bear had charged directly to me, its lunging bite taking me from full life to the game-over screen all at once.\n\nLesson learned: Pay attention not only to Hostile threats, but even to the supposed allies that might cause me trouble indirectly.\n\nIn his next life, my Gunslinger made it much farther along than before, making it to the fourth in-game story location which had me searching an underground complex full of hostile mechs for an important NPC. I noticed an armed turret through a doorway. As I had faced two at once before and survived, I made the mistake of being cocky, thinking I could just walk up to it and melee it to death, as I was low on ammo but too stubborn to retreat to restock. The instant I stepped in the room, I got flashbacks to that one room in Dark Souls 2 with all the ballistas being aimed at the sole entrance; no less than four turrets beeped as they locked onto me. I did the only thing I could, taking a step back to break line of sight, but it was already too late.\n\nLesson learned: Approach all situations with caution unless completely equipped to handle their potential outcomes.\n\nAfter a few games like the ones described above, in most cases involving me resorting to killing things with melee weapons as a range-specialized wandered due the combined factors of a scarcity of ammo and my own terrible aim, I decided to try a psychic character instead. This went much smoother early on, as I was able to blast my enemies away using lasers without worry for ammo or missing my targets. However, I was much more fragile in return for my power. This character did not die to thirst, bear, or turret. He died at the end of the first dungeon, 5XP away from his next level, having attempted to gain this experience by attacking a thorny vine on the wall, becoming stuck on said thorns, and subsequently bleeding to death as he tried in vain to pull himself away while the plant lashed out at him in self-defense. If I had simply used my laser on the plant instead of trying to melee it to death, this particularly humiliating but well-deserved death would never have taken place.\n\nLesson learned: Don't panic. When in danger, stop to consider what tools are available and how best to apply them.\n\nAs it stands, I've learned from my many mistakes, and my current character is doing quite well. This learning experience is a huge part of the game though, as the world will not hesitate to beat the player down at every opportunity presented. My advice to those of you who read about these experiences and were enticed by the prospect of a difficult and punishing game would be to read up on the game before-hand, learn what messages mean what, and equip themselves with the knowledge to see themselves towards a successful completion of CoQ. Avoid spoilers where possible when doing so, but absolutely attempt to find logs of other players' mistakes and their consequences so that you can avoid making them yourself. In my case, this kind of involving experience is exactly what I look for in my roguelike titles, and I whole-heartedly recommend this game for it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1485547039, "timestamp_updated": 1485547039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29526908": {"recommendationid": "29526908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046491083", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 11216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1514204599}, "language": "english", "review": "Not for everyone but very fun once you figure out how to stop dying.", "timestamp_created": 1485546585, "timestamp_updated": 1485546585, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29477556": {"recommendationid": "29477556", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972584572", "num_games_owned": 921, "num_reviews": 186, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487489240}, "language": "english", "review": "Caves of Wonder\n\nCaves of Qud is an old school 80's throwback to ASCII permadeath dungeon crawling rogue-likes of yore. It oozes that retro vibe, but in a 80's Apple 2e roguelike way.  Everything about the presentation is phenominal. The style, the sound design, the music, all the way through to the actual game itself.  Caves of Qud is a rogue-like fan's dream come true.\n\nPros:\n- Style. It feels old school in all the right ways. I absolutley love the aesthetic.\n- World building. The writing is thoughtfully crafted provides a sense of immersion and detail.\n- An open world. In most rogue likes, you are left in a single dungeon and tasked with reaching the bottom. Not here. This game throws you into a complex open world with a variety of locations, settlements, and of course caves.  It really helps build a story and a sense of place.\n- OPTIONS - the big one. A TON of ways to build your character and then so many ways to level them up.  Practically endless possibilities. So much to play with here.\n- Saving. You have to enable it in the menu, but you can play this game with saving. I would advise new players do so as to understand the expectations of the game and get used to it's systems.\n- Steam workshop.\n\nCons:\n- If you dont like ASCII like rogue-likes then this isnt going to help you I dont imagine.\n\nAll in all an EASY recommendation for anyone who likes rogue-like games.

As of the writing of this review, the most recent updates have revamped Long Blades and Axe skill trees, which had drawn the community's ire for being underpowered.  But enough about that, let's get to the game itself.\n\nQud is a post-apocalyptic world rife with technology from the old days just waiting to be discovered.  The game is a good old-fashioned roguelike set in this world, offering tons of character customization.  As in most roguelikes, the action takes place on a grid of tiles, operating by turn-based rules, so the enemy only acts when you do, offering unlimited time to plan your approach.  Many sights and interactions are conveyed entirely through text, thankfully very well-written in Caves of Qud's case.  In fact, it's this writing, the setting itself, that makes CoQ stand apart from the rest of the roguelikes.\n\nFor example, due to the massive amounts of salt covering the planet, fresh water is such a scarcity that it is actually the game's currency!  As in most roguelikes, your character has hunger and thirst to manage, but water weighs quite a lot, and merchants will take it from you if you can't pony up valuable enough goods for a trade.  Do you hoard water to stay healthy, trade it away for that sweet dagger, or get yourself a gold nugget that weighs very little and (unlike other items) always sells for 100% of its value?  It's a balance of risk and reward unlike anything I've ever seen.\n\nAlso, the game's \"faction\" system can ensure even more variability than most roguelikes.  Nearly every sentient race keeps track of your actioins and allies, and responds accordingly.  One notable instance of this is the Machinimists, who revere the ancient artifacts as holy relics, even the lowly folding metal chair.  One quest in the main story involves entering one of their most revered holy grounds.  Most characters will have to fight their way in, but those closely allied with the Machinimists can simply walk in.  And again, it's not just the Machinimists...you may find yourself allied with birds, the Putus Templar, fungi...and your allies will not attack you, or may even help if they see you fighting someone.\n\nThere is a main quest line in the game even in this version, but it's relatively short.  Fortunately, the \"Sultans of Qud\" update added randomly generated history to the game.  With this history of Qud's ancient rulers comes ruins of shrines, arenas, and more dedicated to them.  By studying engravings and statues around the world, you may gain a lead that points you to a historic site, within which a powerful item lies in wait, one wielded by the sultan themselves.  The explorable world is huge, stretching far and wide as well as deep underground.  Even in the game's current state, there's plenty to do.\n\nBut the star of the show here is the customization.  Tons of mutations, powers, skill trees, and equipment ensure that you can play this game however you want.  Be a four-armed porcupine and wield four pistols!  Shoot fire from your mind and electricity from your hands!  Chop off your enemy's face with an axe, then wear it!  Psychically beguile a goat, then proselytize to a lowly farmer, thus traveling with a party of three (who themselves can level up and develop mutations)!  Learn to build and modify machinery, to arm yourself with a stun rod and grenades!  Pull off some sweet angel cosplay with a flaming sword and beautiful wings!  If mutations aren't your thing, staying \"pure\" grants you access to cybernetic implants, including a railgun!  Or attach robotic arms to yourself and put shields on them, and whip out your best Sundowner impersonation!\n\nOverall, Caves of Qud is a fantastic roguelike that compares favorably to even some of the greats of the genre, and this is in its current Early Access form.  Once more quests are added and the game is released proper, be prepared to see this on a lot of people's best-of lists.", "timestamp_created": 1485234288, "timestamp_updated": 1485234288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29439636": {"recommendationid": "29439636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030746271", "num_games_owned": 567, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 2748, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494228611}, "language": "english", "review": "This game isn't early access.\n\nIts an actively developed fully complete extensively featured game and its great.", "timestamp_created": 1485164271, "timestamp_updated": 1485164271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475309", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29437952": {"recommendationid": "29437952", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010828887", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 134, "playtime_forever": 1469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 243, "last_played": 1514609435}, "language": "english", "review": "im not normally the type to pay full price for games but this game is epic as heck. \n1. horror game\n2. cool fighting game\n3. really good sountrack\n4. roguelike\n\nif u like these things u will have a Good Time (like opposite of what sans says in undertale)", "timestamp_created": 1485154745, "timestamp_updated": 1485154745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.353264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29433541": {"recommendationid": "29433541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169224401", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512616111}, "language": "english", "review": "This is definitely one of the best roguelikes out there right now for sure one of the most fun.

The game also offers a host of (completely optional, off by default) debug options, including the ability to disable perma-death if you'd like. This is great for people new to roguelikes in general, and who want to get a stronger grasp on Qud's mechanics and learn its ins-and-outs with some training wheels on.\n\nI generally have a rule with any early access game - to justify a purchase, it has to be worth it if the devs stop updating it as soon as it's added to my cart. Qud absolutely qualifies - the game is wonderful in its current state, and seems to be getting regular updates, which is phenomenal. The dev has also promised to release a road map this year on what we can expect leading up to release, which is a level of transparency I very much appreciate.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this title enough, ESPECIALLY with it still being early access.

I've been following it since the ASCII days and it's absolutely incredible how much has been added. In the interest of transparency, I did receive this game for free to help with beta testing way back, but I've spent more than a few dollars buying this game for friends.\n\nIt plays like a traditional roguelike but instead of a single dungeon, you're given an procedural open world with static quests and towns. The gameplay is hugely varied and tactical from character to character, mostly due to one of the best mutation systems I've ever played. Every type of weapon has it's own pros and cons with a skill tree for each one. The tinkering system lets you craft any technological knickknack you could ever need. From a laser slinging esper who can create temporary, also laser slinging, clones at will, to a four armed turtle swinging four different axes while spewing corrosive gas, to a non mutated true man outfitted with cybernetics tinkering up various deadly energy weapons, you can build just about anything you're in the mood for. \n\nThe aesthetic is one of the best I've seen in any roguelike. There's a CRT screen effect overlayed on the fantastic yet minimal tiles. The writing, believe it or not, is actually one of the games strong suits with vivid descriptions for the various items and enemies you come across and some pretty great dialogue with the npc's you come across. It also has music now, which is generally ambient droning music that does a lot to draw you into the world.\n\nThere's still some jank here and there and some unfinished areas, so it's not perfect, but it gets patched weekly and is regularly receiving massive content updates. I can't recommend this game enough though. If you're a roguelike fan, you owe it to yourself to play this game. \n9/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1484364397, "timestamp_updated": 1484364397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29237960": {"recommendationid": "29237960", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963290101", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484364047}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool game for cool people", "timestamp_created": 1484361760, "timestamp_updated": 1484361760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29233992": {"recommendationid": "29233992", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965273315", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4027, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483838055}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.

You get into a rhythm with the flow of the game, things are going along nicely, you get into a particularly thorny scrap only to survive with little health and a gang of irritable tortoises on your heals.

You can mutate night vision or flaming hands, bring a knife to a gun fight, or become a tinkering archaeologist with penchant for grenades.

You'll find artifacts of the previous civilization hinting at the world they lived in while fighting off mutant hyenamen, cultists who worship the sultans of yore, and horrific wildlife. Each tile of the world map is explorable and contains a nearly infinite dungeon as well as numerous ruins of historical significance potentially containing great treasures. \n\nThe as yet unfinished main storyline will take you from the humble caverns of Red Rock to the cesspits of Golgotha, and eventually to the freezing depths of Bethesda Susa, which is as far as I've been able to survive so far. Even unfinished Qud paints vivid imagery in your mind as you begin to understand how the world functions. The technology of the world stretches from simple swords and shields to powerful cybernetics and energy weapons. \n\nAs far as character building goes, you can choose to be a mutant with a variety of mutations and defects or a true human from one of the last surviving eco-domes. Humans learn skills faster and start with some gear, but mutants grow in power and number of mutations as you level. The mutations you have range from the physical, like extra limbs or a tough carapace, to the purely mental like conjuring forcefields or directly attacking enemies' minds with your own. There's an innumerous variety of builds once you factor in mutations, caste, and background. \n\nCaves of Qud is like if you put ADOM, D___RL, Dwarf Fortress, and Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup in a blender and let the densest juices from each fill your glass.

Roguelikes are all fantastic, but what really sets COQ apart from the rest is the setting. Honestly. Forget orcs and mages and giant spiders. Rather, with COQ, bask in the retrofuturism, mutations & defects, Great Salt Desert and fabled Spindle (rising above the fray, surrounded by banana trees, piercing the cloud-ribboned sky). Learn the lore, and realize that everything and everyone in this world wants to live as badly as you!\n\nIf you aren't sold yet, a recent adventure of mine, if you will:\n\nI was down in some ruins, surrounded by abandoned rooms and half walls, and was suddenly down to 1 HP, battling a snapjaw warlord (and his 9+ minions). I knew I was going to die, so in a last ditch effort to save myself (and defeat as many of the snapjaws as possible), I summoned a space-time vortex (that extinguished everything in its path btw) and stepped in, barely escaping with my life as the snapjaw warlord swung one last time (only to miss). The result?

Your direction is not given through narrative exposition, but rather by talking to people and forming your own understanding of what's going on in the world, with the choice of how best to proceed being left entirely up to you. This particular aspect of the gameplay isn't original, but the setting and lore behind the realm you're thrust into definitely is.\n\nThe game is set in what can be seen as a post-apocalyptic wasteland with mutants, espers, ancient ruins, and a persistent scarcity of water\u2014so scarce, in fact, that it's the default form of currency in the pseudo-barter economy that the whole world has adopted. Honestly speaking, CoQ is better enjoyed when you have time to sit down and immerse yourself, as opposed to favoring the pick-up-and-play nature of many other roguelikes and roguelites. If that sounds like your cup of tea, definitely give this a shot.\n\nThe style of the game aside, the controls deserve being commented on due to how much they affect the enjoyability of the game. They're a mix of old and new that most RL veterans will appreciate. It's not quite as modernized as something like Tales of Maj'Eyal, but has enough improvements over the retro fare to be appreciable and praise-worthy. The controls may take some getting used to for those new to the genre, but are otherwise standard fare, with some level of customizability allowing for streamlining use of abilities and talents. It's even possible (using Joy2Key) to map most standard actions to a controller and play the game almost entirely through that, which is something that very few true roguelikes allow for. This is just a quality-of-life thing, but it's a huge one, and one that makes CoQ a perfect intermediary even for people looking to dip their toes in the waters of more complex RL titles. In short, the controls are varied enough to require some minor memorization, but simple and intuitive enough that picking up the many controls doesn't take much time at all.\n\nLast, but definitely not least, is the gameplay itself. God damn does this thing deliver on what makes a great roguelike great: options. This may be best expressed by recounting my initial experiences with the game, as compared to my current one:\n\n[list]\n[*] My first character was a multi-legged, winged chimera Gunslinger who I intended to be the fastest gunner the game world had ever seen. I took traits to make him faster than almost anything I could run into, gave him the ability to see in the dark, and specced to prep myself for sniping my foes with impunity. He lost his life to thirst, as I had no idea that you could harvest any one of the thousands of vines surrounding the common salt-water pools in the world for an abundant source of fresh water. I made the mistake of using my sole fresh water container to scoop up salt water, intending to attempt to purify it using fire. Not only did that prove not possible (to my knowledge), but I was soon parched and without water to afford... well... water.\n\nLesson learned: Harvest water from watervines, and treat the liquid as an emergency reserve.\n\n[*] My second character, along with the three or so after him, were all re-attempts of the same initial Gunslinger. This time, I made it to the end of the first 'dungeon', accomplished my mission, and as I was preparing to leave, noticed a massive sleeping mutant Bearling in a corner. I was careful, inspecting it from a distance and assessing that it was far too risky to attempt to wake it. As my luck would have it, a bat in the same room as the Bearling\u2014friendly towards me due to my wings improving my reputation with winged creatures\u2014decided to 'help' me by attacking and waking the hibernating beast. Within the span of two turns, the bat was eviscerated and the bear had charged directly to me, its lunging bite taking me from full life to the game-over screen all at once.\n\nLesson learned: Pay attention not only to Hostile threats, but even to the supposed allies that might cause me trouble indirectly.\n\n[*] In his next life, my Gunslinger made it much farther along than before, making it to the fourth in-game story location which had me searching an underground complex full of hostile mechs for an important NPC. I noticed an armed turret through a doorway. As I had faced two at once before and survived, I made the mistake of being cocky, thinking I could just walk up to it and melee it to death, as I was low on ammo but too stubborn to retreat to restock. The instant I stepped in the room, I got flashbacks to that one room in Dark Souls 2 with all the ballistas being aimed at the sole entrance; no less than four turrets beeped as they locked onto me. I did the only thing I could, taking a step back to break line of sight, but it was already too late.\n\nLesson learned: Approach all situations with caution unless completely equipped to handle their potential outcomes.\n\n[*] After a few games like the ones described above, in most cases involving me resorting to killing things with melee weapons as a range-specialized wandered due the combined factors of a scarcity of ammo and my own terrible aim, I decided to try a psychic character instead. This went much smoother early on, as I was able to blast my enemies away using lasers without worry for ammo or missing my targets. However, I was much more fragile in return for my power. This character did not die to thirst, bear, or turret. He died at the end of the first dungeon, 5XP away from his next level, having attempted to gain this experience by attacking a thorny vine on the wall, becoming stuck on said thorns, and subsequently bleeding to death as he tried in vain to pull himself away while the plant lashed out at him in self-defense. If I had simply used my laser on the plant instead of trying to melee it to death, this particularly humiliating but well-deserved death would never have taken place.\n\nLesson learned: Don't panic. When in danger, stop to consider what tools are available and how best to apply them.\n[/list]\n\nAs it stands, I've learned from my many mistakes, and my current character is doing quite well. This learning experience is a huge part of the game though, as the world will not hesitate to beat the player down at every opportunity presented. My advice to those of you who read about these experiences and were enticed by the prospect of a difficult and punishing game would be to read up on the game before-hand, learn what messages mean what, and equip themselves with the knowledge to see themselves towards a successful completion of CoQ. Avoid spoilers where possible when doing so, but absolutely attempt to find logs of other players' mistakes and their consequences so that you can avoid making them yourself. In my case, this kind of involving experience is exactly what I look for in my roguelike titles, and I whole-heartedly recommend this game for it.", "timestamp_created": 1483562462, "timestamp_updated": 1483583240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806012", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29015802": {"recommendationid": "29015802", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977829915", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 8059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512310512}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe the only new traditional, major roguelike created within the last 10 years that has the potential to join the greats.", "timestamp_created": 1483560712, "timestamp_updated": 1483560712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28999130": {"recommendationid": "28999130", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978699196", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500756670}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is an absolute must-own title for fans of the more traditional roguelike games (Nethack, ADOM, Cataclysm DDA, and the like).

So I made a few different characters and started my adventure and got maybe just a few minutes in each time before I was killed. \n\nI really want to like it, especially since everyone else likes it, but I just don't.", "timestamp_created": 1483097089, "timestamp_updated": 1483097089, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.464694", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28783158": {"recommendationid": "28783158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061911641", "num_games_owned": 504, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483000814}, "language": "english", "review": "Now THIS is a rogue-like. You ever find yourself going through the tag, looking at all the crazy stuff people throw the name rogue-like onto? Have you ever PLAYED the original Rogue? If you haven't, I recomend you do that, its a fun little game for the most part. Once you've done that, you probably have a pretty good idea of what Caves of Qud has to offer. At least, in its most basic form.\n\nNow imagine if Adventure Mode of Dwarf Fortress had a baby with a post-apocalyptic fiction author's imagination. Combine that with the original concept of the original Rogue, and you more or less have Caves of Qud.\n\nNow, my first experience with Qud wasn't that great. I couldn't figure out how to do anything. Turns out, I wasn't really trying hard enough. The key mapping is right there in the Esc menu.\n\nSo, Caves of Qud. It's a hard game. Extremely hard? Well, maybe, but definitely hard. It takes a little while to get used to, a little thinking to understand, and a lot of patience and perseverance to really get into the game. It's difficulty will be both a turn on and a turn off, it just depends on who you are as a \"gamer\", and you should know by now what type of games you enjoy, especially if you're looking at a review for a bona fide rogue-like made with ASCII graphics.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing. The setting is amazing. The gameplay is fun and satisfying. The story it tells is interesting. The character creation is detailed and full of interesting ideas. \n\nIn the end, what it all comes down to is this; Do you want a real rogue-like? Do you want to recapture that feeling of exploration and wonder that so many games these days are missing? Do you want to die? A lot? Do you want to be rewarded for your hard work? If the answer to any of these questions was yes, then this is the game for you. If you answered no to any but the second question, you probably shouldnt buy this game.

I haven't played any of the classics except for Tales of Maj'eyal and wouldnt consider myself particularly knoweldgeable about the genre history and so on. With that said I consider Caves of Qud to be one of the, if not, the best game I have purchased and played in 2016.\n\nThe first time I heard about this game was on a forum where it was described as retrofuturistic and inspired by post-post apocalyptic fiction. I was intrigued by talk of sentient plants and also a procedurally generated game with more of a focus on a narrative. My expectations were not only met, but were blown away when I finally decided to play the game. \n\nCaves of Qud is hard to describe. Its often comically stupid, full of crazy situations and at the same time solumn and steeped with a history that is intruging and suprisingly deep. Its a world where not much is explained because to explain it would be convoluted, why does a machingun turret worship a god or why are there mutant hyena people living in something called the rust wells? It is a testament to the vision and world the developers have created that something as absurd as a techno-cyborg-bear can not only exist , but actually feels coherant within the setting. \n\nThe asthetic choices made in the game also really resonated with me and the ascii / pixel art is superb and full of character, helped by an excellent choice of colour pallet. There are also stylistic flourishes that one wouldn't expect in a game with such simple graphics such as floating text highlighting things happening around you and clever ways of giving items in your inventory more character, despite the text based nature (one that comes to mind is discovering a jewel encrusted item with all the characters in its name coloured differently to represent gems). I would say the sound is quite bare-bones at the moment, but the music and sound effects that are present are good, the music in particular is very evocative and used to excellent effect at special locations (specifically the 6th Day Stilt). \n\nAs a game to play CoQ is full of variety, it has a really robust character building system. Essentially you pick between a mutant or a pure-blooded \"True-kin\". The mutants get to pick between 20 or so \"powers\" which could be something like shooting flames from your hands or a physical abberation like having two heads. The true-kin can subdue robots and have slightly better base attributes. Mutants pick a background such as marauder or nomad and then True-kin pick which Arcology they hail from. These serve to augment your stats and give different equipment to begin. Both then pick from many skill trees thoughout the game as they level up. Each game you start in the same village, Joppa, and begin the quest anew. You will die and die often, each time you reincarnate to do it again. The world is static, but aside from some plot critical locations each area is randomly generated each time. Each game is familiar, but always different, every character I have created has been memorable in his own way.\n\nThe game can feel punishingly hard and unforgiving. Deaths can feel cheap and unfair. Sometimes they are, but it is still in early access.  There are some character builds that work incredibly well, some feel like you are just hindering yourself. Some stats feel useless (willpower) and others too strong (Agility). I personally like the unbalanced aspects, but I can imagine somepeople being upset over the death of a long lived character. I have never made it to the end of the game, in fact I have no idea if there is an end as yet. I can't get enough of it regardless. The developers are very communicative and updates happen frequently. I wouldn't have been dissapointed if I had bought this product as a fully released title, its that good. I have no doubt this game will go from stregnth to stregnth as its development continues. I cannot reccommend it enough. \n", "timestamp_created": 1480529803, "timestamp_updated": 1480529803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.746976", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28096056": {"recommendationid": "28096056", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990814415", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1514065607}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]One of the oddest roguelikes out there and it's only growing to be odder.[/h1]\n\nForm the miljeu of the game I have only to say that its a medievalish society set aeons after an end of the advanced civilizations. Were bronze sword wielding barbarians are gunned down by rustcovered walking missile platforms and floating indestructible laser pyramids. Most of the inhabitants of qud care or know of the ancient world as much as you care or know about the history of pre summerian tribes. The world has moved on.\n\nApart of the world map obiviously showing the ruins of an overgrown city on a coast of a long since tried sea, the postapocalyptic elemenst of this world are often unobivious. The remains of old world lurk in the details as an almost sinster force. The call of adventure is carried on ever transmitting signal captured by an weird inventor in the marshlands. The chaotic disase ridden dungeon is filled with coveyor belts, burners and haywire waste mangement robots.  The ice dungeon an cryogenic medical facilty. Magical talking stones hyper advanced computers.  The ancient fortresses remains of once urban constructions, the greates of kings lives in a tower that elevates to the very orbit.\n\nSoon after the tables turn, instead of what you can recognise under all the ther salt, rust and slime it's the unrecogizable that turns eerie. Out on the saltbeds church has been build on gigantic skeleton of what excatly? One of the oldest factions on Qud are conglomerate of sentient plants? Who were the Eaters of the Earth? Why most of the books read as weird streams of consioucness? Nightmarish space demons and chrome angels or degenerate bioweapons and malfuctioning robots? Holy artifact or ray gun?\nWhat occured naturaly and what was once made?\n\n\n[h1]About gameplay[/h1]\n\nNext to Nethack and IVAN this is the roguelike I have played most and to other games in the genere and especialy compared to the Nethack this is much more pleasant to play.\n\nFirst of all: there is option to disable premadeath as well as an option to enable free saving and loading of the game!\n\nMenus operate as you would expect from a proper computer RPG and while they are sometimes when you need to use letters to pick items you want, for most of the time every thing can be handled with numpad, space and enter.\nAs writing of this mouse based interface is being implemented and is already working for the game it self, but not yet for all menu screens.  Personaly I prefer the keyboard controls, here is why:\n\nThe controls are nothing like the usual RL \"command for every leter on the keyboard both lower and upper case\".\nThere is one contex sensitive action key (defaults to space) that automaticly does what ever is most appropriate to do to the cell you stand in or the ones nearby, from talking to opening/closing doors and picking up items or filling your water skin. Spesific keys for all those actions do exists for the rare cases that the contex sensitive action gets confused, but I for example have no clue what the spesific key to start a conversation is and I doubt that I never need to learn that.\n\nAnother quality of life feature is automatic exploration to quickly map out screens. Related to that is the fact when pressing + or - to go up or down stairs the character atuomaticly heads to closest seen stairs, while this doesn't work if the stairs are not on the same screen it still makes returning form your deep earth spelunking trough already cleared out cave levels much faster.\n\nMoving on from controls to gameplay itself, the CoQ has a shortage of Nethacks trademark \"Yet Another Stupid Deaths\".\nThe command look will always tell you how dangerous the creature you are looking at is compared to you and wether or not is aggressive. You can also always see what said creature is equipped with. Even though you might not know what item you are excatly looking at, in a world where \"Unknow artifacts\" wielded by hostile mutants are at best grenades and rocket launchers at worst, you know to be cautious.\n\nCorpses do not rot and very few have any effects other than their varying nutritional value.\nLike wise there are no 'cursed' items even when items have negative efffects they are told on the items description.\nFidling with an unknow artifact with an character who has a low inteligence will at worst break the said item, meaning that you have to pay for tinker to get it repaired and identified.\n\nThere are diseases and infections you can catch and neither are trivial to get rid off. The cures are randomly genereated per character and may cause you some trouble. Though you never know, you may actualy be better off with your new spreading mushroom symbiote infection pals than you were alone.\n\nThere are two ways to gain followers one reguires a spesific mental beguiling mutation and other an ability to proselytize, both also need a character with a high ego score. Both methods are limited to one follower so two at max (barring some strange later game occurences like clones). So team based rpg this is not.\n\nCombat is straight forward and rather simple.\nUse melee, abilities, fire arms, mutations, throwing weapons and sprint away if your opponent hits harder than you. Effects like stun, bleed and dismemberment of limbs are spesific skills and often limited to certain types of weapons (short blades, long blades, axes and cudgels). Weapons differ with their armor piercing and damage roll numbers, bonus changes to said bleed and dismemberment chances and rarely with extra damage as burning, freezing or electrocuting.\nSo fancy damage simulations and injury systems this game doesn't have either.\n\nUnusualy for RLs Caves of Qud models temperatures much better than you would even notice at first glance. Any ongoing fires rise the ambient temperature and spamming pyrokinesis and or spraying all over with flamethrower you will son find out that everything in game has an iginition temperature and in worst case scenario an accidently ignited pond of asphalt will skyrocket the ambient temperature causing everything on screen to burst in flames. Hot steam from boiling water has to be one of the most humilating ways to die in this game.\nHaving a go playing with a mutant build with both cryokinesis and pyrokinesis mutations allows you to get most out of this simulation.\n\nTypical for roguelike games, there is much to do in game and trying out different character builds and mutations will keep you interested for a long time.\n\nThat said the game is still a work in progress. Main quest isn't finished yet and side quests are rather few.\nThe updates have been weekly ever since from the steam release. If you are interested at it's very much good to buy in it's current state with no gratingly missing features or bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1480506679, "timestamp_updated": 1480506712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28090336": {"recommendationid": "28090336", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966628265", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508394027}, "language": "english", "review": "Best $9.99 I've ever spent on a game. 85 gameplay hours and counting.\n\nReasons I like game in order of personal preference:\n1.)

Cannot really recommend this. Which is a surprise, to myself.\n\nI've played a good deal of MUDs and Rogue-likes (actual Rogue-likes, as in not just procedural/random generation and permadeath games), lately I've spent an embarrassing amount of time playing Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (Which is free, by the way!). I've also played NetHack, and an assortment of other similar games. And I find them thoroughly compelling.\n\nAnd this was just not very compelling. Does it look slightly fancier? Sure, yes. The animated sprites intermixed with the \"tiles\" does look genuinely neat - I applaud that. I'm not stuck-up about \"Rogue-aesthetics\". Turning off the tiles for an \"ascii mode\" is silly and looks bad, this is not a terminal window, and it shows. But that's not really a problem, just leave the tiles on.\n\n\nHowever, the actual interface is .... Well, it's a lot of not-good.\n\n[olist]\n[*]The interface is massive in scale. Huge. Enormous. Galactic. It covers, literally, a third of the screen. Even at 2560x1440 screen res. And it OVERLAYS the game world! It doesn't off-set it, or attempts to scale the world window in any way, no, 1/3rd of the world is at all times covered by a massive UI unless you hide the UI.. And now you have no UI! Wow. I thought we figured this out 2 decades ago? Especially now in the world of non-Square aspect ratio displays! You have room for a side-bar plus a perfectly square game world, it's perfect! Use it!\n[*]The text log is also massive, and it's so massive that it becomes unreadable. A mere 2 or 3 events taking place, even if each event is only 4 or 5 words long, forces it to split the sentence and scroll, making you miss a majority of what actually happened, not to mention having no sense of flow of events (you can't, at a glance, see a few turns into the past... Often you cannot even see ONE turn into the past!). Although there is a smaller text log too in another corner, but it's so inconspicuous that I didn't even see it for an hour. And then I promptly forgot about it again. Also, that hardly solves the problem, I don't want two text logs on my screen, taking up even MORE of that screen space.\n[*]The interfaces that you use the most, such as inventory and other screens, are OK to navigate, with very Roguelike hotkeys as well as Numpad navigation which is always groovy to see, but they are, again, absolutely massive in scale. Very few menu items fit per screen, and on my 1440p screen, a single letter is literally larger than my thumb. You could fit every interface panel in the game on 1 screen if scaled to a sensible size... Obviously not true for smaller screens, and not a practical solution, but seriously, goddamn, the UI is so large. It's humongous. Vast. Gigantic. Colossal. It is, in fact, super-colossal.\n[/olist]\n\nSo, the user interface aside, and I have to point out that it's quite hard to do worse, UI-wise, than a terminal-based Roguelike. Even games that have it down to a T, like Cataclysm DDA, are sorta clumsy and unintuitive. This is worse. Despite being a Unity game, not a literal Windows CMD or linux Terminal window.\n\n\nAlright, so what about the game? I don't know about the game... I could not give it an honest try. In a game like this, the user interface IS the game, to a large extent. I don't doubt that it can generate interesting worlds and all that jazz. But it's too clunky, and feels too ... flat? Not flat in terms of elevation, just ... flat in terms of character. The fake scan-lines are cute for about 10 seconds, but says a lot about the intent of the game - the intent is to [i]pretend to be[/i] a terminal-type oldschool game (by the way, no PC monitor ever had scanlines like that, ever. I owned many - they're clear and clean like an LCD).  It does a lot to force this upon the player - it beats you over the head with a giant club, saying I AM SO RETRO WOW HAVE YOU NOTICED IT YET SO RETRO.\n\nThat's funny sometimes, and some games take the whole \"play pretend retro\" theme and run with it, and succeed gloriously at it, or for that matter some games just choose to go very low-fi because they wish to, because they like to, because it lets them focus on other things, and it's fine. But here, there's just nothing to back that up. It's just a generic Roguelike (nothing wrong with that), trying to .. pretend.. like.. it's a generic roguelike? Like, I don't even.... There's some disconnect somewhere. Do tiles, or don't. Don't make tiles made out of ASCII characters. Yeah, sure, they can be minimalist and tile-esque, that's cute, I liked that part, but please, skip the silly parts. Make it a -good- minimalist theme instead, people will have much fonder memories of that.\n\nAnyhow. I found this a frustrating experience. I'll go back to CDDA or NetHack or any other of the dozens of very well made, and free (not that I care, particularly), Rogue-Likes around.\n\n\n\n[h1]Now, for those who enjoy ranting and philosophical ramblings:[/h1]\n\n\nI wished it had been a better experience.\n\nBecause; we need these games to exist in a more commercial sense - we need them on Steam, we need them to be developed by paid and excited full-time developers, so that the genre remains healthy and heck even allow the genre to advance in some areas, because there's room for that. Cataclysm is proving it with a incomprehensibly advanced world simulation, Dwarf Fortress is proving that you can generate amazing and complex and deep worlds... NetHack is being the conservative master of the classic, it does classic better than classic itself. So clearly, there's plenty to sink your teeth into if you're making a real Rogue-like in 2016 (or whatever year). Maybe Caves of Qud wanted to be the Roguelike that improved the user experience by NOT being a terminal-type game, by having a more understandable and friendly UI. But this isn't it. It's made in Unity, so clearly they can do this. In fact, as a Unity developer myself, it's evident that the amount of work put into TRYING TO BE a terminal application, must have been quite significant - rather than making an original, thought-out and friendly UI.\n\n\nI hope this does well, and I hope I'm just a stingy old fart who can't appreciate it. Best wishes to the developers, I hope you find your niche and that the game works out. I hope you can finish your game, we sorely need a Roguelike that is actually complete, rather than stuck in Pre-Alpha/Alpha for the rest of our natural lives.

It's obvious that the development team knows and cares about what makes a roguelike great. The controls are rational, but you can remap them if you need to.

It has a steep learning curve and is often very obtuse; for instance, finding out that you need to buy the Corpus Choliys from Mayor Nuntu in Kyakukya to cure diseases is not mentioned in the game text or dialogs. And then following the instructions to cure said disease can require further delving into forums and message boards.\n\nBut for all its frustration, CoQ is a very enjoyable game that keeps pulling me back. The character creation options are very broad, and the interaction of various mechanics in the game is rich and varied. The game is very much in Early Access still, there is a memory leak that pops up warnings to save and restart the game from time to time, and the main quest is not fully implemented yet. Some people have reported that patches have made their old saves unusable, although that hasn't happened to me yet.\n\nBut if you can forgive its flaws and rough edges, the charm of the game outweighs its detractions. If you don't like old-school RPGs like Wasteland, the early Ultimas (I-V) or other roguelikes like ADOM, URR, C:DDA, Dwarf Fortress, you probably won't be converted by CoQ.

It fits the classic roguelike style in a lot of ways, but it definitely has it's own feel. The early game difficulty seems to vary, but I hear it gets extremely hard later on.\n\nI have no idea how it would be received by a non roguelike player, as I've been playing ascii roguelikes for years, but the controls and menus are definitely more stream-lined than dcss/adom/etc. It's EA, so a lot of these elements are still being worked on and improved.\n\n--------------------------\n\nFor roguelike players, I really feel like this game truly has a unique feel, so it's hard to explain. I'll try to relate examples I'm familiar with that express the 'feel' of the game.\n\nIt has the big open overmap style of ADOM, where you can really go wherever you want (and probably die). From the big overmap squares you can 'enter' the ground level and travel in normal turns. It's far from complicated Nethack in gameplay, but it's not quite as simplified as DCSS.\n\nThere are a lot of interactions, here's a fairly strong example; you have containers you use for carrying water for drinking and trading. But there are other uses, if you are on fire, you can pour water on yourself to put it out, you can make puddles on the ground, drop bloody weapons into them to wash it off. You can gather pretty much any liquid, afaik, including slime, tar, and use it as a (fairly ineffective, in my experience :p) trap. You can even gather blood, for whatever reason. All of these fluids you can pour on the ground, you can drink them and see what happens, you can pour them on yourself. There's a lot of fun experimenting. But I wouldn't say the item interactions are to the complex level of Nethack.\n\nMost of the time when you are actually exploring the world or dungeons, it's more about you using your skills and mutations effectively, or running/using consumables when you're in over your head. But you won't have huge stacks of teleport scrolls or haste potions or anything like that. It's pretty common to see a really strong monster even when you're just lvl 2. You will need to use the sprint skill. Your build and play style is heavily dependant on your mutations/skills. Character building is huge. So far I haven't found any 'get out of jail free card's, like ?tele, in this game (besides the all powerful sprint skill, and some really powerful mental mutations).\n\nBecause of the fact that there's no 'clock', you are free to progress as fast as you want. Food and water is easy to get.\n\nThere's no cursed items, and the ID game is for a subset of items called artifacts (that end up being various things, like grenades, chairs, weapons) and consists of paying someone to ID it for you, or getting the intelligence/skills to id them yourself.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThe free, outdated ascii version gives a bit of insight as to whether you might like the game, but the steam version has come a very long way; I didn't get hooked on the older version nearly as much as I have the new one.\n\nIt's EA. So far, I found one bug that caused me to lose data until my last save (that was promptly fixed about twenty minutes later, but still, save often, and turn on the auto save option). I've been having a very complete and really fun experience so far. The price is also really amazing for even the current level of content. I don't expect to make it far enough to see, but the main quest is unfinished. And there are other big upcoming changes, such as more content in the very early game (which you're likely to be seeing a lot of), and eventually different starts. I heard complaints about losing saves, but apparently you can just roll back to the last version thru steam and the save should still be there.

The setting is a post-apocalyptic world that has both sci-fi and fantasy.  True-kin humans and mutated humans are the playable races, and each race has a variety of classes they can pick from.  Mutated humans differ greatly in that they can choose from various mutations, as well as empower the ones you start with, or choose new ones later through use of mutation points.  I like the graphics very much, as minimal as they are.  They're further enhanced by a wealth of descriptions and use of ansi color on items to give it a MUD-like feel, which is something I'm quite fond of in games, albeit rarely used outside of text MUDs themselves.  This is what I'd call a real roguelike, up there with ToME / Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup/ ADoM/etc.  It is hard and quite unforgiving, but you can also run across some very lucky item caches quite early.

One of the best roguelikes I've ever had the pleasure of playing - I have endless entertaining stories from this game, from the time I knife-fought a bear and won, to the time I set the horrifying Slog on fire and shot lasers from my eyes until he died! (And oh so many amusing deaths, such as the time I was flying over a river, fell into it, and was eaten by madpoles. It's one of those games, see!)\n\nBefore I can recommend it, however, I must offer a few caveats: first, most importantly, the learning curve is high for those who aren't used to roguelikes. The GUI is entirely keyboard driven, and having a numpad is highly recommended. There are handy dandy references on display - hit F1, read the quickstart - but you will need to actually read for a little before you're off and running.\n\nSecond, character creation will be intimidating when you first run into it. There are so many interesting mutations to take, and so many True Kin classes - don't panic. Pick whatever sounds cool, and marvel at the choices. Take a lot of Toughness, grab freezing hands or light manipulaton, get yourself into the game.\n\nThirdly, it's still in Early Access. There is a lot of content - there is so much content the devs could stop developing it today (and I'd weep!) but it would still be a full game in its own right, capable of entertaining for hours. The skinny: the main quest line is unfinished. As far as I know, it's roughly halfway done? But: it's difficult and long already, and unless you're really good at roguelikes you won't get to the end of what's in already. (And it will tell you when you hit the end for now.) (Note: the devs are updating it weekly! They revamped caves just recently, and there's even more stuff in the pipeline that hits every friday.)\n\nSo, with those caveats in mind, you might be asking - why would I rec this? The answer is: once you learn the ropes and get going, it's one of the best roguelikes out there, and quite possibly the king of the exploratory genre of roguelikes. Caves of Qud is well-written (flavor text abounds!) and has a lovely tileset, and poking around in its jungles and deserts and caves leads to all kinds of fun. There are bears you can talk to in this game, and even bigger, deadlier bears with jetpacks you can die to, for example. There are also actual books in there, Elder Scrolls-style with multiple pages of in-game lore, and those are honestly more exciting to me than the rest of the game, but I'm a lore hound, and I digress.\n\nOnce you've poked around the starting town and assigned hotkeys for your numerous abilities, you'll use the world map to either go north to Red Rock or east to the Rust Wells, and there you'll fight in traditional roguelike style - bump against the monster to harm it, on a turn-by-turn basis. Or use your mutant abilities to harm things from afar, or get the multiple arms mutation to dual wield greatswords against your foes. Invest in axes, dismember the limbs of your foes! There are so many interesting options, and the mutations interact in interesting ways as you fight through these distinct areas to get loot and - more importantly - more food and water. Water is the game's currency, and you need both it and food to live. It's a survival sim, in that respect, and you should be careful that you don't go into the desert without food, because you will run out and die of starvation.\n\nSlowly you'll learn where the dangers are - use the look command always to assess your enemies - and you'll learn when to run, or use the big guns in your arsenal. Slowly, you'll forge your way to Grit Gate, and Golgotha, and beyond.\n\nAnd you'll die.

Sacrifice graphics and design for an awesome gameplay (unless if you are fan of retro), Since I have played a game like this, controls are easy to learn for me but I guess it would be complex to others. What's new to me is the splitting of areas (sadly you can't shoot enemeis offscreen) and the map movement (whatever it is called but I would call it \"fast travel\"). The wayfaring concept is great too. As for the setting, the concept of technological reset (I'm not sure) is great, just like Adventure Time, except the fact that creatures are able to salvage few technologies and use it at their disposal. The tinkering is promising. Let's just say that it's hard to survive with a tinker build that even snapjaws can kill you (in my opinion). The mutations are great too, but I hope there is a natural means of getting mutation (for those who uses the true kin character build) and more negative mutations (naturally acquireable one too! The good thing is that the story is linear, and the bad thing is that the story is linear. I mean, randomized game with same quests and map, why? Randomized game with same quests and map, why not?\n\nAlthough, it would be better if the map is randomized (the starting point would have the same name but different position) and the village at the desert! It would be better if the sellers there can restock their items (dromad trader on field too if possible) so that I would hesitate to kill the sellers. Oh and also the wristblades! They give me nostalgia from certain game/s. Could you make them less rare? I was lucky to get one from a jeweler (he won't give it to me so I ended up with fatal negotiations).\n\nWhat disappoints me is the faction concept, it would be nice if even the smallest bit rank of creature in a faction affects your reputation. Only the influential ones do so. I've been wondering with the Schrodinger Annals, so basically, your character is lying about something worth praising but didn't actually happen. And how did the Annals instantly spread news like fire to the faction you helped to (lied to). It would be nice if reputation from annals increase over time only like for every day +10 reputation until it reaches a certain amount. Not that I hate it, but you shouldn't be able to face the Mechanimist Head Preacher (lest you want to die) inside the cathedral after killing tons of Mechanimist pilgrims and preacher near the vacinity.\n\nAlso, at the Barumithe-or-whatever conclave, you could buy its Recoiler with a energy cell at the same price as those without (sorry if I exploited it), it would be nice if it is fixed.\n\nDied countless times, one from falling.

Buy it if you're into character creation.\n\nCaves of Qud is a rogue-like RPG, but where it really shines is character creation and experimentation. The idea is that you're set in a world so far into the future that everything is unrecognizeable. The range of abilities you can have is very extensive, though hindered slightly by the constant death. If you're not into restarting the entire game every time you accidentally die, I highly recommend you turn off permadeath.\n\nThat being said, I get the feeling that Qud is meant to be extremely deep. It wants to be a deep and complex world teeming with politics and people. However, because of the permadeath, I think there's a strong need for the development to be focused on the \"wide\" aspect rather than the \"deep\" aspect. The story (as far as I know) isn't completely finished, and while the new features are very helpful and fun, there is very little attention given to the later stages of the game.\n\nThe game is still very fun though.\n\nPros:\n-Faction system makes certain creatures friendly while others might hate you\n-Very interesting world with unique lore\n-In-depth character creation that makes it exciting to experiment\n-Memorable story\n\nCons:\n-Unfinished story\n-Mouse input is very limited\n-At times, the world feels too random\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game.

While most people think wizards and dragons when they hear the term roguelike, CoQ instead brings the world to a post-apocalyptic setting somewhere on the planet earth. \n\nAt this point in the distant future, much of the land is a vast salt-desert, interspersed with jungles, mountains and more. The remaining humans and mutants (and even weirder creatures) struggle to survive, traversing the brutal heat and unforgiving landscape with the hope that maybe this settlement will last. Water is the currency of choice; with so much of the land arid, clean water is rare and since life depends on it, unbelivably precious as well. Yet beings have survived and thrived, and the game presents a huge amount of lore in various forms to reflect this. \nAlongside the history is the present, with all the fracturing of groups and the different factions that result from a collapse of modern society. Species hate other species, religions hate other religions, and sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend. CoQ has a layered faction system, where the player's actions (and even equipment) can change their standing in the eyes of the denizens of the world.\nAnd with the amount of character customization, your choices will have an impact. From the true humans, non-mutants of various castes and professions, to the mutants, with the huge amount of physical and mental positive and negative mutations, the game can be approached in a vast amount of ways. The specifics are covered elsewhere, but know that builds can go from traditional gunslingers to four-armed, two heart furry ape-like creatures that leak slime and occasionally warp in and out of existence. It's even possible to be hunted by an evil, alternate-dimension version of yourself.\n\nWhat makes Caves of Qud so engrossing and keeps it from collapsing under the weight of the huge amount of features is the streamlining of the classic roguelike experience, especially in regards to the UI. Things just make sense. Very rarely will the game fight against the player, instead they're allowed to lose themselves in the world of Qud. This is even apparent in the graphics; light is cast and blocked by different things, smoke curls and acid spreads, and water will splash as the player runs through. \nThe game now offers tiles, though I'm personally a fan of the ASCII setting after playing it for so long. That doesn't mean the tiles are bad though; in fact it's quite the opposite. Items and enemies are easy to identify, there are various settings to tweak how it looks, and even a fair amount of performance options for players on older computers. It even has music slowly being added, though no sound effects currently. It also supports user mods, for the players who want to add their own changes to the game.\n\n\n\nA final note: Caves of Qud is definitely following the footsteps of traditional roguelikes. The term has been diluted to mean permadeath and maybe randomly generated dungeons, so you can end up with a realtime side scrolling platformer with permadeath being labeled \"roguelike\". This is not one of those. It's turn-based, requires lots of reading, much trial and error to learn the mechanics, and is meant to be played on a keyboard. It does greatly expand on quite a few of the roguelike traditions, but still keeps the core gameplay of one.", "timestamp_created": 1453926617, "timestamp_updated": 1453926617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20741860": {"recommendationid": "20741860", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008531367", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499293733}, "language": "english", "review": "You will not regret buying this game.", "timestamp_created": 1453703786, "timestamp_updated": 1453703786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505747", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20736248": {"recommendationid": "20736248", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985432603", "num_games_owned": 368, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507135289}, "language": "english", "review": "Tried to get away from Qud.

I'm talking NetHack, ADOM, Dungeon Crawl, any of the games that started life as a nigh-incomprehensible block of ASCII characters. Old roguelikes were big on randomization but low on approachability, requiring you to know all sorts of interactions and tricks and symbols just to avoid dying to a bird or something. Caves of Qud plays like a classic roguelike that prioritizes fun over tricks, and does so with a unique setting and sense of style.\n\nCharacter creation is a major highlight in Qud, allowing you to pick more than just attributes and a class (though even the classes are extremely interesting and varied). Being a post-apocalyptic sci-fi sort of game, you get to be a mutant if you want (yes, you want) and pick special powers from a hefty list of dozens. There's everything from telepathy and night vision to multiple limbs, flight, temporal clones, and mind crushing. These powers are on pretty generous cooldowns, and give you a wealth of tactical options in the game that a lot of roguelikes don't offer. My current best is a four-armed spastic teleporting rogue-thing that can emit sleeping gas or EMPs in emergencies, and I love him to the bits he will eventually be.\n\nOnce your character is made, you get dropped in the little town of Joppa with some intro quests to do and houses to loot. The quests in Qud give some much-needed direction, as the world is quite wide-open and there's plenty of places to get lost and die in. Dungeons are varied between caves, ruins, and higher-tech locales, and you can indeed get lost in the jungles and canyons between them. These places are populated with a colorful cast of creatures including rust crabs, goat men, and sentient ooze. The simple graphics are clear enough to distinguish the people and critters you encounter, and a very helpful Look function gives you all the information you need to know about approaching something new.\n\nIf it seems like I'm gushing about Qud, it's because I've never played a roguelike with so much depth and discovery that, at the same time, has so many user-friendly features. The menus are dense and busy but display everything you need to know in sensible order and with useful icons and colors. Item, skill, and attribute descriptions leave nothing to the imagination, so you'll never be left wondering where you should spend your points. And the quests really are fantastic signposts for the game, giving you more to do than the simple \"descend and find the doodad\" premises of the classic roguelikes.\n\nIt's not a perfect package, of course. If you've never played a classic-style roguelike there's going to be a significant learning curve, both to the interface and combat. You'll generally have enough tools to get yourself out of bad situations but learning how they work is going to take some experimentation, and it'll often be fatal. The activity log that explains what actions are being taken each turn is also too compressed to be terribly useful, and hopefully it'll be expanded into something easier to parse. There's no sound or music yet either, which makes it a good game to play while listening to music or podcasts but doesn't do any favors in terms of immersion.\n\nThese are all minor quibbles, and ones that will most likely be addressed during Early Access. Caves of Qud is already a rich and deep enough package to lose yourself in for hours on end, with plenty to see and do and try and die to and try again. It may take you some time to come to grips with the old-fashioned displays and interfaces, but the effort is well worth it.

I've actually played a few old-school roguelikes before going to Caves of Qud and in all of them, I felt that a graphical update would improve the gameplay, but Caves of Qud is the first ASCII-roguelike I've ever played where I felt that the graphics did not need an update.\n\nThe reason for this is that it shares a huge similarity with older roguelikes in that much of the equipment needs to be identified before you know what it is, but there is a major difference in that when said equipment actually is identified, it immediately becomes apparent that any graphical representation whatsoever would have made it obvious what said object really is to the player. For example, the carbine, a very powerful mid-game rifle. Before identification, the description says, \"A strange artifact\" but afterwards, it says \"A composite carbine with a banana-shaped magazine.\" If anyone here can make a Fallout game where the average joe could not understand what an assault rifle is without giving the player an unfair and/or non-immersive advantage in identifying it, I would love to see it.\n\nThere's also the fact that the lack of linearity and graphical fidelity, and yes, I did just say graphical fidelity, gives you more freedom and better immersion as well as lowering frustation. Very, very few ASCII roguelikes actually have blood splattering on the ground and on many occasions, death can really just creep up on you for no reason. In fact, these graphics hold a special place in my heart for actually being very unnerving in one specific instance, WITH NUMBERS AND LETTERS!!! There's also a major advantage in that if you run into an enemy that you can't fight, you not only get a clear indication of that, you also get options. There are actually other places to grind for XP, which can not be said of most other roguelikes and if a really dangerous enemy won't let up, there are numerous escape options. There is no telling how many times Warden Indrix has saved my characters' life.\n\nAnother major difference is how character-building is based less on power-gaming and more on building a character that suits you. Character building for True Men is bog standard but the system really comes alive with mutants. There are various Mental Mutations that give you a great sense of power and Physical Mutations that make your character more likely to end up on DeviantArt. I wish I were kidding, it takes only one mutation point to make your character a f***ing furry. Given that I main as a character with Heightened Hearing, Night Vision, Thick Fur, and has four arms, four legs, and two heads (as well as being amphibious), seeing him as some kind of froggy cattaur with double arms and heads would only be natural.\n\nLastly, identifying objects is based a lot more on skill and a lot less on luck. On many of the older ASCII roguelikes, dying without knowing what half of your equipment does is just part of the experience and there are many occasions where you can find out that your unidentified equipment could have saved your life. In CoQ however, there is no equipment that is necessary for straightforward identification and no need for sneaksy little tricks for said identification that often left me with 2 dozen tabs open in Firefox just to not be lost. I can not stress the importance of the \"Examine\" feature enough, it separates this game from all of its peers. Even then, it's not overpowered, you can't \"Examine\" equipment in merchants' inventories and without the right skillset, \"Examine\"ing something stands a good chance of breaking it. This can lead to some moments where you really have to gamble on getting something powerful or practically useless to you.\n\nFinal Verdict: 10/10 Would accidentally blow most of my fresh water reserves on a box of crayons again.", "timestamp_created": 1451098416, "timestamp_updated": 1451098416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19854533": {"recommendationid": "19854533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063611184", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506402073}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well done.

Most of the complaints in the original review below below have been addressed.\n\n-------\n\nAs someone who plays a lot of Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, I came to this game with high expectations. There is a lot of depth of gameplay here, but you're constantly fighting against the User Interface and the way the map works more than the monsters themselves.\n\nYou will constantly find yourself bumping into walls you can't see because rather than keeping the game world centered on the player, you're going from screen to screen. It feels very clunky and it constantly takes me out of the experience. There is a giant box of information to one side of the screen that blocks a huge portion of the map, but for how big it is, it really doesn't tell you a whole lot.\n\nAnother annoyance is the auto-explore AI. It is extremely poor. It skips over items you have on auto-pickup, and it's constantly getting stuck on nothing when the screen is nowhere near fully explored.\n\nThe game also seemed to discourage exploring too deep into any given cave - there are dead ends everywhere, and no easy way to backtrack like in most roguelikes. I was very disappointed that there didn't seem to be any way to get back to the surface other than the way I came, forcing me to try to retrace my steps over an hour and a half.\n\nAnother issue I had with the game is the performance - you would think such a simple looking game would run smooth as silk, but this game has to stop and think an awful lot. I didn't get far into the game and the files it generated on my computer total up to 385MB - 60MB for the save file, 60MB for a backup of that save file, and an enormous amount of cache. Like many early access titles, this game really needs some optimization done to it, but it's just surprising to see it from a game like this.\n\nI feel like the entire engine needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, getting rid of the per-screen nonsense and keeping the world centered on the player, and with a much better User Interface.

However, it is not quite ready for a consumer audience and is quirky enough that it would turn a lot of people off.  I'm writing this \"negative\" review so that you can understand its shortcomings before buying it.\n\nCaves of Qud is actively in development, with all that entails.  By \"development\" I do not mean \"polish\".  There are almost daily updates which sometimes break old savegames.  Mob combat AI is still getting major improvements, items are still being added, large balance changes are made regularly.  The main quest is not finished, some major locations (the kind you can see from the world map) are not finished, and some of the few named unique NPCs have no dialogue.\n\nThis is a true early access game, not a beta.  If you are passionate about roguelikes and/or science fiction to the extent that you'd like to help develop the game by finding bugs through hilarious death, you might want in on this.\n\nBeyond its incomplete status, this game is a roguelike.  By genre convention it lacks a great many of the conveniences most gamers are accustomed to.  Input is keyboard-only.  The default keybinds for laptop are both horrible and incomprehensible.  Permadeath is on by default and the disable-permadeath option is somewhat cryptically hidden.  Many enemies can and will destroy you even in starter zones and a \"fair fight\" is a myth.  You will not always get warnings when steering your character towards certain death.  You will have absurd runs of bad luck that are not your fault and you will die of them.  CoQ makes excellent use of its tile art system, but it's not what most modern gamers will expect.\n\nIf you are not comfortable reading books at least a chapter at a time, you will probably not be comfortable playing.  If you cannot occasionally relinquish control and adapt to chance circumstances, you will find this game infuriating.  If you cannot sometimes let go of a good thing, this game might break your heart when your character dies.\n\nThis game, overall, has a high barrier to entry.  If you overcome it, though, the world beyond is rich and lovely, as a hundred other reviews will attest.\n\nCaves of Qud is a lovely roguelike with beautiful tile art, a piece of far-future fiction that sci fi fans will immensely enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1440838982, "timestamp_updated": 1440838982, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 245, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762560", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17728007": {"recommendationid": "17728007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037044572", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 2586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500679009}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "This roguelike is one of the best I have ever played, standing along Tales of Maj'Eyal, another beast of a game (still trying to tame that one!). Perhaps the purest roguelike on the entire Steam Store and that is a good thing.  \n\nYou should buy because:\n\n-If you are a fan of roguelikes, you will have plenty to sink your teeth with this one. Multiple player character combinations with several mutations for you to try out and eventually, to find the combination you are more confortable with plus the amazing quests that later in the game will show you how the people behind this know how to make things more interesting than the old Fetch n' Exterminate formula.\n\n-You have two main classes: Mutated Human and True Kin. But of course, if you are like me, you will go where the fun is and pick the Mutated Human from where you can choose from dozens of Physical and Mental mutations from 2 extra arms and poison stinged tails to Pyrokinesis and Teleportation.\n\n-The Tinkering (Crafting) mechanic allows you to collect several different types of bits from trash piles and other advanced devices and combine them into weapons and other useful items (given that you have the recipes). If you are a sucker for that sort of thing, then by all means, please consider this.\n\nWhat you should watch out for:\n\n-Although the game is moslty silent, there are sound effects for when you step on liquids and some ambient music kicks in at seemingly random moments of the game. It's a great game to play while listening to a podcast in my opinon.\n\n-As this is in early access, the game is being constantly updated and from time to time, a certain update comes out that may render your saves from a previous version as invalid. Unless you switch to a previous branch that the developer made available to these specific cases, you will have to start again from scratch which is kind of a bummer if you have dedicated a lot of tie to your saves.\n\nEverytime you start a game, you do it on the same location, with the same quests. The worl is free to explore, but it turns the game a bit repetitive and adds a bit to the frustration if you were quite advance on a previous life.\n\n-The game is NOT COMPLETELY RANDOMLY-GENERATED.

Even the best hunters in Kyakukya would talk about them as merciless killing machines.\n\nThe thing looked as mean as they said. Rows of jagged teeth flashed between frantic snapping as it splashed about. I watched from the banks of the river a few feet away, peering down my carbine's scope to get a closer look. It was ugly.\n\nI pulled the trigger; the madpole tried to flee, but another pull and the water turned red around its corpse. Three more madpoles swam over. I shot another and they scattered. I emptied my carbine, reloaded, and saw that only one was still moving.\n\nFeeling sporting, I shouldered my rifle and drew my daggers. I waded into the river and charged the last madpole, landing both blades in either side.\n\nYou can imagine my surprise when this madpole ignored the blades I planted, latched onto my shell, and I could feel its teeth through my carapace. The very same carapace had, just last moon, merely sizzled as laser fire hit me.\n\nEven more surprising was watching my right arm come off in the madpole's mouth, then fall into the water as the madpole took another attempt at ripping my shell from my body.\n\nI stabbed as hard as I could with my remaining arm to try to dislodge the madpole. This worked, in a way; the madpole released in order to gnaw at my feet, shearing them off with such speed that my terror obscured my pain. My remaining forearm was taken off at the elbow.\n\nRolling myself onto the bank of the river, the madpole released me to fall back into the water lest he suffocate on land. I rummaged through my now thoroughly-bloody pack with a stump and my face; I found it: My last shot of Ubernostrum.\n\nHeld in my teeth, I shot my bicep-stump full of superdrugs and watched as my arm sprouted back, as painfully as it did quickly.\n\nI dug out my revolver, shot the remaining madpole to death, and collapsed.

It's currently in Early Access, but I've already gotten a lot of hours of enjoyment out of the beta. It has a lot to offer for those who enjoy exploratory dungeon crawling, tense strategic situations, varied playstyles, and a good deal of mystery in their games. Here are some of the highlights, in my opinion:\n\nCharacter creation: Your character can be created with a huge number of physical and mental mutations, and gain more as you level up. These act as your spells and passive bonuses, and come in a really wide variety of forms. Physically control your adrenal glands for a quick boost of speed in combat, release an EMP to disable enemy grenades and robots, or even manipulate time to produce several clones of yourself. Trying out new combinations of mutations really keeps me coming back to the game. My only real complaint is that, at the time of this review, physical mutations seem less powerful and interesting than mental mutations overall. Rebalancing is sure to come in the future. \n\nIf you're looking for an alternate playstyle, you can also choose for your character to be a \"true kin,\" a non-mutant human who lacks special powers but starts with useful artifacts and higher stats.\n\nThe gameplay: True to its genre, Qud has randomly generated levels, randomized loot, and permadeath. If the latter is really a dealbreaker for you, it is possible to turn it off in the \"debug\" option category. Graphics are either ASCII or a clean, if simple, set of tile icons.\n\n Unlike other staples of the genre such as Nethack, there is not one ultimate goal (fetch the amulet) but a series of main quests with other objectives you can find on the side. There are also various ways to complete the quests, from what I've seen. Another feature of Qud is the world map, which can be used to quickly travel between locations in the game at the cost of running down your hunger and thirst quicker. \n\nEnemy balance is pretty good, in my experience: you may run into a really strong monster, but as long as you stop to think, there is usually a way for you to escape and return later.\n\nThe world: Caves of Qud takes place in a setting where it seems as if almost anything goes - yet, it's very good at hitting its own specific tone. The weird world of Qud, while putatively post-apocalyptic, has a lot more in common with The Dark Tower than Fallout. The dead civilizations you ransack are [i]old[/i], and the artifacts you dig up range from your everyday hand grenade to more exotic types such as the \"shade oil injector,\" which will cause you to phase out of reality for a little while. I admit I am a bit of a sucker for the trope of forgotten technology aging and turning into artifacts of myth, and Qud does pull it off well. Lore is tantalizingly doled out in item descriptions and NPC dialogue.\n\nOverall, I'm very excited to watch Caves of Qud develop. It's already quite large in scope, and should only be getting better. As another plus, the devs seem to take player feedback very seriously and are active in the forums.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1440025268, "timestamp_updated": 1440025268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17579251": {"recommendationid": "17579251", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985659428", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500515668}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a tough but very rewarding game.

It's odd placing the acronyms \"HD\" and \"ASCII\" next to each other, but there really isn't a better way to describe the game. it keeps true to it's heritage of Dos based roguelikes, from it's HD ASCII visuals, to it's keyboard command scheme. Even the mechanics and visuals are redesigned versions of what you may find in games like Rogue or Dwarf Fortress. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6BngOmzxv0\nIf you've never played an ASCII Roguelike game before, getting into Caves of Qud, could prove challenging. It won't control like modern games, forgoing mouse and gamepad, and sticking strictly to keyboard commands. There is a help menu which I highly recommend any new player to check before proceeding. But once you get over the learning curve, you'll find an expansive randomly generated world to explore, with a ton of replay and experimentation potential. You'll be able to create your own class, and tackle the game's quest and world as you see fit. It's wide, expansive, and deep.\n\nVisually it may look unimpressive at first glance, but when you compare it to it's original ASCII version you can clearly see where all the work went into. Instead of actual ASCIIs as representation of the characters and the world, the game uses low-fi sprites that carry a similar visual feel of ASCIIs. Even the font choice and spacing is carefully designed to remind us of older times, while keeping things modern and easily read. There is no sound to speak of, no music, no midis. The game is in early access so it could be something to be added later, however, I suspect the omission is done intentionally, as the original Caves of Qud featured no sounds as well.\n\nThe game is fantastic, even as a player who've never played a whole lot of ASCII games in the past, but with that said, it's not perfect. Though the lack of sound could of been done deliberately, I'd still prefer if it featured some midi sounds to go with it. Also the initial area is consistent and always the same, with areas outside of the starting point being RNG. This coupled with the high learning curve of Caves of Qud will make the initial few tries at the game feel more tedious than if it was also randomly generated as well.\n\nOverall Caves of Qud is what I'd like to consider \"The Pillars of Eternity of Roguelikes\". Much like Pillars of Eternity, Caves of Qud keeps true to both the gameplay and visuals of it's inspired genre, without sacrificing the original's spirit, all while being an immensely enjoyable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Great looking \"HD\" ASCII sprites and design\n- Keeps true to it's heritage\n- Deep and engrossing\n- Endless experimentation and replayability \n\nCons:\n- Might not be for every one\n- No sounds", "timestamp_created": 1438988927, "timestamp_updated": 1438989703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17429360": {"recommendationid": "17429360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026465519", "num_games_owned": 495, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487292539}, "language": "english", "review": "Red Rock is a trap for fools.

[/b]\nCaves of Qud is by most, if not all, definition a traditional rogue-like which features plenty of untimely deaths and tons of quirky living and non-living things. There are light elements of survival with some needs for food and water, and you are also able to make new stuffs if you happen to come across the 'data disk' for you and if you have the necessary skills. Being a traditional rogue-like also means graphics is restricted to ASCII or tiles (static icons effectively) so kindly do not expect to see the fringe of your character\u2019s hair flowing in the breeze. \n\n[b]Is it fun? [/b]\nRogue-likes us]ed to exist at a time which requires people to use their imagination, and so it is only as fun as you imagine it to be. That said, the lack of graphics also mean more effort can be put into crafting deeper lore, additional content and balancing game mechanics instead of having to fiddle around with body proportions and rag-doll physics. Considering that you can choose to play a mutant with multiple hands, legs and heads (just two), perhaps it\u2019s better not to fiddle around with the rag-doll physics too. Fun is when you actually make an effort to overcome an in-game obstacle and take pleasure in doing so, or when you prevent your next character\u2019s death by learning from his/her predecessor\u2019s demise. Fun is also when you are able to get randomized loot, crappy or otherwise, and make the most out of them. Fun too, is when you beat bad RNG odds to survive. Fun is all of the above; everything else is merely enjoyable at best. \n\n[b]Does it look good? [/b]\nIt looks as good-looking as alphabets and sentences can be. There\u2019s quite a bit of reading to do, mostly flavor text and background lore and whether you might be dying or not, or did you lose a limb or two. Other than these, graphically-representative icons are all that you have to feed your imagination with. \n\n[b]Million dollar question (or whatever price the game is), is it worth buying? [/b]\nThere is a free ASCII version on the developer\u2019s website (freeholdgames.com) which you may wish to download and check out for yourself on the content and gameplay. I would also advise watching a few Let\u2019s Play episodes somewhere to gauge if you can dedicate the hours needed to enjoy the game. There are still some issues which needs to be ironed out, and the developer has been pretty hardworking so far to get these sorted out.

Yes. \nIs it too hard? No. \nEven for somebody who's never played a roguelike before? Totally do-able. \nYou will die. A lot. The game is designed to be hard, but not tear-your-hair-out frustrating. The way that it manages to be very difficult and yet wholly enjoyable despite death after death is a masterpiece of gaming. \n\n**INTRIGUE**\nThere is deep political simulation, effecting every last mob in the game. Gain enough reputation with certain types of creatures or people (arachnids, farmers, tortoises) and they will rush to your aid in battle. Lose enough, and they'll attack you on sight. The landmarks in the game--like the starting village, Joppa--are always the same, but the wilderness and caves are procedurally-generated. That means that as you try to reach the deepest depths of, say, Red Rock, you could find the next staircase down mere feet away or on the other side of the map. What's more, there are very in-depth and extremely interesting crafting and trade systems that you can master in time. \n\n**COMBAT**\nDeceptively simple. Like any proper roguelike, you have to come up with creative ways to deal with certain situations. Choosing whether to shoot your rifle or swing your sword could be a life or death decision. It's easy to learn, hard to master. \n\n**CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION**\nOh, boy. Wanna be a beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones? You got it. \nWant to be one of just a few remaining true men, an aristocrat as well versed in ways of the trigger as he is in the way of the blade? You got it.  \nWanna get a few more points to put into useful mutations by taking a debuff that puts an evil twin somewhere in the world, an exact clone of your character who may one day find you and kill you? Yep. You can do that too. \n\n**LORE**\nJust play it, man. It's awesome. \n\n**CONS**\nSometimes, you get attached to your beguilin', time-dilatin', flame-throwin', photosynthesizin', gunslingin' cowboy-snake called Grassy Jones. While after he dies you can click 'replay most recent character' on the new game screen and get Grassy Jones back, you won't get his successes back. Half the time, that's fine and it's just as fun to do it all over again. There's actually a disable permadeath button, but for now it doesn't work.

A post-apocalyptic setting done right with a minimum of over-used tropes is the backdrop for your adventure. You begin as a hapless adventurer simply trying to make your way in life, but can progress (with a little luck and a little skill) into a wealthy and powerful figure with an ever-increasing knowledge of the mysterious world in which you live and its exciting ancient past. 10/10.\n\nUI:\nOnce you grasp the basics of the control scheme, the game becomes easier and easier to play. I personally enjoy the all-keyboard control scheme of a well-made roguelike, as it allows me to play the entire game with no more hand motion than it takes me to write this review. This setup can be daunting for newcomers to the roguelike genre or even to experienced dungeon crawlers who are new to this game in particular. The complete lack of mouse support, even in the menus, has been off-putting at times; however, there is an option in one of the menus that claims to activate mouse interactivity (though it seems to do nothing at the time). Perhaps the developers are planning on introducing this feature at some point in the future.\nThe game includes no tutorial for the controls, so a new player has to do some reading and some perusing of the hotkey binding page before they can make much progress in the game. I would hope that at some point in the future the devs introduce some sort of tutorial mode to help out with this.\nOverall, once the controls are mastered and the GUI is understood by the player, it is a system on par with what i would expect from a commercial roguelike, though it could definitely be daunting to a newbie and has no tutorial to explain its intricacies. 6/10.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs with the UI, there is no particular gameplay tutorial to help the player become immersed in the game. There are walls of text in the help menus that can, with patience, teach you enough about the game to get started. From there, you're on your own. In some ways, this is interesting, as it forces you to discover each new fact about the game world for yourself, rather than having it spoonfed to you. In other ways, it is frustrating. For example: it took me until my second or third character to understand that _water is the currency_ in this game. The confusion was due in large part to water's being represented by the $ sign in various interfaces.\nThat all being said, once one gets a grasp of the flow of gameplay, it's a wonderful experience that melds with the world and makes me want to play more and more. The procedurally generated game world also draws me in, as I know that playing the game will never simply become a matter of rote memorization. (Has anyone else played 400+ hours of Skyrim? Then you know the feeling.) Overall, 8/10.\n\nCHARACTER OPTIONS:\nThe other daunting aspect for a new player is the sheer volume of choices to make at character creation, with no particular guidance besides (eventually) experience. Again, interesting in that one has to descover working character builds for themselves, but not newbie friendly. This item is double edged though: I have to say that I love nothing more than a system that gives me a full spectrum of options in character creation, especially in a world where having \"4 unique classes\" is a selling point in some games.\nIn addition to the countless myriad of unique characters that can be created before one even enters the world, the game also features a robust skills tree that allows the player to uniquely customize their character. This skills tree does more than simply \"Add 5 to hit with longswords\". Almost every perk on the tree features some non-numerical gameplay benefit (your dagger also deals ongoing bleed damage, or your axe can cleave through many foes, or you can pause to take careful aim before firing your raned weapon, etc.), and not every perk on the tree is combat based (there are perks for butchering, harvesting, knowledge of various terrains to allow long distance travel without becoming hopelessly lost, etc.).\nAll in all, I can't wait to try out build after build after build, since there is an enourmous depth of options and combinations of powers to try. 9/10.\n\nTL;DR:\nA great game with a steep learning curve that makes up for its somewhat uninviting front with a rewarding world, gameplay experience, and character custimization options. 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1437895143, "timestamp_updated": 1437895143, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.619342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17230524": {"recommendationid": "17230524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113962505", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508880930}, "language": "english", "review": "Killed by my mutant evil twin.

I'm about 50 characters in and I still find some new wrinkle or interesting ability/mutation I haven't tried before yet in combination. I still have yet to reach the very edges of the map or, indeed, the second main dungeon the questline but I've experienced a goodly portion of the main game, enough to evaluate it for a review. Of course, there's always the chance that by the time this gets read the game has changed.\n\nOne of the thing you might overlook is the defects: Don't! Almost all of them are entertaining and guaranteed to make a playthrough more interesting. Variety is the spice of life. My last character took the defect Packrat where you have to carry almost all of your carrying capacity or take damage and you have to wait 10 turns if you want to get rid of something, so basically every RPG hoarder ever except with an ingame mechanic. Taking the defect let me take a 4-point mutant skill (I picked a Paralyzing Stinger on my back) just as an example of how it can make your game interesting and different.\n\nIf the game ever gets so difficult it's completely unfun for you, turning off Permadeath is only a click away in the Options menu. Doing so invites a friendly \"Did you mean to die?\" menu.\n\nThe game is rich and textured though not every game will reveal its secrets only in the first hours: it's only after you've really begun to sink your teeth into the quests, find a mysterious man frozen in glass in a dungeon, find yourself reloading your shotgun to blast off another accursed thatch of qudzu (which has the ability to rust your gear off) out of the way, beguile an eyeless crab to join you that you might realize you're having a lot of fun... Watch out for those \nslumberlings and rifle turrets and fire ants! Pressing \"L\" whenever you see a new creature is always recommended.\n\nSound: There's no sound as of yet, I recommend using  the Steam Music Player for now. The Crypt of the Necrodancer soundtrack or Heroine's Quest are good for putting on in the background.\n\nGraphics: With a baked-in CRT scanlines interface, the tileset is nicely stylized. After a while, they won't seem so strange after you figure out what you're looking at. They're not top-of-the-line (That would probably go to Cogmind) but they're \nserviceable and a step above the original cluttered ASCII of the free version.\n\nGameplay: Incredibly deep! No two games, even with the same character build will play the same and there's just so many different kinds of ways to play ... which is good because until you turn off permadeath, you'll probably be trying out lots of things.\n\nWriting: The writing is very, erm, unique, sometimes a little trippy/out there with the descriptions but its very descriptive. You won't feel like you're reading a book but there's enough of it that it feels like a dungeon master's lovingly crafted attention to detail of a world they love to write for.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend this game, it can really only improve from here.

It's a nice mix of ancient sensibilities and high-tech sorcery that hearkens back to a bygone era of pulp sci-fi.\n\nUpon starting the game proper, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of customization permitted during character creations - mutant characters get the brunt of the options, in the forms of various mutations which can vary from small stat bonuses to special combat abilities to mutations that can drastically change the way the game is played. Pure humans, on the other hand, get to pick from one of several classes that will decide their starting skills and gear.\n\nOn entering the game world and getting into the thick of it, I somehow found my way to the faction page and found out that not only does each phylum of the animal kingdom have its own faction but that they're all after my blood, with the sole exception of the antelopes, with whom I've somehow managed to maintain cordial relations. On one of my trips to the beginners' dungeon, I was beset upon and ruthlessly torn apart by a pack of baboons, quickly confirming the faction screen's insinuations. The gameplay is the usual roguelike fare - delving into dungeons and fending off ravenous furries, robots and said fauna, collecting treasure (swords, axes, woven bracelets, shotguns, high-tech gizmos and combat drugs) and gaining levels.\n\nThe skill system in this game is well done - rather than gaining small incremental bonuses for pumping points into skills, every available upgrade to your skills carries a discrete benefit and/or ability. For example, when upgrading the long blades skill, you can choose the interception ability, which gives you a small chance of attacking any enemy that moves into an adjacent space for free and an activated stance that ensures you automatically intercept for a number of turns. The fact that gaining skills and growing in power actually affords new tactical opportunities rather than just embiggening numbers is one of this game's definite strengths. The huge amount of possible combinations of gear, stats, mutations and abilities mean that you'll have limitless options as to how to build your character.\n\nAlso rather unusually for a roguelike, this game has quests, and what appears to be a storyline. One downside is that those I've encountered so far appear to be fixed and do not vary from playthrough to playthrough, which does detract from the novelty a bit. I've not yet played far enough to tell for sure, but it does appear that they can be safely skipped, for the most part, though my compulsive nature has lead them to feeling more like chores to be repeated after each death rather than the interesting opportunities they were at first.\n\nAs for the simulation aspects, I'm not rightly sure how deep they go. It's certainly nowhere near Dwarf Fortress adventure mode's level of granular simulation, as numerous elements appear to stay the same across different playthroughs, and some things appear to not be simulated at all. This isn't a bad thing, however, since in lieu of DF's maniacal obsession with detail, this game provides basic gameplay mechanics that are far more fun, it runs better, and not having to rely on generated conversations and descriptions allows the devs to infuse it with far more flavour and atmosphere, creating an experience which is a lot more coherent and quite a bit less samey than DF's adventure mode.\n\nOverall, I've played this game for only 4 hours as of writing this, and I've only explored a miniscule corner of the game world. If you like Roguelikes and RPGs in general, this game is a steal at 10 bucks.

You can also do a \"water ritual\" (share water with a sapient to get faction points) to learn things, skills, or even share things you know about to get more faction points. I was really suprised when I went to do the water ritual with a friendly sapient robot and I had to use a dram of oil instead of water. Its still updated every week, and I cant wait for the big cooking update coming soon. This game blows my mind. Its literally the best real Roguelike Ive ever played, hands down. Its in my top 10 of \"all time favorite games\", and when you've been gaming for 30+ years, thats saying something. Ive watched this game just continually get more amazing and more amazing for the past few years, and I love the fact that its continually updated and just keeps getting better.\n\nUPDATED:\n\nI *love* the background sounds and music. They fit absolutely perfect with the extremely post-human setting. Tiles and art style are great too.. The whole setting reminds me of Dark Sun meets the Urth of the New Sun or something. Its really unique. The new content is great. More story, quests, setting, items. I love watching the game grow. \nThe books are cool too. I believe except for certain ones, books are randomly generated -just bits of game text and NPC conversations jammed together. Not sure, but that would explain why they sound so weird and disjointed. I like the effect though.\n\n\nTL;DR If you like true Roguelikes GET THIS GAME. Holy crud, Ive seen finished games that werent this huge and complex. The free ASCII version is good, this is f'n awesome,\n________________\nOk. If youre a fan of true Roguelikes- not the games that have random generation and permadeath and so are labeled \"roguelike\" just based on that fact - but real true top down randomly generated RPGs that use keyboard commands, have a  ton of variable randomly generated content and options, turn based, simple tile graphics but are incredibly complex and fun, then  you MUST get this game. Its been around for a bit in a free ASCII format, but this is the new and improved and worth paying for version.\n\nIts great. I used to play the ASCII Roguelikes back in the day (Moria, *Angband etc), but Ive gotten to the point where I like tiles. And CoQ has them. Simple tiles, yes, and they aren't all done. But at least you're not squinting and trying to remember if the blue s was a simple water snake or a terrible siren that will charm you before she beats you to death.\n\nTheres no sound ort music yet, but that is something that the devs are planning on putting in.\nUnlike most Roguelikes. this one is Sci Fi/Fantasy, which is cool. It reminds me of a sci-fi-ish DarkSun, that awesome D&D world from the '90s. Qud appears to be a ruined dry world, full of sentient plants, caves, little water, ancient tech, giant insects etc. Its really unique and fun.\n\nTheres two races, mutated human and True Kin each with a HUGE amount of unique-to-that-race sub options to really customize your PC. Mutated Humans are weaker than True Kin but get mutation points. The points allow them to buy physical or mental mutations (positive traits) and defects, which are detrimental but give you more mutation points. I dont know how many mutations and defects you can choose from, but it looks like at least 70 or so. Mutants also get 12 classes to choose from, and none of them are like \"fighter\" \"mage\" \"priest\". They are all unique, nomads, tinkers, merchants, wardens etc. True Kin have better starting attributes, no mutations and can choose 1  of 12 \"castes\" (classes - again they are pretty unique), also choosing a caste chooses the arcology you come from. There are 3 arcologies, each with 4 castes. THey appear to be the \"shut away in the high-tech place protected from the wasteland\" type race, while the Mutants are the \"scrabbling dirt-grubbers trying to survive in the toxic wastelands\".\n\nThe world is HUGE and expansive, even in its unfinished state. Theres also a main storyline, another thing most Roguelikes lack (beyond the \"get to the bottom of the dungeon and bring the Amulet of Yendor back out\" type plots), in addition to the \"bring me a whatzit from the wherezit\" type quests you see in many Roguelikes tkat actually have towns and NPCs you can talk to.\n\nThe game is still in EA, and the devs are adding more content and bugstomping. The main questline isnt finished, But even in EA, its totally worth picking up. I never buy EA games, I usually wishlist them until completion. But Ive seen \"full release\" games that werent this complex and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1437204945, "timestamp_updated": 1511728116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505300", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17102223": {"recommendationid": "17102223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044218930", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499046543}, "language": "english", "review": "Wandering small cavern, finds artifact, eXamines it, finds chaingun.", "timestamp_created": 1437194434, "timestamp_updated": 1437194434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497866", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17101864": {"recommendationid": "17101864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123286890", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 10091, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505868876}, "language": "english", "review": "honestly one of the best games i've ever played??? merges the trend of procedural generation with really solid worldbuilding seamlessly. controls are gonna be hard for beginners to get into but you can rebind them and controls are a problem for all oldstyle roguelikes anyway. aesthetically really nice. grood", "timestamp_created": 1437191903, "timestamp_updated": 1437191903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17098643": {"recommendationid": "17098643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101319180", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512452664}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome,  Well rounded and In Depth Roguelike.

The focus on character building and death meaning something have always been a huge draw to me. If you look at my library, I have a lot of these suckers. You may wonder if there's still games in the genre that can still surprise me. The answer is HELL YES. Caves of Qud is one such game.\n\nThrow out the typical fantasy setting you probably picture when you think of a roguelike. This is the post-apocalypse and your two choices are to play as a pure or mutated human. I've tried both and the latter seems to be way more fun. It kind of reminds me of the episodes of Futurama with the mutants in the sewer. You can turn yourself into all kinds of monstrosities, and I suspect the number of options will only grow over time. My most recent playthrough I decided to take a mutation which gave me flaming hands. I didn't realize it meant I would never be able to wear gloves. This is a great illustration of the mutation system: most of the time it involves trade offs, especially for the really fun powers, like being made up of quills like a porcupine (a personal favorite).\n\nThe graphics are ASC, but put through a filter that makes it look like you're playing on a much older computer. One that may or may not be from before your time. I personally love the look of it, but the result makes it deceptively system intensive. \n\nThe controls will be divisive to the say the least. Some will be pissed that the controls are so obtuse, though once you play with them for a while they do start to feel natural. They can all be rebound though, and if you're willing to put in the effort to do so you can bind them in any way that your heart desires!\n\nI haven't even explored a fraction of the world yet, nor have I managed to complete the first quest I was given. There are still enemies that would seem menial in other games that can kill me if I'm not careful. Call me a masochist but this is more than a little bit exciting to me. Two hours into a game I generally feel like I get what's going on, but here I'm still trying to figure out what exactly I'm supposed to do. The procedurally generated, fully destructable world is huge, and I get the feeling that even without permadeath (that is an option for those who are turned off by having to reroll all the time) the game would be collosal.\n\nIf you're into that kind of thing, there's tons of lore here too. More than I'll ever manage to sift through realistically. It's a world of mutants and sentient bears; the writing ain't half bad either.\n\nNegatives are that the game uses far more system resources than it needs to. It looks pretty, but functionality trumps graphics, especially in a roguelike. Also, the game isn't friendly to those who aren't willing to be patient with it. You'll die a lot before you start to see successes. Then you'll continue to die frequently. That can be disheartening and will certainly put off some players. This game is harder than Nethack in my opinion, and that's not something I would say lightly. Tutorials would be a welcome feature, more than just a series of paragraphs to read in the help section.\n\nTL;DR: This is the roguelike for the true hardcore roguelike player. It's tough, it's massive, and inventive enough that I feel like telling my friends about the porcupine-beetle-man hybrid that I rolled last time. For an early access title its chock full of content.

There's random dungeons, a set storyline, traditional gameplay, sure. But what makes Caves of Qud stand out amongst the crowd is the sheer mystique of the setting - Qud is a dangerous country in a post-apocalyptic era. Most of the humans (potentially including you) are mutants with strange powers that grant interesting tactical choices. The areas feel extremely unique (a rarity in the roguelike genre) - one area has you rushing to the bottom of a pit on conveyor belts while trying to avoid the toxic inhabitants, another area has a strange mix of machine-worshipping humans and armored trolls in a cyrogenic environment with optional frozen bosses... the list goes on.\n\nCharacter customization is also neat. Beyond mutations, there's also skills, a crafting system, faction relations... It's a bit overwhelming at first. It is fun to eventually grow into a winged psychic with a flamethrower that has a poor relationship with the consortium of plants!\n\nThe combat is by far the neatest thing I've seen in a traditional roguelike. Most of the skills and spells have neat effects tied onto them, and most of the enemies have interesting behavior with their abilities. There's a ton of tactics involved, and mashing the basic attack of moving into enemies is a sure way to die past a certain point in the game.\n\nBeing a roguelike, there is permadeath, BUT you can turn it off if you wanted to. But hey, what kinda roguelike doesn't have permadeath? \n\nIt's also reeeeally difficult. It took me a ton of tries just to get a character past a certain point in the game. Some of it has been rebalanced in the alpha, but you should still prepare to die. And die. And die.\n\nThe major gripes I have with this game are its memory issues (which I'm told are being fixed) and that the tiles can make things look really similar (which can be turned off). It's also still unfinished, so there's that too (though it still takes ~5 hours to beat if you don't die. Protip: you will die).\n\nConclusions:\n+ Excellent lore, setting\n+ Really cool character customization\n+ Interesting combat\n+ Togglable permadeath\n+/- Pretty difficult\n- Memory issues\n- Tiles make everything look really similar (togglable)\n- It's still in early accessm, so it's unfinished", "timestamp_created": 1436970421, "timestamp_updated": 1436970421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17060803": {"recommendationid": "17060803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027907201", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489233145}, "language": "english", "review": "For my first death, I was strangled to death by a jilted lover.\n\nNext time, I'll bring chocolates.\n\n10/10\n\n...\n\nAlright, time for a seriousness edit:\n\nCaves of Qud is a traditional-style roguelike, set in a fallout-esque world a few thousand years after the end of the world. It's got plenty of procedurally generated caves and ruins to explore scattered across a large overworld, all tied together by a quest line rife with side-quests. At least, that's what it aims to be eventually; currently, the main quest line is not finished, and many side quests remain unimplemented as of the writing of this review. Despite this, there's tons of content to discover and die by.\n\nEven though the quest line is unfinished, you will die many, many times before you reach the end (you'll know when it stops, if you make it that far). The difficulty and frequency of death allows you to explore the rich character creation system the game is packing. This system offers many options, allowing you to choose whether you begin as a mutant (slower skill point gain, but gains useful mutations) or a True Man (higher starting attributes, and increased skill point gain). From there, you've got a number of physical/mental mutations (for mutants) or castes (for True Men) to choose from. Additionally, Qud offers you a skill tree of sorts as you level up, allowing you to gain abilities as you grow more experienced. Oh, and dialogue trees!\n\nThough it may be difficult to get in to, Caves of Qud offers a unique,engaging, and deeply rewarding rpg experience.

Once progress is made and you start to become powerful, it's easy to feel like a God until some new horror pulls you to your grave.\n\nThe quests are lacking/incomplete - Qud doesn't need quests (besides the main for story progression).

Collect artifacts, find historical sites, search out faction leaders to either bond with though ritual or to rob/murder, check out those scary places around the edge of Qud, go deeper, or just get lost in the lore.

Things were going well as I was making my way down a rust cave, collecting copper wire for an early quest.  I was a human gunslinging mutant, with an unstable genome that granted me a 33% chance of generating 3 random mutations to select from when leveling up.  I was quite lucky, and had this happen a few times, and got a few really handy abilities.  I got lase, which gives me illumination and the ability to shoot lasers, and temporal fuge, which spawns another friendly copy of myself.  I could only use the last ability sparingly, as it had a 200 turn cooldown, and only lasted 22 turns, so I only used it when encountering tough hostiles who were closing in on me.  Unfortunately, the copy of my character had the same items that I had, and would always apply a tonic that made him invisible as soon as he was generated, and would hide from enemies or stay stationary.  I developed a tactic of running around him, keeping him between me and the enemy as my health and other abilities slowly regenerated, while praying that he would shoot a little more often.\nAnyways, I got down to the 4th level of the cave, and had almost all the wire that I needed, when I noticed that in the top corner of the floor there was a little bit of floor beyond the walls, and if I went diagonally I could squeeze through the corner of the wall and go off the map.  I did this, and found myself in a strange underground meadow, with spiderwebs all over, and creatures I never saw before.  I got stung by a scorpion, and was poisoned, and thought I was done for as I had no healing items or abilities, nor anything that I knew that could cure poison.  When I killed the scorpion, I was at 10 health, and the poison did 3 damage every turn.  As a last ditch effort to try to cure the poison, I drank water until I became tumescent.  I don't know if that was what did it, or if it was just luck, but the poison subsided and now I was just ill.  I waited until I got my vitality back, and continued exploring after that close encounter.\nThere was a staircase going down in the middle of the meadow, and I was torn between going down it, or going back to the cave.  I decided to keep looking around, then make my way back to the cave.  I came across a tough blue spider that was coming for me, I used one of my abilities to generate bramble around it and fled.  As I was fleeing, I noticed that something was shooting at me, and was confused for a moment, thinking that it was one of the plants that I generated.  Turns out that there were musket sentry guns set up, and they were killing me.  I fled towards safety, but they had incredible range.  Fortunately my gunslinger was quite agile, and dodged a lot of bullets.  I moved far enough away that they didn't seem to be able to shoot me, and saw a pile of swag, surrounded by spiderwebs.  I looked around, and there were no spiders, so I went for it.  It turns out it was a trap, and I was bombarded with musket shot, and was still getting shot as I was getting away.  I was down to 10 health, and was maybe 11 turns away from the staircase in the middle of the meadow, with the way back to the cave past the staircase.  I thought to myself aha! now I shall use the tonic that my copy kept using, make myself invisible, sneak off to the staircase, and decend if necessary to heal up, then make my way back into the safety of the cave proper.\nI applied the tonic, and my presence became unstable.  I flickered in and out of reality, and I could sense an evil presence.  It turned out there was an error when I used the tonic, and it spawned an evil shadow copy of myself right in front of the staircase.

Character and mutation customizing, freedom of developing your friendly ally NPCs, modding your weapons and armor as you see fit...\n\nObviously, as a roguelike, it has somewhat of a learning curve to get used to everything, and at the start, you'll probably die your fair (or unfair) share of deaths. However, each death only serves as experience to the player, and each time you'll figure a more stable class or build toward progressing farther than you have before.\n\nCaves of Qud is open-ended in that you can choose either to be a mutant class - steadily evolving to what you can choose to be a four-armed dual wielding combat pragmatist, or an esper with the ability to make clones of yourself and simultaneously cast pyrokinesis over a horde of enemies in the safety of your own psychic shield. And those are just two possibilites; the fun is experimenting and finding unique mutations that can play off each other!\n\nSince the game is still in development, there might be a few bugs here or there, and the lore and story (and main quest, as a result) are still in progress, though from what I've seen, active progress updates seem to happen on each Friday, so expect new content every week. However, post-game is slightly less balanced right now, so once you beat the main story, things tend to scale a bit exponentially difficult past story...\n\nThe soundtrack is nice to listen to, the ambiance definitely fits the mood. Hopefully, we'll see even more variety for different areas and landscapes as the game develops. \n\nThe graphics tend to be hit or miss for people; I personally don't mind ASCII, and the tileset for this game is pretty detailed and accurate as can be for a true roguelike. If you feel put off by the retro graphics, let the gameplay speak for itself.\n\nFinally, the replay value; well, let the hours I've played on the game speak for itself. The maps are proceduraly generated based on each new character and world playthrough, so you never have the same adventure twice.\n\nThings I'd have to be critical on would be the lack of general quests and towns/static trading hubs, which I can count on one hand, and the faction system, though impressive that you can ally yourself with any NPC group in the game, don't really interact much with other groups outside of fighting in random encounters on the map. Early game is punishing but manageable and rewarding to learn, but the lack of development late-game means you'll be facing enemies that can sometimes one-shot you even with a developed character, as placeholders for late game enemies to be replaced, as well as the Deathlands in general.\n\nIn conclusion, the game has it's flaws as a game currently in early access, but developed enough for deeply immersive, wide array customization gameplay with nearly endless replayability and weekly updates.

No thanks.\nSo let's spend some points on a extra set of arms. Actually wait. I don't want to wield a torch in those either, let's spend another point on night vision and ditch torches completely. 4 Daggers sound badass.

(it just like vanishes.) so I kinda believe this is a bug.\n\nbut I found another trick that isn't bugusing!!\n\ntrick no 2: COOKING! Some cooking recipes are useful. like watervine and any meat can be used for a recipe that gives you bleed resistance (+8-12), which esentially cures your hemophilia. With it I only bleed for about 5-6 turns. (instead of until dead.) \nso I rush butchery -> carbide chef -> harvesting (In that order) and I'm golden!\n\nthere is also this other recipe I found which is useful too: thirst at half rate + whenever your hp falls below 20% of maxhp you gain 15-20 hp\n\nnow whenever i bleed i get healed periodically as that effect triggers each time when I drop below 20% hp.\nI filled a few waterskins with my own blood. figured that would be worth something.\nThen I realized my low ego won't enable me to sell that for a profit. Oh well I can pour it on myself if i ever catch fire.\n\nSo I am like lvl 10 and have uuhm ... 40 maxhp. And can't be killed whatsoever. They're gonna nerf this right? Cooking was introduced rather recently after all.\n\nAs i leveled up, my unstable genome ... destabilized a couple of times and i picked up some new mutations like\ndouble muscled and heightened quickness. the former gimps me a bit because I'm all about getting a maximum of cuts in in a minimum of time. On the other hand the latter mutation makes up for it and each hit I do get a roll to daze em' so that might be okay too.\n\nThe extra strength also lets me carry more stuff. Which I hoard in my personal stash for selling later. As I level I even get higher ego so even I might earn my daily water. (Fresh Water is the currency in Caves of Qud. it's a pretty salty place)\nI wonder if i can distill my blood for water ... hmm.\n\nSo, I got myself two shiny carbonite daggers from Tam's in exchange for some of my loot. The two extra hands were using iron ones that i looted of my less fortunate opponents.\nI headed to Kyakuya to pick up a pivotal book with the cures for everything you never wanted to contract.\n\nOn my jolly way back I found me some madpoles (I think they were called?)\nfirst time i meet those in any playthrough so far so I was thinking of introducing my daggers to them. \n\nUnfortunately those ain't fun fighting. They cause me to bleed and the scent of bleed apparently turns them on.\nSo I kind of got my arm dismembered. One of them four I had.\nNot to worry though. I picked up regeneration earlier so it will grow back.\nBut I did worry about the carbonite dagger it was wielding! If was on the floor.\nSo i picked it up. In the meantime the madpoles continued their blood-frenzy and took my other arm.\n\nWell I'm stubborn. It kinda ended with me killing two of the madpoles somehow. and by somehow I mean I smacked them to death with my torso.\nSee, they dismembered all my four arms, my two legs and my beautiful face.\nI then farted some sleeping gas (I got another mutation for that) to put the remaining madpoles to sleep and gather my belongings that I had dropped.\nI probably lost a ton of blood too but that got dilluted in the water. Not that I care I have 3 full waterskins in my stash.\n\nThen I walked away. I mean crawled away. Uhhm ... shuffled away? Let's call it that.\n\nI also picked up my right arm. how did I pick it up? It's not like I had any other arm remaining. With my mouth? Wait my face got dismembered too ... uh. Yeah Anyway.\nI shuffled back home, stashed my loot and spent a few points on new skills.\nDual wielding costs 300 points. Let's get that. I have no arms but I can dual wield.\nThey will grow back, I'm sure.

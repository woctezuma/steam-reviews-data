Any improvement on your single player game seems to come down more to luck than skill because you're having to choose paths where you can't see what's up ahead, usually with a couple of reds on your tail. Multiplayer seems totally different in this regard with its infinite revives. The single player mode could do with a similar chance of survival, maybe like a random teleport/respawn ability recharged with the 256 dot streaks.\n\nDefinitely recommended for the novelty, low to moderate level gameplay and multiplayer. But with such a large element of the difficulty being randomness with a desolately inevitable outcome, the game discourages you from getting good because getting lucky will always matter more.\n\nGood outing, Bandai Namco.

Steam.\n\nD'un c\u00f4t\u00e9, Pac-Man 256 est une excellente adaptation des m\u00e9caniques de Pac-Man \u00e0 la structure d'un [i]endless runner:[/i] au lieu de toujours \u00e9voluer dans le m\u00eame labyrinthe, Pac-Man doit ici fuir le bug qui survient dans la borne d'arcade originale au 256\u00e8me \u00e9cran, le labyrinthe de Pac-Man 256 partant ainsi \u00e0 l'infini en haut \u00e0 droite de l'\u00e9cran alors que le bug y vient d'en bas \u00e0 gauche, d\u00e9ferlant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d'un tsunami et nous for\u00e7ant \u00e0 aller de l'avant.\n\nAfin d'accorder le gameplay original \u00e0 la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration al\u00e9atoire du labyrinthe, les sch\u00e9mas de d\u00e9placement des fant\u00f4mes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 alt\u00e9r\u00e9s plut\u00f4t intelligemment: Blinky (rouge) chasse toujours Pac-Man comme dans la borne d'origine, mais les autres ont maintenant des comportements plus m\u00e9caniques et pr\u00e9visibles - Inky (cyan) longe syst\u00e9matiquement le m\u00eame mur, Clyde (orange) va vers le bas d\u00e8s qu'il en a la possibilit\u00e9, Pinky (rose) reste sur place mais fonce en ligne droite vers Pac-Man d\u00e8s qu'elle le rep\u00e8re, et de nouveaux fant\u00f4mes (gris, verts, etc.) ont des comportements tout autant clairs et intuitifs.\n\nDans le m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, les fruits ne sont plus de simples bonus, ce sont d\u00e9sormais des multiplicateurs de points pour un temps limit\u00e9: les cerises accordent du x2, les pommes du x3, les fraises du x4, les oranges du x5 et les melons du x6, ce qui bien s\u00fbr les rend tous cruciaux pour le [i]scoring[/i].\n\nIl y a aussi une nouvelle m\u00e9canique de combo de pastilles, le labyrinthe n'\u00e9tant plus enti\u00e8rement rempli de pastilles et comportant des \"trous\": en mangeant plus de 16 pastilles d'affil\u00e9e, on gagne l'\u00e9quivalent de notre combo en score pour toute puissance de 2, \u00e0 savoir 16, 32, 64, 128 et 256. Quand on mange 256 pastilles d'affil\u00e9e, le combo est bris\u00e9, mais tous les fant\u00f4mes pr\u00e9sents dans le labyrinthe sont d\u00e9truits simultan\u00e9ment, ce qui rapporte \u00e9videmment beaucoup de points, surtout si on a mang\u00e9 un fruit juste avant que \u00e7a n'arrive.\n\nPour encore pimenter les choses, les super pac-gommes ne sont plus les seuls [i]powerups,[/i] il y a d\u00e9sormais 21 nouveaux [i]powerups[/i] que Pac-Man peut utiliser \u00e0 son avantage, le joueur choisissant lui-m\u00eame avant de commencer sa partie les trois nouveaux [i]powerups[/i] qu'il veut voir appara\u00eetre. Afin que les super pac-gommes conservent un avantage, elles restent le seul [i]powerup[/i] dont le score est progressif plus on d\u00e9truit de fant\u00f4mes (10 points pour le premier, puis 20 points, puis 30, puis 40, etc.). Pendant l'activation d'un [i]powerup,[/i] les autres types de [i]powerups[/i] sont chang\u00e9s en petits cubes qui prolongeront l'effet de celui en cours.\n\nToutes ces m\u00e9caniques sont parfaitement huil\u00e9es et pr\u00e9sentent un \u00e9quilibre subtil de risques et r\u00e9compenses tr\u00e8s satisfaisant qui renouvelle Pac-Man assez brillamment, le jeu procurant d'excellentes sensations au d\u00e9but. Mais h\u00e9las, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, le jeu est pourri stupidement par sa structure originelle de jeu pour t\u00e9l\u00e9phones et tablettes...\n\nEn pratique, le score est malheureusement compl\u00e8tement secondaire dans Pac-Man 256, toute l'exp\u00e9rience du jeu \u00e9tant ax\u00e9e sur la collecte interminable d'argent et de pastilles: en collectant des dizaines de milliers de pastilles, on d\u00e9bloquera les [i]powerups[/i] un par un et de fa\u00e7on lin\u00e9aire, et l'argent permet quant \u00e0 lui d'am\u00e9liorer les [i]powerups[/i] afin qu'ils durent plus longtemps et rapportent plus de points quand un fant\u00f4me est d\u00e9truit (plus de 85000 cr\u00e9dits \u00e0 d\u00e9penser pour que tout soit au maximum). Collecter de l'argent ne demande aucun talent et n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat, il faut essentiellement remplir des \"missions\" du genre \"collecter deux melons\" ou \"collecter tel type de [i]powerup[/i] cinq fois\". Il y a de l'argent dans le labyrinthe, mais les missions en rapportent incomparablement plus, le plus efficace \u00e9tant de suicider Pac-Man d\u00e8s qu'une mission est remplie afin d'avoir imm\u00e9diatement acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une autre mission, sans jamais s'embarrasser des m\u00e9caniques de survie ou de [i]scoring[/i] du jeu.\n\nComme les derniers [i]powerups[/i] d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s sont beaucoup plus puissants que les autres, il ne sert \u00e0 rien d'essayer d'obtenir un bon score avant d'avoir fini toute cette collecte laborieuse, qui n'a strictement aucun sens sur Steam ou sur consoles: au moins, sur t\u00e9l\u00e9phones et tablettes, ce syst\u00e8me o\u00f9 l'on cherche \u00e0 faire perdre le maximum de temps au joueur est pertinent puisqu'on l'arrose constamment de publicit\u00e9s dans l'intervalle, mais puisque ici le joueur a pay\u00e9 le jeu une bonne fois pour toute, ces simagr\u00e9es sont inutiles et massacrent un jeu qui serait tr\u00e8s bon sans elles. Le pire, c'est qu'une fois qu'on a enfin d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9 les derniers [i]powerups,[/i] le [i]scoring[/i] est soudain d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibr\u00e9 \u00e0 cause de la surpuissance de ces [i]powerups,[/i] la survie devenant trop facile et les parties trop longues, jouer s'approchant alors plus d'un test d'endurance monotone que de la tension d'un jeu \u00e0 scores.\n\nIl y a de toute fa\u00e7on trop de [i]powerups,[/i] beaucoup d'entre eux \u00e9tant redondants, inutiles ou (donc) trop puissants. C'est vraiment dommage, car en ne gardant que les cinq nouveaux [i]powerups[/i] les plus pertinents et les plus \u00e9quilibr\u00e9s (le laser, la bombe, le feu, les pi\u00e8ges et l'aimant) puis en supprimant toutes ces stupides m\u00e9caniques de d\u00e9blocage, et enfin en rendant disponibles tous les [i]powerups[/i] d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but et en les mettant directement dans le labyrinthe sans s\u00e9lection comme dans un vrai jeu d'arcade, Pac-Man 256 serait excellent, un nouveau classique.\n\nPour encore aggraver les choses, les tableaux de scores en ligne sont honteux, n'affichant que les 100 premiers scores en plus du n\u00f4tre, sans que l'on puisse avoir la moindre id\u00e9e de notre classement par rapport \u00e0 l'ensemble des joueurs.\n\nJ'ai conscience que cette \u00e9valuation est assez longue, mais les avantages et les inconv\u00e9nients du jeu sont difficiles \u00e0 expliquer bri\u00e8vement, et le jeu m'a captiv\u00e9 en d\u00e9pit de l'\u00e9pouvantable g\u00e2chis que repr\u00e9sente la boucherie de sa transition depuis les t\u00e9l\u00e9phones et tablettes. Avec quelques ajustements mineurs, j'aurais recommand\u00e9 ce jeu avec enthousiasme.", "timestamp_created": 1514568766, "timestamp_updated": 1518551186, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38715097": {"recommendationid": "38715097", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061042984", "num_games_owned": 777, "num_reviews": 84, "playtime_forever": 28, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516604724}, "language": "english", "review": "\nPAC-MAN 256 byBANDAI NAMCO Studios Vancouver , Hipster Whale , 3 Sprockets - Wow a fresh reboot of a classic.

And you don't even get multiple lives (just one, die and start over).\n\nAfter an hour of playing I'm not sure what the point is. You seem to unlock things after each death, but the gameplay doesn't really change. You get loot boxes full of coins that don't seem to have a purpose. \n\nI'd call it a nostalgia trip but it kind of isn't. \n\nI got this as part of a humble bundle and it's OK. It's probably worth $1 or $2, I think $5 (the regular non sale price) might be a bit steep for how shallow the game is.\n\nI will say it's cheaper than feeding quarters into the original. And the ability to reskin the map into various abstract themes is a cute addition (that adds nothing to the actual gameplay, just appearance change).\n\nIf you are looking at the screenshots thinking \"hey there's a bunch of different games/maps/mazes\", no, there isn't. It's the same infinite map. You pick a theme when you start, it's just a skin change. \n\nIt was neat for about an hour, and whoever made this has a serious grasp on how to make addictive sound effects.

Cela ressemble plus \u00e0 un jeu mobile, de qualit\u00e9 il faut le reconna\u00eetre, mais qui devrait avant tout \u00eatre destin\u00e9 au mobile.

C'est plut\u00f4t un Pacman endless, dans le sens ou il n y a r\u00e9ellement pas de fin, car on ne s'en tient pas au \" tableau \" bien c\u00e9l\u00e8bre avec ce nombre d\u00e9termin\u00e9 de pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 gober. L\u00e0, il faut tout simplement en gober le plus, avant de se faire avaler par un fant\u00f4me, ou pire encore par la map qui disparait. Le jeu s'appuie sur une diagonale ( c'est assez inconfortable d'ailleurs ), avec un plateau qui s'efface progressivement du bas vers le haut. Le but \u00e9tant de se frayer un chemin tout en \u00e9vitant les fantomes qui sont tr\u00e8s nombreux, et qui gagnent de la rapidit\u00e9 au fil de la mont\u00e9e. C'est l\u00e0 le principal probl\u00e8me, finis le jeu de reflexe ou les personnages vont \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 m\u00eame vitesse. Ici, il faut jouer sur le play et retry, c'est-\u00e0-dire faire une centaine de parties en ramassant le plus possible de pi\u00e8ces pour pouvoir am\u00e9liorer le powerup du petit Puckman, afin qu'il puisse grimper dans le niveau sans se faire surpasser par le fant\u00f4me, sauf que c'est sans fin, il faut faire plein de parties car que vous soyez bon ou non \u00e0 ce jeu, impossible d'aller, c'est frustrant.\n\nBien heureusement, les \u00e9diteurs ne vous proposent pas encore ( pour l'instant ) de payer pour am\u00e9liorer votre bonhomme plus vite. Pour d\u00e9crire le style de jeu, \u00e7a ressemble un peu \u00e0 Crossy Road ( jeu mobile ) et je me demande franchement ce que fait ce jeu sur Steam ... Ca n'a pas sa place, ou il devrait \u00eatre gratuit avec achats int\u00e9gr\u00e9s.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1198397818\n\nJe voudrais aussi faire remarquer que lorsque j'avais achet\u00e9 le jeu il y'a quelques mois, il y'avait une mention qui pr\u00e9cisait que Pacman 256 \u00e9tait multijoueur \" En ligne \". Bien \u00e9videmment, les \u00e9diteurs ont fait comme beaucoup d'autre la \" bagatelle de mettre cette mention \" puisque \u00e9videmment c'est bien plus vendeur ...

Very addicting, enjoyable, and easy to sink hours on end, just trying to beat your own high score, or earn a new power-up.

The glitchy teleport effect is shared between randomly placed coins and glitched ghosts.  Both will show up randomly, but coins are a semi-frequent pickup that are crucial to progression when starting out, where as ghosts will of course kill you if you try and run through their teleport assuming it was a coin about to pop up.  The only difference I could see between their visual effect is that ghosts took about half a second longer to make the transition.  You already don\u2019t get much time to judge what it is because of the corridor hallways the map is made out of and the 256 wall doesn\u2019t allow for too much back tracking should you need to find a better path.\n\nPower ups are horribly designed/balanced.  I should point out that if not all your power ups are lethal(as in a weapon of some sort), you will guarantee your death in multiple situations early in a run.  Not even pickups that give you non-lethal invincibility are useful. They can leave you trapped when they wear off and won\u2019t earn you any extra points anyway.\n\nWhile achievement hunting, I discovered that after awhile, the hallway setups and ghost placements become exceedingly predictable.  Its when I noticed that power ups are usually placed in areas in later parts of a run where they are absolutely necessary to progress through an area.  If you choose anything other than an all lethal loadout, you will either die within the area or not progress fast enough and screw yourself in the near future.\n\nMany unlockable pick ups have straight upgrades with the only nerfs being less points for using them and less time given when picking them up.  This becomes entirely trivial when the better form of the same pick up is significantly more useful and will extend your game much further than using the longer lasting/better scoring pick up.  A grand example of this is the beam/laser pick up, with the Beam pick up reflecting off corners and being able to clear out large groups of ghosts without being anywhere near them.  The score/time bonus for using the inferior laser doesn\u2019t even come close to being relevant, as it can\u2019t kill ghosts without direct line of sight and is still vulnerable in many situations that the beam is not.\n\nThe periodic missions that give you coins as a reward for completing them often pressure players into doing things that would probably get them killed, so to progress and level up powers, you will have to sacrifice trying to play towards an actual score like you would expect in an arcade game, or even an infinite runner.  The coin rewards are also random and have nothing to do with what the mission objective was.  Though the objectives can take anywhere from the first 3 minutes of a run collecting a small amount of pellets to multiple runs searching for 6 of the exact same fruit, you can get anywhere between 128 and 1024 coins for doing them.  From my experience, it went more towards the low end of rewards more often than not.\n\nAll of this is just bad gameplay.  THEN you add the fact that it has a Pac Man theme, a game series with deep roots to classic, skill based arcade experiences, and that this started out as F2P mobile game\u2026 yeah its a pretty big slap to the face.  I would like to give them credit for making a solid port but honestly I don\u2019t think many people would play something like this on PC, its really unnecessary.  I wouldn\u2019t play this on mobile either, despite having mobile games ranging from both casual and a bit more in depth.

When taken on its own and not held to any of its predecessors.\n\nThe problem there is, I've already seen what a modern Pac-Man game could be with CEDX+. When held up to that candle, this game falls short in just about every measure.\n\nThe various power ups start out interesting, and then either become obsolete (what is the use of choosing or upgrading Laser/Bomb/Freeze/Tornado/Fire/Magnet, when you have Optics/Boom/Shatter/Twinado/Pyro/Regen, which are respectively similar but more powerful versions?), or are pretty useless (Sonar) or unwieldy (Radar) compared to other power ups.\n\nThe incentive to actually get a high score is lacking. The game quickly becomes a grind about collecting coins to boost power-ups, and even with that, you will get far more coins from completing missions or just as free drops between games than you will actually playing the game.\n\nSpeaking of missions, in part these seem to be used as a crutch to make sure that you give every powerup, no matter how useless, fair air time. Because, eventually, you WILL get missions for things like \"collect 5 Sonar power ups\", and the only way to do that is to equip the power up so that it appears in the game, consuming one of your precious 3 slots. Ugh.\n\nThe game also breaks several traditional Pac-Man conventions. Forget about the tight, ghost-escaping cornering that you may have relied upon SINCE 1980, because the ghosts in this game will catch you every time. You will absolutely need to unlearn that to do any good at this game.  The fruit progression is not even correct, even among the paltry 5 fruits they included in the game, causing me to instinctually overvalue some fruits and undervalue others.\n\nI'm a little under halfway through the grind to max out all power-ups (at 9h), and frankly, I'm not sure I'll find the motivation to continue to completion.  This seemed like it might be a good 100%'er, but that hope is fading fast.\n\nIf you want a good, modern Pac-Man game, get CEDX+.  If you already have CEDX+, play it some more.  It's more exciting, more authentic to the original, and just MORE in general than this game is.

If not, watch a Youtube video or something! Pac Man is undeniably one of the most important and iconic video games in history.)\n\nPac Man 256 is a very well done, procedurally generated, dot eating maze game. The level scrolls infinititely upward, and the entire time you are chased by a slow-moving kill wall that forces your continuous ascent.\n\nUnlike the old Pac Man games, the objective isn't to eat ALL the dots you see... There's simply not enough time to do that, and you'll get killed pretty quickly. Rather, you now simply have to eat as many dots (and classic power pellets) as you can as you keep going up, all while avoiding ghosts and collecting fruit (which are now multipliers) along the way.\n\nIn addition to the standard dots/ghosts/fruit, there are powerups and coins scattered throughout the maze. Collecting a powerup gives Pac Man a temporary power, such as the ability to slow ghosts down, or kill them from a distance in various ways. The coins serve as an ingame currency, which you can use to permanently upgrade your powerups between games. Powerups are unlocked simply by eating dots over your career, and you're allowed to pick 3 of them at a time to randomly appear throughout the maze. I've only unlocked a few of the powerups so far, but they all seem to work well with the game, and it's been fun to see what new power the game will throw at me next.\n\nJust like the Championship Edition, this game is a great modern take on a classic game. It's sleek, it's polished, and it gets frenetic. It changes enough to be a new and exciting experience, but it still retains the classic features and basic gameplay that make it distinctly Pac Man.

The game is an endless maze where you must avoid ghosts and the glitch tsunami. Interestingly the glitch tsunami is based in the original Pacman's level 256 glitch: the screen gets split into two with the right side turning into a soup of numbers and letters. The 256 level of Pacman is impossible to beat and occurs due to the level number being stored as an 8-bit number. The highest number and 8-bit number can store is 255 (2^8 - 1 = 255) so going to level 256 glitches the game. This glitch is also the origin of this game's name. Being an arcade game the objective is to reach the maximum score. To get points you eat pellets, fruits or kill ghosts by getting power ups\n\nThere about 18 power ups available but to use them you must first unlock the power ups with points and you can only choose 3 to show up for sure in each game. A random power up may show up from time to time as a 256 glitch. This random power up is usually the power you're going to unlock next. Some examples of power ups are giant, fire, lava, laser, magnet and so on. As you progress the power ups get more interesting. You can also level up your power ups with the virtual currency you get in the game which will usually increase the duration of the power up. To no surprise there's also the standard power pill that shows up in every game which turns the ghosts blue and allows you to eat the ghosts.\n\nThis game is very polished. I didn't find any bug or complication whatsover. It's an easy enough game to just start playing. There's a lot of attention to detail. For example the game tells you how many pellets you ate non stop both with a small non distracting number on the side of pacman and with a faster eating sound the more pellets you get. You also get a score for that particular feat. You also have a very useful bar on top of the screen that tells you how long until your power up ends. You also have missions in each game to help you get currency to level up your power ups and keep you interested. The current mission shows up at the start of each level.\n\nThe color of the ghosts tell you which way they'll try to get you. Blue ghosts will just circle around, orange ghosts just randomly travel through the maze, pink ghosts will ram against you when you're found, black ghosts are sleeping until you get close and follow until you get far enough for the ghost go to sleep again and the red ghosts will follow you indefinitely. There are also lines of ghosts. The green line just goes from one side to the other and the purple ghosts follow which side you're on. You need to know these patterns to get better scores.\n\nThere are many themes in this game. You can choose one for every game and that's fine if you want to get used to one particular theme but I find it more interesting to just let the game chose one randomly each game. The colors and icons were designed so that you understand what's going on even if you have random themes.\n\nOverall this game is a very addicting and easy to play, just like early arcade games, with a touch of modern features. If you like arcade games this one is definitely a keeper.\n\n[h1]Edit[/h1]\n\nFixed writting mistakes.", "timestamp_created": 1498954508, "timestamp_updated": 1517769343, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668120", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33075781": {"recommendationid": "33075781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273939997", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518351172}, "language": "german", "review": "Like it :D", "timestamp_created": 1498901573, "timestamp_updated": 1498901693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33056215": {"recommendationid": "33056215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109316851", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518879356}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like this as much as the Pac-Man Championship Edition and DX versions - namely because they've changed far too much.

Played from a 2.5D perspective, the biggest feature of this installment is the 256 bit glitch that will constantly follow you from the bottom of the screen, making time an important element of the game, as you can no longer dance around the same spot for too long and must constantly be on the move to avoid the glitch catching up with you. Unfortunately there are only 2 game modes, a single player mode, and a multiplayer mode for up to 4 players via local play, but even with that in mind, Pac-Man's addictive nature will make the hours pass without even realizing, especially when playing with friends. \n\nAs much as I loved playing alone and collect more coins to upgrade my power-ups, the real fun begins when up to 3 other friends join you for a local multiplayer session, something that few games in this age even consider, and Pac-Man 256 does that so well. As the glitch will constantly follow you, sticking around for too long is not an option, which means that players cannot be too far apart, making multiplayer on a single screen feel natural and the movement fluid. There is no split-screen needed and all you need to do is pass another controller to a friend and you're playing together on one single large screen; fast forward one hour later and you will still be there trying to beat the high score.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThis is still Pac-Man in every possible way, but the new features, power-ups and tweaks to the formula make it feel like a fresh experience, and thanks to 21 different power-ups there is a lot to play around with. Each power-up can be upgraded with coins in order to increase duration and finding the best combination to suit your play style is the key to success, as you can only equip 3 power-ups at a time, which means that once inside the match only the selected power-ups will spawn, in addition to the famous Power Pellet. \n\nEven if at its core multiplayer mode is still the same thing, the fact that you can respawn other downed players makes matches much longer, and once you and your friends get that perfect combination of momentum and power-ups, you will constantly push for a bigger high score, which is pretty much all you have going on since there are no additional modes, but do not underestimate the power of leaderboards, as the desire to make it to the top feels just as genuine now as it did back in the 80s. \n\nIn terms of enemies you will still have to face Blinky, Inky, Pinky, and Clyde, in addition to their new friend Glitchy, each one of them having a unique AI pattern that you must learn first in order to succeed. Even though there is no tutorial to teach you which ghost follows which pattern if you aren't familiar with Pac-Man already, just playing a few matches should teach you that in a matter of minutes. Same thing applies to power-ups and trying them all before deciding on the three that best fit your play style is just as important, as players who prefer avoiding the ghosts might find the Freeze power-up more useful than the Laser for example, which is aimed towards the players that aim to eliminate every single ghosts in their path.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nEven if the resolution and design quality are obviously better than they were back in the arcades, Pac-Man 256 still has an 8 bit style, but with a large number of skins inspired by previous installments in the Pac-Man franchise, you can choose the one that catches your eye and just go with that. However, skins don't change the overall layout of the map or the play style in any way, and are made purely for aspect purposes. \n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nSound is just as your remember it, with a better quality of course, but all the death sounds and pac munches are still the same, which definitely helps with the nostalgia element this game wants to pass along to the player. There are obviously new sounds made for the power-ups, and they fit nicely with the rest of the sounds that probably any kid who grew up playing Pac-Man could recognize in an instant. \n\n[b]Extras[/b]\nSadly, whether you choose to play alone or with friends locally, that one mode is all you get, however playing with power-ups and collecting coins to max out each one of them and unlock all of the achievements can keep you busy for 20 hours at least. Skins are a nice addition, but apart from changing the aspect, they don't change anything to the gameplay itself. \n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nPac-man 256 is a pleasant throwback to the times when video games used to be much more simple, yet still entertaining at the same time and reminds us why Pacman is still one of the most influential video games of all time, decades later still managing to be as addictive and fun as it was when it first came out.\n[u]Rating: 8.4[/u]\n\n[h1][b]Check out the full review at [url=http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=199&p=196]GameDragons.Net[/url][/b][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1495635079, "timestamp_updated": 1515507550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580399", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31933077": {"recommendationid": "31933077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360109741", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500315623}, "language": "romanian", "review": "Nu cred c\u0103 exist\u0103 vreun gamer care s\u0103 nu fi auzit despre Pac-Man.

For me - it's a [b]legend[/b]. You collect dots and try to escape from evil monsters known as \"ghosts\".\n\n[b]Why choose PAC-MAN 256 amongst all other Pac-mans on Steam?[/b] - there are lots of different answers to it, and I'll start by listing them:\n[list]\n[*] PAC-MAN 256 does not go far from original Pac-man, unlike some other Pac-mans on Steam.\n[*] It has various power-ups which make game more interesting. Getting new power-ups and upgrading them takes decent amount of time, so you don't have to worry about game being very easy or too hard to advance.\n[*] Backgrounds/themes. You might not like to play on same background again and again. PAC-MAN 256 has feature to change your background theme - you can either use theme from original Pac-Man or change one for each round.\n[*] Multiplayer. Although it's called \"multiplayer\", it's actually old styled multiplayer. And what's that? - It's 2 player game mode on same keyboard. It's a thing I, personally, [b]love[/b].\n[*] Windows XP support! Guess what? - most of the Pac-mans on Steam does not support WinXP. What of it? - Pac-man was released in 1980, so it just makes me feel good when I see WinXP or earlier in support requirements' tab. [spoiler]I actually tested game on WinXP (SP3). It works very well![/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n[b]\"Game's not as perfect as you describe, right?\"[/b] - you'll ask. Of course not... There are some minuses to PAC-MAN 256.\nFirst of all, this so called \"glich\" was a very disapointment for me when I first launched game. There's not enough description on store page, so people will most likely be confused when they discover that there's something coming from bottom to \"eat\" you...

The view has been tilted weirdly (as if you were looking over the shoulder of someone playing the original Pac-Man), a ton of skins and powerups (which are unlocked and upgraded via coins collected in-game) have been introduced and the game forces you to move on constantly by destroying the level behind you as time goes by. Apart from those tweaks, it is very much a classic Pac-Man game.\nThe weird name is probably a reference to the weird obsession with the powers of 2 in the progress system. You need 2, then 4, then 8 and all the way up to 2048 coins to upgrade a power fully. Unless of course it really is the 256th opus in the franchise... Could be, for all I know.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Classic Pac-Man gameplay\n[*] Procedurally generated levels alleviate repetitivity somewhat\n[*] Quest system gives something to focus on and pushes to try all powerups eventually\n[*] Great variety of ghost behaviors\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Titled view takes some getting used to\n[*] Some skins are harder to read than others\n[*] Retro sounds that might be grating for some and almost no music\n[*] Progress system requires a LOT of mindless grinding to upgrade all powers (which is required for an achievement)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nIf you loved the classic Pac-Man and played it a lot, chances are you'll have a good time on this game.

Unlike the original game, you make progress by continually moving up the screen rather than trying to clear all of the dots in a given area. The goal is to reach the highest score possible, and you'll do that by eating ghosts, collecting power-ups and making combos of up to 256 dots. Getting a 256 combo can be quite challenging; ghosts (many of which behave in different ways) will try to stop your progress, and like in the original game you'll have to either avoid them or eat them with power pellets. \n\nThe game works well with either a keyboard or a controller. There are also different level skins unlocked from the get go, which include ones themed after previous Pac-man games, such as the Championship Edition series. There's also Steam leaderboard support for both highest score and number of 256 combos. Unlocking and upgrading the various power ups will serve as incentive to keep playing, but I found chasing higher scores was more than enough of a reason to return. \n\nPAC-MAN 256 is well worth checking out!", "timestamp_created": 1491019914, "timestamp_updated": 1491019914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30813483": {"recommendationid": "30813483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353961565", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518687709}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u52066342\u5206\u3002\u8d5e\u4e00\u4e2a", "timestamp_created": 1490794841, "timestamp_updated": 1490794841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30810720": {"recommendationid": "30810720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021726329", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491044799}, "language": "english", "review": "PAC-MAN 256 is an endless arcade version of the classic pac-man formula with a twist, which is the glitch that is slowly consuming the area starting from the bottom.  Hence, you have to run away from the glitch in addition to the different coloured ghosts.\n\nThere are 14 different maps that looks different aesthetically (but all plays the same as there is only one game mode) but more maps might be added in the future as this game is still being supported and updated by the developer despite being almost a year old.\n\nThis game can get boring after playing for awhile as there are no story elements or real objective to drive you to play more. The only motivation is to collect dots to unlock new powerups and coins to upgrade the powerups. The required amount of dots and coins to upgrade and unlock all the power-ups are insanely high and you are required to grind through the game alot of times in order to use new power-ups or the upgraded version of them.\n\nHowever, the game is still fun in small doses, but I believe there are still better games out there to spent your time on. I would recommend this game to Pac-Man fans as it is still a good game but the grinding element is really a turn off for me.

In 256 one hit kills you, and you are supposed to die at some point anyway, so you can deposit your bloody coins, which takes quite a bit of the excitement of progressing out of it.\n- The maps didn't go on forever, so it wasn't just about dodging a ghost once, but what you did after that, and after that. Sometimes you had to exploit the ghost's AI to escape, such as scaring away Clyde or confusing Pinky. That's what Pac-Man was all about, for me, so this game doesn't even get nostalgia points because it \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s it up. \n\nSo after 255 sequels this series has actually gotten worse. \n\nThere is one cool mechanic in 256, actually, which is how as you eat pellets in an unbroken chain, and your combo increases, the sound effect frequency increases, until, after a minute or so, the beat is out of control and it climaxes in a satisfying screen-wiping explosion.

Inspired by the infamous level 256 where due to memory limitations half of the level would glitch out this game has the bottom portion of the screen constantly being eaten up by a glitch forcing you to run away and continue upwards. \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThis game retains the awesome mechanics of the original... Eat, eat, eat and run from ghosts. The original ghosts are all back as well as the addition of a new ghost glitchy. This port from the original does have some changes. They have removed all the microtransactions which is a welcome feature and have added the option to play multiplayer! Co-op play in this is a blast. It gets very tense and if you die your team mate will have the opportunity to revive you. You can work together to unlock new power ups and continue to improve your score.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nThe graphics are off the hook! you have never seen such cutting edge pixels in your life! it will make your eyes bleed! In all seriousness this is a great presentation. It keeps the feel of the old while updating it and making it feel like something fresh and new. There are several different themes that you can choose from including the developers previous title crossy road.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nAll together I think one of the freshest takes on Pac-Man in recent years, and possibly even since its inception. A lot of fun to play in short bursts and true to its source material. I definitely recommend to people looking for a challenge or something as a quick burst of fun that you will keep coming back to.\n\n[h1]5 Pacs out of 5!!![/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1489745046, "timestamp_updated": 1489745247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30501845": {"recommendationid": "30501845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285953838", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520176831}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun well thought out modern take on a true arcade classic!", "timestamp_created": 1489465485, "timestamp_updated": 1489465485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30479480": {"recommendationid": "30479480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271706901", "num_games_owned": 1119, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502050247}, "language": "english", "review": "As addicting as the original and even more fun.

What's better is that each type (color) of ghost has a special behavior, so you know what they'll try to do as you approach. If you can swerve accordingly, gaining points, power-ups, etc, I imagine the maze is infinite.\n\nThe power-ups are fun, though some are definitely better than others. You can pick up coins in the maze, and earn bonus coins for completing missions (and earn random coin \"gift\" boxes) that you can spend on leveling up your power-ups. The power-ups have a limited time that can be extended by eating other power-up pellets, in order to chain your power-up to make it last as long as possible. Though the easiest to \"chain\" is the original Power-Pellet because you also gain extra time for eating ghosts (whereas the other power-ups \"kill\" them).\n\nI can't recommend this game enough.

Le meccaniche sono quasi le medesime del gioco originale ma il livello prosegue all'infinito generandosi in maniera procedurale (anche i \"set\" sono veramente pochi e in breve temppo si imparer\u00e0 a riconoscerli) e, quindi, l'obiettivo passa dal ripulire il livello al fuggire dal glitch che ci insegue cercando di far salire il punteggio e di evitare i fantasmini.\n\nFantasmini che troveremo in enormi quantit\u00e0 nel livello e che in maniera un po' infame pu\u00f2 capitare che ci attacchino da dei \"punti ciechi\" al di fuori dello schermo (quelli rosa in particolare) senza poterci difendere efficacemente da loro.

Maybe there's none. \nMaybe it was just throwback to childhood where Pacman was serious thing and with Donkey Kong like king of the gaming. \n\nNow, should you really get sentimental over the game when you're reviewing it? Definitely yes. Why? Because main reason games are (and should be) here is not state of being perfect and without errors, but actually be able to stuck in your mind and bring you joy and smile on your face when you play them. So most definitely sentimental reviews are true picture of that certain game.\n\nThis Pacman is not really that extraordinary. Yes, there are powerups and some of them are really cool, you can do local co-op so if you have some mates who love nostalgia, then you can go back in time . Tradings cards are bonus. Game will last you between 2-3 hours, depends on how you play it. Overall gaming experience is pretty nice and game is really enjoyable.\n\nI'm not sure if there is much more to say. If you got it in Humble, then good for you, if you played Pacman as child, then definitely play this game, if you want easy achievements then go for it and if you want only cards then you suck.\n\n[b]Bonus Point: Retro is Back[/b]\n[h1]Rating: 8/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1488552306, "timestamp_updated": 1488552306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810552", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30292577": {"recommendationid": "30292577", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306270568", "num_games_owned": 1562, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488539088}, "language": "english", "review": "Although it's a really old game \n(it's older than me at least hah)\nit is also funny today.\n\nYou can play it with your roomates or friends\nalso you can play alone \nbut I think play with friends can kill more time\n(....it's painful if you have a stupid friend)\n\nIT'S ALSO TELLING US THAT \nno matter how hard you have tried, you will dle in the end !!!\nso sad...\nOR\nA fat boy eat too much cant be a good runner....\n\n               9/10\nA good game to kill time", "timestamp_created": 1488537100, "timestamp_updated": 1488586641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544443", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30285444": {"recommendationid": "30285444", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997934524", "num_games_owned": 1437, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489559089}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic spin on the classic that stays true to classic Pac-Man while being supremely addictive. Basically it's an infinite Pac-Man maze where you have to survive as long as possible, and you get bonus points if you manage to eat 256 consecutive dots. To keep things fresh, you basically play to unlock further power-ups which make you more and more powerful. It's a good progression that makes you really want to play one more game to get the next powerup, but doesn't feel like a grind. Each round gives a great sense of progress and I topped out the final power-up after about 10 hours of play, which felt like good value and even now I find myself still playing just to top my old scores. Pac-Man 256 isn't quite as flashy or over-the-top as the also-excellent Championship games, but I feel like there's more room for strategizing with how you can pick what powerups you want, and there's a great sense of split-second decision making: Do I go for the powerup or try to keep the dot chain going? Can I keep this going, or should I escape the ghosts? Stuff like that makes the game fun and exciting and it feels like no two rounds are ever quite the same.

Using that as the inspiration, this game involves trying to get away from that glitch by making it into an endless runner.  By changing the formula, does it result in a better game?\n\nBeing made by the same people that made the mobile game [i]Crossy Road[/i], the game has the same look and feel of that game.  The graphics shared the same block look of that game.  One thing that is good about this is that for those that prefer a different look, the game offers multiple styles to customize it to the player's taste.  From the Namco's [i]Pac-Mania[/i] and [i]Rally-X[/i] to Hipster Whale's [i]Crossy Road[/i] and even a few surreal styles like an office, a garden, and inside a computer, the variety makes it that there is something for everybody.  There is even an option to randomize it to make each game feel different every time.\n\nJust like classic [i]Pac-Man[/i], the player has to go through mazes while eating dots, power ups, and bonus items while avoiding the ghosts.  Since it was also made by the same company that made [i]Crossy Road[/i], the game also involves constant forward movement to avoid the glitch\u2014the thing where the title's 256 came from.  Besides the classic power pellets, new power ups like lasers and fire and new ways to attack the ghost or protect the player\u2014all of which are upgradable through coins collected through gameplay.  Additionally, the game keeps tracks of not only your own score, but the scores of your friends as well.  This makes that the player has incentive keep playing to beat their friend's score.  \n\nEven with these updates, there is one big problem with the game.  Unlike the classic games, the game involves constantly moving forward instead of clearing each maze.  This makes it that the player has to move forward constantly instead of going after every dot.  Since each pattern will pass in just a few seconds, the maze will start repeating after only a couple of minutes.  Even with the extra looks mentioned before, it does not change the fact that it is the same few maze patterns looping around.  Despite the new features, it does not take long before the game feels like a big case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\nOne thing that brings the gameplay above its mobile roots is that up to four players can play at the same time.  Each player selects their look, and they work with (or against) each other to fight the ghosts.  The combined scored will be on the top just like the singleplayer mode.  As for the individual scores, they appear on the side where the friend scores normally appear.  Unlike the single player, it does not necessarily mean game over when an enemy catches you.  Once something catches a player, a spinning Pac-Man item will appear.  Grabbing it will bring the dead player back.  This is one way that the game allows players choose to work with or against each.  If they want help, grabbing it means more ways to attack the ghosts.  However, if treating the game like a versus game, players can leave it alone to boost their own score.  This makes that you will even question what kind of game you are in once you are waiting to see if the other players will bring you back or not.  With this level of unpredictability, the multiplayer is much better overall experience than the single player game.\n\nWhether this game is worth playing depends on how people will play with it.  As a single player game, it will get old fast.  However, by adding multiplayer, the game has enough life to justify continuous play.  Make sure that you plan to play with other players.

Most importantly, they do make the gameplay rather unfair too. Even in the original PAC-MAN you sometimes end up in unwinnable situations, but in PAC-MAN 256 this is a far too common occurance as you can only see a small section of the (infinite) level around you.\n\nThe loadout system on the other hand feels like a pointless addition and the only justification for its existance seems to be the microtransactions in the original mobile release. The microtransactions are thankfully gone in the Steam version, but that doesn't make the rather grindy unlocks any more exciting or meaningful.\n\nOverall I didn't feel that PAC-MAN 256 adds much to the original game, you are much better off playing the far superior PAC-MAN Championship Edition instead.\n\nThe good:\n- The core Pac-Man gameplay still holds up well\n\nThe bad:\n- The upgrade system feels extremely grindy and pointless\n- The random levels lead to too many unfair situations", "timestamp_created": 1487685672, "timestamp_updated": 1487685889, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30075789": {"recommendationid": "30075789", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970649200", "num_games_owned": 378, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488230418}, "language": "english", "review": "Great formula.

It is an endless arcade game where you, controlling PAC-MAN, navigate your way through a maze, collecting dots along the way. Unlike the traditional PAC-MAN game, however, the maze is endless in the vertical direction. Using procedural generation, you must navigate your way upwards, while being pursued by the glitch \u2013 a wave of numbers, garbage characters, and darkness which gradually eats up the maze from below.\n\nThe title of this game \u2013 and the wave of darkness that pursues you \u2013 are references to a glitch in the original PAC-MAN game, where the 256th level created a bunch of garbage on the screen, generating an impassible kill-screen.\n\nThe game itself is very reminiscient of PAC-MAN, but is somewhat more sophisticated; there\u2019s about twice as many ghost types, each of which have their own behavioral pattern. If PAC-MAN touches any ghost or the wall of glitches at the bottom of the screen, it is game over.\n\nOrange ghosts try to go to the bottom of the screen, choosing to turn towards the horizontal side of the screen that PAC-MAN is on, but always turning down when able.\n\nRed ghosts pursue PAC-MAN endlessly.\n\nPink Ghosts will remain dormant until PAC-MAN comes into a straight line with them, at which point the ghost will fly towards PAC-MAN at a speed faster than PAC-MAN\u2019s own.\n\nGrey ghosts will sleep until PAC-MAN approaches, then pursue PAC-MAN via the shortest route.\n\nTeal ghosts will circle endlessly around a certain portion of the map, generally a single wall; this can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior, though, as they can also circle the OUTSIDE of the map, which can make them somewhat unpredictable when first spotted.\n\nGreen Ghosts always appear in groups of 3-4, and move a bit slower than PAC-MAN in a horizontal back-and-forth manner.\n\nPurple Ghosts are similar to Green Ghosts, but move back and forth much more slowly, but will track PAC-MAN\u2019s horizontal movement; you must move around them reasonably quickly (or use a power-up) to get past them.\n\nGlitch ghosts constantly change color, and occasionally teleport around the battlefield; they pursue the player somewhat slowly.\n\nAll of this combines to make the core gameplay a bit different from normal PAC-MAN, but still familiar in many ways.\n\nThere are power-ups that you can pick up over the course of the game to kill ghosts with or to do other things. In addition to the basic power pills which turn ghosts blue, slowing them down and allowing you to eat them by running over them (and scoring ever more points by doing so), there are 21 powerups with various other effects. About half of them are variations on the power pill, but with added powers \u2013 one leaves a firey trail behind you, another shoots a laser beam in front of PAC-MAN, a third turns all ghosts in a radius around PAC-MAN into cherries, fruit which also appear naturally and give you extra points and a point multiplier.\n\nThe other half of the abilities are stranger. There are a couple of abilities that create roving entities that home in on ghosts and kill them for you, but don\u2019t make PAC-MAN himself invincible. There are some abilities which simply slow down ghosts, which are pretty bad abilities, but one of them also gives you the ability to score a bunch of extra points (generally inferior to just killing ghosts, though). One creates static traps around the map to kill ghosts, and a couple allow PAC-MAN to gather dots, power-ups, and fruits in a wider radius.\n\nYou may select up to three of these abilities before you start each game, and the abilities are gradually unlocked by eating dots. The abilities can also be levelled-up by spending in-game currency on them, found via random loot drops after games, as well as by completing various tasks that the game gives you (such as eating five apples, or killing 20 ghosts with the tornado power-ups).\n\nWhile all of this combines to make the game feel like it has a bit more of a point than a standard PAC-MAN game, in the end the game here is very simple, and it starts to get pretty samey after a while. While adding the unlockable power-ups makes the game a bit more interesting, and the various quests add a slight spin on things, the reality is that the game itself is very samey \u2013 there is a multiplayer mode and a single-player mode, but both are just endlessly running down a maze which, in the end, doesn\u2019t have all that many variations on it.\n\nIt is a kind of mindless game, and it isn\u2019t bad for what it is. But what it is isn\u2019t exactly aiming for the stars; it is an extremely simplistic game, and most people will likely get bored with it pretty quickly. It is ultimately a bit of a time-waster, and probably better suited for mobile gaming than sitting down and playing it at a PC \u2013 it is just not a very sophisticated game. As such, it is difficult for me to recommend it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487661525, "timestamp_updated": 1487661525, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30062024": {"recommendationid": "30062024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059578686", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1520638833}, "language": "english", "review": "A phenomenally fun way to waste a good hour.", "timestamp_created": 1487611460, "timestamp_updated": 1487611460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30060562": {"recommendationid": "30060562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070591221", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488383096}, "language": "turkish", "review": "[b] Ba\u015flarda \"Ya PC'ye niye \u00e7\u0131karm\u0131\u015flar bunu?

What the hell happend to PAC-MAN? I realise that this is a Free-2-Play mobile game, which makes it an extra kick in the teeth that I bought this, but this is pretty bad. \n\nThis game was made soley to sink time into. There is no fun anywhere in this. Just die and restart. It follows the model of games like Flappy Bird or Temple Run where you see how far you can get and try and beat your high score. I know that the original Pac-Man was pretty basic but atleast that had levels. That had extra lifes. That was a fun and progressively challenging game that you could master by putting time into it. You could figure out the patterns of each of the Ghosts and use that knowledge to trick them and get past them. This game trys that but just fails miserably. How the hell am I meant to figure out how to dodge a teleporting enemy? Whats the point in trying to get the highscore? You don't progress. There is no end game. \n\nAlso, who decided that Pac-Man needed a load out? Why do I need to customize and upgrade my loadout? The only point in that whole system is to make you play the game more. It gives you a false sense of progression. After you die and complete challenges you get coins. The amount of coins is so little that you have to play the game for hours on end to actually fully upgrade your loadout. This is just a facade to make you think that you are playing a game wqith actual substance. Plus, why have about 20 different weapons when there are only like 3 good ones? And about 5 of the weapons are just better versions of earlier ones. So why upgrade the earlier weapons? Whats the point if its gonna get replaced by a better version of itself?\n\nHonestly, I hated every second of this game. Since my first attempt when I booted it up, to the ten more hours of time put into it (Im one of those guys/assholes that likes Achievements). If your thinking about playing this, get the phone version first and see if you can play it for an hour. If you are not incredibly bored by then, by all means buy the game. But if you get bored after the first couple attempts like I did, then do not buy this. It doesnt get any better.

And it's not like video game designers don't spend a lot of time trying to capitalize on nostalgia for the old coin-op days, but they almost never nail it like this.\n\nSo, like, you're playing Pac-Man.  The mechanics are sort of like you might remember.  But it's an endless level, constantly growing in one direction while killscreen-style glitches eat it from the other side.  And it's isometric instead of straight-up top-down, there are more ghosts than you might be used to, and a wider variety of powerups, but for the most part everything still has that old Pac-Man feel to it.  Everything's congruent with that old Buckner & Garcia vibe.

it randomly generates an infinite map and you only have one life. It has multiple powerups which you unlock in addition to the standard power pellets. A slow wave of corruption destroys the map behind you and keeps a forward momentum.\n\nUnfortunately, this exists in a universe where PAC-MAN Championship Edition exists, which was a lightning-fast modernization. Comparatively, PAC-MAN 256 feels slow and awkward. The new power-ups are cute but mostly just add randomness. And the randomness is part of the problem - sometimes you can have a smooth ride, but sooner or later you'll get into a no-win situation. Now, no-win corners are nothing new to PAC-MAN, but Championship Edition at least makes them predictable enough to avoid most of the time. Because PAC-MAN 256 is random, you can get randomly f-ed. Worst of all, it's a PAC-MAN game with grinding. Grinding! Yes! That's what PAC-MAN was missing! You can pick up coins to increase the duration or radius or whatever of some of the random power-ups. It's an attempt to add replay value to the game, but... it just kind of showcases how shallow the gameplay can be.\n\nIt's not the worst way to spend your time, but Championship Edition is a much better way. In a world where CE didn't exist, it'd probably be a welcome update. In a world where CE does exist, all PAC-MAN 256 does is bow to modern trends (endless! grinding! random!) to the game's general detriment.\n\nPlayed to the top of my local leaderboards as far as I can tell, and left it at that.", "timestamp_created": 1486827518, "timestamp_updated": 1486827547, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467986", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29849508": {"recommendationid": "29849508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025750807", "num_games_owned": 613, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486922241}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun experience in local co op.

And it's a GOOD GAME. Who cares if it's a mobile port? It's a GOOD mobile port with full controller support and up to 4-player co-op madness on the same computer which is a blast by the way. \n\nBeing a fan of Crossy Road and seeing the same dev work on this gave me hope for it to be a top notch time waster and it is. While I don't expect people to put in hundreds of hours, I can see picking it up for an hour or two here and there with friends especially because it is fun and it plays very well. And honestly, the $5 price tag is very fair, that's less than the cost of a day's lunch. Do yourself a favor and pick this game up even at the full $5 price tag if you're impatient, it's a lot of fun in short bursts and it's something you can come back to and/or play with friends for even more fun. It's worth the price to support such a great developer. \n\nOh, and it's TINY and not resource heavy at all. It's less than 100MB but packs a ton of fun in that bite size download.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that after playing a bit more I'm having even more fun with this game. I recently purchased Pac-Man Championship Edition 2 and was completely disappointed in how bad it was considering how good the first one was. So I went back to Pac-Man 256 and haven't looked back. It's pretty sad when a small time indie dev creates a game with minimal resources and it's way better than a game by a company with almost limitless amounts of cash and they're in the same vein.

Go play that. That was fun. So fun. Go play that. Don't play this. This is boring. This sucks. This is not fun. Okay we all know Pacman. They trot it out every now and again. Another version in another place. I actually recall when it first came out. It was on the radio. The newsradio guy was giving someone money for each dot they gobbled. And we were listening to it. Not watching it. It was weird. But then listening to friends talk about how they got their record of second key and such. That was kind of thrilling and important. There were rules to pacman then. I dunno what happened. So they took Pacman's flat screen and they bent it isometrically like a rhombus or paralleligram. And you no longer just go around the maze. YOu go up. Up and up and up. See you are being chased by the kill screen characters from below. Just like Nihilumbra void. Don't touch that! It's evil!. And the ghosts are there and they brought a million cousins. So there aren't 4....there can be like 12 at once sometimes. Yes that sucks and you will lose. A lot. But this isn't your grandma's pacman. You don't get 3 lives plus your bonus life. YOu die? that's it. YOu die. And then you continue. You ever continue. So you always have one life. And you always continue. And you get goals. They keep track of how many dots in a row you eat but they put breaks in the dots everywhere so you won't get a long continuous thing. At least you have to watch out for that if you care as well as watch for ghosts. There are more types of ghosts now. Speedy sits and waits then srpings after you as you enter his site. There is grey sleepy ghost that wakees when you get close. There is 4 x congaline of ghosts. And of course Inky and Clyde are always chasing you. Then later Blinky shows up in multiple numbers. So yeah when you eat powerpellets, you can still eat ghosts. But they don't go to a box. They just go away but as you are always going up you will always find MORE ghosts. However there are more ways to kill ghosts. There are freeze pellets, there are bombs, there are lasers, there is fire, there is stealth....lots of gimmicks. But it doesn't matter. Just as they did in the past they will blockade and corner you and you die. And then you continue. An endless stream of worthless consciousness with un satisfying goals, excrutaing gameplay and ....just....really bad graphics. The ghosts and pacman all are like cardboard cutouts stood up on the playing field. They are thicker like cardboard sets and when you die your body exploeds into pixelated yellow pellets. It just looks unpolished.  And the worst part of all is what they did with the theme. They turned it into some hiphop backbeat version.

I played the board game where a plastic Pac-Man physically chomps white marbles. I played Ms Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man in arcades. I played Pac-Mania in arcades (I liked that one; you can jump!). I really like the 2D platformer Pac-Land (until you get to the bit with several springboards in succession). I played Pac-Man Pinball on the GBA (<3). I watched Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures on TV. I think Pac-Man in Smash Bros on the Wii U is a hoot.\n\nI really like Pac-Man, as a character.\n\nBut... to be honest, I don't like the original base game of Pac-Man very much. It inspires a strange combination of boredom and fear. At the time, back in those early days, I always felt like... \"but Mr Do does the same thing but better!\"\n\nAnd I don't really get along that well with Pac-Man Championship Edition, or Pac-Man Battle Royale.\n\nBut I like this game. It's a short format, it's different every time, the enemies feel more distinct and their patterns easy to read, the dot combo mechanic and its sound effects are pretty intense, and there's a real feeling of progression every time you play as you unlock new power-ups. And I like the concept of it; that it's based on the level 256 glitch weirdness.\n\nI got this game in a Humble Bundle for $1. Very happy with it. Also - I've never played the mobile version. \n\nAll these years of putting myself through so many Pac-Man maze games I didn't *really* like, and it paid off in the end!", "timestamp_created":

It's a great game, even more fun with people to play with, wish there was more skins to choose from though, at least character wise in co-op mode.\n\n9/10\nwill rate higher if upscaled resolutions are fixed or more skins :D\n", "timestamp_created": 1486004516, "timestamp_updated": 1486004516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568918", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29640789": {"recommendationid": "29640789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139254902", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486004084}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u5728\u54e5\u54e5\u5bb6\u73a9\u8fc7\uff0c\u65f6\u9694\u5c06\u8fd120\u5e74\u518d\u73a9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u72b9\u65b0", "timestamp_created": 1486004280, "timestamp_updated": 1486004280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29640138": {"recommendationid": "29640138", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974085922", "num_games_owned": 748, "num_reviews": 248, "playtime_forever": 141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486000825}, "language": "english", "review": "This game inspired me to curse loudly alone in my apartment.

Los potenciadores son las armas que podremos usar contra los fantasmas, como rayos, l\u00e1ser, tornados, bombas, etc. El juego nos obliga a ir avanzando hacia arriba en el nivel puesto que abajo ir\u00e1 apareciendo \"el error\" que viene a por ti, otro de los puntos m\u00e1s originales del juego.\n\nCompar\u00e1ndolo con su gran competidor, Pac-Man: Championship Edition DX+, no sabr\u00eda decir cual es mejor. Cada uno es bueno a su manera, incluyendo modos de juego que los diferencian entre s\u00ed como para hacerse con ambos si eres fan del cl\u00e1sico. Quiz\u00e1 Pac-Man: Championship Edition DX+ es m\u00e1s fren\u00e9tico y m\u00e1s espectacular visualmente, auque menos \"bonito\" y peor acabado. Pac-Man 256 es algo m\u00e1s fiel al cl\u00e1sico, m\u00e1s pausado y tranquilo. Las novedades de Pac-Man 256 hacen que sea imprescindible tambi\u00e9n para los fans de este cl\u00e1sico, sobre todo por los potenciadores y los modos multijugador local. Os dejo mi lista de pros y contras: \n\nPROS:\n\n- S\u00faper adictivo\n\n- Luce bastante bien\n\n- Sonidos cl\u00e1sicos\n\n- Muy fiel al original, encantar\u00e1 a los nost\u00e1lgicos\n\n- La sensaci\u00f3n de agobio que crea ver c\u00f3mo nos alcanza el \"error\"\n\n- Incluye modos de juego originales\n\n- 10 skins diferentes para cambiar totalmente la est\u00e9tica \n\n- El control responde muy bien tanto con mando como con teclado\n\n- Incluye un modo multijugador local de hasta 4 personas que aumenta mucho la vida \u00fatil del juego\n\n- Muy rejugable\n\n- Una vez se avanza y se consiguen los potenciadores, el juego se vuelve espectacular\n\n- Tiene logros Steam, alguno requerir\u00e1 bastantes horas de juego para conseguirlo\n\n- Tiene sistema de guardado de la partida en la nube Steam Cloud\n\n- Tiene cromos Steam\n\n- Continuamente recibe actualizaciones y mejoras\n\n- Suele estar a menos de 5\u20ac en las ofertas de Steam\n\n\nCONTRAS:\n\n- Totalmente en ingl\u00e9s, a diferencia de la versi\u00f3n para m\u00f3viles que s\u00ed est\u00e1 perfectamente traducida\n\n- A pesar de la variedad de temas, da la sensaci\u00f3n de que estamos repitiendo una y otra vez lo mismo en el mismo nivel\n\n- La interfaz no es muy intuitiva, se hace un poco pesado tener que volver siempre al men\u00fa principal cada vez que morimos\n\n- Se puede echar en falta algo de m\u00fasica\n\n- S\u00f3lo incluye 10 logros\n\n- Algunos potenciadores se parecen bastante entre s\u00ed\n\n- No es tan fren\u00e9tico y divertido como Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+\n\n- No hubiera estado mal a\u00f1adir tambi\u00e9n multijugador online\n\nCONCLUSI\u00d3N: A\u00f1adidos interesantes en esta nueva versi\u00f3n de Pac-Man.

The controls are superb, the various map styles are (mostly) all excellent, and the sounds and power-up feedback are all pitch perfect.\n\nIf you enjoy Pac-Man gameplay, this is an excellent experience.  It takes a couple of hours of gameplay to get all the power-ups unlocked, quite a bit more to power them all up fully, but once you get them all unlocked and get the most powerful ones levelled up to 8, you can compete in the leaderboards with no issues other than your own skill and patience.\n\nProbably the [b]best[/b] thing about this game, which I love the most, is that it doesn't artifically ramp up the difficulty as it progresses.  The difficulty is constant, so getting a high score is largely about mastering the gameplay, being careful and simply not screwing up.

In this game, the Missingno-esque wall of glitchiness actively advances towards you from the bottom of the screen, and you have to endlessly make your way upwards while eating as many dots as you can. It's a neat idea, and it works. Along the way there are ghosts to avoid, Power Pellets to even the odds, cherries, strawberries, apples, oranges and melons to eat, and 21 different power-ups that are unlocked as you play.\n\nThe Power-Ups are mostly pretty cool. There's lasers and fire and icicles and traps and bombs and beams and tornados and they're unlocked in an orderly fashion that keeps the gameplay fresh. You can only choose three Power-Ups at a time to show up in the maze, but whichever one is next to be unlocked will occasionally fly down and give you a brief taste of things to come. The Power-Ups occasionally repeat though, so you'll start the game with Lasers, and later earn Optics, which are exactly the same as Lasers except they fire around corners as well, making them infinitely better. You can unlock a Tornado which chases enemies down, but later you can unlock the Twinado, which is like the Tornado, but there's two of them.\n\nYou unlock the Power-Ups by eating Pac-Dots, but you upgrade them using coins that you can earn by doing missions, which include things like 'Eat a chain of 128 Dots', 'Eat 4 Apples', 'Eat 5 Power Pellets', 'Eat 20 Ghosts', 'Kill 20 Ghosts with the Fire Power-Up', and so on. They never really go up in difficulty, but the majority revolve around eating or using a certain Power-Up, so it's a nice way to force in some variety. And your progress carries over, so you don't have to eat 20 ghosts in a single run if that's a little too challenging for you.\n\nOne of the biggest down-sides is that I've heard that this is a port of a mobile game, and I'm willing to bet that it was one of those 'Free to Play - Fee to Pay' mobile games, because grinding for coins to upgrade your Power-Ups is a nightmare. There are coins in the mazes, but they're only worth 2 or 5, which is terrible when you need to earn more than 85,000 to fully upgrade your arsenal. You get boxes of coins for completing missions, and sometimes just as random free gifts, but they contain random values of either 128, 256, 512 and 1,024. As you may expect, it's most commonly 128, with the thousand only showing up very rarely, maybe once after beating 10 missions.\n\nThat's definitely the biggest problem - the grinding. This is a good game, honestly, but it's not the kind of game I'd want to play for more than 5-6 hours. And it bugs me to know that with every Power-Up unlocked, a decent high score achieved, and all of my favourte Power-Ups fully upgraded, I would still need to spend another 20 or so hours to get the last achievement, because the game wants me to keep playing, but it doesn't know how to make me beyond making the final achievement 'Fully Upgrade Every Power-Up'.\n\nBut if the greatest crime this game commits is 'Wanting me to keep playing for a very long time', then I can sort-of forgive that.

The problem is with the gameplay. Genre-wise, it's a mix of an arcade game with an upgrade'a'thon, and it's hard to tell which part is supposed to be the side one.\n\nIf you try to ignore the upgrade'a'thon, you end up with a rather simple game where you lead Pac-Man amongst the neverending maze, with flood of glitched out glyphs preventing you from returning too far or completely slacking off. The ghosts have some interesting, unusual behaviors, probably tied down to the fact that you are in a neverending maze and not a closed one. You can also get \"dot combos\" by collecting regular pellets without crossing over empty spaces. The thing is, the deciding factor on your score is what will the level generator come up with. A particular oddity is that game occasionally changes minor pellets into upgrade coins and powerups, and the way it works is that pellet disappears and a thing appears a moment later - the thing would keep up the pellet combo, but if pellet gets removed just as you were to collect it, your combo is broken. Add very random locations of powerups, ghosts, and lanes, and it really is a game of luck.\n\nThe upgrade'a'thon part hinges on additional powerups being introduced into the game. Here are the facts: you select three powerups that game will spawn randomly on the field. The power pellets are always spawned but share some mechanics with powerups, most notably that while under effect of a powerup the very same powerup will refill the duration as expected, but other ones will just refill a little of duration of current one, and you can't distibugish visually between other powerups until the current one wears off. You unlock selectable powerups by total of collected regular pellets, and you can upgrade them with upgrade coins, with first upgrade costing 16 upgrade coins and eigth one 2048 upgrade coins. The upgrade coins with value of 2 and 5 spawn rather rarely during gameplay, and there are also traditional missions granting you, randomly, 128/256/512/1024 upgrade coins on fulfillment; the game can also grant you such a reward for no apparent reason. Unlike most upgrade'a'thons with mission system that come to mind, you are only given one mission at a time.\n\nSince regular pellets are placed at roughly same density, or even decreasing one, through the maze, there is little discouragement for dying in the first unlock system. You just grind for powerup selection. How are the upgrade coins? Not much better. Most missions involve collecting specific powerups or making use of them to kill ghosts which also implies collecting them, and there we get back into maze being rather random. The fact that you don't have a wider selection of missions at once also makes this quite annoying. They don't even get harder with time, they stay time-consuming, but that's it; you could probably fulfill all but one of them by playing the game for 20 seconds, intentionally dying, and repeating. At the same time, if you are past the last unlockable powerup and want to just get the upgrades, there is no reason at all to continue a game once you get a mission success prompt, since that's the only real way to get coins and you won't get another mission until acknowledging that one.\n\nThis would perhaps be forgivable if the new powerups actually revived the overrandomized main game. They do not.\n\nThe vast majority of unlockable powerups are based on the concept of killing ghosts. The game introduces no extra buttons compared to original Pac-Man, thus question arises if those powerups are fundamentally different from (still present here) power pellets, and the answer is, quite a few aren't; the biggest yet common difference is that ghosts don't go blue and calm, thus they can rush into you and die. Typically the reach of unlockable powerups is way better than power pellet's one, to be minimally balanced by static scoring, but there are some underpowered aversions. A few powerups don't involve killing ghosts, even less don't involve ghosts at all, some introduce actually interesting kill mechanics. Now, there isn't really much more to the game in the first place, but I think the game would be better if most of these powerups were cut and the rest were made slightly more sophisticated.\n\nAnd then there are upgrades for powerups, which seem to be developed with a template: all involve exclusively increase of powerup duration and/or increase of points gained upon killing a ghost with one. There is one powerup in particular in case of which I'm pretty sure duration increase is more of a downgrade than anything. If you want something else to happen to your favorite powerup, you may find it interesting that latter half of unlocks is full of semi-clones of earlier ones, with some odd upside but usually no marked downside, and with actual usablity improvements varying. The best thing I can say about this is that you can load both into your set of three spawnable powerups, thus reducing randomness for your enjoyment of general arcade part of the game, and also for selected missions in which both powerups work.\n\nAfter some time spent playing, I'm sad to report the game does not really develop compared to where it started.

This is very much a mobile device game in design.  It is very easy to argue that there isn't enough \"game\" to warrant its regular $5 price tag.  I don't recommend it unless it is on sale.\n\nFatal flaws:\nPac-Man 256 quickly becomes a game of luck rather than skill. The limited forward view combined with the design of the maze means that often you have to blindly commit to a path, with danger only being revealed after it is too late to escape.   Sometimes there appears to be no safe path at all, where nothing short of an active power-up could have saved you.  As your score increases, the number of ghosts increase.  In single player, around the 10,000 point mark you will be entirely reliant on your current power up lasting long enough to safely reach the next power up.  (In multi-player, things are a bit different due to some power-ups being replaced with \"revive a fallen player\" items.)\n\nPower-ups themselves leave a bit to be desired.  At first, it looks like there are a large number of power-ups, but some are just \"better\" versions of others.  The different power up designs also vary in effectiveness, a critical flaw when the game has you choosing three power-ups to appear.  Freeze is at best nearly useless, and is too often an outright liability. (Slows ghosts, but the main danger of ghosts is when they are in front of you, not chasing from behind.)  Cloak makes you invulnerable, but other abilities make you both invulnerable and fatal to ghosts.  Abilities like Tornado and Pac-Men are unreliable, sometimes they are highly effective while other times they leave you open to danger.\n\nThe grind is far greater than the game's limited content.  You will unlock new power-ups quickly at first, but this rate soon slows to a crawl.\n\nThere just isn't much to do.  The basic game doesn't change.  There are no alternate modes of play.

You could almost describe this game as Pac-Man + a Roguelike, as the maze is randomly generated out of a large variety of pre-made sections as you go along, with powerups and ghosts placed in random spots.   The idea of the game is simple: You go through the maze as always, eating as many dots as you can, avoiding ghosts, and so on, but in this game the infamous Killscreen Glitch is constantly chasing you.  A solid wall of total gibberish, this is always below your position, and it constantly advances, so you are forced to keep heading upwards further into the maze.  There isnt anything you can do to stop the Glitch, so one way or another, it forces you to keep up a good pace; it's a mechanic that works out pretty well.   It's also honestly just cool to see, they made it look particularly awesome, and the closer you get to it, the more messed up the screen and sound will get, and you get a rather disturbing sound effect if it manages to get you.  So the only thing you can do is to keep moving... right into the clutches of the ever-familiar Ghosts.\n\nAll the usual cast is here, but there are some unfamiliar faces here too.  Each Ghost has their own unique behavior pattern:  Blinky (red) is the most determined and persistent of all of them (like he was in the original, and will simply chase you non-stop.  Pinky (pink, of course) just sits there until you cross her line of sight, at which point she'll charge at you, moving much faster than you can until she hits a wall.  Inky (blue) simply travels counter-clockwise around whatever maze wall he's currently attached to.  Clyde (orange) never, ever moves upward, but always downward towards the glitch and will take downward paths even if you're right in front of him and it means that he misses you.  Sue (purple) appears in groups, forming a slow moving wall that simply tries to block your path.  Funky (green) forms a longer, fast-moving wall that bounces back and forth.  Spunky (gray) is the lazy one, sleeping until you get near, at which point he goes all Blinky on you for a few seconds before going \"feh\" and falling asleep again.  Lastly, Glitchy (???) is a corrupted mess of a ghost, spraying out wonky letters and symbols as he moves around, also having the ability to teleport.\n\nLearning the behaviors of all of these ghosts is the key to mastering the game.  The game will throw TONS of ghosts at you, but it is never unfair about this... there's always a way to dodge them, particularly if you learn how to manipulate certain ones into moving where you want them to.\n\nAs always, you have the classic Power Pellets at your disposal, which do just what you'd think they do:  They turn the ghosts blue and slow them down, and you can eat them until the effect wears off.  Each ghost you eat in a chain will give more points than the last, and grabbing another Power Pellet while the first is still going will reset it's timer without resetting the chain, allowing for really big points.   Fruits are also plentiful, and when you grab them you get some points and also a multiplier that lasts for awhile, multiplying all incoming points from any source.  Which fruit you grab determines how big the multiplier is (with melons being the highest, at a x6 multiplier), and these are the key to REALLY big scores.  Grabbing a fruit and then getting a high level ghost chain from a Pellet is the thing you most want to do.\n\nOf course, with so many ghosts around and the ever advancing Killscreen Glitch, Power Pellets alone arent going to be enough.  Fortunately, the game adds tons of different powerups to the mix.  The great thing about these is that they give you all sorts of fun effects, but they dont go totally overboard.  They never take away from the feel of a real Pac-Man game.  If you've ever played any of the remakes of classic games that were popular in the late 90s, you probably know what I mean by remakes that go too far with new ideas, transforming an old classic into something kinda crappy.  That never happens here, and these powerups only add to the game.  There's all sorts of effects here... you have a laser that fires out in front of Pac-Man (with infinite range until it hits a wall), one item that spawns tornadoes that roam around hunting ghosts, another that puts out an aura around you, causing you to be able to grab dots and things in lanes you arent even in, or other loopy effects.  You have a \"loadout\" of three powerups that you can choose before beginning a run, which determines which powerups will appear in that run.  Power Pellets will always appear, and are the ones with the biggest scoring potential by far.  Learning to use all of these different items is very important, and not all of them are easy to use to their fullest potential.\n\nUnlocking powerups and enhancing them is a pretty slow process... the unlocking simply happens as you keep playing, but powering them up further requires coins, which are either found in the maze or given to you by the various \"missions\" that will pop up.  Each time you enhance a powerup, it will either last a bit longer, or give more points, and each time the cost for the next enhancement will double.  These get very expensive after awhile and the process gets slower and slower, so that can be a bit of an issue at times.  \n\nThere is one other special mechanic:  As you keep eating dots, you'll notice that there's a counter that keeps going up as you keep eating them.  At certain intervals (16, 32, 64, so on) you'll get a small blob of points, but the real bonus happens if you can get your dot chain up to 256, which will give you a huge point bonus and clear the screen and next maze section of ghosts.  Doing this is difficult though; if your chain is interrupted by running over an empty space, it resets back to 0.  Getting a full chain of 256 is the most difficult thing to do in the game.\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind is that this is a port of a mobile game, and a bit of a lazy one at that.  It does have it's issues, but fortunately not many... I found that they dont really impact my experience with the game much.\n\nAlso:  This is a DIFFICULT game.  You're going to die.  Really often, and often really fast.  The game gets brutal quickly.  The ghost combinations and maze layouts work together to make your task as complicated and challenging as possible, and once you get hit, that's it, that's the end of your run.  Getting a truly high score is no small feat.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic game, and expands really well on the old Pac-man formula without screwing anything up.  For me, this is one of those games that I just keep coming back to constantly, and I can absolutely recommend it to anyone that likes Pac-man whatsoever.", "timestamp_created": 1474000616, "timestamp_updated": 1474000654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768346", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25486164": {"recommendationid": "25486164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062800826", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515827410}, "language": "english", "review": "Very very fun.\n\nLocal multiplayer is a big plus. if you have people over that want to play this game, you really don't have to explain much:  \"It's Pac Man\"\n\nTip: Do the missions and save all your coins.

Addicting gameplay, smart enemies, a multitude of power-ups, and the drive to rack up a high score. \n\nThe power-up and upgrade system works similarly to games like Tower Defense or Clicker Heroes, in that the more you play, the more access you have to more overpowered items and upgrades, which I think is a very cool approach to this kind of game. However this also means that if you want any chance of getting the highest score possible you will have to keep playing until you ultimately get the most broken power-ups, which will take a while because because coins are disappointingly sparse, at least when you get further into the game. \n\nEvery time you upgrade a power-up the cost for the next level up is doubled, and considering most prize boxes you get for clearing a mission or otherwise are more likely than not to give you a very small increment you don't feel a very big sense of accomplishment. By the same merit you also unlock new power-ups by collecting a certain amount of dots cumulatively during play, but you eventually reach a point where you have to collect so many dots that even when you've had a really good play session you barely make any progress with unlocking the next power-up. It's a definitive feeling of \"getting less for doing more,\" and it makes me wish the unlock criteria was determined by a different attribute. If you plan on unlocking everything then give it time, because you're going to be in for a long journey.\n\nEven looking past this unlock system Pac-Man 256 still holds its own exceptionally well, and it defines the word \"timeless.\" If you love arcade games then this is something you don't want to miss out on.", "timestamp_created": 1472156177, "timestamp_updated": 1472184617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25138614": {"recommendationid": "25138614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115189955", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487987662}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a infinatite maze runner game themed around PAC-MAN, you run or float (or whatever PAC-MAN does) collecting pellets and coins (Basicly PAC-MAN's common activity) as well as eat fruit on the screen.

Behind Pacman is a wall of 8-bit glitchy cacophony that swallows everything up.  You rack up points primarily from dot combos, which max out at 256, hence the name.  Furthermore, an assortment of powerups is gradually collected for your arsenal, which replace traditional power pellets and which  you can optionally equip.\n\nThe pace is frantic and fun like Crossy Roads, but I hope you don't care about score, because 256 is basically at the mercy of RNG.  Occasionally very tight dual lanes will generate with no escape.  Your dot combos are occasionally broken by areas where the dots simply stop for no reason.  The worst offender of them all is the camera.  THE CAMERA!  IN A PAC MAN GAME!  The camera is centered around PAC man no matter what, limiting your view of whats ahead, and what awaits you when you use the side warps to stay alive.\n\nChildren will like this, I know I do, but they could get it free on their phone, and for a more finely tuned experience, CE DX is the superior alternative.", "timestamp_created": 1469236102, "timestamp_updated": 1469236102, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.408992", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24432212": {"recommendationid": "24432212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039422332", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509222331}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430, \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0422\u0430\u043a, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435. \u041d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0433\u0430\u0435\u0442 :)", "timestamp_created": 1469051217, "timestamp_updated": 1469051217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479969", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24411634": {"recommendationid": "24411634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967644346", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1521552058}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth the small price, For people saying its Free on there phone, This is a totally different experience being played on a 4k screen lol..

While Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is my absolute favorite follow-up, Pac-Man 256 is a very close second.\n\nPac-Man 256 embraces the \"board 256 glitch\" from the original game where the maze itself would be partially covered with random symbols and letters. In this game, the glitch manifests itself by slowly creeping up from the bottom portion of the ever-scrolling, randomized maze. If you dwell too long in a certain area, you'll be overcome by the glitch and die.\n\nSpeaking of death, you've got one life. That's it. Make it count!\n\nTo help you get a high score, there are various power-ups that you can choose at the beginning of a game. You need to unlock them by getting coins, and you can only choose three at a time. Power-ups from your chosen load out will then appear randomly through the maze along with power pellets, coins, and score-multiplying fruit. Power-ups range from lasers to traps to tornadoes to bombs. There's good diversity, and you can have fun mixing and matching once you have enough unlocked.\n\nThe game is all about getting a high score, of course. However, you'll also get coins for completing specific missions. Missions include things like eat 6 cherries, kill 20 ghosts with the laser, and eat five beam power-ups.

Just when I  thought they'd never bring anything innovative and different to the franchise... Oh this one's a game changer. While the Championship DX game from a few years ago was entertaining to look at and keep going around in circles in (for a little while anyway), Pac-Man 256 actually brings a whole lot of new shit to the table. New weapons and traps for the ghosts as well as a new antagonist chasing you: The Glitch, continously storming in from below and you have to keep getting away. This is nothing like the Pac-Man's of yesteryear where you strive to eat all the pellets in a maze because you can't, you can only keep going forward while staying alive. And once you realize what a 256 is you may become obsessed with scoring one as I did... It only took me until about my 71st attempt, almost two hours in, until I finally got one and oh man was it ever glorious.\n\nThe ghosts all have different habits and attack patterns as well this time around. Watch out for the pink ones!\n\nSo yeah, I don't think any previous Pac-Man title has delved into the elements that this one does (unless there were any I missed somewhere over the years). This is easily one of my favorite since Super Pac-Man, Pacmania, and Pac-Land. Not only do I recommend it but you don't have to wait for a sale, either, just get it for $5 and think of all the quarters you'll have saved after your 20th playthrough if this were a coin-op game back in the 80's or 90's.", "timestamp_created": 1466882793, "timestamp_updated": 1466882821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23787848": {"recommendationid": "23787848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202524232", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470856133}, "language": "english", "review": "NEVER thought I'd grab a MOBILE PORT of a game on the computer (let alone get the game for both my X1 and PS4 to go along with my computer, I'm not a fanboy or anything, but this game is one of those rare cases where a mobile game getting port's is perfect for a game like this and gets addictive fast\n\nThis game takes the classic and basic formula of Pac-Man and gives it addictive gameplay with you constantly needing to keep an eye out for power ups and coins while needing to think of what to do and fast to avoid the ghosts from catching ya\n\nEven though this game isn't a rouge like, it has elements of a rouge like (endless runners are similar to rouge likes) and mix that element with some fun and unique power ups, and just the adrenaline rush of trying to get the highest score you can grab, this game is a great grab and it's even better that the game's only 5 dollars\n\nAnd just a note, this isn't the first time I grabbed a game on more than one platform (Bully and a few of the lego games, and one of the newer tomb raiders are examples)\n", "timestamp_created": 1466853501, "timestamp_updated": 1466853501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23782510": {"recommendationid": "23782510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156528805", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 553, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489645102}, "language": "english", "review": "Super addictive fun.

This game is gorgeous.  Don't let the simple appearance fool you, there's a lot going on here!  The various visual themes means the look never has to get stale.  Graphical \"glitches\" come across the map in waves, forcing you forward and altering the game ahead of you.  Powerups are greeted with flashy effects and zooms.  \n\nThe powerups!  There's a ton of them, and each can be leveled up with coins.  Other features new to Pac-Man are loadouts, and some limited stealth mechanics.\n\nThere's some genuine gameplay innovation going on, as well.  Ghosts are more like Agent Smiths.

The glitch occurred when the player makes it to level 256, where the right-hand side of the screen would turn in to a jumble of letters and numbers.\n\nThis is a very unique take on the PAC-MAN formula where you will be challenged to continuously move upwards in a never ending battle with the maze, ghosts, power-ups and the infamous level 256 glitch that is following behind.\n\nThe aim of the game, like most PAC-MAN and arcade titles is to chase the highest score possible. There are many ways to increase the score multiplier as such as eating many ghosts in quick succession, as you would expect from a PAC-MAN title. The core mechanics that you would expect from a PAC-MAN game are here and they work well, controlling PAC-MAN feels as tight and responsive as ever.\n\nHipster Whale evolve some of the original core PAC-MAN gameplay elements; collecting 256 pac-dots in a row will erupt 256 pac-dot chain that explodes the screen in celebration all while eliminating all ghosts on the screen. I found myself obsessively attempting to earn the 256 pac-dot chain as it was both satisfying and rewarding.\n\nEach ghost has their own idiosyncrasies where for example, the pink ghost will chase PAC-MAN if you appear in its line of sight, the orange ghost will continuously move down the screen while the blue ghost will always hug a maze wall and move in a counter-clockwise rotation. Learning how each ghost works is imperative to your success in PAC-MAN 256.\n\nUnlike previous titles in the series, PAC-MAN 256 features an array of power-ups that add new elements of fun, tactics and hilarity as you see a large PAC-MAN stomping around the maze squishing ghosts like a out of control bulldozer.\n\nPower-ups can be that can be upgraded using coins that are earned within the game and not purchased with real money, unlike the mobile counterpart. Upgrading a power-up will make it more powerful; for example, leveling up the Laser power-up will allow the laser to last longer, giving PAC-MAN more protection from those ever pesky ghosts. As well as earning them in game, you will be rewarded with free coin gifts at random intervals after several runs through the game. This makes this version of the game far more generous with the coins than the original mobile game.\n\nOn top of the generousness of the in-game currency; upgrade times have been significantly reduced from the mobile game. Within PAC-MAN 256 on mobile devices, it would take anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours to upgrade the power ups. In the PC version of the game, these updates happen instantaneously.\n\nThe audio should be commended as it sticks to the classic and iconic PAC-MAN sounds and music that PAC-MAN fans have come to love over the years. It does not feel outdated and in fact feels right at home in this zany take on the franchise.\n\nA local multiplayer mode is also featured in the game where up to 4 players can share the same screen in a frenzy to earn the highest score. Unfortunately, no online multiplayer is available.\n\nAs expected, there is not much in the way of graphics options however the game can be played in both windowed and fullscreen with a range of different screen resolutions available to chose from. In-game effects can also be turned on or off.\n\nA option to change the skin of each maze is available and this provided me with many extra hours of enjoyment as I waka-waka\u2019d my way through a office, garden, classic 80\u2019s PAC-MAN and even Crossy Road.\n\nAt \u00a33.99, this game includes no micro-transactions, no advertisements and comes with all add-ons that were available for purchase in the games mobile version.  If you have any interest in PAC-MAN or are just looking for a quick and fun time killer, I would need to recommend you check out PAC-MAN 256 and its unique take on the classic yellow  icon.\n\nHead over to PCGN for the full review: https://pcgnet.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/pac-man-256-review/", "timestamp_created": 1466526287, "timestamp_updated": 1467164277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 79, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796886", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23688076": {"recommendationid": "23688076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015075204", "num_games_owned": 1452, "num_reviews": 357, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466525591}, "language": "english", "review": "this is the definition of mindless tedium. all the things you like about pacman are not present here, but it does add the amazing concept of grinding for powerups and obvious microtransaction stuff that isn't much better now that it's free. basically all you do is move down a maze forever; it's the bad roguelike version of pacman. gone are the well-designed mazes or any creativity! wowie wow! don't buy it!", "timestamp_created": 1466525819, "timestamp_updated": 1466525819, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.358545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 699, "total_negative": 74, "total_reviews": 773}}

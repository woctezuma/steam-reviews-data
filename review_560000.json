Raide's art is phenomenal; each character has a variety of fairly unique expressions, and the CGs are...delightful. The UI is polished to a sheen; it feels unique for a VN while still effortlessly communicating exactly what a player needs to know.\n\nThe story is okay - the character interactions are far more compelling than the overarching plot (though anyone who claims they were \"playing for the plot\" is probably lying). The dialogue is well-written, balancing humor and smuttiness nigh-perfectly.\n\nMy main criticism has to do with the mechanics of the game itself. The main character is attempting to pass herself off as her twin brother, for plot reasons that aren't incredibly important, and so has to manage \"suspicion\" which is accrued for behaving differently from her brother (who's a narcissistic asshole). Players are allotted a number of \"suspicion slots\" which, like a reverse health meter, cannot be completely filled without a game over.\n\nThis would be an interesting constraint if not for the fact that the only way to *remove* this suspicion is to follow the submissive romance route (there are two main routes in the game, one in which the main character acts as a domme and the other in which she acts as a sub). While it's entirely possible to complete the game without needing to remove suspicion, many routes require the player to accrue suspicion - so if you want to sleep around (or have played carelessly) the player character is essentially blackmailed into submission, which I personally find distasteful, especially for a game that otherwise seems to make an effort to emphasize the importance of consent.\n\n(Of course, the *player* is free to start from a previous save - but in-universe, this meta-game ability isn't exactly relevant.)\n\nAside from that mechanic, I adored the game's writing and characters.

It promises a pretty fun premise of a character with a lot of agency in a wacky situation (there's also \"sexy stuff\", but it is skippable). \n\nThe game is mechanically sound. The interface works really well, and of all the different things you have to balance in-game, it is explicitly clear on what will do what, which allows you to make informed roleplaying decisions. However, the main character is coerced, belittled, or has her agency taken away in almost every single scene, and none of it is portrayed in a bad way. Almost every character is portrayed as knowing her better than herself, and it leaves me feeling gross. On top of it all, she's helpless in the meta-narrative, especially at the end, where the plot goes off the walls, which I categorically disliked.\n\nOn top of it all, all the problems translate into the sex scenes. I went into this being open about the sex stuff, but off the bat, I was grossed out because [spoiler] you're telling it all to your brother. [/spoiler] And this isn't something that fades into the background, but is consistently reinforced. The second issue, is that although a safe word is established, the player has no opportunity to use it, which seems contrary to the roleplaying style in the other part of the game. When the game is about having a lot of choices to make, the sex scenes happen pretty much without player input. The relationship also seems to develop on its own, too, with nothing in-between all and nothing. The last issue with the \"sexy stuff\" I'm going to discuss is that while the game touts its skippable sex scenes, it's clear that the sex scenes are longer, more detailed, and basically what people are here for. It is thus incredibly disappointing when one must skip them.\n\nBetween needing to skip some sex scenes and wanting to skip all the scenes where the protagonist is put down, belittled, coerced, or otherwise without agency, there are about 3 scenes in the entire game I liked.

I genuinely thought that I would like it. I enjoyed Analogue and Hate Plus and bought this game upon release. What a letdown that was.\n\nPlot - Flimsy. I expected something amusingly outlandish from the premise but somehow got blindsided by the sheer absurdity of it. A cruise for privileged high schoolers becomes the theatre of a game of psychological manipulation and sex. That's about it, a sort of Battle Royale sleazy sitcom.\n\nWriting - Crude. The style is unable to salvage the lack of substance. The story suffers from being delivered in dialogs that feel shallow at best, insipid at worst.\n\nCharacters - Mixed. Some characters managed to shine in a few select scenes but otherwise everyone feels terribly underdeveloped. It is fitting that you only know them by a moniker instead of a name as they all can be reduced to mere archetypes.\n\nArt - Mixed. The sprites are fine with a diverse range of expressions and clothing to make up for the lack of facial variety among characters. The backgrounds are pleasantly detailed but sometimes feel overly ornate and jarring compared to the way characters are drawn. The art in the sex scenes is especially pared-down with bodies depicted almost like dolls. Not much disappointment over the absence of the usual Visual Novel gallery feature.\n\nMusic - Adequate. Follows the overall atmosphere of the scene, sometimes light-hearted, sometimes tense. Though not memorable, I didn't feel the urge to mute it.\n\nGameplay - Good. This is a classic Visual Novel with a bit of novelty. An original change is the possibility to keep the conversation going without having to decide what answer to give among a set, answers can then appear and disappear as the situation evolves. Becomes a hassle when replaying in skip mode as you can miss the choices. Interface is well designed and pleasant.\n\nLength - Underwhelming for the price tag. Three playthroughs to unlock everything and finally have an inkling of the plot. There is quite a lot of skipping already read text involved. Not sure of the exact time as I first played the game after buying it on Humble Bundle but about 10 hours in total.\n\nAchievements - Not challenging. It requires playing three times to see everything. Bugs may prevent the timely unlocking of some achievements though.\n\nSex - Tepid.\n\nClosing thoughts - The game fails to be the 'erotic romantic comedy' it proclaims itself to be and instead dissolves in a needlessly convoluted and messy plot with characters you do not care about having sex that is nothing to write home about.", "timestamp_created": 1512426279, "timestamp_updated": 1512426279, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38053502": {"recommendationid": "38053502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002379108", "num_games_owned": 989, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 413, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512380821}, "language": "english", "review": "I knew I was going to enjoy this game, but I wound up enjoying it a lot more than I thought I was going to.

This is comedic sexy tied up girls: the game. Smut with a fun, slightly frustrating social (if you're me anyway) manipulation game mixed in.\n\nThe games broken up by times of day and you're able to visit a choice characters in each time slot.  Helpfully, when you're picking which character to spend the time with, it gives an indication of possible suspicion and votes that can be gained, if any, for the encounter.  The social game is just a matter of gaining votes if you so wish to win The Game, and avoiding suspicion, which can be removed at night if you submit to The Beauty.\n\nThe social interaction game is interesting and reminded me of high school.  Mechanically, you're just gathering 'points (votes)' while avoiding being suspicious.  What's neat about it is the interaction system, where instead of just always having static text boxes, they sort of flow in and out, not often or jarringly but enough to be interesting and keep you on your toes.  So you can wait to see if choices unlock, or perhaps you already passed up your best option for what you're going for.  Also text boxes are coloured (I believe by 'type' of choice. Mean, Assertive, Flirty, etc. though I'm not 100% sure). This is actually pretty fucking nice.\nThe writing is excellent, often funny, and referential, though sometimes to the point where I kind of wonder how it seems with people who don't get the references and jokes.  Hell, I'm probably missing a few.  The votes ('points') you get themselves are also pretty amusing or interesting.   Also there are a few FUCKING AWFUL jokes here.  Like god awful pun level.  I love that shit though, it's what amuses me greatly, my sense of humour by most definitions terrible.  You even get called out by it once if you make one, it's great.\nSadly it also has the problems of most VN-style games of feeling very limiting.  Mostly in this case I was just frustrated I wasn't able to manipulate the characters better (or at least the way I would have).  That said it's probably better that way otherwise it'd get in the way of the more important sexy stuff, so I'm pretty sure it's intentional as I'm pretty sure that's the main point of the game.  (See the end of this review for 'what it means').  Other things I found kind of annoying are again problems of the type of game it is;  Sometimes the contextual choice picked and the sort of resulting exposition doesn't quite go the way, I at least, would think. And not in a way that makes sense to me all the time, though usually I can see the logic after at least, which helps.\n\n\nThe sex scenes are gold, but probably not what most would expect I guess.  It's hard to explain but if you're coming for super unrealistic 'regular' sort of porn you're going to be dissapointed I think. \nThe writing throughout the sex scenes is also excellent, and since the writing for non sex stuff is excellent the characters feel good (heh).  \nI do have a few problems here though.  \nPersonally, I found The Beauty's sex scenes harder to get through.  It's probably due to me very much enjoying bullying the fuck out of The Stalker, and finding it hard to mentally switch myself to The Beauty's style.  Even when I did it was more of enjoying her role rather than switching as The Beast.  I got 'The Beast' switch in the end but the beginning was a bit rough for some reason (heh again).  It might also be a problem with playing each route pretty close to each other (I finished one and started the other immediately). \nThe other (bigger) problem I have is that if you want to remove suspicion you can only do so via The Beauty.  I don't think it would be so 'bad' but you're forced into one role here, whereas in The Stalker route you could be all out mean or mean but still be kinder-ish and while they lead to the same sort of thing it felt more differentiated.  Very often mouthing off or going along with it are pretty close to the same thing and feel like it. As far as I know anyway, I didn't go for unlocking all the dialogue itself because that gets tedious and diminishes my enjoyment of games.  Really I think the problem is this isn't quite for me, I would have preferred a position where one could also sub safely, with full manipulation intent on The Beasts part.  I'm pretty sure The Beauty route is supposed to be a 'safe' place to be 'away' from all that shit for The Beast though, so again I think the problem is me here.  Also you don't really *need* to remove suspicion. Maybe to win the game once, I'm not entirely sure.  Guess you also don't *need* to do her route either but whatever I do all the things.\n\nArt is preference as always, personally I found the backgrounds gorgeous, the regular art good and enjoyable.  \nThe sex scene art in some cases didn't *quite* work out for me in some cases, lack of detail or something I'm not entirely sure, sometimes it felt very much like blob with face for some reason. \nThe facial expressions are fucking phenomonal though, as I tend to have a hard time with understanding them in general(what are emoticons even supposed to be) I think I got these pretty easily.  Couldn't tell you why though.\n\nMusic is good and fits.  I've got nothing better to say here sorry.\n\nThere used to be a heterosexual noncon scene (updated to be skippable and warned properly) that was removed.\nHaving been a filthy pirate (I was so annoyed I couldn't own it I pirated it and didn't even play it until I owned it) and having an older version on a hard drive somewhere with it as well, I did read through it.  \nIt was fine to me (to be in the game), but lets be honest I've seen way more fucked up shit than that so I'm probably not the average person there.  I don't quite agree with the removal of it, but I definitely understand at least.  I'm very glad at least the full script of the scene was uploaded by Love so you can still read that version though it still has the code all with it.  So I'm kind of glad I have an old version on a hard drive somewhere.\n\n\nOnto technical stuff:  \nNameable characters so you can renname The Stalker to Please Tease Me Relentlessly is A++.  \nA bit weird that The Brother is a default option for The Prince, so characters refer to him as Brother.  Seems really strange of a nickname if some of them don't know you (the sister) exist.\nThe save systems wonky to me, I'm not sure what was wrong with a regular VN style system, I often found myself loading wrong files because they move around due to autosaves and such.\nI would be curious to know if any thought was given to a 'hard' mode where indicators of suspicion gain, choices unlocked, and vote gain were all off.\nColour blind mode, auto skip all/seen, even a SFW option,  good choices here.\nSkipping sometimes locks up the game for a few seconds sometimes on choices/saves.  Might just be my pc is trash.\nNo 'scene' viewer.  Kinda a pain if you just wanna relive some bullying whether you're dishin' or receivin'.\nAchievement II which I will point out in a second, I think should be read as 'you're playing' not 'you playing'.  I probably should email about that brb.\n\nOverall though I loved the game, and very much wish there was more games like it.  I wish I could fuck or hang out or both with The Nerd more though I won't lie.  Also The Maid looks real fuckin' good in that outfit.\n\nI've seen a few reviews and people talk about how this game's about consent, relationships, being queer (is that even the right term I'm not good with political correctness shit), or whatever.  If that's what you got out of the game good for you I guess.  Personally, I think that's all far fetched, and at most it's just Christine Love putting it out there that she's both a huge fucking nerd and a huge fucking pervert, who wanted to write somethin' sexy, and there ain't nothing wrong with that (for anyone).

The framing device for the plot is just so over the top and absurd. \n\nYour \"evil\" twin brother makes a deal with you that if you crossdress as him and join his classmates on basically a highschool graduation cruise he will attend your summer school classes after you flunked out of highschool and give you back a motorcycle your father took from you.  That was weird enough.  But, to find out [spoiler] his actual master plan was to have a fake kidnapping of you at the end of the cruise in order to trick your abusive father into paying a $5 million ransom for what he thinks is his son...that's going a bit too far.  Then on top of that the even bigger master plan is that it was also a test, because while he is out forming a terrorist organization, with the ransomed $5 million, to rid the world of capitalism. He wants you to stay pretending to be him and to take over your fathers company, so you will be a titan of industry and in a key position to help his plan...to rid the world of capitalism, when the time comes for it.  \n\nThis is pretty insane.  Basically, your twin is Lelouch Lamperouge...due to all the anime references in the game, I'm pretty confident that's who they were going for.  It's never explained what weird new world order he wants to bring in, but your twin sure seems to be a psycho considering he ties you up and interrogates you and demands to know all the sexy details of what happend on the cruise.  My guess is this new world order is probably a brutal dictatorship with him as the head. [/spoiler]  I also find it hard to believe, and very animey, that this insanely wealthy person hid the fact he has a daughter from the world because he hates her so much.  \n\nDespite that very weird and perhaps terrible framing for the story, I did enjoy it quite a bit.  The game really only has two romance options and I felt both were handeled excessively well.  I also just liked talking to people on the ship.  I got the feeling the game felt I was playing wrong though.  As i really just wanted to talk to people and not have sex with everyone.  A lot of the poeple seemed like they were kind of massive jerks or sociopaths...so I didn't really have a desire to attempt to sex them up.  I spent the bulk of the game just hanging out with my cousin.  I liked it quite a bit, I felt they were a fun character.  All the characters were all well developed, it's just I didn't like them so I didn't want to have sex with them.  I also greatly appreciated the soundtrack.  That jazz score was so great.  I'd feel better about paying full price for the game if the soundtrack was included as opposed to it being additional money as dlc. \n\nThe one thing I will fault the game for is that basically you are simply choosing who you want to hang out with on the ship.  You don't have enough days/hours to hang out with everyone so you have to pick who you want.  These choices are binary/linear.  Picking some people over others has no impact on the other choices.  It's already scripted out, each character has 5-6 scenes and they play out in order.  Which creates story problems later.  In one example the Beauty showed up in one scene and it was heavily treated like I had sex with her, even though I didn't yet.  In another example even though I was having sex with the nerdy girl the game treated it as if I wasn't.  Also, except for Beauty and the nerdy girl it felt like things I told people in one scene didn't really carry over to other scenes.  If I was super nice to people prior they didn't seem to care in the next scene.  I would have liked my decisions to have more impact on the other people.\n\nI still felt the writing was very well done.  Unlike, most anime the romances here actually felt like real relationships.  I would like to see what this developer could do with a lot more money and a bigger team.  I noticed quite a few inaccuracies with character design from scene to scene (such as a character would say they look one way or be wearing something and the picture would clearly show the exact opposite). I enjoyed the over all interactions with the characters so much though that I would still recommend the game.  But, due to those weird bugs/inconsistances and the choices not having much an affect outside the main relationships I would not suggest paying full price for this game unless you just want to support the dev.  #worth $10", "timestamp_created": 1499210671, "timestamp_updated": 1501335019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33212995": {"recommendationid": "33212995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043346855", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 338, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506490458}, "language": "english", "review": "Comfort food for the soul.

It\u2019s\u2026very relatable.\n\n(There are sex scenes, but the game is very upfront and clear about letting you skip them at any time if they\u2019re not your thing. There\u2019s also an option to cover up any nakedness with large colorful Christmas sweaters if you want to play on a train!)\n\nAs the full title suggests, the game puts you in the uncomfortable shoes of the Beast, who must pretend to be the Prince, her rich and powerful brother, on a week-long graduation cruise. He\u2019s a horrible manipulator, his classmates are just as devious, and the Beast has to play the part without being found out--with the added stress of being caught up in a high-stakes popularity contest called the Game.\n\nThe concept of the game uses the classic amnesia trope in a refreshing way; the Beast is going in blind, just like you, and some social situations become minefields when everyone\u2019s referring to something the Prince would obviously know about. Juggling the twin goals of not arousing suspicion and getting enough votes to win the Game is made easier by just how brilliantly the game handles dialogue. Instead of being a classic tree, multiple options will present themselves, and sometimes disappear as the conversation continues. Having been multiple times in the situation of helplessly watching the subject change away from something I wanted to comment on, it was novel to see it used so well as a game mechanic. Some options will make people suspicious; some will get you votes; some will do both, or neither. Sometimes you\u2019ll be pressured into saying something, anything, to avoid tipping people off.\n\nBut the game can take a lot of that pressure off you if you need it. You always can scroll back a little bit; take back what you just said, and go down a different path if you\u2019re having second thoughts. As someone with social anxiety, this made me feel so much better. This feature, like many others found in Ladykiller in a Bind, are now things I wish every game with conversation mechanics would use.\n\nWhat made this game stand out to me so much were the nights, where after a day of saying and doing horrible things to keep up appearances, you finally get to let your defenses down and be genuine with someone you care about; either the Beauty or the Stalker. Both have their own mechanical raisons d\u2019\u00eatre, but both also give a glimpse into vastly different dynamics. With the Stalker, you take the lead. With the Beauty, you willingly put yourself into the hands of someone else with the promise that she\u2019ll make everything better. Both relationships \u2013 all social interactions in the game, in fact--make it clear that there's consent from all parties.\n\nMy life is filled with things to be anxious about: I constantly feel that I\u2019m running out of time, that I\u2019m missing important things, that I should be doing so much better than I am at so many things. It\u2019s so easy to beat myself up. But it\u2019s not healthy, is it? Anxiety and depression make it simple to discredit ourselves and be rougher than we need to be when it comes to self-criticism. But there are people in our lives who care about us, who are in a better position to help us get better. We can trust them. It\u2019s okay to put ourselves in their hands, to relinquish that control \u2013 to stop hurting ourselves because of all the flaws we see in the mirror.\n\nVideo games can teach us important things if we\u2019ll lower our guard and let them in; I learned a very important lesson from an erotic game about frustrated young adults on a cruise ship.", "timestamp_created": 1491321663, "timestamp_updated": 1491321746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.787522", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30930804": {"recommendationid": "30930804", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972333556", "num_games_owned": 1020, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496887830}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not normally the biggest fan of visual novels, but Christine Love's work has always managed to capture what's best about the genre while minimizing the tropes and stupidity that are unfortunately common to this type of game.

Mas o fato \u00e9 que, quanto mais eu penso sobre, mais eu gosto dele como obra completa. Acredito que a assinatura da Christine Love \u00e9 uma tens\u00e3o entre o \"s\u00e9rio\" e a \"galhofa\". Bem, esse \u00e9 um jogo sobre transar com o m\u00e1ximo de pessoas num navio sem que descubram que voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma fraude. Adivinhem s\u00f3 qual lado ganhou dessa vez.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 t\u00e3o besta quanto a sinopse da Steam deixa a entender. Sua personagem, conhecida como The Beast, troca de lugar com o irm\u00e3o g\u00eameo (The Prince) num cruzeiro com os colegas de turma dele. Por uma semana, ela precisa fingir ser o irm\u00e3o para pessoas que n\u00e3o conhece e cujo grau de rela\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o entende. Ao mesmo tempo, est\u00e1 rolando um Jogo, no qual quem obtiver mais votos vai receber um bol\u00e3o de 4 milh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares. \nComo jogador, seu objetivo \u00e9 gerenciar duas vari\u00e1veis: a de Suspeita, e os seus Votos. Se seu n\u00edvel de Suspeita chegar a 5 pontos, os colegas de turma descobrem que voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma fraude e game over. J\u00e1 os Votos s\u00e3o a moeda de troca no navio, e indicam sua participa\u00e7\u00e3o no Jogo pelos 4 milh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares. Fora isso, voc\u00ea tem a liberdade de escolher com quem passar\u00e1 suas manh\u00e3s e tardes, mas as noites obrigatoriamente s\u00e3o de um dos dois interesses rom\u00e2nticos centrais: The Beauty ou The Stalker. Beauty \u00e9 uma dominatrix e pode usar contatos com a high-society para zerar os seus pontos de Suspeita depois de cada noite com ela. J\u00e1 Stalker \u00e9 uma nerd t\u00edmida e submissa que te presenteia com tr\u00eas Votos garantidos ap\u00f3s suas visitas. Mais do que meras mec\u00e2nicas, no entanto, seu relacionamento com elas serve como forma de apresentar duas rela\u00e7\u00f5es muito diferentes entre si, mas ambas permeadas pela quest\u00e3o do poder - um tema recorrente em todo o t\u00edtulo. \n\nLadykiller in a Bind \u00e9 um jogo adulto - por raz\u00f5es \u00f3bvias; e por outras menos evidentes. Verdade, ele \u00e9 um game er\u00f3tico com cenas de sexo expl\u00edcito. No entanto, mais do que um adolescente \"jogo pra se jogar com uma m\u00e3o s\u00f3\" (como muitos na tag er\u00f3tica da Steam se orgulham de ser), Ladykiller lembra mais uma longa preliminar, uma conversa aberta sobre sexo, limites e consentimento - mesmo quando os personagens est\u00e3o completamente vestidos. \nN\u00e3o me entendam errado: ele \u00e9 sexy para caramba quando quer. E esse \u00e9 o ponto. Porque, nas palavras da pr\u00f3pria protagonista, \"sexo n\u00e3o precisa seguir um roteiro pr\u00e9-programado idiota no qual come\u00e7amos com uns amassos e conclu\u00edmos com sexo penetrativo\". Sexo tem a ver com conex\u00e3o, divers\u00e3o e confian\u00e7a. Independentemente de ser casual ou n\u00e3o, passa pelo terreno do consentimento e do respeito m\u00fatuo. S\u00f3 que a discuss\u00e3o fica mais complicada quando sua protagonista \u00e9 uma farsante.\n\nNuma entrevista uns anos atr\u00e1s, Love mencionou como achava que a maneira como videogames lidam com romance soa manipulativa. Afinal, voc\u00ea adapta as suas respostas n\u00e3o para o que pensa de fato, mas para o que acredita que o outro personagem vai gostar mais. Voc\u00ea traz sua melhor persona para a situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Aparentemente, foi implicando com essa ideia que nasceu Ladykiller in a Bind: um game sobre uma personagem fingindo ser quem n\u00e3o \u00e9, num barco cheio de mulheres que ela bem que gostaria de ~conhecer melhor~. Um jogo que sabe que \u00e9 inapologeticamente manipulador. Que apresenta sexo emaranhado com rela\u00e7\u00f5es de poder e mentiras. E que gera \u00f3timas discuss\u00f5es sobre consentimento, sem ser sanitarizado.\n\nA raz\u00e3o para eu recomendar Ladykiller \u00e9 principalmente por ser muito refrescante ver um jogo positivo sobre sexo t\u00e3o inerentemente queer. Contar com uma escrita excelente e ser hil\u00e1rio tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o atrapalha. \nMas nem tudo s\u00e3o flores. Alguns pontos (em especial uma cena degradante de troca de sexo por favores, que chega beeem perto dos limites de um estupro) talvez pudessem ter sido lidados com um pouco mais da sensibilidade que a quest\u00e3o merece. Apesar dos por\u00e9ns, Ladykiller in a Bind tem a seu favor mais pontos positivos que negativos, e \u00e9 um marco importante na apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de sexo em videogames.", "timestamp_created": 1484862304, "timestamp_updated": 1484862365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29336492": {"recommendationid": "29336492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070087297", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506793882}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the game via humble previously.

I consider it mandatory playing for anyone interested in narrative in games or a mature treatment of sex in games.\n\n(Low play time is due to having played it before it came out on steam)", "timestamp_created": 1484588550, "timestamp_updated": 1486345915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518104", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29288354": {"recommendationid": "29288354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153144539", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486842985}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it, thoughtful and sexy is a good combination.\n\n\nVisual novels go on a bit though, and I'm not terribly smart with this kind of game and some of the mechanics, but I liked it.", "timestamp_created": 1484536386, "timestamp_updated": 1484536386, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494676", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29283143": {"recommendationid": "29283143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029077038", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484513337}, "language": "english", "review": "Unique experience.

In normal circumstances, I'd have absolutely no interest in a game like... well, *gestures wildly* this. I have no attraction to the female form normally beyond the same way you'd appreciate a nicely decorated house, or a painting, and two women making out certainly does not turn me on.\n\n\"Wow, what an idiot\", I hear you say. I don't neccessarily disagree with you there. But despite on the surface not being the target market for the game, I actually really appreciated my time with Ladykiller in a Bind. Sex is a huge part of Ladykiller, and if you're uncomfortable with that I'm just going to say that the game's probably not for you, but it's not big solely in a fanservice way. It's also about the characters, and power dynamics, and consent. (Also there's a christmas jumper mode if you don't like the idea of seeing a bunch of naked women. It's what it sounds like. There's also an option to skip the sex scenes, but for THE MOST PART I'd recommend not using it.)\n\nIn terms of the gameplay, it's a surprisingly interactive visual novel. Normally, when you have a conversation in a game, the characters say their bit, and then control is handed to the player as they're asked \"Do you want to kick the puppy, yes or no\".  Not so in Ladykiller. Instead, dialogue options pop into (and out of) the main character's head as you progress through the conversation, which makes the actual act of choosing options seem a lot less stilted. It's not perfect mind you, occasionally if you wait to click on a dialogue option then it's pretty clear that it's best read as an immediate follow up to a line from a while ago, but as it stands it's a major improvement compared to the other visual novels I've read.\n\nThe music and art is also worth mentioning. Whilst the tracks themselves are pretty good in of themselves, what *did* stand out was the fact that the music dynamically changes to match who's in the conversation, how kinky the sex is getting, etc., which was pretty neat. Similarly, the art is pretty good, but the standout part is the fact that everyone has multiple outfits, there's plenty of cgs, and I really like the colours used generally throughout. Good stuff.\n\nPlot wise - I'll be honest, by itself the overarching plot is not particularly interesting. You can play multiple times to learn more about what's going on, but it's not developed that much and when it was I wasn't super interested. Fortunately, this is because it largely comes across as an excuse to get to the actual meat of the story: A woman pretending to be her brother as she makes out with a bunch of other women. The dialogue is often hilarious, the characters are interesting, and it's fun trying to be as flirtateous as possible without coming across as suspicious.

I love Christine Love's work very much. I think the UI and choice system is incredible and should set the new industry standard in visual novels.\n2. There's something weird going on with Raide's art in this game. I wonder if he was driven out of his comfort zone?\n3. The music and the way the music interacts with the story is incredible.\n4. Christine uses a lot of interesting themes to motivate the overarching plot of Ladykiller. Unfortunately, they do not all mesh or manifest the way they were intended. The themes of consent and manipulation are not followed through entirely, and if you're not fully prepared for the harem ending, you WILL end up forced to endure a dub-con scene to get to the end. <--I guess this was patched out. But why wasn't it it there to begin with?\n\nI don't hate Ladykiller, but my feelings on it have been very mixed. I've fallen into the void where disappointment in a work makes it hard for me to remember this game fondly. I don't think it's horrible. I think it is worth playing. I can't give it a harsh 5/10 on steam, so I will not recommend it.\n\n(Sorry Christine.

I will update this later.\n\nOVERALL: I liked this game and would recommend it to people who enjoy visual novels with self-awareness and humor.  There needs to be more visual novels that're worth playing and replaying, and this is one of those from the looks of it.  The achievements imply some very different endings that are truly based on your decisions throughout the game, and it certainly looks like the ending I got was tailored to the choices I'd made throughout mine.  I'm certainly going to be playing it a few more times through.\n\nPROS: Entertaining writing, characters that fit the mood and theme of the story, and the surprises at the end of the game as things begin to wrap up.  I was also very pleased with certain characters especially, such as The Bro, and how the BDSM side of things was handled with The Beauty.\n\nCONS:\nThere are definitely cringe-worthy moments throughout the game that I don't think were intended to be cringy, such as implying that everyone in Kentucky is racist (?) and some other, uh, delightful moments of speech like that (like how one person could only say something they did because they were white...yikes).  On the other hand, these are Canadians, and I've known a lot of Canadians who actually talk the way this game does, so it's realistic as far as the ridiculously PC-level discussion sometimes goes.  Sometimes it just sounds like the characters being themselves; sometimes it sounds...really awkward and takes the reader out of the scene.  To each their own, however - some of it is well-done, others not.  Overall, I like the writing, just not those parts.  \n\nI'm probably just boring, but I wasn't really fond of how sex came across as cheap, easy and...just, the ease in which certain people agreed to sharing was distressing.  Still, that's a personal preference, not a real negative to the writing itself.  Some people will love the game that much more for it, and the game never hides what it's doing.  The honesty of the characters just enjoying themselves is refreshing; the easy acceptance of people clearly sexing each other up without discussing it with prior established relations, not so much.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1484339401, "timestamp_updated": 1484339401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29215303": {"recommendationid": "29215303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006021261", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495493589}, "language": "english", "review": "Ladykiller is a sex comedy which takes place in a hypothetical setting where the sex.... is real.\n\nUnoriginal jokes aside, I've never played a game that had a more realistic depection of sex. There were more than a few times where I'd think to myself, \"hey, this brings back some nice memories\" or \"oh my God! I actually said that when I was that age, and it must have been just as cringy\". There's also little details that are often left out of games, like little mistakes and fumbles, corney pillow talk, or active communication. Not to mention a depiction of consent in a very normal, healthy way. \n\nI thought the comedy was brilliant, but comedy is subjective, and I'm not familiar enough with the medium of comedy to recommend an apt comparison. Take of that what you will. \n\nThe story has a bit more depth than one would expect of a comed, and you'll probably need to do a few playthroughs to get the bulk of it, so I'll say I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nOverall, highly recommended. 5 out of 5 Christmas sweaters, would yuri-knee again.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1484273183, "timestamp_updated": 1484273183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.700096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29212552": {"recommendationid": "29212552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000561257", "num_games_owned": 2988, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484280226}, "language": "english", "review": "Gateway To Gaming Presents:\n\nLadykiller in a Bind, A Visual Novel Review\n\nDisclosure: This visual novel was bought by the review.\n\nVisual Novel experience: Muv-Luv Alternative, Kindred Spirits on the Roof, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action\n\nPlease note: I will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible. If you are interested in spoilers, I don't mind explaining in detail with a link to a separate group.\n\nThe visual aesthetic's quality is a mixed bag, but nothing dips beneath terrible. The backgrounds and environmental set pieces are absolutely beautiful to look at, ranging from the hallways of the cruise ship to the dinning facility and pool tables located in the lounge. Random pieces of art are also included via the third epilogue, which had a couple of noteworthy pieces done in black and white shading. The UI and the option menu are all presented cleanly and in uniform fashion, something I wish a lot of other visual novels could mimic. In terms of the sexual content in this game, it is very tame with simply drawn genitalia (nothing detailed) and the most extreme act being penetration. It is nothing to write home about and due to some serious story issues, feels more tacked on than genuine. Yes, BDSM is also featured, but the use of the crop is never shown, just emphasized by sound effects. \n\nCharacter avatars are shown during conversation to help specify who is talking, but they are all rather similar in terms of build and height. The main menu screen illustrates this best, having each character side by side with their outfits and hair being the only real feature separating them. Faces, unfortunately, also suffer the exact same issue most visuals novels have when dealing with their characters. The faces are interchangeable with no definition to the way noses look and provide the strange case of \"same face, different hair style and eye color. It just feels lazy, a feature that can easily be fixed by giving the time to provide cheek definition. This makes the characters look sterile, clean cut and bland. Thankfully, much more care was given to the outfits that range from spectacular (looking at your wardrobe Boss) to simply quaint. Clothing wrinkles and stretch lines were sown into most poses as well. The game actually uses multiple poses, different angles for each character that helps convey emotion over simply having the assumption from a single avatar. If it wasn't for the faces though, I probably would have given the character artwork a plus.\n\nMusic, I am pleased to announce, was mellow throughout and never seemed to outstay its' welcome during the short duration of conversations. During times of tension, the tempo picks up and helps carry some scenes that otherwise fall flat from delivered dialog. It is by no means terrible, but once I finished the game for the third time, I honestly couldn't remember any of the melodies used. It would also help if the main menu could feature at least some form of music. Sound effects are minor, mostly given to the pounding of waves against the hull and the swift cracks of the crop. The only major omission from this visual novel is voice acting, which again, leaves the music to help carry scenes. Granted, the developer's other games lacked voice talent, but they were also not $30 dollars. \n\nConversations play a major role in the manipulation game, influencing the way the story progress in regards to the individual classmates. While the main story follows the same script, the player can choose to interact with specific people at special times of the day, adding the chance to garner more votes while trying to avoid triggering suspicion. Each character has dialog paths that can unlock sentences worth of different text and others that are needed to progress down the path to either a peaceful resolution, breaking it off in poor taste or commemorating friendship on silk sheets. Certain conversation options are also blocked that can only be unlocked if certain interactions occur to gain information regarding that character. Options can also open up or disappear depending on how long you continue to listen to a conversation, which can be beneficial or harmful. Honestly, if the player goes to far into a conversation, they can roll back up using the mouse wheel and select a less impactful option in most cases. How can someone tell? Every dialog option has their profits and losses written next too it, which makes deciding on a specific path incredible easy. It also removes any real danger of rousing suspicion (except for one unavoidable situation) and makes the conversations less enjoyable. It is a great system (in terms of removing options) dragged down by unnecessary hand holding and a lack of discoverability. \n\nThe game also handles the idea of a fail-state poorly. If a player somehow manages to get five suspicion points, the game cuts to the same conversation, the same outcome, then uses the unreliable narrator to reload the same time of day for a retry. This was a missed opportunity to examine the reactions that would have been made, leading to more potential endings and uses of the manipulation narrative. It all feels too \"safe\" in a genre that has given some very amazing story arcs during what equates to a game over. It boils down to a missed opportunity in a disappointing story.\n\nStory-wise, this is a mess of a title. This is without taking into account the dialog, the character motivations, the general lack of chemistry and the themes used by the developer (which are all subjective). It takes at least three play-throughs to get all the information needed to understand the main plot and goes from out of left field to incredibly outlandish for what was advertised as a simple story about high school romance and votes. The cruise is simply an excuse to set up the protagonist for the ending and doesn't involve any of the classmates plot wise, which makes the cruise seem more like filler except for the interaction with The Stalker and The Beauty (who wipes away your suspicion points if you decide to submit to her). It is hard to really pin point the issue without spoilers, so I will try it this way: this is two visual novels wrapped into one, with the first being a \"fish out of water\" romance comedy and the second being an origin story to a Call of Duty villain. That is how disjointed and out of place the ending feels, which would have probably just been a good place to start the planned sequel for this game. \n\nThe core premise also takes a nose dive off the plot-line close to the end as it is revealed the need for votes is arbitrary, resulting in the same ending regardless of how many are acquired. On a side note: votes are needed to unlock certain paths during Day 6 for individual characters, not the main plot. It doesn't help that the chemistry introduced is paper thin (for the actual brother, not the sister). The reason for adding the consequences for certain dialog options was made to help play off the brother, I understand this, but there is barely any relationship or motivations revealed outside \"he is my rival\" or \"I use to date her.\" If there were more details involving situations like the unavoidable conundrum I mentioned early, it might have been needed. The characters just don't have a well written history to give off or promoted angles to make them anything but one dimensional. \n\nTechnical issues are also present on this little lust boat. Crashes have occurred three times during my play-throughs, once for hitting New Game and twice while loading two separate saves. Dialog also has a tendency to repeat itself, as if the scene was meant to be a placeholder for the finished sentence. Music would something play while I was reading something, cut off while I was reading that same page, then start again before clicking to the next page. \n\n<---See First Two Comments for Last Part--->", "timestamp_created": 1484259838, "timestamp_updated": 1484260133, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 229, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656491", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29198401": {"recommendationid": "29198401", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048362160", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484203560}, "language": "english", "review": "I liked it a lot.

The sex scenes are tastefully done and not very explicit, the sub/dom and bondage play is handled with a lot of care and respect, and the characters are all fleshed out and written in such a way that you end up caring a lot about them. (Well, most of them. The President can **** right off)\n\nDifferent from a lot of other visual novels, the game includes several strategic dialogue and character choices, where you at specific points in the dialogue will have different, time-limited (limited by progressing the text, not a clock) dialogue choices that impact the story and your relationship with the current characters. You also have a limited amount of \"suspicious actions\" (think Phoenix Wright's penalty system), leading you to balance how you behave and talk based on how much suspicion you've gathered at the time.\n\nAt the time of writing I've finished one playthrough (getting ending A, and sleeping around) clocking in at around 6 hours, which is a very respectable time for a game with so many choices and side-character routes to explore, and most importantly - side-character routes I -want- to explore.

Nice.)\n\nI'll open by admitting the visual novel isn't one of my preferred game formats. I've tried quite a few over the years, but for the most part I lose interest within the first twenty minutes or so. This isn't because of the lack of interactivity or action; it's because, just in general, for games theoretically focused on their textual content, the writing is abysmal.\n\nLadykiller in a Bind had me hooked before the introductory segment had even ended.\n\nNow I'm not going to tell you the game is entirely lacking in cheesiness - that is, in fact, part of the appeal! What I will say is that its writing is clever, humorous, and, perhaps most importantly, sincere. Scenes that would make me cringe to read in other contexts WORK in this game: they're set up properly, they feel like they're given appropriate weight and respect, and those \"uncensored\" moments aren't just played for titillation. The plot is, on its face, ridiculous, basically playing a social media popularity contest in an unrealistic setting, and yet through that vehicle it manages to create a variety of interesting, believable, and widely varied characters.\n\nAs for the structure and mechanics of the game, the way it approaches your standard conversation branching activity is a bit different from the usual formats of either quicktime style \"pick your response before the conversation moves on without you\" or \"everything hinges on this one choice\" that seems most prevalent in these kinds of games. Instead, you get a sort of gradient of choice over the course of a conversation, with options popping up and gradually fading away as they're relevant to the conversation at hand. It lends a sense of realism to the flow of conversation: do you butt in right away as soon as you think of something to say? Do you decide to wait until you can come up with something a little more witty or biting? Are you going to miss your moment entirely trying to think of that perfect response that never comes?\n\nThis is a big part of what kept me engaged with the game as I went through it when I might have otherwise lost interest in a core plot that isn't my usual fare, that sense of needing to really be in the conversation and gauge my role in it to decide how and when I need to make a move, if I want to speak up at all, to achieve my goals. It's more complicated than simply \"who do I want to make happy?\" and then picking whatever seems like it will go that direction as soon as I can. Well, at least it was for me, as I got to know the characters. If you really just want to make your goal \"impress X,\" you can do that, too; it doesn't try to trick you with secretly sabotaging conversation choices. However, as in a real conversation, timing and context is important: what you think might be the best way to get what you want could bite you in the ass if you misjudge your audience.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in VNs, and even for people who, like me, usually don't find the genre interesting at all.

Attention has most notably been paid to making the characters all feel like interesting people who have their flaws and hang-ups but are fun to be around - even if that fun comes from you pushing their buttons until they snap.\n\nOn the side of raw game mechanics, Ladykiller builds on the typical VN style by allowing you to ignore the dialogue prompts that appear on-screen and instead let the conversation continue naturally, new options appearing as new details come up in the conversation, and old prompts disappearing as things move on from where they would be relevent. One small but very useful addition is the inclusion of a tone indicator, letting you know whether the option you are picking will be spoken sarcastically, reasonably, etc. The game also goes out of its way to make clear which options will unlock new paths, give you rewards or penalties, so you won't end up uncertain of why something just happened.\n\nDepending on your reading speed, a playthrough will take 2-6 hours. Exploring all of the main paths will probably take around 6-10. All the paths are dense with dialogue and humor, but this game is priced higher than some people are willing to pay for a VN. I found the price to be acceptable, but not everyone is in the same financial situation and the cost-to-time ratio isn't the best for someone primarily looking for the most playtime for their dollar.\n\nOh, also the sex scenes are all very good, using the same dialogue system as the rest of the game throughout, and make up about 1/3rd of the game's full word count.

If you're balking at the price for a visual novel, absolutely don't, it's worth every penny. It has a cast of memorable characters who are in some ways very much fufilling and archetype, but are not two dimension enough to be summed up by that archetype. The dynamics between characters are good, the dialogue is top notch, and the use of choices and branching paths is stellar. If you at all are into the idea of visual novels, or even just reading a comedy with pictures, seriously just buy this game.\n\nIf you want to hear a longer form review, here's a longer bit of writing about it:\n\nLadykiller in a Bind, or Incredibly Long Title No One But Me Actually Uses, is a game about... well, I mean, the title explains a lot of it. The main character is forced to act as her twin brother for a week on a graduation cruise, and encounters a not really a stalker geek and an absolutely a domme beauty, and sometimes gets tied up. In impersonating her brother, the main character can get \"suspicion\" and if you rack up five suspicion, it's game over. Meanwhile, you also collect votes to win a mysterious game with five million dollars on the line. Also, you have sex with your brother's friends and enemies, probably. There's a lot of sex in Ladykiller, I'm just putting that out there right now. You can have sex with the majority of the cast, and every one of the seven nights ends with the main character in either The Beauty or The Hacker's bed. Speaking of The Beauty and The Hacker, character names in Ladykiller are set by the player. Whenever you met a new character for the first time or another character mentions them before you meet them, a quick info screen shows up and prompts you to pick a name from either one of two suggested choices or a custom name.\n\nChristine Love is one of the very few developers of visual novels interested in poking at what the medium can do. Hate Plus was particularly interesting in a lot of ways regarding the fourth wall, and Ladykiller is a game that subverts a lot of how visual novels work normally in a thoughtful way. I've heard it described as \"a power fantasy for socially awkward people\" and in a way that's right. In most visual novel type games, you have to pick the right option to get what you want, and then if you pick wrong something bad happens. Mostly you just sit there advancing text until a choice happens. In Ladykiller, there's two main differences. First, options pop up during dialogue without interrupting it, and you choose when to speak up. Sometimes you'll reach a point where you have to say something if you've been quiet for too long, but you can cut off characters all the time or jump in eagerly to agree. Secondly, you generally know the outcome of what you're going to say- if it's going to generate suspicion, or get you votes you'll know. If you're about to lose the chance to say an option, it indicates it, and if something opens up more choices, ends a scene or closes off a character, it'll tell you.\n\nWhat this means is the game becomes less about figuring out the \"right\" thing to say, and more about figuring out what you want to result from it. On Twitter in the runup to the release, Christine mentioned that she wanted to make \"good easy choices\" - \"that is to say I\u2019m interested in making it easy for the player to do things they wouldn\u2019t normally do, to do the interesting-but-wrong thing\". You can generally be an asshole and absolutely know you can get away with it. The game even gives you an excuse- you're trying to act like your brother, and he's an asshole, go for it! On the other hand, suspicion is pretty easy to reset, so if you don't want to be bound to acting like your asshole brother, you can be more noble than he would be without necessarily getting game over. It makes for a more interesting dynamic than \"which is the right answer\" or \"which of these answers is the one to get the route you want\". The design of the game in general is really nice as well; there's stylish cards for picking where to go during the day, the menus and options are all nice, and there's well done dynamic music. Characters change outfit every day, and will sometimes be wearing something different if you run into them in the bar compared to the library, so it's significantly more dynamic than the standard \"ten sprites for the entire game and maybe two outfits\" deal.\n\nSo, let's talk about humour: Ladykiller in a Bind is fucking hilarious. I don't think there's a single other game where I've laughed out loud as often as in Ladykiller. If I posted every screenshot I've taken of lines that made me laugh it'd be a wall. The game is just really funny. That said, Ladykiller is also an incredibly honest game in a lot of ways, and part of that is that it's honest to Christine Love's sense of humour, so if tumblr jokes or general memes piss you off probably you'll get annoyed sometimes. That's not all of the humour, by any means, but there's plenty of it, with The Hacker especially. I think the humour as a whole easily stands up even if you don't know any of the memes or tumblrisms referenced, however.\n\nNow would be a good time to mention there's a joke SFW option that puts christmas sweaters on everyone in sex scenes! And that brings us to the sex scenes. I mentioned before that Ladykiller is honest, and while sometimes obviously things are character opinions, sometimes things are said that I'm fairly confident are things that Christine Love thinks. And a lot of these are about relationships. The sex scenes are full of explicit consent, jokes, honest conversation, and exploring relationships. Almost all of the characterisation of The Hacker and The Beauty is done in the sex scenes, inverting the normal \"get to know this character and then bang them\" paradigm. The game doesn't shy away from sex, but it also doesn't treat sex as some kind of ultimate achievement. It's a part of a relationship.\n\nAnyway, I could basically talk about this game forever, but there's a limit to how much anyone wants to read.

It is also a visual novel with interesting choice systems.  You play as \"the Beast\" (every character can be renamed), twin sister of scheming weirdo \"the Prince\".  Your brother has kidnapped you and made you take his place on a cruise ship full of his classmates, who are mostly also scheming weirdoes.  Also, he has arranged a Game to take place on this ship, where everyone is given a vote and the ability to trade it, and whoever has the most votes at the end of the cruise supposedly wins a bunch of money.\n\nLadykiller revolves around two systems: votes and suspicion.  If you're concerned with The Game, you can work to earn votes from people by (for example) doing what they want or tricking them.  However, many actions also arouse suspicion.  You're pretending to be your brother and do not understand any of his relationships with the other people on the ship, so there is a bit of danger in almost any conversation.  Suspicion is always bad, and if you get five points of it, the game ends.  However, it might be worth taking the suspicion hit in order to change someone's opinion of you from whatever impression your brother had left.\n\nThe game is abundantly clear about exactly what effect any option will have.  You never have to guess at the overall outcome of a choice.  When you pick where to go at various times of day, you can see the potential range for vote and suspicion gain for that scene, and when picking options within conversations, you can also see how many votes/suspicion you would gain as well as whether the option might open up more options down the line or just end the scene outright.\n\nThe conversation options themselves are mostly interjections.  They appear in the middle of a conversation and allow you to interrupt with something.  If you continue the conversation, they fade and eventually disappear as the moment passes.  However, occasionally there is a consequence for not interjecting, and in those cases the options will not fade until you have made a choice.\n\nTo further complicate the votes/suspicion system, at the end of each day you choose to spend time with either the Beauty or the Stalker.  The Beauty will erase all of your suspicion, allowing you to act like a complete fool during the day, and the Stalker will give you votes, making it easier to win The Game, but requiring that you take more care with the rest of your actions.\n\nI primarily wanted to talk about the mechanics of the game in this review, but of course I should also mention that the game has numerous sex scenes, mostly at night.  A lot of the most interesting conversation choices are in those scenes, and you can really alter the tone of your relationship with the Beauty or the Stalker depending on what kind of options you pick.  Like the rest of the game, these scenes are about control, and either the giving or taking of it.\n\nThe story is rather silly and I suggest that you not spend too much time thinking about things like how anyone could actually mistake the Beast for the Prince, even if they do have roughly the same face and hair, or how a single school could end up with so many horny Machiavellian backstabbers.  Just take it for what it is and accept that this insanity is happening and that you need to find a way out of it with some shred of dignity hopefully intact (or not!).\n\nAlso, the game has a fantastic dynamic soundtrack whose songs change along with what is happening in the conversation.", "timestamp_created": 1483985327, "timestamp_updated": 1501448194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772702", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39576582": {"recommendationid": "39576582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041969034", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "last_played": 1516714895}, "language": "english", "review": "Fulfil your greatest and strangest fantasies, like being a confident boy.

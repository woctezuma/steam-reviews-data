That was the only thing I was bothered with, but the pros outnumber the cons so I will look it through my fingers.\n\nNot to mention the fact that this game has three routes, and two of them are with guys, while the last one is with a doll of the forest, Some could consider these relationships romantic or platonic, it just depends on your point of view and I loved it. \n\nHonestly, I adored it.

They are all sad, but some are a lot more optimistic than others. Try to get a lot of them as you reach for the true ending. I played without using a guide, and I don't regret it. There's a lot of backstory...not sure how much of it I grasp, but enough. This here is a rich fantasy world. There are loads of hijinks and memorable fun and sentimental moments.

In this game, we take on a third person role as we view the story from the eyes of Chester, a young man from the mainland who ends up on the island of Carlyle.  He is afflicted by a disease simply known as \"Enigma,\" which has spread throughout the world, killing people.  Throughout the story, we meet the various people on the island, such as Colette and Lauro (the siblings who discover Chester), the mysterious, quiet Ignis (who seems to not be originally from the island), and Envirio (a doll who supposedly brings bad fortune to those in contact with it).  When you start the game, you get locked into Lauro's path (which has 7 different endings) and once you get a particular one of his endings, then you can choose to move on to Ignis' path.  Then once you get a particular couple of his endings, you can finally choose to move on to Envirio's endings.  I won't spoil any more in regards to the story or whatnot but definitely, save the true ending of Envirio's path for last.  It might take a while to get to it, but it's totally worth it.\n\nNow that I've given a basic idea of what [i]ENIGMA:[/i] is about, it's time to get on to the critique part of the review.  I think only a few words can sum up my reaction upon finishing this VN, getting all of the endings and whatnot.  I absolutely loved it!  This has to be one of the best VNs I've played in a while.  [i]ENIGMA:[/i] brings out a lot of emotions.  There are parts that are happy, humorous to downright scary and even horror-filled.  I liked getting to know the different characters and as I unlocked different paths, I got to know certain characters better.  Of course, we do get to learn more about the disease known as Enigma and find out that the island has a huge tree called by the same name.  Are the two related or is it just a coincidence?  I'm not going to give the answer for now.  ;)  It's also interesting to learn more about Chester's past and we definitely get to do by playing through Envirio's path.  There are mysteries and a couple do get left unsolved but I could take a pretty good guess as to what was going on so I felt it was fine.  Without a doubt, my favorite ending was definitely the true ending, found on Envirio's path, as it revealed the most of what was going on and it was the saddest, most touching of them all.  It's worth it to save it for last.  Are there any happy endings?  Well, it depends on your definition of happy but I'd say that there are a few.  However, there are others that are sad or even downright scary, full of horror and a bit of gore.  This is just to give a heads up for those who may not be into certain genres and such.  \n\nAs to the other aspects of the game, I loved the art style as well as the music.  Also, there is a gallery which has all of the CGs and endings you have unlocked.  I like when VNs include this feature since I like looking at the CGs and replaying the endings after I've gotten them.  Are there any criticisms I would give?  For me, there was nothing that I personally disliked about the game but I'll bring up this one point since this might be a turn off for those who don't like this feature.  As I stated earlier, when you start a new game, you get locked onto Lauro's route so you can't play Ignis' or Envirio's routes.  This might annoy those who'd rather have the freedom to choose which route to take but I can understand why the developers chose to lock routes.  The other routes do spoil more of the story and I like it better when I can learn more of the story little by little rather than have it all thrown out at me at once.  That's really the only criticism I have although, as I said, this wasn't an issue for me.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved [i]ENIGMA:[/i] and it's a must-have for anyone who loves VNs and a wonderful story.  It took me over 32 hours to complete all of the paths and so forth but that's only because I don't tend to skip text.  I like getting to experience the entire story for myself and rarely do I ever skip text.  For the price, [i]ENIGMA:[/i] is worth buying and you'll be in for one emotional ride once you get started.  ^^", "timestamp_created": 1508994328, "timestamp_updated": 1508994374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36000419": {"recommendationid": "36000419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198360045710", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512855775}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.", "timestamp_created": 1508979005, "timestamp_updated": 1508979005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34247540": {"recommendationid": "34247540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144786155", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505949064}, "language": "english", "review": "warning: the word \"ret*rded\" comes up sometime after the 3rd choice. i am autistic (asperger's) and i would rather not see the word normalized as an insult in such a beautiful game. it was terribly disappointing.\nother than that sour note, i am enjoying the game very much. sorry if you were expecting an in-depth review.", "timestamp_created": 1502763389, "timestamp_updated": 1504489444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471876", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33360335": {"recommendationid": "33360335", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182865045", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510665398}, "language": "english", "review": "Within the first two hours of having played this game, I\u2019d decided I was going to write a review, however for the sake of being thorough, I waited until I finished up all the alternate routes and endings. In short, I was very impressed by just how incredible this visual novel is.\n\nI felt the visuals throughout the game were very nice. There were so many lovely CGs! And the backgrounds\u2026 I was quite impressed. They were absolutely stunning! The character designs were quite nice as well. I feel some visual novels go overboard on some of their designs, but ENIGMA seemed to have a perfect combination of unique, but still practical.\n\nThe music suited the story perfectly. It was so beautiful and haunting. In fact, when I was playing without my headphones, my roommates both commented on just how lovely the background music was. I\u2019m really glad the soundtrack is packaged in with the game, though I would have happily bought it separately if it were not.\n\nWhile these are all well and good, my biggest concern when reading a visual novel is its storytelling. And it just so happens that that category is one where ENIGMA really shines. While it\u2019s true the story starts out a little slow, it gradually introduces you to the cast and the culture of the island of Carlyle. As you complete each ending, you\u2019re given more clues and slowly you piece together the puzzle that is Enigma.\n\nThough I must admit, some of the characters are a bit flat, I felt the 'main' cast were all very well rounded. Chester in particular makes for a wonderful protagonist! I quite enjoyed getting to know more about the former soldier, and watching him interact with the rest of the cast was an incredibly fun experience.\n\nAll in all, this game had me laughing, smiling, uneasy, disturbed, and tearing up\u2014all more than once.

He was found on a beach (most probably thrown overboard during a storm) at an uncharted Island called Carlyle which happened to have a forest also named Enigma, like the disease.\n\nEvery choices would lead to different story path and would explain Enigma from several perspectives. Once finished, we can relate all of the story together to fill in the voids of each storyline.

go as far as saying it's one of the best VNs I've ever played, because it isn't. But it's so unique and engaging! It's an experience I'll never forget, for better of for worse. Why worse? Well, I assume you've read the description of the game - this isn't a joyful one. I mean, sure it has funny moments, but it's overall depressing and has lots of very disturbing moments.\nAn important factor to keep in mind if you want to play this game is that it isn't a game you play for romance, since friendship is the main factor here, even if it has \"character routes\" like most romantic VNs (though you can read in between the lines and see whatever you want in there). \nAs for the characters, I really liked most of them, though I must admit Ignis must be my favorite from the ones who got routes. He really hits some soft spots in my heart and breaks it in some of his endings. Now, Lauro is lovely and lovable too, and Chester, the MC, is one of my favorite main characters in VNs. I think I like Envirio a bit less than the others, but I love seeing dolls in games - it's quite uncommon. \nOne thing bothers me a lot about Envirio, but this isn't a story or character problem. The issue is that most of the characters in the game speak of them using the femenine, while they are genderless being a doll, and they even say it at some point. English has neutral forms, so why not use these? But this is roughly my only complaint.\n\nOther than what I've already said, I also think this game is gorgeous, both the art and the soundtrack are great, and don't even let me start on the opening and the ending!\n\nOverall, it was a great experience I'll be glad to replay once the trauma of the depressing story will subside a bit.\n\n\nPS: don't mind the small playtime recorded by Steam - I've played offline, and it didn't record the time I've played or the achievements. I was able to get the achievements by loading all of my saves and skipping from the last choice leading to each ending (I save all the time), but well, I can't help the playtime.", "timestamp_created": 1484359242, "timestamp_updated": 1484359427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 41, "total_negative": 1, "total_reviews": 42}}

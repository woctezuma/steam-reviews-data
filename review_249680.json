For me this game is heartily recommended for anyone who emjoys watching the action hero heavyweights during the 80's and 90's.\nIt's clear this is also the vibe they are going for and they pretty much nailed it.  At it's core it's a revenge plot but quite simply fluffy and ridiculous, and you blow away enemies using mystic mayan(?) melee weapons instead of guns (ok so could be aztec). Yes you use guns as well, but mainly in set piece battles.\nThe combat is pretty much the standard for any action game that came out after Arkham. but it's big, loud and ridiculous.  The graphics are bright mostly crisp, but for me the chief joy of this, apart from one of the greatest boss battles (for mood) that I have ever played, is simply your \"not so annoying\" companion.  \nI have never been so happy to die in a videogame, and since I am awful at platform sections I hear one of his plethora of lines like \"All the power of the ancients, and then you go fall in a hole and die!?\" quite often.\nThis is quite simply, primal fun.

The \"budget, B movie God of War\" description is very apt and the game has a very lighthearted tone considering that your girlfriend has been kidnapped, you were recently murdered and dumped in the jungle, only to be magically revived as a legendary warrior. so naturally you are now trying to rescue your girl seeking revenge against the very rich guy who did all of that and is seeking crazy magical powers.\n\nThere is a reasonably good variety of weapons and abilities, plus some magical powers that are a pretty good considering the age of the game and its budget. There are also some challenges where the main fightig action is changed with turret sections, races or even \"bullet hell\" sections, which add a little variety. The enemies are varied enough with the exception of some giant scorpins that are moreannnoying than challenging.\n\nThe game is a bit on the easy side if you play it smart; in more than one instance I waited to enter the next section so that for henchmen and bugs would face each other, and they WILL fight each other while you wait, so that eventually I would only have to actually fight the last guy. Alternatively, sometimes you can possess weak and weakeed foes so that they fight for you, which you canleverage to turn the tides on some swarms of opponents.\n\nI had fun with the game t the point where I wanted to see it to the end, which I did. That said, I did take breaks from the game because it is somewhat repetitive. At a discounted price, this is a great buy, while at five bucks you may want to reconsider the purchase even if what is on offer is pretty solid.", "timestamp_created": 1507420317, "timestamp_updated": 1507420317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35518573": {"recommendationid": "35518573", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997981100", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507296814}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

Das Art-Design und ein paar schr\u00e4ge Ideen heben das Game aber dennoch deutlich vom Einheitsbrei einiger anderer Titel ab und machen es so zu einer willkommen Abwechslung im Third Person Actionspiel Genre, weshalb ich guten Gewissens eine Empfehlung aussprechen kann, es lohnt sich definitiv.\n\nFazit: 7.9/10", "timestamp_created": 1505571943, "timestamp_updated": 1505582266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34941681": {"recommendationid": "34941681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123248534", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508367036}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "\u00f3timo game, com um enredo bom, jogabilidade fant\u00e1stica e bons gr\u00e1ficos.

It succeeds at the first admirably, and as a result, hopefully the second happens.\n\nThe game is shamelessly a God of War clone, right down to having 4 weapon types, 4 magic types, one attached to each weapon, and even the identical backwards rolling animation done by flicking the right analog stick to dodge. But rather than try to mimic the grand 'epic' sense of scale, Marlow Briggs takes the combat and sets it into an explosion filled, action packed cinematic adventure full of lighthearted sidekicks (who happen to be floating death masks) and comically evil villains complete with maniacal laughter, making for an enjoyable, tongue in cheek experience.\n\nPresentation is pretty basic, and music serves to be a cinematic backdrop rather than emotional in its own right. The game follows the plot of the evil villain Heng Long, who has discovered ancient Mayan secrets and is using them to take over the world. Our hero, Marlow Briggs, is attacked while trying to help his girlfriend, and is killed, only to be ressurected by the Mask of Death and granted supreme slaying powers as the Sacred Warrior. What follows is a 5-8 hour spetcacle of runnnig through oil rigs, ruins, mountains, and volcanos, blowing up everything in your path. The plot could probably be predicted from second one of the game, but that doesn't really mar the game.\n\nCombat works exactly like God of War, with canned light and heavy attack combos, and weapons that level up as you earn XP based off of actions in the game - from killing enemies, to landing high combos, to collectables found in the world, to orbs picked up for completing time based challenges. Weapons and Magic are levelled up to learn new combos, increase damage, and up your total Health and Mana. I was able to completely max myself out by the second to last level of the game by abusing the whip weapon's massive multi hit mechancis to squeeze tons of extra XP out of fights via high combos. Afterwards, though, the final Hammer weapon becomes the only weapon of choice to use, as unfortunately, later enemies become such damage sponges that the best way to deal with them expediently is to constantly hitstun them over and over again with massive hammer smashes. The game is extremely liberal with magic and health refills, so don't be shy about using your big magic attacks and ranged hits to erase groups of enemies from existence.\n\nPlatforming is minor, and double jumps and later,a glide mechanic, allow for impressive distances to be covered. Puzzles are minor as well, mostly being timed block pushing and platform creating. Even God of War had more complex puzzles, and for the most part, that's really saying something. The platforming and puzzle bits really mostly serve to break up the action and give you a chance to grab life and mana refills, and grab some XP collectables strung around the area in the form of colored death masks that gives life, mana, or XP, based on their color (red, blue, or gold). There's also twelve hidden Blue Masks to find, for the achievement hunter. Most of them are pretty out of the way, and don't grant anything besides an achievement for 1 and an achievement for all  12, so if you really want them, I just suggest using a guide.\n\nLong enough to tell its story and keep the experiences fresh and coming, short enough to not overstay its welcome and bid you goodbye with a sequel teaser that would be straight out of a crazy action movie that you hope will come but probably never will, Marlow Briggs, for $4.99, is an action game experience that shouldn't be mmissed, if you're a fan of the God of War stylr genre.", "timestamp_created": 1499904898, "timestamp_updated": 1499904898, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567286", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33475844": {"recommendationid": "33475844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263128427", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493099119}, "language": "english", "review": "Got it for pretty cheap.

Most of the \"Cutscenes\" are these dynamic dioramas that slowly change as the camera passes across certain objects in the foreground.  They're kind of cool at first, but end up dragging on so long that they eventually become boring, and if you actually pay attention the don't really even make any sense.  The characters are vaguely amusing.  Well some of the characters anyway.  The protagonist and his sidekick have amusing banter.  The stereotypical old chinese man villain is kind of amusingly over the top...  The goalfriend is pretty much a nonentity.  She leaves a few inexplicable notes lying around that are basically just her saying she's scared and to stop trying to save her.  The \"Dragon\" archetype villain is sarcastic and has a sexy character model.\n\nThe reason I've spent so much time talking about story in a game like this is that the gameplay isn't interesting.  It's a very simple spectacle fighter with many of the standard tropes.  You pick up weapons and powers as you go allong.  None of them are really anything interesting or even cool looking.  You kill everything around you then procede allong a linear path collecting experience orbs allong the way to make your weapons and powers stronger.  There's platforming with double jumping, ledge hanging, vine wall clambering, and eventually gliding.  The combat becomes quite boring and repetitive as most enemies are fairly damage spongey, and some are difficult to hit too.

No permanecen en la memoria quiz\u00e1s pero durante su visionado son t\u00edtulos entretenidos y espectaculares. Marlow Briggs bien podr\u00eda tratarse de una pel\u00edcula de Bay.\n\nEl argumento lo hemos visto muchas veces, bueno buen\u00edsimo asesinado y que resucita gracias a antiguos dioses, luego va en busca de venganza para aniquilar al malo mal\u00edsimo y rescatar a su novia de paso, todo obedeciendo a cierta profec\u00eda en tierras precolombinas. Todo muy visto, aunque sin duda es suficiente para montar una historia previsible pero a la vez divertida, no ser\u00e1 este su punto fuerte. Adem\u00e1s los di\u00e1logos no ayudan, pues las conversaciones son un copia-pega de otros tantos t\u00edtulos, y los comentarios chistosos de Marlow dan para risillas y son de serie B.\n\nLos escenarios por donde nos movemos son preciosos, desde selvas espectaculares con mucha vegetaci\u00f3n, antiguas ruinas, templos olvidados, plataformas petrol\u00edferas, etc, sin embargo, la libertad que tenemos a la hora de desplazarnos es exigua, el juego es pasillero a m\u00e1s no poder, nos movemos en l\u00ednea recta por todos los escenarios, con nulo componente de exploraci\u00f3n, salvo para encontrar alg\u00fan secreto, aunque dicho sea de paso, son pocos y est\u00e1n casi a la vista al no poder salir apenas de la ruta marcada. Hay alg\u00fan que otro puzzle muy concreto, pero se resuelven con suma facilidad, este juego no es para pensar. Bonitas vistas, pero aqu\u00ed funciona lo del \"se mira pero no se toca\". Gr\u00e1ficamente vistoso, aunque sin florituras, pero a veces tiene algunas molestas ca\u00eddas de frames y rendimiento que pueden arruinar la partida.\n\nEntonces \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 merece la pena este juego? Por su jugabilidad, como sI de Dante se tratara (salvando las distancias), tenemos a nuestra disposici\u00f3n 4 armas y 4 tipos de magia (no desde el principio, desbloqueables con la historia y mejorables) y gran cantidad de combos f\u00e1ciles de hacer, aunque al final acabaremos usando unos pocos, pero como todos var\u00edan un par de teclas como mucho poco influye; los efectos son espectaculares as\u00ed como los movimientos, f\u00e1cil de dominar, recordando baaaaaastante a Kratos y God of War (si hab\u00e9is jugado lo notar\u00e9is). Imprescindible jugar con mando. Las magias son muy \u00fatiles para momentos desesperados y efectivas. Para conseguir experiencia, debemos derrotar enemigos y encontrar estatuas repartidas por todo el juego.\n\nY los enemigos, no demasiada variedad, comenzando por mercenarios cada vez m\u00e1s fuertes, bichos del bosque como escorpiones, sacerdotes y bestias mitol\u00f3gicas y como no pod\u00eda ser de otra manera, algunos jefes finales que requerir\u00e1n de mayor habilidad y paciencia para ser derrotados; dicho sea de paso, la dificultad es ajustada, ni demasiado f\u00e1cil si jugamos en el modo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, ni imposible, con rapidez de dedos disfrutaremos mucho de los combates. Adem\u00e1s existen zonas en las que deberemos evitar trampas movi\u00e9ndonos muy r\u00e1pido o pulsando secuencias, desaf\u00edos repartidos o misiones con torretas fijas, o incluso alg\u00fan divertido minijuego, para as\u00ed conseguir algo m\u00e1s de variedad en el juego que se agradece.\n\nEn cuanto al sonido, las melod\u00edas son las t\u00edpicas \u00e9picas de juego de acci\u00f3n, nada destacables, y ambientales, y los efectos sonoros son buenos, interesantes para tener un buen equipo de sonido y as\u00ed disfrutarlos m\u00e1s. Los textos est\u00e1n en castellano y las voces en ingl\u00e9s; en conjunto est\u00e1 bien implementado. Las secuencias de v\u00eddeo est\u00e1n realizadas con el propio motor del juego, que nos van desvelando los entresijos de la historia de Marlow Briggs. La duraci\u00f3n es de un par de tardes mal contadas, algo m\u00e1s si se decide ir a por todos los logros.\n\nEn definitiva, un t\u00edtulo que por el simple hecho del irrisorio precio que tiene, ya merece la pena. Se trata de uno de esos t\u00edtulos que pasa desapercibido para la mayor\u00eda, pero que si lo pruebas vas a disfrutarlo el tiempo que te dure, a pesar de todos los defectos que se le puedan encontrar, funciona en la parte m\u00e1s impotante de su estilo: los combates, r\u00e1pidos, divertidos, \u00e1giles, con muchos combos, y que sirven de nexo entre las zonas de (nula) exploraci\u00f3n entre un bonito paraje y otro. As\u00ed pues lo recomiendo si te gusta el hack & slash estilo God of War.\n\nNOTA 7\u00b425/10", "timestamp_created": 1498225949, "timestamp_updated": 1498355896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638123", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32483218": {"recommendationid": "32483218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350122977", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497640299}, "language": "polish", "review": "nie napisz\u0119 nic nowego.

If you don't know who James Hong is, he's the \"I just do eyes\" character on Blade Runner whom Roy Batty isn't very nice to, as well as Po's adoptive father on Kung-Fu Panda, and Covetous Shen on Diablo III, among many other roles. He's a delight to hear do his work, and this game is no different, even if the characters are all pretty flat - which is okay, given the B movie vibe. I can't remember the music, though I don't recall awkward silence, either, so no qualms on that front.\n\nThe B-movie vibe is fun, but other aspects of the game need to shine. Although things can be corny or awkward and still be fun, everything else needs to \"feel\" right, and certain things didn't sit well with me. First off, the game's cutscenes are often freeze-frame camera pans. These are cool for showing you certain details you might have missed, but they really drag on for far too long, and skipping them had me worried I'd miss something plot-relevant. Also, the combat is clearly taken right out of God of War. This isn't a problem, except God of War continually entertained me with a longer playtime, while Marlow Briggs often had me feeling bored despite its 8 or so hours of playtime.\n\nIt took me a while to realize what was boring me, but the bullet-spongy quality of some enemies really got old. You don't shoot enemies, but I'm saying that quite a few enemies had so much health, that I just got tired of beating on them. I found myself shouting \"just die already!\" within about 10 minutes or so of the final battle, and was on the verge of quitting and uninstalling out of sheer annoyance at how long repetitive fights went on. I only pushed on to complete the game because I knew I was right at the finish line.\n\nAlthough this game does have a lot of charm and is of surprising quality at its pricepoint, I can't recommend a game that bored me during much of its playtime, only tempting me to complete it because howlongtobeat.com showed just how short it was, and because so many other players seemed to adore it.

However, some of the enemies can be pretty spongy, and you have to deal with the incessant comments of your ghost companion (who insists on calling you \"Chu Chu\"). The banter between the two is occasionally entertaining, but much of it is repeated, including the worst of it. One of the best way I found to deal with the spongy enemies is simply to use the grab/throw mechanics. Almost every fight takes place in a high spot, and I defeated almost every humanoid enemy in the game by picking them up and throwing them over the edge. And when you're swarmed by bugs, it's almost always more effective (a 1-shot kill) to stomp on them rather than using your weapon attacks.\n\nAdditionally, the camera is sort of locked as you walk around the maps - this can obscure health/mana/experience items, and occasionally makes areas a bit more difficult to navigate than they need to be, especially when you are attempting to glide or avoid moving obstacles. The \"challenge\" sections of the game often require you to quickly avoid a number of environmental hazards, so they weren't particularly enjoyable to me. You don't feel like you're fighting with the camera, to be clear, but there were a handful of times where I wish I had control.\n\nThe game has a skill tree, but there really aren't \"choices\" in any traditional sense. You pretty much only have one option at any given time, and new skills tended to unlock only after I'd maxed out upgrades in the previous ones. Other silly aspects of the game include the \"letters\" that are left to you by your girlfriend (these are just so tonally inconsistent as to feel strange), and the odd way that you pick up health/mana/experience items in the game. These items look like \"masks,\" and to acquire them you have to hold down a button for 3 seconds and watch your character jam his hand in the middle of the mask and struggle to acquire the health/mana/experience. I suppose this led to a bit more interesting encounter design, as you couldn't always grab health items in the middle of a fight, but over the entire game I got a bit tired of waiting 3 seconds every time I wanted to pick something up on the map.\n\nOne thing that I felt the game did very well was the boss encounters. These were always exciting and over-the-top, much like some of the best \"God\" fights in God of War. \n\nI enjoyed my time with Marlow Briggs, but feel that its mechanics might only stay fresh for about as long as it takes for a playthrough (around 6 hours).", "timestamp_created": 1494353317, "timestamp_updated": 1494353317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31588748": {"recommendationid": "31588748", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976354603", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484339873}, "language": "german", "review": "Kann man sich f\u00fcr unter 10 \u20ac g\u00f6nnen :) Leider motiviert es nur f\u00fcr einen Run.", "timestamp_created": 1494100427, "timestamp_updated": 1494100427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31567750": {"recommendationid": "31567750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024350423", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494536371}, "language": "german", "review": "Sinnlos viel Gewalt und Explosionen  sorgen f\u00fcr  viel Spielspa\u00df.

They also throw in various diversions as well such as manning a turret and shooting down attack helicopters, top down airplane shooting, or puzzle platforming. Overall the game is a lot of fun and since it\u2019s an indie game, it\u2019s also cheap (though not on sale very often).\n\n*Spoilers below*\nYou play the title character Marlow Briggs, trying to rescue your girlfriend after being \u201ckilled\u201d with a magical weapon. Sadly (for the bad guys) the magical weapon turns you into a mythical warrior with a new friend, the Mask of Death. The Mask is a lot like the demon companion in Shadow Warrior, who only you can see, and kind of guides you along while making snide remarks at you. Your mission, aside from revenge and rescuing your girlfriend, is to stop the big bad guy from gathering enough magical power to become some kind of ancient Mexican god (even though I think the guy is Chinese).\n\nThe game is played in third person perspective and it\u2019s one of those platformers where you can swing a big weapon and knock around a dozen enemies at once, comparable to Darksiders/DMC Devil May Cry. The combat isn\u2019t that sophisticated, just hit the enemies and dodge when they attack. You also have access to some magical spells, but \u201cmana\u201d in the game is kind of limited and you can\u2019t spam the spells (your mana bar won\u2019t even let you cast 2 spells in a row without picking up more energy). The spells are quite powerful though, and really splash up the screen. Combat is about 66% of the game, where the rest is platforming such as climbing, dodging boulders, double jumping (and later gliding on magical wings). There are a few puzzles to solve, but they\u2019re not too hard. The biggest pain comes from some of the enemies having extraordinary amounts of life.\n\nYou should try this game if:\n+You are looking for a relatively easy hack/slash platforming game with a decent story. Only a few areas in the game had me replaying over and over (challenge areas with risk of instant death). The game only takes about 6-7 hours to beat.\n\nYou should NOT try this game if:\n-You\u2019re expecting some kind of grand RPG, or a game with a lot of replay value. This game cost me $2 and after playing through, I deleted it. Had a good time, now I move on to something else. \n", "timestamp_created": 1490304440, "timestamp_updated": 1490304440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534663", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30676820": {"recommendationid": "30676820", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258120754", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507578835}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Entretenido.

Das ganze Spiel sowie die [b]Geschichte[/b] ist mit einem richtig lustigen aber trashigen Humor gestaltet. Schlechte Spr\u00fcche, flacher Humor und protziges Getue sind im Sekundentakt vertreten. \n\n[b]Spielerisch[/b] ist die Abwechslung definitiv geboten. Marlow heizt den Gegnern mit verschiedenen Waffen und Magiespr\u00fcchen ordentlich und extrem \u00fcbertrieben ein und zerst\u00fcckelt seine Gegner mit zahlreichen Kombos. Schnelle und fordernde K\u00e4mpfe, protzige Bossgegner, gelungene Jump 'n' Run Einlagen, einige Secrets und einen Haufen Minispiele hat das Spiel zu bieten. Der abwechselnde Mix zusammen mit zahlreichen actiongeladene Filmsequenzen und einer grossen, schlauchartig aber detailreichen Welt sorgen daf\u00fcr, dass man ein spannendes Erlebnis haben wird. \nIm Men\u00fc wird jederzeit Hilfe geleistet, falls man mal Waffenkombos vergessen hat oder ausprobieren will. \nDie Gegner sind leider ein bisschen repetitiv, jedoch tr\u00fcbt dies nicht den Spielspass mit einer [b]Spielzeit[/b] von ca. 7 bis 9 Stunden.  \n\n[b]Grafik und Sound[/b] sind volkommen in Ordnung, auch wenn das Spiel keine Grafikbombe ist.

Du coup, le [i]boss[/i] fait ex\u00e9cuter Marlow comme un chien juste sous ses yeux pour la contraindre \u00e0 aller au bout de son contrat. \n\nMais ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 mort avec une arme ancienne trouv\u00e9e sur le site, Marlow reprend vie gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la magie contenue dans celle-ci, se d\u00e9couvre \u00ab\u00a0Guerrier Sacr\u00e9\u00a0\u00bb, et se retrouve affubl\u00e9 d'un masque maya en guise d'acolyte.\n\nMarlow part alors sauver sa belle et r\u00e9clamer vengeance, aid\u00e9 par la toute puissance qui l'habite d\u00e9sormais.\n\n[u][b]Graphismes[/b][/u]\n\nJouant la carte du spectaculaire, Marlow Briggs assume compl\u00e8tement son c\u00f4t\u00e9 [i]too much[/i]. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du jeu, vous vous retrouvez dans des bastonnades tourbillonantes et des sc\u00e8nes de bravoure compl\u00e8tement dingues, sur fond de destructions et de catastrophes incessantes. \u00c7a voltige, \u00e7a explose, \u00e7a valdingue, \u00e7a s'\u00e9croule, \u00e7a s\u2019effondre dans tous les sens.\n\nTout cela est servi par un aspect visuel correct, bien que les textures soient un peu moches. Mais bon, \u00e7a n'emp\u00eache absolument pas de se prendre au jeu.\n\n[u][b]Bande-son[/b][/u]\n\nUn flot de coups, de cris, de grondements telluriques, de bruits m\u00e9caniques, de m\u00e9tal qui se tord et d'explosions sur fond d'orchestration de film d'action tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rique, mais qui fait le boulot. \n\nLe jeu propose cependant quelques ambiances sonores plus calmes assez r\u00e9ussies, ce qui fait du bien entre deux sc\u00e8nes de carnage.\n\n[u][b]Jouabilit\u00e9 / gameplay[/b][/u]\n\nMarlow est vif et r\u00e9pond bien aux commandes. L'action se laisse suivre agr\u00e9ablement, d'autant plus que le jeu ne laisse aucun temps mort (on passe tr\u00e8s vite d'une \u00e9tape \u00e0 une autre) et offre pas mal de vari\u00e9t\u00e9 dans ses diff\u00e9rentes s\u00e9quences.\n\nDans les grandes lignes, c'est un [i]beat'em all[/i] \u00e0 grand spectacle avec une dose de jeu de plate-forme. La palette de coups et de combos tient sur 2 boutons agr\u00e9ment\u00e9s d'un bouton pour sauter, et d'un bouton d'action. On peut aussi lancer des \u00ab\u00a0couteaux spirituels\u00a0\u00bb et utiliser quelques sortil\u00e8ges. \n\nLes combats sont nerveux, et on affronte aussi bien des humains que des cr\u00e9atures fantastiques. Les [i]bosses[/i] sont assez sympas, m\u00eame si on peut ressentir un petit manque d'envergure sur ces combats. Si les bastons en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral manquent un peu de variation et de profondeur sur la longueur, elles n'en restent pas moins plaisantes.\n\nEntre deux phases de baston, on progresse en sautant par-dessus des gouffres, en \u00e9vitant des jets de flammes, en esquivant des m\u00e9canismes susceptibles de vous broyer ou de vous pousser dans le vide, ce genre de choses. Il y aussi des phases de glissade, de course-poursuite, ou la traditionnelle balade sur le chariot de mine, autant de s\u00e9quences qui varient les situations et le gameplay.\n\nDe temps \u00e0 autre, une pseudo-\u00e9nigme appara\u00eet sur votre chemin. C'est simpliste, mais \u00e7a participe \u00e0 la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 du gameplay sans pour autant casser le rythme du jeu.\n\nLa cam\u00e9ra offre une perspective assez a\u00e9rienne qu'on ne peut pas modifier, ce qui donne une vue claire sur l'action, mais cela peut fausser la perception que l'on a de la situation (ennemi dans le hors-champ, angle de vue qui fait cafouiller durant une phase de varappe ou de saut). Rien de dramatique, cela dit.\n\n[u][b]Sc\u00e9nario[/b][/u]\n\nD\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, on comprend que le jeu va \u00e0 l'essentiel, et c'est r\u00e9ussi. On sent vraiment un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00ab\u00a0nanar\u00a0\u00bb volontaire et assum\u00e9\u00a0: les personnages sont clich\u00e9s et sont juste des pr\u00e9textes, l'histoire est bidon, tout arrive et passe si vite que tout semble exp\u00e9di\u00e9... Et pourtant, \u00e7a fonctionne\u00a0! De plus, les r\u00e9flexions de Marlow et ses dialogues avec le masque sont assez dr\u00f4les, ce qui ajoute encore une bonne dose de second degr\u00e9.\n\nJe suis toutefois bien plus r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sur les cin\u00e9matiques fa\u00e7on \u00ab\u00a0sc\u00e8ne fig\u00e9e dans laquelle la cam\u00e9ra circule\u00a0\u00bb qui pars\u00e8ment le jeu. Peut-\u00eatre que cette \u00ab\u00a0figure de style\u00a0\u00bb redondante d\u00e9coule plus du budget limit\u00e9 que de la r\u00e9elle volont\u00e9 artistique, mais il n'emp\u00eache que, selon moi, elles sont un peu trop longues, un peu trop nombreuses, ni belles, ni dr\u00f4les. Elles sont juste lourdingues.\n\nAlors que le reste du jeu trouve un \u00e9quilibre entre surench\u00e8re et moments plus pos\u00e9s, ces s\u00e9quences cassent carr\u00e9ment le rythme du jeu, et m\u00eame parfois le plaisir\u00a0: ne pas pouvoir jouer la mise \u00e0 mort d'un [i]boss[/i], par exemple, pour y assister sous la forme d'une de ces cin\u00e9matiques longuettes, sans \u00e9nergie, et pas forc\u00e9ment belles, c'est dommage.

Das Spiel ist ziemlich unbekannt, da es 2013 im Hype von GTA5 untergegangen ist. Dabei hat es viel zu bieten. Die Charaktere sind sympathisch, die Sprecher gut gew\u00e4hlt und die Dialoge meist sehr witzig. Es gibt englische Sprachausgabe und deutsche Untertitel.\nWie in GoW gibt es verschiedene Waffen, Einzel- und Fl\u00e4chenangriffe sowie verschiede Zauber die man mit gesammelten Orbs aufr\u00fcsten kann. Wie in GoW kann man an W\u00e4nden (auch \u00fcber Kopf) klettern, R\u00e4tsel mit Drehschaltern l\u00f6sen und bekommt sp\u00e4ter im Spiel die F\u00e4higkeit zu gleiten.\nUnterbrochen wird das Spiel manchmal durch Railshooter- und zwei nett gemachte Vertikalshooter-Abschnitte. Der Abspann h\u00e4lt noch eine weitere nette \u00dcberraschung bereit.\n\nMarlow Briggs macht es mir wirklich nicht einfach. Ich habe eine Weile \u00fcberlegt wie ich es bewerten soll, habe mich aber knapp f\u00fcr eine Empfehlung entschieden.\nDas Spiel hat zwei M\u00e4ngel \u00fcber die man kaum hinwegsehen kann. Wie in den Foren beschrieben, wird man zuverl\u00e4ssig und kommentarlos nach 30 bis 45 Minuten Spielzeit zur\u00fcck auf den Desktop geworfen. Da ich etwa 8 Stunden gespielt habe, kann man sich genau ausrechnen wie oft mir das passiert ist. \nPunkt zwei ist die Tatsache, dass Zwischensequenzen sehr pl\u00f6tzlich einsetzen und auch augenblicklich durch ein unbeabsichtigtes Dr\u00fccken der Angriffstaste \u00fcbersprungen werden. Mir sind dadurch essenzielle Storyteile entgangen und wei\u00df bis jetzt nicht, warum ich mit einem der Feinde pl\u00f6tzlich befreundet war.\n \nDa Marlow Briggs nicht viel Geld kostet und auch nicht sehr lang ist, kann man es sich trotz der gravierenden M\u00e4ngel ansehen. Mir hat es insgesamt viel Spa\u00df gemacht, eine uneingeschr\u00e4nkte Empfehlung kann ich aber nicht geben.", "timestamp_created": 1488058396, "timestamp_updated": 1488058490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583966", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30178213": {"recommendationid": "30178213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048632839", "num_games_owned": 640, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488046060}, "language": "italian", "review": "Un clone economico di God of War, con tanto di simboli sul corpo, lame dal raggio lungo tra le armi adoperabili, arrampicate con nemici molli di mezzo, ma....  con divinit\u00e0 atzeche, un assistente che ricorda Aku Aku di Crash Bandicoot e un protagonista nero e scherzoso, totalmente opposto all' arcigno e pallido Kratos. \n\nTecnicamente siamo su livelli di una ps2 a fine generazione nonostante lo sviluppo recente, e la telecamera automatica, non modificabile in alcun modo \u00e8 tarata spesso in modo infelice e ricorda tempi ancor pi\u00f9 lontani. Le fasi narrative sono ultra economiche ed a parte l'inizio, l'intermezzo ed il finale, invece di essere, animate col motore di gioco, sono costituite da  sequenze comicamente in fermo immagine e passate al rallentatore, una trovata che in teoria vorrebbe trasmettere epicit\u00e0 durante i disastri del nostro avatar, peccato che  presto verranno saltate direttamente visto la lungaggine, la loro scarsa utilit\u00e0 e la consapevolezza tardiva che vi \u00e8 un orrido trofeo ottenibile facendo subito in tal modo....   BAH!.   \n\nI livelli di difficolt\u00e0 sono 4, ed io l'ho giocato al secondo livello, quello normale, che sarebbe stato pi\u00f9 corretto chiamare Facile (e il corrispettivo livello Ameba) dato che persino il boss finale, giocato in modo disattento \u00e8 andato gi\u00f9 al primo tentativo. A livello medio, su otto ore necessarie al suo completamento, le prime due ore di gioco si sono dimostrate veramente a prova di esseri privi di pollice opponibile, e anche il level design stenta parecchio ad ingranare, dimostrandosi abbastanza piatto per la prima met\u00e0 del titolo, mentre a fronte di un miglioramento secondario, rimane comunque ripetitivo di per se. Gli ostacoli maggiori sono stati probabilmente alcuni salti e spazi stretti per combattere, ma si tratta di casi sporadici.  Durante la campagna vi \u00e8 tuttavia la possibilit\u00e0 di cambiare il livello di sfida, ma personalmente non l'ho fatto per due motivi: 1) per non perdere i progressi fatti (a sto punto meglio ricominciare, ma avevo poca voglia onestamente), 2) perch\u00e9 quando il gioco tenta blandamente di farti impegnare, palesa tattiche poco felici. \n\nPer spiegarmi meglio specificher\u00f2 prima le probabili cause. Marlow Briggs ha un sistema di combattimento funzionale, ma rozzo nonostante la possibilit\u00e0 di cambiare arma, e aggiungerei mal compensato dato che pur facendo stragi, ad un livello palesemente permissivo, l'energia vitale risucchiata dai nemici riempie impercettibilmente la barra vitale. La variet\u00e0 degli stessi \u00e8 solo sufficiente, hanno tentato maldestramente di rinnovarli tramite potenziamenti ed un aura oscura, ma con scarsi risultati all'atto pratico. Tutte mancanze dovute ovviamente a un progetto poco spontaneo alla sua radice e aggiustato alla meglio. Per evitare di lasciare il giocatore a secco i programmatori invece di differenziare nettamente le ricompense, hanno puntato sul pi\u00f9 netto e facile posizionamento delle fonti di vita e di mana nei quadri, ma in numero elevato  gi\u00e0 a livello normale. Met\u00e0 di essi, e non esagero, li ho saltati fino all'ultima ora di gioco e le fonti gialle di exp, con un minimo di attenzione esplorativa  mi sono avanzate per completare tutte le tecniche magiche. \n\nOnestamente non so quanto il gioco possa essere stato equilibrato meglio ai livelli successivi. A parte alcuni invocatori con la tecnica superiore della moltiplicazione, gli unici nemici decenti di Marlow saranno le coppie di scorpioni giganti, per lo pi\u00f9 i gialli, che hanno un danno accettabile oltre la resistenza, contrariamente ai giganti umanoidi lenti e poco dannosi o ai soldati/spiriti pi\u00f9 numerosi, ma facili da uccidere, far danneggiare con i loro stessi barili esplosivi o anche solo tenere a bada incantando i pi\u00f9 deboli di loro con la tecnica della presa per  farsi aiutare. In generale, il ritmo del gioco \u00e8 veloce ma non stimolante. Il concetto di difficolt\u00e0 sembra essere stato per lo pi\u00f9 legato alla resistenza, infatti  a parte i ragnetti, pi\u00f9 che macellare orde di nemici diversi il gioco preferisce metterci contro continuamente un numero ristretto di tank per tipo e numero, siano essi piccoli, grandi o giganteschi, che a fronte di un danno contenuto e pattern semplici, diventano subito tediosi e basta e fanno desiderare di sprecare il mana per toglierseli di torno... e non \u00e8 che con i midboss cambi molto la musica.\n\nComunque... per quanto possa essere severo, mi sento di spezzare una lancia in favore del team di sviluppo. La buona volont\u00e0 si intravede nello scambio di battute dei due simpatici protagonisti e nel tentativo di variare il gameplay al meglio delle loro modeste capacit\u00e0. Saranno infatti presenti durante la campagna prove di vario genere, dal race-platforming per raccogliere sfere di esperienza, alla classica torretta falcia elicotteri, fino a vere fasi Shrumps, queste ultime un p\u00f2 pretenziose nello basarsi sulla tempistica pi\u00f9 che sulla distruzione dei nemici, salvo rinunciare al  bonus exp.  In generale non boccio Marlow Briggs, \u00e8 fatto con pi\u00f9 passione che budget ed \u00e8 stato un tappabuchi piacevole e sufficientemente lungo per quello che aveva da offrire, ma per quanto ragionevole sia il costo base, non \u00e8 un titolo che consiglio a prezzo pieno dato che viene spesso scontato. Nel caso lo prendeste vi consiglio di partire col terzo livello, ma al tempo stesso, vi invito a riflettere sul mettere l'ultimo visto il requisito di pazienza richiesto gi\u00e0 con alcuni nemici base, anche se, l'alta probabilit\u00e0 che sia tarato male potrebbe offrire in senso opposto una sfida da non sottovalutare.", "timestamp_created": 1488057645, "timestamp_updated": 1488112505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30108989": {"recommendationid": "30108989", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070887333", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487805142}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't really add to the things that have been said before, just giving this my thumbs up.

Just a hack and slash style game. You can level up multiple specials and to keep the combat fresh you end up with 4 different types of weapon. I ended up just using the original weapon and the heavy weapon. Combos are pretty responsive and you can interrupt using a dodge. \n\nThe only really poor thing IMO is that you cannot control the camera.

Tomadas de c\u00e2mera, movimento, combos; basicamente tudo, com excess\u00e3o a viol\u00eancia, que n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o elevada assim; e conte\u00fado sexual, que \u00e9 nulo.\n   Como nos filmes de a\u00e7\u00e3o da d\u00e9cada de 90, Marlow Briggs se resume a uma hist\u00f3ria rasa, mas recheada de porradaria. Apesar de ter uma grande varia\u00e7\u00e3o de movimentos, voc\u00ea acaba se atendo aos b\u00e1sicos e mesmo assim consegue uma boa experi\u00eancia de jogo.\n   Os gr\u00e1fico de cen\u00e1rios s\u00e3o bem trabalhados no limite do or\u00e7amento. Anima\u00e7\u00f5es complexas s\u00e3o pouco exploradas. Para economizar espaco e dinheiro, eles utilizaram a t\u00e9cnica de \"freezeframe\" para contar grandes sequencias de a\u00e7\u00e3o em poucos segundos como se fosse um quadrinho tridimensional.\n   A m\u00fasica tem um apelo agrad\u00e1vele a ajuda a climatizar o jogo.\n   Um dos pontos mais altos, na minha opini\u00e3o, \u00e9 a falta de seriedade do jogo cosigo mesmo. A M\u00e1scara da Morte possue coment\u00e1rios hil\u00e1rio e s\u00e3o um expet\u00e1culo a parte. O pr\u00f3prio Marlow faz coment\u00e1rios que seriam cr\u00edticas ao pr\u00f3prio desenho e planejamento das telas, como se quisesse quebrar a quarta barreira, mas de forma s\u00fatil.\n   Marlow Briggs at\u00e9 vale o pre\u00e7o total, mas se vc n\u00e3o curtir jogos de baixo or\u00e7amento, \u00e9 melhor esperar alguma promo\u00e7\u00e3o. Eu o comprei por R$2,50 e achei divertido. Foram boas 8h investida pois sou um amante do g\u00eanero. Se voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m gosta, vale a pena conferir. Esse \u00e9 daqueles tipos de jogos \"p\u00e9rolas\".

Es bietet 4 verschiedene Waffen, die man im Laufe des Spieles freischaltet und 4 Supernovas oder wie man es nennen will. Gut gro\u00dfen Tiefgang hat das simple Hack and Slay jetzt nicht aber es gen\u00fcgt vollkommen aus um \u00fcber die 4. Spielstunden am Ball bleiben zu wollen.

Die Grafik ist dazu stimmig und f\u00fcr den Preis entsprechend auch echt echt gut. Sie tut was sie soll und ist nicht fehl am Platz, wenn man es so sagen will.

presenti su steam. Che dire, fra \"Il god of war versione pc\" e \"capolavoro\" ho pensato di fare l'affare della vita comprandolo ad un euro, e invece....\nMarlow Briggs \u00e8 un titolo Indie sviluppato Zootfly e pubblicato dalla 505 Games. Fra i titoli rilasciati da questa casa, i quali si contano sulle dita di una mano, questo \u00e8 sicuramente il migliore ed il pi\u00f9 ispirato.\nLa storia parte con qualche sequenza filmata veloce e senza patos, la quale ci introdurr\u00e0 chi siamo e cosa dobbiamo fare.\nMarlow, il protagonista, \u00e8 fidanzato con un'archeologa molto famosa, la quale implicata in scavi portati avanti da un losco mafioso Asiatico, finisce vittima di lui e della sua politica col pungo di ferro. \nMarlow, dopo essere stato ucciso, rinasce nelle vesti del guerriero sacro, ed il suo compito adesso \u00e8 quello di recuperare la sua amata, anche se vi anticipo che man mano che le ore passeranno, il protagonista finir\u00e0 in una missione molto pi\u00f9 grande di lui.\nDurante tutta l\u2019avventura sarete accompagnati da uno spirito Maya il quale presenta delle battute davvero divertenti, le quali daranno vita a vari teatrini interessanti fra Marlow e, appunto, lo spirito.\nIl gamplay di questo titolo \u00e8 molto scarno e ripetitivo. I nemici che incontrerete nel vostro cammino saranno vari e molto ben caratterizzati.

Daf\u00fcr sind Gameplay und Story umso besser gelungen. In seinen rund 6 Stunden Spielzeit bietet das Spiel eine enorme Abwechslung und jede Menge witzige Dialoge. Es kommt einem fast so vor, als w\u00fcrde alle 5 Minuten ein neuer Gegner, eine neue Waffe oder eine neue Challenge zu Gesicht bekommen. Mal muss man Moorhuhn-Artig Hubschrauber mit dem FLAK vom Himmel hohlen, mal befindet man sich selbst in einem Flugger\u00e4t und muss in einem Bullet Hell Minispiel feindliche Hubschrauber abschie\u00dfen und deren Raketen ausweichen. \n\nDazu kommen noch ab und zu eingef\u00fcgte Dialoge zwischen Marlow und der namensgebenden Maske des Todes, welche wir immer bei uns haben. Mehr dazu aber im Story-Teil.\n\nLeider muss ich sagen, dass das Spiel an keiner Stelle wirklich fordernd wird. Ich bin w\u00e4hrend des Spielens auf dem mittleren der 3 Schwierigkeitsgrade nicht ein einziges Mal im Kampf gestorben.\n\nJetzt noch ein paar Worte zur Story:\nMarlow ist der Freund einer jungen Arch\u00e4ologin, welche zurzeit damit besch\u00e4ftigt ist, f\u00fcr einen chinesischen Konzern alte Schriften zu \u00fcbersetzten. Marlow begleitet seine Freundin zur Arbeit, weil diese k\u00fcndigen will. Das findet der chinesische Chef, dessen Name mir leider entfallen ist, gar nicht so lustig und l\u00e4sst Marlow kurzerhand mit einem alten Artefaktschwert erstechen um Eva, so hei\u00dft das M\u00e4dchen, dazu zu zwingen, weiter zu arbeiten. \n\nDas Artefakt belebt Marlow wieder und gibt ihm gleich dazu noch ein paar Superkr\u00e4fte. Sein Mordwerkzeug beh\u00e4lt er und verwendet es selbst als Waffe. Die Maske, ein Anf\u00fchrer eines alten Stammes, begleitet ihn ab jetzt auf seiner Reise. \nNun schnetzelt wir uns als Super-Marlow durch Gegnerwellen und erledigen allerhand Schwergen des b\u00f6sen Chinesen und einige andere Monster. Wie schon gesagt, hier wird einiges an Abwechslung geboten.\n\nMehr sag ich zur Story jetzt aber auch nicht mehr, ihr sollt ja schlie\u00dflich auch was zu erleben haben. Also LOS!!

Zootfly.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 puro Hack and Slash e totalmente focado na a\u00e7\u00e3o, que \u00e9 o ponto mais forte do jogo. \n\nSobre o enredo \u00e9 b\u00e1sico: Voc\u00ea estava de f\u00e9rias e foi visitar um local onde sua namorada estava trabalhando para seu chefe, logo ap\u00f3s ela descobrir o qu\u00ea estava se passando, o seu chefe acaba por capturar a namorada de Marlow e com isso acaba tamb\u00e9m matando o mesmo. S\u00f3 que depois desta morte, ele foi \"ressuscitado\" por uma entidade Mayan Death Mask que \u00e9 um anci\u00e3o do local) onde estavam procurando por artefatos sagrados. O chefe desta explora\u00e7\u00e3o ent\u00e3o passa a querer poder absoluto para dominar tudo e consequentemente matar a namorada de Marlow. S\u00f3 que com os poderes que Marlow adquiriu durante sua jornada e gra\u00e7as a entidade ele vai melhorando seus poderes ao longo da jornada em busca de salvar sua namorada e principalmente derrotar o chefe que controla o local que agora quer poder absoluto gra\u00e7as ao artefato que a namorada de Marlow estava tentando descrever, ou melhor. Decifrar. Contamos tamb\u00e9m com a ajuda de uma outra protagonista que na verdade n\u00e3o sabemos se ficou viva ou morta, afinal ela tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o queria participar deste ritual. \n\nO enredo \u00e9 deveras simples e n\u00e3o funciona como plano de fundo central para o jogo funcionar bem. Ele tem boas sacadas, o anci\u00e3o acaba falando com voc\u00ea e Marlow sempre tem uma piada ou sacada genial ao longo da jogatina, assim tamb\u00e9m como o anci\u00e3o. Os di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o bem executados e a trama apesar de ser super simples, \u00e9 bacana de se entender e jogar at\u00e9 o final para saber o qu\u00ea vai acontecer. \u00c9 deveras clich\u00ea? sim, mas funciona para este tipo de jogo. \n\nOs pontos mais altos de Marlow s\u00e3o os cen\u00e1rios que s\u00e3o super bem detalhados e muito variados, a trilha sonora que \u00e9 perfeita para cada momento de calmaria e a\u00e7\u00e3o, a variedade de inimigos, a possibilidade de subir nos inimigos e acabar com os outros inimigos, as varia\u00e7\u00f5es nos poderes (skills) de Marlow e principalmente a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o no geral. \n\nMas o destaque fica por conta da a\u00e7\u00e3o fren\u00e9tica que o jogo proporciona para o jogador. Aqui \u00e9 a\u00e7\u00e3o total a quase todo o momento (tirando pequenos puzzles super simples) para quebrar um pouco do ritmo insano que o jogo coloca na frente do jogador. Quem gosta de sangue, porradaria, poderes e belos combos e skills est\u00e1 no jogo certo. \n\nOutro fator maravilhoso neste jogo s\u00e3o as cutscenes em c\u00e2mera lenta que acabam gerando belas imagens e s\u00e3o perfeitamente detalhadas e acaba sendo um dos maiores destaques do jogo. S\u00e3o incr\u00edveis, algumas \u00e9 claro n\u00e3o t\u00e3o belas quanto as outras, mas mesmo assim vale a pena ficar vendo as cenas em camera lenta e ver o quanto a desenvolvedora se preocupou em mesclar a\u00e7\u00e3o + cenas absurdamente maravilhosas durante o decorrer da campanha. \n\nAgora vamos fazer um belo resumo sobre o jogo e contando com pontos positivos e negativos:\n\nPontos positivos: \n\n+ Enredo simples, mas funcional.\n+ Ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o fant\u00e1stica.\n+ Gr\u00e1ficos medianos mas com belo jogo de luzes, sombras.\n+ Protagonistas carism\u00e1ticos.\n+ Belas sacadas e piadas durante o jogo, que quebram o clima de seriedade e ajudam o jogador a se divertir.\n+ Trilha sonora que combina perfeitamente com o estilo proposto pelo jogo.\n+ Engine bem trabalhada (at\u00e9 certo ponto) e sendo um jogo muito leve.\n+ \u00d3tima dura\u00e7\u00e3o.\n+ Boa variedade de Skills.\n+ Boa variedade de inimigos.\n+ Conquistas para os miletadores.\n+ Boa dificuldade.\n\nPontos negativos: \n\n- Bugs na engine: Apesar de ser uma boa engine eu me deparei com alguns bugs como por exemplo: O cen\u00e1rio sumir ou o personagem travar em algum local ou at\u00e9 mesmo tendo que reiniciar o jogo para resolver o problema, fiz isso 3 a 5 vezes.\n- Falta de Portugu\u00eas - Brasil.\n- \u00daltimo chefe \u00e9 completamente f\u00e1cil de se matar, diferente dos outros que acabam pedindo mais do jogador.\n- Final um tanto fraco, mas teria at\u00e9 possibilidade de continua\u00e7\u00e3o (que n\u00e3o vai ocorrer, \u00f3bviamente).\n- Controles (pelo teclado) s\u00e3o bem fracos.\n- As vezes o personagem n\u00e3o responde de maneira satisf\u00e1toria os comandos dados pelo jogador.\n\nNo geral Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death \u00e9 um jogo de a\u00e7\u00e3o pura, com bela ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o, bela trilha sonora e \u00f3timas cenas em c\u00e2mera lenta para a satis\u00e7\u00e3o do jogador que gosta de um bom jogo de a\u00e7\u00e3o e sangue pela tela. Sem contar seus gr\u00e1ficos, seus protagonistas, o level design e a varia\u00e7\u00e3o dos cen\u00e1rios e inimigos.\n\nEu recomendo o jogo at\u00e9 mesmo no pre\u00e7o full de 10,49 j\u00e1 que o mesmo pode render de 6 - 10 horas de gameplay, principalmente levando em conta se o jogador vai pegar todas as conquistas. \n\nComo eu peguei ele por apenas 2 reais, \u00e9 realmente uma barganha e recomendo absolutamente este jogo para todos que querem um jogo divertido, sem compromisso e apelando para a a\u00e7\u00e3o a todo momento. Sim, o enredo \u00e9 clich\u00ea e fraco, mas n\u00e3o tira o brilho que o jogo proporciona no que acaba se propondo.\n\nMe diverti bastante com este jogo e recomendo para todos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1484111822, "timestamp_updated": 1484111822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.683210", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29175971": {"recommendationid": "29175971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082032795", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486746429}, "language": "english", "review": "Just by sitting in my Steam Library, I can already feel the difference this game is making.\n\nI was but a fool before.

Resurrected by a spirit in the blade Marlow can now wield various supernatural weapons, and can't die (obviously in terms of gameplay he can, but you are resurrected at a checkpoint...)\n\nTo rescue his girlfriend, and stop some real bad end of times stuff happening, he must stab lots of things and climb up lots of platforms. Luckily he is quite handy at doing both.\n\nThis is a surprisingly fun, slick game along the lines of Devil May Cry / Dante's Inferno / Wolverine: Origins / Enslaved / Conan, and, er.....are there are any others on PC? It controls well, and is responsive. It's not quite the skill based style of DMC, but a fairly hefty challenge encourages using his various weapons and requires some dexterity.\n\nFor a game that isn't AAA it has some nifty setpieces, decent production values, and is amusingly stupid about a very stupid story. To compare it to God Of War (which is the most spectacular of this kind of game in my eyes) would be daft, but it would be fair to say that 'Marlow Briggs etc' makes a pretty darn good go at the genre.\n\nAnd its certainly better than Dante's Inferno or Wolverine Origins. I doubt many people remember them, yet I can't think of anything more recent that was this kind of gameplay. The DMC reboot is certainly more polished, but as long as skill and scoring isn't your main interest, then this game will do nicely for your bloodthirsty urges.\n\nLooking at my Steam time though - it is a smidge short, though I might have played  some of it offline.", "timestamp_created": 1484091881, "timestamp_updated": 1484091881, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604073", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29171969": {"recommendationid": "29171969", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136585050", "num_games_owned": 704, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 68, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484087479}, "language": "thai", "review": "25\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e17\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21 Hack and Slash\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e4c\u0e46\u0e01\u0e47\u0e04\u0e38\u0e49\u0e21\u0e14\u0e35\u0e19\u0e30=w= Achievement\u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e14\u0e39\u0e01\u0e47\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e48 \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e14\u0e32\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e48\u0e32\u0e07\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e14 :v \u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e19\u0e28\u0e31\u0e15\u0e23\u0e39\u0e21\u0e31\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e4c\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e02\u0e19\u0e32\u0e14\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e19\u0e34\u0e14\u0e40\u0e14\u0e35\u0e22\u0e27 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e14\u0e32\u0e46 \u0e41\u0e16\u0e21\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e21\u0e35\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e44\u0e23\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e04\u0e27\u0e23- -\" \u0e41\u0e2a\u0e07\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e1a\u0e15\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e36\u0e2a\u0e46 7/10 \u0e0b\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e06\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e39\u0e48", "timestamp_created": 1484087985, "timestamp_updated": 1484087985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29171623": {"recommendationid": "29171623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264257893", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490207450}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "aprovado", "timestamp_created": 1484086654, "timestamp_updated": 1484086654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29170896": {"recommendationid": "29170896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246337492", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484309228}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 ! \u0414\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u044f\u0440\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438 \u044d\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u044b . \u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043f\u044b , \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f\u043c\u0438 . \u041a\u0443\u0447\u0430 \u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u0430 . \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e , \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0434\u0443\u0448\u0435 . \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c, \u043a \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e.", "timestamp_created": 1484084229, "timestamp_updated": 1493884936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29170463": {"recommendationid": "29170463", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000681902", "num_games_owned": 486, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484082472}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is actually surprisingly good.\n\nThe writing is really hillarious and the combat itself is not really that bad.

But none of this matters because Marlow Briggs is unquestionably a blast to play. \n\nPros: \n- deliberately trashy, it's all about the fun\n- great conversations between the mask and Marlow\n- fluid movements\n- good voice acting\n- nice, average graphics\n- explosive, wild fights\n- enjoyable boss fights\n- top-down shooter in-game mini-games\n- credits is a mini-game too\n- hilarious end of the story\n- feels like a B-movie\n- many automatic save points\n- option to save manually\n- ride and fight with a giant scorpion\n- learn, upgrade and use magic attacks\n- find and upgrade different weapons\n\nNeutral:\n- except for the final boss fight the game is a little too simple on normal difficulty\n- choosing the best combo is not important on normal difficulty\n\nCons:\n- sometimes somewhat annoying camera perspective\n- the game crashed four times in my 10 hour play-through", "timestamp_created": 1482084567, "timestamp_updated": 1482087643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803080", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28333141": {"recommendationid": "28333141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014631938", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481575920}, "language": "english", "review": "A decent game. I put around 3 hours into it which is about half way through because according to howlongtobeat.com it takes 6 hours to finish the game.\n\nIt's a hack and slash game with a variety of weapons and some magic abilities. The combat is fun but can get repetitive when you are just spam clicking and using shift to dodge. The game looks pretty decent for the age and price and there is a ongoing story throughout the game. There are also some puzzle elements but they are quite simple and shouldn't cause too many problems, if at all.\n\nMy only complaint is the camera. You don't control the camera, it moves around automatically as the character moves so it will swing around and adjust itself automatically so it can get a bit disorientating.\n\nOverall it's a pretty decent game, especially at the price.

What you're supposed to do is activiate a series of triggers within a room, but the control system and the mechanics of the game make it near-impossible to do so in the small amount of time given.

Is this game just another mediocre God of War clone, or does it rise above that by being a hilarious and self aware budget game? Spoilers: it does.\n\nStory: Marlow Briggs takes place in South America, where your ladyfriend is translating ruins for a crazy businessman. When she tries to quit working for him, our protagonist Marlow is stabbed by a ancient Mayan weapon and killed. He is brought back to life by a talkative mask and goes out to kill the bad guy and save the girl. Pretty normal stuff. Anyway, it doesn't take itself seriously, and I did get quite a few laughs from the magical mask, who acts as the comic relief throughout the game, and gets some good banter with Marlow. Also the evil businessman is absolutely amazing, he has enough ham to feed a West Virginia family reunion (In case you didn't know, that is a lot of ham) It might not make much sense, but I had fun, and that's what matters.\n\nGraphics: Looks great, lots of colors, good animations for Marlow's attacks. Very few options on PC but runs smoothly, so I didn't mind. Not much to say here. One quick sidenote, why are some people saying the graphics in this are bad? It's a budget game, 15 bucks at launch man. Are people comparing this game's graphics to AAA 60 dollar games? Cause that doesn't make a whole lotta sense.\n\nGameplay: The God of War comparison is easy to make, and it certainly follows the formula. Light and heavy attacks, combos, health and mana items, all of that stuff. Not being an expert at God of War (or any game, for that matter) I don't know the small details, for instance if the 43rd frame of Marlow's combo ruins the game or any super indepth thing like that. I can tell you the combat is smooth and responsive on keyboard and mouse, combos feel very natural to pull off,  dodging works effortlessly, and magic attacks feel very powerful and satisfying. It also has quite a bit of variety, platforming, very basic puzzle solving, and turret sections that don't overstay their welcome. Everything in this game works well, and controls pretty much perfectly. Here's a quick side thing, I didn't try using a controller, because the keyboard and mouse worked perfectly. As a guy raised on consoles, it's rare where I play an action game that feels flawless on Keyboard and mouse. \n\nLength and replay value: The game takes about 7.5 hours to beat, probably less if you don't suck as badly as myself. Not many reasons to replay unless you want to beat the game on hard mode.\n\nShould you get it? If you like fun games, I'd recommend it. If you don't like fun games, buy Call of Duty Ghosts instead. Just kidding! Even if you hate video games, don't buy Call of Duty Ghosts. Buy Marlow Briggs and give it to someone who likes games.\n\nThanks for reading my review!

The gameplay outside of combat is no better; there are numerous puzzle and platforming sections, but I found these areas just a hassle; I ran into numerous glitches, (character unable to climb up walls, character glitching through walls, etc.) which was only made worse by the fact that the puzzles, I felt, lacked any real challenge.\n    (I will now discuss the issue of the game taking itself seriously, this is a personal preference when it comes to cheesy games, so you can disregard this section if you'd like, [skip to next paragraph] but I feel it's worth saying) Secondly, and by far one of my biggest complaints, the game takes itself way too seriously. What I mean by this is, the game, or I suppose the creators, really, could not see how ridiculous and cheesy the plot, characters, cut-scenes, and overall feel of the game is; they want us to look at the game as a serious work meant to inspire powerful emotion, instead of a tongue-in-cheek ride meant to entertain. Aside from the fact that this is a serious missed opportunity, as it shows an incredible amount of potential to be a wonderful parody game. it completely broke the immersion; I was never able to get fully involved and feel the emotions the game was trying to invoke, because all the situations were too ridiculous for me to be able to take seriously. It left me feeling disinterested; further worsening how much of a chore playing the game felt.\n    Thirdly, the plot in this game is heavily bogged down by the fact that I was completely unable to sympathize with the protagonist, and worse yet, I actually sympathized with the antagonists, as technically, they did nothing wrong and it was actually the hero who started the conflict, (I won't go further into this, as I would spoil what little there is to be spoiled). This left me actually rooting for the villains to win, and gave me no drive to push forward through the campaign; why go through the effort if I can't sympathize with the hero or his plight? \n    All in all, I simply cannot recommend this game. I found it completely unenjoyable, and would hate to see another person buy this game only to have the same conclusion. I only hope that if the developers do decide to come out with another game, they can learn from the mistakes made in Marlow Briggs, and produce a high-quality product for us all to enjoy.\n", "timestamp_created": 1467181696, "timestamp_updated": 1467181696, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23907530": {"recommendationid": "23907530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070812522", "num_games_owned": 984, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467223759}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[h1] Combos, magia, possess\u00f5es, piadas e uma pitada(talvez 1kg :P)de God of War.

He awakens as the \"sacred warrior\", accompanied by an annoying talking mask, and must battle through hordes of mercenary mooks, jungles full of exploding bugs the size of dogs, scorpions the size of cars, and giant zombie warriors.\n\nLike its obvious antecedent God of War, it's a reasonably solid mix of platforming and button-mashing combat (long \"combos\" created through the light and heavy attack buttons, with four different weapons unlocked through the game), with occasional puzzles. As is often the case with this sort of design, it doesn't do any one thing particularly well -- the Arkham games ruined combat for everyone else, and it definitely gets repetitive here, and the platforming sequences are uninspiring make-work. There are also a number of strange mini-game sequences, e.g. manning a turret to shoot down helicopters and two instances of flying an aircraft in a particularly terrible Raiden-style top-down shooter. \n\nWhere it really shines, though, like God of War, is as blockbuster spectacle -- a \"boss\" that's an enormous screen-filling sea monster, platforming through a collapsing mine etc. The story isn't much to write home about it but it provides a reason to hurtle from one explosive crisis to the next. It's entirely linear.\n\nThe variety of environments and enemies is fairly good, though the game is relatively short (~6 hours). It's not stunningly polished; there are invisible walls everywhere, occasional issues with the controls etc.\n\nSome negative reviews here complain about checkpoint spacing, which I wuold agree with except that it appears to be possible to create your own checkpoint at any time with a quicksave from the menu.\n\nIt's good fun and available so cheaply that it's well worth giving a go.", "timestamp_created": 1460247746, "timestamp_updated": 1460247746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22320643": {"recommendationid": "22320643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060445191", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460214635}, "language": "english", "review": "All my saves are gone", "timestamp_created": 1460214652, "timestamp_updated": 1460214652, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.369372", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22311193": {"recommendationid": "22311193", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981793213", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 2557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460144370}, "language": "english", "review": "Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is the equivalent of a B-movie from the 1980s and 1990s. It is so bad it is good. It is clearly a low budget game that is not a breakthrough for the game industry or the game\u2019s genre. However, this game provides plenty of fun from the beginning. The gameplay feels varied enough as you traverse different settings in the same country and the action never lets up.\n\nMarlow Briggs is a smokejumper who goes on vacation outside the U.S. to a Spanish speaking country. I initially thought it was Mexico, but it could have been Central or South America based on the jungles and the rich history of the indigenous people. He is with his girlfriend, an archeologist who is kidnapped by an Asian madman, Heng Long, with godlike magical powers who seems bent on taking over the world. This madman kills Marlow Briggs with a mythical weapon, but he is reborn by a Mayan mask proclaiming him to be the sacred warrior who must save the sacred land. Long is backed up by an army of mercenaries of varying levels of difficulty. Marlow goes to fight to save the land for the Mayan mask and to save his girlfriend. It becomes apparent that this plot is formulaic and unoriginal but this game can get away with it because of its X factor: entertainment value.\n\nOnce Marlow goes to work the plot takes a backseat and the real fun begins. Marlow begins with the same weapon used to kill him. It has short range, but it cuts good. The gameplay seems to borrow elements from the Tomb Raider series and God of War. The mercenaries may seem repetitive at times, but it does not detract from the fun that combat provides. The Mayan mask becomes Marlow\u2019s sidekick, cracking cheesy jokes along the way. While the combat is mainly melee Marlow is introduced to magic spells that require full or near full levels of mana. There are red masks for health regeneration and blue masks for mana regeneration. The red and blue masks are generously placed in areas of intense combat. Therefore, it is easy to regenerate health and mana after the combat is over. There are also new weapons to use that slice better and have more range than the first weapon of the game. Sometimes Marlow sounds like an action hero from a cheesy action film when fighting saying things like \u201cAw yeah, class is in session.\u201d His acrobatics are well animated, whether in combat or jumping from one section to another.\n\nThere are many bosses that Marlow Briggs must face. I think they are quite impressive and require you to figure out their moves so that you can best fight them without taking damage in return. The boss fights seem to ensure that you put as much importance in your defensive moves as you do in your offensive moves. It becomes important to damage your toughest foes without taking so much damage in return. The battles with the ordinary mercenaries are the ones that feel a little repetitive as you advance through the game. The animations of all the mercenaries are impressive and look realistic.\n\nThere are platforming aspects to this game, much like the Tomb Raider games. There are plenty of puzzles, some timed whereas others are not timed. Some puzzles require you to jump around a lot to reach the next destination. Other puzzles require you to move boxes to open doors or gain access to boxes that can lead to higher levels. The puzzles are really none too complicated to solve. There sceneries are not the best in terms of graphics, but they are respectable with enough detail to look realistic, especially for a low budget game. Eventually, Marlow will be able to glide (fly) from one platform to another since double jumps will not always be good enough. There is also a break in the melee action when Marlow is required to shoot stationary guns to shoot down choppers. There are also challenges that require you to shoot down aircraft in top-down style.\n\nThe one gripe I have about this game is the fixed camera angles. The camera angles are inflexible and awkward as they do not allow for much viewing freedom. This can lead to some frustrations such as jumping and falling to your death. Eventually, I got over the problem with these camera angles. It feels like an unrefined aspect of this game, but it is not so bad that it would ruin the game. The developers at ZootFly can sure use tips from Crystal Dynamics, the developers of Tomb Raider, on how to best apply camera angles in a game that features platform jumping and puzzle solving. Also, there are times when the camera obstructs your view when fighting two very large Juggernauts of Chabtan. One comes after me while I can\u2019t see what the other one is doing.\n\nI think Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death deserved more popularity than it got. It is a solid action game with plenty of fun gameplay that never reaches boredom. I recommend this game to anyone. At a price of $4.99 you cannot go wrong with this game.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1460171510, "timestamp_updated": 1460171510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22293793": {"recommendationid": "22293793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088504276", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460932858}, "language": "english", "review": "If you think this is a character action game, let me tell you how fucking wrong you are!

It was just that I had to take out time for a third person story driven game. But once I started to play this game, I wanted to play through it completely, cause I found it fun! Where most of the games become a chore sometimes, this one was actually fun. Though if you are really a game critic you may not review this game very highly. Its understandable, I think this is one of those games, you would play once and be done with. Somehow the fun element in this game reminded me of console games back in the 90s, with revamped twist to it.\n\nMain points\n* Third person story driven hack n slash type\n* main empahsis is on the story, and you getting to beat up the enemies.\n* The game isn't all that difficult but still decently challenging.\n* Beating the enemies is repetitive, but you won't really get bored cause the game is mainly story driven, and a lot is happening all the time. Things really change with the scenery and all, so you don't get bored of the beat em up!\n* Also the game is short, at about 8 hours I completed it, and I liked it!\n\nVerdict-\nIf you are looking for a fun game, that you wanna pick up and play to relax or just chill perhaps, you will find what you are looking for. Also, this game isn't a time sink, you'll pretty much be able to unlock all the abilities and get almost all the achievements on steam in about 8 hours time!\n\nSo at the end you'll be all happy happy! :)", "timestamp_created": 1457881293, "timestamp_updated": 1457881293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21795229": {"recommendationid": "21795229", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134858735", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457804638}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0432\u0430, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0432\u044e. \u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0437 Splatterhouse, \u043b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0438\u0437 Uncharted, \u0438 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0439 hack-n-slash \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b (\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0445 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044b\u0445). \u041d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0438 \u0432 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439 - \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0430\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0432. \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442, \u043d\u043e \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043d\u043e. \u041b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435, \u0431\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u044f (\u0430 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c).", "timestamp_created": 1457805602, "timestamp_updated": 1457805602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21771991": {"recommendationid": "21771991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056001390", "num_games_owned": 1364, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457723348}, "language": "english", "review": "Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a moderately compitent spectacle fighter.\n\nMy play time for the full game was roughly 7 hours.\n\nThe game feels better with a gamepad though it features keyboard controls, On screen prompts will switch between Xbox 360 and Keyboard controls on the fly if you begin inputting from another source.\n\nThe story follows the titular Marlow Briggs and his bound by death partner as they attempt to save his girlfriend... and the world.

Sometimes it's the games that just want to have fun that make you enjoy your time with them the most. Marlow Briggs fits this description so aptly. The voice acting is decent but still has the cheese to really emphasize the B movie style. Marlow is actually voiced by Pierce from the Saints Row series. \n\nThe combat is solid with a lot of combos. You're given the ability to do light and heavy hits, but there's no automatic counter attack button which means that you still need to pay attention to the game to win. The enemy variety is rather decent. You'll fight bugs, big guys who want to melee you and guys with rocket launchers and flamethrowers. The enemies are dispatched kind of simuilarly but the amount of combos at your disposal means that you can vary it up yourself. \n\nThe game is about 6-8 hours in length depending on how you play. \n\n\nOverall an enjoyable experience and a steal for $5.

It's a stupid hack-and-slash with no depth that succeeds because it keeps the pace up and constantly changes what you're doing. It has a dumb-as-rocks story that involves Marlow Briggs, a Regular Guy (TM) getting killed by an Evil Genius (TM) and then being resurrected to take on said Evil Genius by Aku Aku from Crash Bandicoot.\n\nFrom there it's 6-8 hours of slashing and platforming and rail shooting. You don't do any one thing for too long so it doesn't get boring.\n\nThe only issue I have with the game is some of the late game boss fights, which fall into the trap of going like this: dodge to avoid boss's slow attack, dodge in and hit boss once or twice, dodge back out, repeat. This would be fine except that many of the bosses have really large health pools, so, while it's not hard to beat them because you can easily avoid their attacks, the battles do test your patience. This is just bad game design. If I've figured out the trick to beating the boss, let me beat the boss already! Don't make me do the trick 40 times, I already understand it!\n\nOther than that it's good if you want something with that dumb 80s action movie feel.\n\nPerformance note: this game has a couple of annoying, but not game-breaking, technical problems. \n\nFirst, my audio drivers crashed every single time I quit the game, resulting in that loud buzzing noise that you get when your drivers crash. I had to restart the computer to get the noise to stop. Not a huge deal since I beat this in 3 sittings, but it is annoying. I have a dedicated Asus Xonar soundcard and I haven't noticed anyone else complaining about this problem, so it might just be my setup. YMMV.\n\nSecond, this game respects the Windows display scaling when it shouldn't. What I mean is, I have my computer hooked up to a 43\" TV and I sit about 7 feet away, so I have to set text and apps to 150% size in Windows display settings to make things readable. When I run Marlow Briggs with display scaling set to 150%, the game's menus and HUD increase as well and run off the side of the screen. So I had to toggle my Windows display scaling every time I booted the game up. I haven't noticed any other games that do this, so it makes me think that 505 Games just doesn't know what they're doing.", "timestamp_created": 1454944259, "timestamp_updated": 1455378676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511952", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20962581": {"recommendationid": "20962581", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040718284", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454648113}, "language": "english", "review": "This game does a few things way better than God of War III.

The explosions, cliffside leaps, jumping from flying helicopters, etc. almost never stop.  I usually don't like action movies much, but this game handles itself very well.  It knows there shouldn't be so many explosions, but it lets you know right out of the gate that this is how it is going to be and jokes about it the entire way.\n\nI like the combination of solid action mechanics and platforming.  The addition of difficulty settings helps the cause as well.\nHonestly, it is a good thing the game only takes about 6 hours to beat.  If it were any longer it would wear you out and get boring.  It is just long enough to introduce the characters and humor, let you get in some good fights, power up, and then it is done, inviting you to come back later on to try a harder difficulty.

The answer is... well, lots of things actually, but Marlow Briggs is perhaps one of the least well-known of the various clones that have spawned as a result of the aforementioned combination. It's a budget title with little in the way of innovation or originality, and its lumpen, cheese-tastic story is nothing to write home about, but in here lurks a fun, respectable, though flawed action game. \n\nPerhaps the best thing about Marlow Briggs is that the action rarely lets up, as it shifts from set piece to set piece, never really giving you a chance to get bored as you deal with waves of enemies by using a variety of combos to slice them to pieces. Throughout the 6-7 hour campaign you're furnished with a number of new weapons and magic powers, all of which are then upgraded via XP that you earn from kills and pick-ups. Along the way you'll find plenty of health and mana pick-ups too, helping you to replenish your stock ahead of the next big fight. It's a relatively simple system, and the combos aren't too difficult to master, though you'll probably stick to a couple of good ones and use those throughout. Along the way you'll be taking out human enemies, insects and spirits, along with a few boss battles to spice things up, and all with a smooth, easy-to-learn control scheme.\n\nHonestly, I was really enjoying Marlow Briggs up until around the halfway mark, where the game then insists on giving you incredibly tanky enemies that take far too long to kill, artifically increasing the difficulty and the length of the game in doing so. As fun as it was to slice and dice my way around, I felt like the tanky enemies began to detract from the enjoyment of the game, with spirit creatures that disappear every few seconds, forcing you to spend longer running around as you slice away at them until they finally go down. I began to get frustrated with some of the enemy encounters in the second half of the game, though unlocking some weapons and powers did help to satisfy my desire to finish out the game. These encounters won't kill the appeal of the game for you, but they might make the last few hours of it less palatable.\n\nIt's hard not to recommend Marlow Briggs at just \u00a34. You're getting a decent game, and you may even improve the experience a tad by dropping the difficulty level down to Casual (I played on Normal), where the tankier enemy encounters that pop up constantly in the second half might be a bit more tolerable. I was impressed that the game has a bit of gusto, and though I encountered a few bugs and glitches, it was a smooth experience overall. There's a bit of humour and self-awareness to the whole thing, and the game never takes itself too seriously.

It\u2019s an over the top, in your face action and comedic hack and slash. I definitely enjoyed my playthrough of it. \n\nYou play as Marlow, trying to save your girlfriend, Eva, after she is taken hostage to decipher some ancient codices. I was quite surprised with the range of environments that you are taken through. They are nicely done too and feel full and rich.\n\nAn odd thing to point out, but I will. The game sets up the \u201ccamera\u201d to be the Mask of Death following you around. Or at least that\u2019s how I interpreted it. Reminded me of how Mario 64 implied the Lakitu Brothers were \u201cfilming you\u201d during gameplay. \n\nSince we are on the camera, there is a love/hate relationship with it. The camera is FIXED and you cannot control it. This can, and is, used to hide secrets and extra experience points that are out of view until you explore a little. Generally, it\u2019s good and doesn\u2019t get in the way. But on occasion, especially during battle, it will not let you see where the enemy is. It also tended to lag behind if I started moving too fast. The multiple rope swinging segments are brought to mind where this happened. In the end, it wasn\u2019t too much of a nuisance.\n\nMarlow Briggs is extremely linear. I don\u2019t mind this at all in games, but I know this is a personal preference. There are invisible walls everywhere and you cannot explore much outside your destined path. I say can\u2019t explore \u201cmuch\u201d because you can go in little crevices and off camera areas that give you experience. It definitely rewards you for doing what little exploring you can. \n\nControls feel relatively tight during combat and responsive during the many platforming segments. [u]I would highly recommend a controller to play this game.[/u] It was released on the 360 and it shows. The mouse and keyboard controls are awkward and I immediately switched to a controller. The game switches seamlessly between the two, which is appreciated.\n\nMarlow can upgrade and acquire a few more weapons and magic powers throughout the playthough. You can switch quickly and easily between them for whatever situation you\u2019re in. I tended to stick with the weapon that was on a chain for a majority of the game after I acquired it. It\u2019s the only ranged weapon and felt the most safe using it. It was also easy to break out of a combo and dodge an enemy attack. The magic powers are visually cool, but consistently felt underpowered. They were expensive to use (Mana) and would usually not even kill the smaller enemies. I wish they were quite a bit more powerful or used less Mana. \n\nSaving is spectacular. Tons of auto-saves and you can save manually at any point. I always love to see this in games. \n\nGraphically the game is quite good! I found myself taking a lot of screenshots because of the really nice looking environments I was in. However, there are NO graphics options to play around with. You get to choose your resolution and if it\u2019s full screen or not. That\u2019s it\u2026 \n\nSound and music is good. I felt some of the epic songs got tired since they were used a lot during the cut scenes.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the Pros and Cons\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n+Awesome, over the top action. All the explosions you could ask for\n+Nice graphics\n+Great auto and manual save system\n+Controls feel good (use a controller to play!)\n+Fantastic variety of environments\n+Solid variety of enemies. (Possessed enemies are recycled)\n+Weapon combos are cool\n+Good game length. Not too short or long.\n+Rewarded for the small amount of exploring you can do\n+60fps throughout\n\n[b]Cons[/b] \n+No graphics options?! (Just resolution and full screen toggle)\n+Magic powers felt weak, cost too much Mana\n+Puzzles could be more challenging\n+Camera at times can be frustrating\n+Slightly repetitive\n\nWorth the $5 asking price and a \u201cmust buy\u201d if it\u2019s on some type of sale or in a bundle. I had a great time playing Marlow Briggs. The gripes I had are easily overlooked by the crazy action everywhere. \n\n[b]8/10[/b] Very good", "timestamp_created": 1450755891, "timestamp_updated": 1466180674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19748118": {"recommendationid": "19748118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005689587", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424465493}, "language": "english", "review": "Most underrated game of the centurary", "timestamp_created": 1450367250, "timestamp_updated": 1450367250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19739580": {"recommendationid": "19739580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013917525", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450310778}, "language": "english", "review": "God Of War IV: Racial Diversity", "timestamp_created": 1450315693, "timestamp_updated": 1450315693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19737978": {"recommendationid": "19737978", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993279741", "num_games_owned": 1685, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450305871}, "language": "english", "review": "It has its fair share of problems - lack of advanced video options, camera bugs, knocking enemies through walls bugs, health-sponge enemies every so often, QTEs wherein keyboard buttons' mouse equivalents won't apply - but \"Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death\" brings plenty to balance itself into a worthwhile ride.

But don't judge so quickly it might have a linear storyline yet you encounter and experience the wildest things from hanging upside down on a helicopter to fighter a huge fish God. All while you try to save the \"Princess\" with your mask companion, who will bring all mental encouragement you need. \n\nWarning though some people might not enjoy the dialog, which is filled with cheesy comments, but also with funny comments of the ancient mask, who will tell you all about the Aztec culture and just generally comment in a funny way on what happening.\n\nLike I said earlier gameplay is fairly simple and you unlock 4 different weapons and 4 different spells plus a ranged attack as you progress. You also have a lot of time the possibility to mash the \"E\" button or the \"B\" button, if playing on a controller, which I found to be superior to the keyboard controls, but none the less you can play with keyboard, you'll be at a slight disadvantage against later enemies though. To no surprise, enemy variety is not that high, up until the last third of the game, where you encounter most of the bosses and harder enemies.\n\nOverall a very cheap and cheesy, but very fun game, if you enjoy over the top stupid games.

The hero, unsurprisingly named Marlow, is portrayed by Arif Kinchen (aka Pierce from Saints Row), you've also got James Hong (Mr. Ping from Kung Fu Panda), and Steve Blum (Tom from Toonami, and pretty much everything else in existence with a voice actor). The bantor and the comedy is there, even though the game \"acts\" like it takes itself seriously, more on that in a bit...\n\nI've never played a God of War game, but having seen some gameplay videos from that landmark franchise I can see where the parallels are drawn from.  I played most of my playthrough with a Steam Controller using the default gamepad template Steam offers for all titles and it felt very natural.  I couldn't comment on the keyboard/mouse input as I have yet to give it a chance, but I also played the intro with a 360 controller just fine, so if you have a gamepad laying around you should give it a shot on this title as it has console roots, both mechanic and development wise.\n\nSpeaking of development, where in xibalba did this game even come from?  I remember the tweet for the release going live on the official Steam accounts, but prior to that ZootFly was never on my radar.  Even looking into their catalog, Marlow Briggs seems like a diamond in the rough.  The game launched on PC and Xbox 360 as an Arcade title, but sports graphics that would be at home on most AAA console titles from the 360/PS3 era.  There is a decent variety of enemies, with new variations and additions being thrown at you right until the end.  The settings alternate between Mesoamerican ruins that leave you wondering \"how the heck did they build something so ginormous?\", and humongous industrial complexes/machines that leave you wondering \"why the heck did they build something so ginormous?\".  The weapons and powers follow an experience based upgrade system, but the game is plenty generous with xp pickups and you usually end up maxing out your new unlocks not too long after receiving them.  \n\nThe plot, and even in some portions the animation and voice acting can be received in two different ways-\n1. So cheesey and jenky that it circles around to become awesome again.\n2. Purposefully made super duper cheesey and jenky, which means it was done with just as much heart, so also making it awesome.\n\nI mean, there are scenes where your goal is to \"shoot down all the helicpoters\" and the game proceeds to throw nearly a 100 choppers at you.  Who has that many choppers on standby?  Who is that 100th chopper that sees the first 99 explode in front of him that says \"Ef it, yolo\" and continues to come at you guns blazing?  Also there's a scene where you fly a generic prop plane like Xevious and it somehow has the payload capacity for a bunch of heat seeking rockets AND machine guns under the propeller. I know, I know: What. Even.\n\nEither way, I'm not quite sure Zootfly knows what they've got with this franchise but the cliffhangerish ending demands a sequel with just as much over the top action, explosions, and lulzy dialog.", "timestamp_created": 1448592262, "timestamp_updated": 1448592262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19294567": {"recommendationid": "19294567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130173063", "num_games_owned": 568, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448571336}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death no es mas hack and slash bastante basico\npero con sus ciertas variedades como para que sea divertido.\n\nRecomendado si lo encuentras es ofertas.\n\nUn punto a recomendar en que tiene un apartado artistico muy bueno.\n", "timestamp_created": 1448571739, "timestamp_updated": 1448571739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19273974": {"recommendationid": "19273974", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975431965", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1397687693}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing platformer !

Sure it copies a decent amount of its tricks from the God of War formula, but in all honestly, that's not really a bad template to borrow from.  Throw in a little bit of Indiana Jones, 70s blaxploitation film-making, B action movies, nonsensical comedy and you've got the vibe for this game down pat.  I actually enjoyed this game more than alot of big budget games from the same genre.  \n\nBriggs isn't a perfect game, yet it does so much right that I couldn't stop playing until I completed the hardcore mode today, FINALLY.  In Marlow Briggs you are killed by an evil Chinese magnate who wants to rule the world with a frightening, sort of terraforming magical power.  He kills you and kidnaps your girlfriend, though thankfully Marlow is brought back by a wise-cracking mask that guides him through his journey to save the girl, the day and the world.  The entire premise is ridiculous.  Once you're having fun with the game, the plot hardly even matters.  \n\nAt its core, Briggs is a hack n' slashers delight.  You arm yourself with several types of melee weapons, magic, long range attacks and acrobatic abilities.  As you fight and explore, you earn experience to upgrade your powers, making you a killing machine on a machine.  You'll explore crazy industrial complexes, temples, caves, jungles and much more.  While graphically, Marlow and the gang aren't the best game in town; he surely isn't the worst looking either.  Levels are solidly detailed with lots to peer at in the distance and the enviroments look good while alternately being a blast to travel.  There's hidden secrets to find and numerous achievements to unlock.  There is also a hardcore mode on hand that will test your skills for certain.  It's not as impossible as Deadlight, but it will put up a stiff challenge and make you sing for your supper.  \n\nYou upgrade with new equipment at key points of the game while fighting legions of foes that include all sorts of armed guards, giant insects, mythical looking boss creatures, teleporting evil priests, giants, a wolf like Hellbeast and other assorted demons.  The boss fights are a blast, and require quicks hands, strategic use of attacks/abilities and old fashioned pattern memorization.  That's really all there is to it!  The campagin is a decent length with alot of areas to explore and frequent differences in scenery so that you'll rarely be bored and when you're not fighting like a champ there are all sorts of gameplay variations to keep things exciting.  You'll man gun turrets, fly choppers and fighter planes while shooting down everything in sight, use your nimble abilities to platform your way to victory, etc.  The controls were mostly tight and responsive, so it's easy to get yourself in the action and stay there.  While I expected minimal of this game, I got way more than I bargained for and put in 28.7 hrs to beat it twice and get most of the achievements (97%).   Hell, once weakening certain monsters like the club wielding giants and monster scorpions, you can even ride and use them to fight Golden Axe style!  \n\nOn the downside, sometimes the controls do tend to get a little wacky and combo stringing won't feel entirely accurate, making for a cheap death or two.  The QT buttom presses to hammer down on certain bosses and deal decisive blows don't always register, which also got me slaughtered a couple of times as well.  While not with the frequency of a survival horror game, the camera has potential to get a little rickety and you'll end up taking a beating from some foes you can't even see.  All of the problems with the game were rather minor and I actually thought this game was HIGHLY addicting and entertaining to play.  To be honest...I like it more than some of the God of War sequels.  You can scream blasphemy all you want, but that's how I felt.  Another downside is that the slow-motion cut scenes could have been better executed and the voice acting isn't top-notch (although its rampant cheesiness is rather endearing as this game is straight out of one of those B movie action 4 packs).  Overall, anyone into the hack n' slash genre would do well to check this out for the cheap price.  I hope they make a sequel with co-op!  Good lord, that'd be a blast. \n\nNow for some quick pros and cons:  \n\nPros\n\n-Solid graphics and sound\n-Excellent set of weapons, abilities and magic\n-90% of the time the fighting is fluid and fun\n-Superb enemy variety with tough fights and killer battles with monstrous bosses\n-Campy storyline and voice-acting adds to the appeal\n-Combos are easy to execute and satisfying\n- 90% of the time the controls are response and fun\n-Great gameplay variety with everything listed above and even a few puzzles\n\nCons\n\n-10% of the time the fighting can be a little clunky\n-10% of the time some button presses won't register, especially the QT sequences (fortunately they are few)\n-Platforming is a beotch when the controls stutter\n\nOverall:  8.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1445148628, "timestamp_updated": 1447822383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18451783": {"recommendationid": "18451783", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970585670", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 506, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444716353}, "language": "english", "review": "The game makes fun...in a strange kind of way.

I don't know what they are smoking. Sure, given it's low price i can understand that many start the game with low expectations about it. But i found this game amazing, deserving well more than 5 bucks. As soon as you get to the main menu, you are greeted to one of the best epic main menu songs out there. Everytime i started the game, i couldn't help but listening to the music for at least 2 minutes. The rest of the music is ok, but this song makes up for all of them. Now speaking of the game, it's a ripoff of God of War, but a pretty good one. The story surely sucks, but there's plenty of funny dialog. The graphics are decent and the game is surprisingly well optimized for PC. Now speaking of the gameplay, it's mostly an Hack and Slash. There's a light and a heavy attack that you can combo, and a grab, block and jump buttons. There's 4 weapons and 5 magic powers that you collect, and they all play differently. You can also upgrade them. The combat is good, with a solid variety of enemy types and bosses, but blocking feels a bit off because you can't block in the middle of an attack, so you'll be evading most of the time. Besides combat, there are also sections of platforming (those could be better), puzzle solving, evading obstacles, 3D shooting and top down shooting. Together, it'll last about 6 hours, and if you are like me, you'll play right again on the hardcore difficulty, which isn't really that hard except for some encounters later in the game. For it's price, it has a good lenght. And you can also replay some challenges from the story in the menu with leaderboards, but for me only the first time was added. Probably a bug, but didn't care much about it. And there's also a minigame in the credits, which sucks but lets you skip the credits the faster you complete it. It was a nice addition to finish the game. In the end, the game isn't brilliant, but surprisingly good given it's price, and you should definitely get it if you're a fan of Hack and Slash games.

The corny acting, the even cornier lines, the dumbed down hack & slash mechanics, and the hilariously stupid plot all serve one thing: to let you have a great time.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nSteam is full of bad games. And while Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is undoubtedly a bad game, what makes it stand out in the sea of Greenlight schlock is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great status.\nLet me explain.\n\nWhen you play a bad game, you often get frustrated because of bad level design or game mechanics, or bad controls. Or even worse, the game is downright boring. With Marlow Briggs, you will hardly ever get bored: it is a platformer, a hack & slash, a rail shooter, and a shoot \u2018em up\u2013 all packed into one explosive pack of joy. Sure, some of the platforming levels are repetitive and the camera tends to kill you more than the bosses, but there are so many minigames and shooter sections that you will never, ever get bored.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple as a brick: you have a jump button, normal and a power attack, and a few spells. They form dozens of combos, but they cannot hide the fact that Marlow Briggs is played by mashing two buttons as fast as you can. Combat is strangely satisfying though with good enemy design and one of the most balanced difficulty sliders I saw in a long time.\n\nThe cherry on top of this rather delicious action cake is the story. You cannot name a single 90s action movie clich\u00e9 or one-liner that isn\u2019t here in some form, and there are more explosions than in Michael Bay\u2019s entire filmography.

It's a pretty standard formula of action adventure games akin to the likes of Darksiders, God of War, and Devil May Cry, and it might do everything that's been done before, but it does so very well and manages to stay fun throughout.\n\nThe gameplay is nicely balanced between combat sections, platforming, puzzles, and mini-games. You're never doing the same thing for too long, which keeps the experience fresh and entertaining. As you progress through the game, your weapon acquires different forms (scythe, twin daggers, whip, and hammer), which are useful in different situations and you can switch between them at any time. In addition you also learn some very powerful spells which are good at clearing out large crowds of enemies.\n\nOverall the difficulty I felt was balanced perfectly. There were no unexpected difficulty spikes and most of it was a smooth ride. In the last quarter of the game it gets a bit challenging, but it does so gradually and reasonably. Only one section involving a certain collapsing underground bridge felt a bit cheap since it gave me a lot of insta-deaths, but that section was pretty short.\n\nI really enjoyed most of the mini-games, such as the first-person shooting sections where you have to mount a turret and shoot down helicopters, or even flying one yourself, or sliding down the cliffs and dodging obstacles. No overcomplicated mechanics. Just simple and fun mini-games to give you a small break from fighting and platforming.\n\nThe plot is somewhat cheesy and lighthearted, but the main character is quite likeable, and his frequent dialogue exchanges with his sidekick, the Mask of Death, are all very funny. The length was also quite spot on for a game like this. Took me about 10 hours to beat it on Normal.\n\nMy only serious critique for this game would be the occasional crashes to desktop that I got (and it seems there are some other people who get them too). It wasn't too bad, since the game has very frequent checkpoints, so you don't lose a lot of progress, but it's still a bug.\n\nI'd say if you enjoy action adventure games and seek something to give you heaps of entertainment, then I'd highly recommend this game. I got it for merely \u00a34 (~$6), which is its full price on Steam and enjoyed it way more than some games which I bought for a higher price.", "timestamp_created": 1440345692, "timestamp_updated":

Beides aber auf nem Level, der gut unterh\u00e4lt ohne anzustrengen. Nebenbei gibts noch nen Sidekick, der wirklich witzig ist (der Sidekick betrachtet den Spielcharakter z. Bsp. wiederum als Sidekick). Das Spiel ist wie ein Trash-Movie, der einfach gut unterh\u00e4lt.\n\nDie Graphik ist teilweise toll und wird von der (nicht steuerbaren) Kamera teilweise richtig gut in Szene gesetzt. Die Kamera hat auch kaum Probleme gemacht. Nicht ganz auf der H\u00f6he der Zeit sind manche Zwischensequenzen.\n\nK\u00e4mpfen kann man mit 4 Waffen oder 4 diversen Zaubern, welche man jeweils in 3 Stufen aufleveln kann. Da machen die Zauber mehr Bumms und die Waffen bekommen ein paar neue Kombos. Hier ist es auch wieder wie in vergleichbaren Spielen, dass es die weitreichende schwache bis zur langsamen starken Waffe gibt. Je nach Gegner kan man dann anpassen.\n\nDer Schwierigkeitsgrad ist ok, f\u00fcr mich schon teilweise zu leicht (hab auf schwer gespielt). Man findet ordentlich Heilung und wenn man in den K\u00e4mpfen das Ausweichen bisl raus hat ist der Rest ein Kinderspiel, weil Tasten h\u00e4mmern nach ausweichen fast schon allein zum Erfolg f\u00fchrt. Heilung gibt es  auch genug und automatisch wird auch oft gespeichert.\n\nMan braucht auch keine Angst haben, dass man sich mit dem Leveln der Waffen und Zauber spezialisieren muss. Es gibt mehr als genug Erfahrung daf\u00fcr.\n\nEinziger Kritikpunkt (was eigentlich keiner ist) ist der Preis des Spiels. Es ist zu billig! F\u00fcr dieses Spiel sind 5 Euro angemessen. Es wird aber oft bei nem Sale f\u00fcr 1 Euro rausgehauen. Das ist es nicht wert! Die Entwickler haben gute Arbeit geleistet und man selbst ist \u00fcberrascht, wenn man dieses Billig-Spiel dann mal anspielt....\n\nFazit: Super Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch, welches wie ein trashiger Film toll unterh\u00e4lt. Ich freu mich auf nen zweiten Teil.\n\nTip: Beim Endkampf (der einzigste Schwere im Spiel) empfiehlt sich eine mittlere Distanz, bevor man selbst angreift.

I suppose you could compare this game to legends like God of War although it doesn't have the brutality associate with God of War so you won't be tearing your hair in frustration but instead can enjoy this game in peace.\n\nAlong the way witness the dynamic duo of Marlow and the titular Mask of Death as they trade banter while killing enemies, facing monstrous creatures and wielding terrible weapons.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b]\nYou probably won't believe how beautiful this game is despite the fact that it merely clocks at 2gb something in terms of size, fauna has a beautiful sheen to it, enemies and environment has beautiful and varied art to them and you will visit many location each [barring the temples] has their own art style and colour.\n\n[b] Music [/b]\nIt's awesome, its  beaty track that fits well with the game and doesn't sound out of place, especially when you face some of the bosses. It's great.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\nAnd here is where MBATMOD shines the most, you will wield many different [actually just four but they are all different in how they play.] weapons, traverse many different locale and best of all, fight tons of enemies all with satisfying combo.\n\nGranted I don't actually know why its more important to string longer combos since  I don't actually notice any increase in reward but damn I would say its not that hard to pull off 100-200 combos by late game as your skill greatly outclass that of the enemies.\n\nEnemies aren't dull dullard either, they will put up a stiff fight and unless you actually use those combos you will find yourself always running out of health and mana. Fun thing is killing enemies restore the meters albeit very very little. It's a fine system of risk of reward which is greatly enhanced by the fact that healing takes time and you can't just do that in the middle of a brawl with 10+ dudes so caution must be taken. One fun ability they give you in game is the ability to convert humanoid size enemies to your side by grabbing them and spamming the E button. Granted they do die quickly and are usually relegated to meatshield duty but I'll be damn if they didn't save my hide once when I got trapped in an arena with two hulking dudes and 2 never ending spawning enemies, which I proceed to convert naturally.\n\nDid i mention boss fights are aplenty? Yes they are, and they are awesome, you will fight mythical creature, twisted monster and the demons of the underworld itself! Of course cleverly they disguise the mini boss fight as a tutorial segment to deal with the enemy type later. \n\nSo about controls, its very good and responsive. So far none of my button has mispressed. Although one issue with the game is the camera can be a backstabbing bastard occasionally, It might swing behind you, in front of you or even block your off-screen view. I guess there has to be a con no?\n\n+Awesome gameplay\n+Killer Graphic\n+Responsive combat and control\n+Great enemies\n+Actually smart AI\n\n+/-Occasional Copypasted levels\n+/-Repetitive levels before the next carrot stick appears\n\n-Terrible Camera\n-The camera, its awful\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nSo MBATMoD, lets tick the checklist shall we? Great cheesy story, awesome gameplay and enemies and a game that actually understands the meaning of action adventure by shooting you across the world at breakneck speed. I'll give this little bugger a medal and for you I will presribe a  dose of this awesome game.\n\n[h1] PRICE [/h1]\nTHE GAME IS SUPER CHEAP DAMMIT! BUY IT ALREADY!

I do not ever recall this game being advertised but it is a good game.\n\nThe main villian is trying to get immortality. He enlists the help of your girlfriend. When she decides to leave they kill you to make her finish her work. You are brought back to life to stop this guy from getting supernatural abilities. As far as the plot goes, that is about it.\n\nFor a pretty straight forword storyline, you travel to many locations and fight a good variety of creatures. The boss battles are interesting and cool looking. \n\nThe things that will annoy you  in this game are first off the talking mask that follows you. He is not very informative and seams to suffer from exceptional hindsite. Secondly at certain parts of the game (mostly when getting new upgrades or end of boss battles) the game does a stop motion revolving take of what is going on.

bought this game is well worth the money, has a style of game like God of War / Darksiders, the plot is not spectacular but simple and then you can even skip the cutscenes for example, because you will not miss anything as history.\nThe fun and there is hectic, it never stops but always active combat, dodging etc ... there are powers and weapons to use and doing combos to defeat enemies quickly, the Boss are only 4 and offers few hours of play but it is worth playing for fun, I recommend it for anyone who wants to make trouble and bloodshed.\n\nPro:\n\n+ Fun\n+ Gameplay hectic\n+ Low

They though that adding a minigame was more original than watching a black screen with white letters, but the minigame is horrible.\n\nAside of that and the animations, which are pretty bad, the game is awesome. It's not the most in-depth hack and slash game, but it's good enough to enjoy it. There's a lot of absurd action and the soundtrack is great (most of the time is the same track, but it's good enough not to get bored of it).\n\nThe combat system is like Bayonetta but slower and not elegant. You press strong or fast attack and depending of the succesion, you make different combos. You have some AoE power but I ended using always the same one.\n\nThe enemy variety is pretty good. At first the enemies are humans (with a lot of variety), later on you encounter gigant insects and then you find some mayan warriors.\n\nThe game is very cheap, even more on sale, so I suggest to buy and play it.

The game runs extremely smooth at a constant 60fps and is very well optimised for PC.\n\nThe price to pay for the beautifully designed environments is the fixed camera perspective, which is literally the most annoying thing about the game, but well, for that price...\n\nOther than that the gameplay is generally smooth. The controls are fluid and fast, not always 100% precise, but forgiving enough for it not to matter.\n\nMarlow Briggs alternates hack-n-slash fights, which can get a bit repetitive but never too much, with platform sequences which are more fast paced and generally more enjoyable, There are also some puzzles, minigames and bossfights thrown in for fun, and some QTEs for anti-fun.\n\nAll in all, for your 3$ you are getting a ton of brainless fun, easy-play adventure full of ludicrous and unbelievable special effects and explosions.\n\nThis is one the best value for money you'll ever get, if you don't take your games too seriously.

Although a budget title, graphically it has a lot of polish with big set pieces, a lot of explosions and decent enough effects. The plot is silly and the game knows it. As Marlow Briggs, you are a huge black dude who gets imbued by superpowers after being stabbed by a mystic, ancient weapon. You are then followed around by a floating tribal mask while you 'save the princess' and the fate of the world. While beating people up is the primary mode of play, you will also shoot down helicopters (multiple times), fly planes (1942-style), platform and puzzle solve. It's mindless fun.\n\nIt's no masterpiece, though. Textures are pretty low resolution, and I encountered at least one showstopping bug during my playthrough. There are some annoyances, like how some ledges you can't fall off of (even though there's nothing blocking you from the edge) and others you can easily walk to your death. There are a few too many 'minecart' sequences (the kind where you are on-rails and have to dodge obstacles) - one of these is on an actual minecart. Most of these are just annoying instead of fun. The game is farily easy, with the exception of the final boss, which took me a few tries to beat.

I had no idea this game had even existed until I picked it up during a Steam sale and now that I've played through it, wonder why I had put off doing that for so long. \n\nBriggs is as close to a God of War game on Steam as you might get with enough differences to help it stand out. Instead of an angry deathdealer in ancient Greece, you play modern nice-but-tough guy, Marlow Briggs, who was killed while visiting his girlfriend working on researching ruins in the jungle thanks to a generous benefactor. \n\nUnfortunately for Briggs and for her, her boss turns out to be supervillain material voiced by James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China) who funded her research and now wants her to complete her work after having killed Briggs to prove that he's serious. The thing is, Briggs was killed with a sacred weapon attached to a talking jade mask of a dead king with a smartass tongue who has brought him back to exact vengeance and stop the bad guy before he becomes a god.\n\nBriggs will eventually wield four different weapons to destroy everyone in his way: a dual bladed staff (which he starts with), dual obsidian blades, a chain for distance, and a heavy scythe-hammer thing. He'll also get four different powers along the way: a fire devastation spell, a strength enhancement spell, a freeze spell, and a hurricane spell. The controls feel really geared for a gamepad even though there are keyboard and mouse options (I highly suggest using a gamepad; I played this using an Xbox 360 controller). The learning curve is pretty shallow and before long, I was switching up weapons and sending enemies to Xibalba like it was second nature. \n\nEnemies consist of humans to giant, flying bugs and undead warriors. And there's traps -- lots of jumping, swinging across chasms, dodging, climbing on vines, sliding, and eventually, gliding with plenty of upgrade points (to improve weapons and magic powers, both of which also increase your health and magic gauges respectively) hidden everywhere on each level. Enemies also drop a bit of experience, heals, and magic energy. Generously placed red (for health) and blue (for magic) masks replenish everything to keep Briggs in fighting shape.\n\nWhen it comes to looks, the game has quite a bit of eye candy. Some areas look a lot better than others, but the detail in some of the ancient temples and ruins really stand out. There are vast industrial complexes, mines, giant digging machines (some of which you have to avoid), a mobile factory, sprawling ruins, giant cliffs, and all of it wants to take you out sooner or later with the help of an army of foes ranging from human thugs to half-serpent humanoids that can disappear into the ground right before a giant scorpion comes out to play.\n\nAside from wielding his arsenal of weapons, Briggs can also grab enemies, toss them off into the wild blue yonder, into a giant fan, stomp on bugs (which can really get abused), all the while spouting one liners with a possessed mask. If you feel a groan coming on when you see some kind of ridiculous fire trap ahead, chances are Briggs is going to sympathize with you and that the mask will reminisce about human sacrifice again. This is a game that ever so slightly nudges the fourth wall and has fun with its own material. It's not a heavy serious kind of adventure -- just a game that has as much fun with its characters as you might be with the action.\n\nFrom start to finish, this is a complete action adventure deal with decent voice acting, great music, nice visuals, plenty of action, and even a few puzzles for good measure thrown in with a solid ending that makes it worth getting to. \n\nThe worse thing I can probably say is that the game won't make your reflexes sweat too much. This is partly due to its incredibly quick reloads and the option to manually save pretty much anywhere which goes far in alleviating any potential repetition. Most of the fights aren't too rough and the boss fights won't put your controllers at risk from the frustration that might otherwise twist them into pretzels as with other games. \n\nThere are some close calls, but it seems that the game was designed to make you feel like a total 80s action hero and for the most part, it works, especially when you're flying through the air on a helicopter platform blown off a building while still being chased by choppers.\n\nIf you've had experience with God of War, this won't be that much of a challenge, but it's still a nice trip into the danger zone with a great character who just wants to go out there and kick ass to rescue his girlfriend from James Hong.", "timestamp_created": 1424506844, "timestamp_updated": 1424506844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14558318": {"recommendationid": "14558318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012988831", "num_games_owned": 581, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 196, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423751130}, "language": "english", "review": "Controls get a little wonky.

But Marlow Briggs lacks both charm and quality to make it appealing. Few would argue that the pricing is reasonable. However, the game suffers from too many issues to make it a recommendable game. The game consists of platforming sections and \"hack n slash\" combat. The problem is not the variety in combos, weapons, enemies and level design. I'd go as far as saying the developers have done a decent job (for a low-budget game anyway) in those departments. The problem is simple: PLATFORMING SECTIONS. This is a game where you don't have control over the camera so it's EXTREMELY linear - as in, you can't deviate. One would think that there is little to go wrong but you'd be wrong. You will die hundreds of times not because of poor timing or misjudgement, but because the game is simply glitchy. Inputs are not handled with any care whatsoever - the game doesn't feel consistent or smooth to play at all. Everything has a delay, and sections involving grappling or swinging are very buggy - often you can't jump off the rope, for example. Although the game is light-hearted and makes jokes about its own design, there's nothing original whatsoever. It's not classy, intelligent or well-thought out by any means. The story and characters are generic, and the level of comedy is not enough to make you laugh out loud. The problem becomes apparent when you realise that the game is TRYING to be \"epic\" with all its fancy locations and scenery, yet the texture quality is bad with lots of pop-in. Whilst I highly value big-budget AAA titles, I also have an appreciation for the underdogs and smaller games which sacrifice production value for a single aspect - like comedic writing/characters or focus on one specific gameplay mechanic. Unfortunately, Marlow Briggs does not impress in any department. If you are bored and have nothing better to do and are desperate for a cheap giggle, Marlow Briggs can provide that.

Reminded me of something Nick Cage might do.\n\nThis is an over the top character action game with all the tropes and mechanics you've come to expect. X and Y weak/strong attacks strung into combos. 4 different weapons types. Standard med speed/med damage/med range(sword type), fast/short range/med damage(dagger type), fast/long range/low damage(chain type) and Slow/low range/high damage(hammer type). As well as elemental magic attacks. Though these do more or less the same thing except the ice one. Powerful AOE attack.\n\nIts got block puzzles, its got platforming, ledge grabbing, timed based swings and jumps. It also has a really weird and out of place vertically scrolling shooter that happens more than once. \n\nThe banter between the main character and the mask that gives the character powers is actually funny at times and very self aware. It never really gets in the way or become annoying. \n\nIt's paced pretty well, at the end it drags a little (but only a little). Maybe it over stays its welcome by a small unit of measurement. If it were maybe 4-5 hours long it'd be perfect. 6 or more if you're a completionist seems just enough to make me mention the length might be an issue. \n\nIt's more inspired by God of War mechanically but the aesthetics are pretty much Uncharted with some industrial zones. Even down to the Health Orbs being red, magic orbs being blue and XP orbs being gold/yellowish. Not to mention the right analog \"push in direction to roll that way dodge)\n\nDecent romp and palate cleanser, especially for $5.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/25764029/][i]Follow my curation for more[/i][/url]", "timestamp_created": 1422062393, "timestamp_updated": 1469395581, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647591", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14131063": {"recommendationid": "14131063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117764780", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1409757668}, "language": "german", "review": "es gibt so spiele die sehen auf den bildern echt gut aus und es gibt sie im sale f\u00fcrn euro . hinterher w\u00fcnscht man sich man h\u00e4tt das geld f\u00fcr n lolli ausgegeben oder irgendwas ansatzweise sinnvolleres . denn diese spiele gammeln dann in deiner bibliothek rum, verschandeln das ganze inhaltsverzeichnis und du wirst sie nie wieder los .", "timestamp_created": 1422042401, "timestamp_updated": 1422042401, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489796", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14126000": {"recommendationid": "14126000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141403139", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428572806}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and fun.

Intente, intente, intente y segu\u00ed intentando de que este juego me gustara. Trate de hallarle un factor bueno desde la perspectiva del genero del cual se trata (hack 'n slash) pero no puedo decir que lo he disfrutado, ni un poco. \tPara mantener las cosas claras y transparentes para los que lean este an\u00e1lisis, voy a ser sincero: Es innecesariamente largo, aburrido, repetitivo y para colmo, no hace ni el m\u00ednimo esfuerzo de separarse del molde que se inspira de manera obvia (God Of War).\n\nLa mejor manera de describir a Marlow Briggs es \u201cun clon gen\u00e9rico de God Of War, pero inspirado en las culturas precolombinas\u201d (mas precisamente la maya), tomando las mec\u00e1nicas y dise\u00f1o de juego del mismo que se ejecutan decentemente, pero que se siente vac\u00edo desde el coraz\u00f3n de la acci\u00f3n.\n\nGod Of War es un videojuego que se caracteriza por muchas cosas: la tragedia griega del personaje, ambientaci\u00f3n muy pulida, puzzles que sin bien no eran dif\u00edciles, hac\u00edan pensar al jugador; combate excelente y por sobre todo un trance entre escenas que manten\u00edan entretenido al juego. Marlow Briggs intenta copiar la formula a su manera, sin embargo es aburrido y sin alma.\n\nMuy seguramente muchos argumenten que por el precio del mismo y valor de producci\u00f3n, es un producto decente y barato que, al menos, valdr\u00eda la pena probar unas horas. Aunque no es justificaci\u00f3n defenderlo teniendo en cuenta que hay otros hack 'n slash en Steam a un precio similar (o un poco mayor) que hacen su trabajo mucho mejor. A pesar de su clara narrativa estilo cine B, la exposici\u00f3n es irrelevante y tediosa, produciendo un juego mas largo de lo que tendr\u00eda que ser. No estoy en contra de juegos largos pero cuando la historia, combate y los eventos no acompa\u00f1an, la experiencia se hace frustrante de experimentar.\n\nAunque Marlow Briggs tiene un acabado gr\u00e1fico muy peculiar y que se podr\u00eda considerar lindo de ver en algunos casos cuando estamos dentro de los bosques o los templos, en tanto otros combinan arquitecturas dise\u00f1adas para construcci\u00f3n y/o excavaci\u00f3n (que juega un papel importante en la historia... que no me moleste en seguir), lo cual es un punto a favor a recalcar. SIN EMBARGO, el juego desde la mec\u00e1nica deja mucho que desear.\n\nEl titulo es un hack 'n slash muy restrictivo: paredes invisibles, imposibilidad de backtracking, exploracion estrecha, las escenas scripteadas hacen que el ritmo de juego sea confuso y en casos que combates terminen abruptamente para desencadenar un evento que nos lleve al siguiente, y por sobre expone poca originalidad en tanto a la mec\u00e1nica jugable, caso que personalmente lastima mucho la experiencia.\n\nLos hack 'n slash tienen ciertas reglas o normas a seguir como en todo juego que respeta el dise\u00f1o de juego. Aqui vemos un intento de God Of War/Dante's Inferno sin intentar algo nuevo que mantenga fresco la jugabilidad, y para hacer las cosas justas, no voy a compararlo con los grandes del genero, pero con otro juego independiente de origen japones: Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae. Este tenia un combate muy repetitivo que la gran mayor\u00eda del tiempo era tedioso puesto que no otorgaba nada interesante para entretenerse, sin embargo introduc\u00eda una mec\u00e1nica de juego que te permit\u00eda eliminar enemigos r\u00e1pidamente, hacer parrys, o contrataques que, sin bien no eran necesarias, se sent\u00edan de maravilla dominar y mucho mas para los niveles de dificultad mayores. Con lo que quiero decir es que Marlow Brigss olvida mucha de estas herramientas que, al dominarlas, otorgaba un mejor entendimiento del juego y un motivo para mantener entretenido, dif\u00edcil pero justo.. fresco, por as\u00ed decirlo. Aqu\u00ed es simple y llanamente un machaca botones que, salvo el hecho que podremos cancelar movimientos al esquivar, no tiene nada mas que ofrecer. Las magias si bien lucen buenas, no tienen ning\u00fan efecto claro sobre los enemigos; las armas se sienten iguales una de otras sin ninguna diferencia que nos obligue a usarlas con ciertos enemigos y si aun fuera el caso, este sufre el mismo problema de Dante's Inferno y la cantidad de salud excesiva de los oponentes.\n\nNo quiero hacer una tesis acerca de \u201cqu\u00e9 hace genial un hack 'n slash\u201d pero para mi, Marlow Briggs es aburrido, repetitivo y que no ofrece nada para dominar. El ritmo de juego es tedioso, la c\u00e1mara no ayuda apuntando en ocasiones a \u00e1ngulos que no queremos, haciendo algunos combates complicados de llevar; es mas largo de lo que tendr\u00eda que ser (punto que siento que pueden discrepar, pero prefiero un hack 'n slash medianamente corto pero que ofrezca considerada rejugabilidad) y... nada mas.\n\nSeguramente algunos argumenten que por el precio se le puede perdonar algunas cosas y si, hay cosas que hay que tener en cuenta en tanto a producci\u00f3n, pero dejando eso de lado, personalmente no lo recomiendo. \n\nEstoy confundido.\n\n[b]5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1420938859, "timestamp_updated": 1420938859, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502469", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13932117": {"recommendationid": "13932117", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973463039", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420928414}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games that reminds me of how much I love gaming.

They look good and convey the action well, but would have been so much more epic in real time.\n\n+/- Sound and voice work is mostly competent, if pretty flat. No stadouts here at all. Better maybe than what you'd expect for a $5 game, but nothing more. Explosions and combat sounds are good though. Again, nothing exceptional but fit the game well. Only thing would have made it better is if either Marlow, or the villian, Mr. Long, were better done to fully match the cheesy 80's vibe.\n\n+/- Story is pure 80's cheese and I mean that in the best way possible. Everything is exploding, you are kicking ass and throwing puns, your mask sidekick mocks you when you die, and the bad guy absurdly sets up why everything is basically a deathtrap. This isn't a good story. It's clinche and dumb as hell. But it's fun.\n\n+/- Combat, being the core of the game, is mostly well done. Learning to dodge and block, switching up between your varied attacks, and using combo's is the name of the game. We aren't talking Bayonetta or DMC level of complexity, but it works well. Movements are sometimes a bit sluggesh however, most noticably during some \"challeges\" where even on missed jump means instant death. Despite those \"Challenge\" sections, I found the game to be pretty responsive.\n\nIf you are looking for big, brash, stupid, 80's action movie style gameplay that is just fun. Look no further. For $5 bucks or less, you simply can't go wrong. Happily give it a 4/5 due to it just being stupidly fun and a steal when on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1420902494, "timestamp_updated": 1420902494, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13922294": {"recommendationid": "13922294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018183133", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421164362}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is epic for the price", "timestamp_created": 1420887706, "timestamp_updated": 1420887706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13911045": {"recommendationid": "13911045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004032428", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 482, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420818901}, "language": "english", "review": "I would suggest this game be renamed \"Big Trouble in LIttle China 2:  Mayan Boogaloo (directed by Michael Bay)\"\n\nIt's an overall-fun beat 'em up, much like the God of War-styled games that were popular when this was made.

Controls can be glitchy and you're on rails throughout,  I didn't think Hard was as hard as others have been saying; I only died a few times due to fighting but alot trying to make a jump.

I think they wanted to make a franchise out of this, what with the character's name on the damn title. Too bad it's all mediocre. \n\nThe combat is of the button mashing variety. There are plenty of combos that take the form of a light and heavy attack, with combinations being strung together. The problem with that sort of combo system is that you can't expect me to remember all the 'XXXY, XXXX, XYXX, YXXY' combos. It winds up just being a button masher with a combo system that has too much to memorize for it's own good. You wind up memorizing three or so moves and just constantly mash those out.\n\nIt's boring as hell. Simplicity isn't bad, route memorization is. Metal Gear Rising had a similar set-up, but the memorization was kept to a minimum. The fun in combat lied in keeping your blue gauge up and getting those quick kills. The Arkham titles have an even simpler battle system, with the challenge being in continuing your chain of attack while thwarting enemies with properly placed counters. Marlow Briggs presents nothing unique or interesting in its combat. It's just randomly hitting buttons with the challenge lying in simply keeping your health gauge up. There's nothing rewarding in the combat itself.\n\nApart from the mediocre combat, the game has light platforming and puzzle elements. When you aren't busy fighting, you'll be traversing the level with fixed camera angles. The platforming is all pretty barebones and boils down to jumping across pits and pressing the action button when appropriate. Swinging from cliffs and walking across ledges would be a lot more exciting if there was any sort of challenge to it beyond pressing a button. The fact that the camera angles are fixed means that there's not even any challenge in finding how to proceed. It's all meant to look nice and tantamount to simply pressing right on the joystick while ocassionally hitting the B button to jump across the ocassional pit. Again, it's boring.\n\nOn the positive side of things, the game looks gorgeous for a budget title. I got it for 99 cents a few sales ago, and can't comprehend how such a cheap ass title can look so damn good. There's even some creativity in the way some of the cutscenes unfold. \n\nOtherwise, it's all mediocre and completely forgettable. For a budget title it passes the time and is...not completely offensive, but if that's its only real upside then it really has nothing going for it.\n\nRecommended if you are, plan to be, or ever will be Tyler Perry", "timestamp_created": 1420603145, "timestamp_updated": 1420603400, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447716", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13861529": {"recommendationid": "13861529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020609363", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 484, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420535415}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is unbelievably testosterone-heavy.  Inspired (very, very heavily.  Like, \"watch out for copyright lawsuits\" heavily) by God of War 2, a game already known by all men with booming voices, beards, and indescribable road rage, this is the tale of Marlow Briggs.  See, Marlow isn't just your regular old barrel-chested he-man.  He fights fires.  Not to be confused with spraying water on burning buildings, no.  Before you have ever even picked up the controller, Marlow Briggs has had a history of going mano-e-mano with towering pillars of flame.  Fists only.  No items.  Final Destination.  By the time your dainty, effeminate hands have laid themselves down on the controller (play it with a controller, it's a console type of action game), he has had sexual intercourse with more women than you have ever seen, including your mother and all of your sisters over the age of 18, though the underage ones still jill off to him.  Over the course of the next few hours, you will direct his wrath at a menagerie of mercenaries and Aztec horrors all over a Central American jungle.  Even though I was already an adult male, this game put me through a second, much stronger puberty.  My testicles dangle like anvils with a sweater on them, my booming voice shatters windows and sends girly men screaming to the ground, and my muscles got so big that even wearing a muscle shirt still costs the GDP of a small African country.  I have to wear a shirt or else risk being drowned in a tide of slippery sloots.

this game really does work best with a 360 controller or similar pad control, I have one of these but I prefer keyboard and mouse, but all the same I recommend this game, it's a lot of fun, you get to blow lots of things up, and shoot things down out of the sky, some areas require you to solve your way through the level, but nothing too taxing of the old brainbox, nimble fingers sometimes required,

The Mask cracks jokes when Marlow is killing enemies and makes fun of him when he dies.\n   \n  I only had one problem, sometimes when trying to grab a rope or ladder you would miss.

For the price of a candy bar you can have the best experience of your life with Marlow Briggs for 99\u00a2 on Steam\u0099. It is a life changing experience and will change the way you see games and life in general forever. I was on a downward spiral of depression before playing this game. My good friend came up to me and told me \"Hey, have you checked out Marlow Briggs for 99\u00a2 on Steam\u0099? It's a life-changing game and the best game you will ever play for 99\u00a2 in your life.\" I thought a great game for only 99\u00a2? That sounds too good to be true, but I still bought it because for 99\u00a2, what did I have to lose? As soon as it finished downloading, my computer played a chorus fit for the Heavens. As the chorus chanted \"Marlow Briggs\", getting louder and louder as I finally clicked on the game to start it. Once I did that, the chorus stopped immediately as one last \"MARLOW BRIGGS\" was sung with a ear deafening, yet mentally soothing tone. Following the silence was the game booting up and bringing me to the start screen, I subsequently went blind. My vision was brought back after a few minutes which I can only assume was Marlow Briggs himself testing me to see if I was worthy of laying my eyes upon this immortal beauty. From here I cannot say what beautiful godlike things have happened to me playing this game, as only Marlow Briggs can judge who can have this knowledge, but I can tell you now, I know everything and anything. I no longer have the capacity for depression because I have no need for mortal foolishness like emotions. Only my pure devotion to Marlow Briggs is needed to sustain my now immortal body and mind.

Good thing that's done.\"\n\nInitial impressions with the game were great. A funny villain, a funny supporting character, over the top action, and not taking the game too seriously. That comes crashing down after you start going to arena after arena fighting some enemies and boss (repeat). Its a spectacle fighter that fouces WAY too much on combat and times where you are doing physics puzzle and just walking around. It needed to keep the action up instead of padding out the game length. \n\nThe game is a spectacle fighter and has a VERY good combat system that a player who actually cares about will love because there are a lot of weapons, magic, and combos to perform. But I mostly just stuck to repeating my heavy attack for the last half of the game and was fine. Initially, the game is easy because the enemies are just dudes. Then you move on to the spiders and scorpians which are ridicusly frustrating because your light attack doesnt regiester. The enemies only react to your heavy and if you have more than two spiders/armored units, good luck putting a heavy without having to stop your combo half way through to roll out of the way. Some of the enemies have a ridiclous amount of helth and they JUST WONT DIE. They pile them onto you and its frurstating at times. \n\nA really weird thing is that there is no mouse control. You cant look around. each section has a fixed camera that moves to highlight the path you go towards. Its weird because it suggests you use only a keyboard. Speaking of which, you will hate platforming when you cant move the camera to see when then next platform is coming and when you cant move accurately with your keyboard. Use a controller if you have one.\n\nHD4000 users: the game runs about 20-25 FPS, has no video menues, and overheated my system causing the game to crash ~10 times.\n\nThe game had potential. The first chapter was funny and then it just took it self to seriously. The notes your girlfriend leaves you are serious and the vilian becomes super serious. It doesn't keep up the action or the humour.\n\nIf you're looking to waste 8ish hours, buy it for a dollar but it seemed like a grind to me.", "timestamp_created": 1420009090, "timestamp_updated": 1420498530, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13730540": {"recommendationid": "13730540", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051339101", "num_games_owned": 586, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420024568}, "language": "english", "review": " So, u're one cheap mofo ?

And is runs very well with no frame rate or crashing issues. \n\nThe humour in the game is pretty good, as the game doesn't take itself too seriously (at one point I was cursing the person who designed the levels, as I kept dying in one part, for Marlow to cry out \"who designed these levels anyway?\" in the middle of the game - cracked me up.\n\nThe game does have some issues, like even though you have lots of combos there are probably only three that you will ever need. The level design is a little questionable at times. The game is very god, but just not quite as tight as the GOW games. And of course, for a black dude to get super powers, we have to knock on the door of voodoo (just a minor thing - as the mask is very funny and more than makes up for it).\n\nAll in all, this is an insane bargain at 79p.

A game can be very intriguing, but not necessarily fun, and I can enjoy it immensely --take puzzle games, for instance, or Phoenix Wright. Vice versa, you have games like Team Fortress 2, where there's not much intrigue in story or setting but a ton of carnal fun. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death lacks any 'umph' in either of those two elements.\n\nSure, the game can be occasionally fun. The game play is very Devil May Cry styled, quick, fierce, and sharp. The magic you get in the game, though limited, is quite satisfying, and the landscapes are generally pretty. Too often though did I find myself bored when I was chugging through the fighting segments, or struggling through some of the game's numerous mini-games. That's almost a kiss of death for a game centered around combat and platforming.\n\nOn the flip side, the game is only sort of intriguing. MBMD is just brimming with explosions, and it's sprinkled with a B-movie style humor that's actually quite charming. Only thing is, it loses its charm fast. Flat characters and a bland, almost predictable story keep this game from being interesting for me, and the flat voice acting and bland animation from everyone else beside the main characters just feels stale.\n\nSo for the most part, I really don't recommend this game.

You can be so tiny in a grand complex and you feel it. The game really shines with its gameplay diversity. You won't just be hacking and slashing. There are fun turret sections, plenty of not too difficult platform traversal, climbing, swinging, running from boulders, pushing objects, sliding down areas, working turnstile levers and even playing a top down vertical scrolling shooter. These other elements bring a lot of diversity to break up the brawling.\n\nThe story is simple and so bad its good. You're Marlow, visiting his girlfriend in a remote jungle, so she can quit her job working for an evil madman bent on immortality. To show her he means business, he kills you right then and there to kick off the game. Marlow gets killed with a magical artifact and the mask of Death resurrects him. So now with crazy magical powers, Marlow must save his girlfriend. The mask will guide Marlow along the way. There is a lot of humor between Marlow and the mask. Its not a comedy game, but has dabs of humor here and there. Marlow Briggs knows how implausible the situation is and doesn't always take things seriously. The mask is there to aide and taunt Marlow when he dies. To show the game's humor, the antagonist is named Heng Low. He makes some great announcements throughout the game, such as, \"all personnel, go grab a gun. There's a nice reward for killing Marlow Briggs. You can use that reward to pay for the weapon rental.\" Oh and \"All employees are fired, please avoid flaming death traps and bottomless pits on your way out.\"\n\nThe core game play is simple. You can move, double jump, weak attack, strong attack, grapple, block, roll in any direction with the right analog stick, use magic by pressing two buttons and change weapons with the D-pad. Marlow will get four weapons throughout the game. Each weapon has a different speed, range and damage, but for the most part they are pretty much the same. When he attacks he'll swirl around, causing beautiful death. Its visually appealing. There are four spells to earn. A fiery meteor shower in a circle, earth spikes in a straight line, frost to freeze a radius of enemies and a storm. Every enemy gives you experience to upgrade your weapon and magic levels. It seems like every spell depletes all your mana. Luckily each dead enemy brings you health and mana. There is plenty of mana, health and experience around each level. You just need to hold a button to absorb it, so if an enemy is around, they can keep you from getting them. Enemies can be grappled and thrown, but more interesting, they can be converted, making them fight for you! Your block can reflect projectiles if you time it right and you have magical projectiles of your own.\n\nIt is all a nice system, made even more enjoyable by a wide cast of enemies. The standard soldiers don't use guns, just machetes since this is a hack and slash. Rocket launchers that need you to reflect. Riot troops that need to have their shields knocked away with specific attack combos. Bugs that can be easily squashed. There are plenty of mini bosses that show up in the game. First they get their own fight, but then they appear later as common enemies. When most of the mini bosses get weak, you can hop on and control them. Not like the conversion, but rode. You can ride a giant scorpion and control it to kill enemies. You can ride giants the same way. The visual is better than the actual fun. I could kill the enemies a lot quicker without being on top of slow lumbering giants.\n\nSpeaking of giants, then there are the game's big bosses. The bosses so big that you're as tall as a single eye. Each big boss has many parts and they're quite memorable. Its all simple pattern recognition though so its easy enough once you figure out the pattern. The only problem is that you don't do much damage. At the end there is even a quick time event or mash the grapple button.\n\nYou have NO control over the camera. It is always carefully placed and follows you well enough. I only had a problem with that once or twice in the whole game. The load times are hid. I didn't notice one at all unless I came back to a save. Dying has a really quick reload time to the point its just a quote, then you respawn from the last frequent checkpoint. Its so nice to be back in the action.\n\nTo keep things interesting, there are challenges in the game. Things like you're sliding down a hill and need to move left and right. The challenge is collecting all the experience orbs! Don't collect them all? You can restart or just keep playing. You can kill all the helicopters in the turret section or the town down shooter section. It adds an extra level of challenge to what would be an easy game on normal (medium) difficulty. Even though the game stays the same level of difficulty, the later areas just take longer. Bigger enemies take more damage. Puzzles take longer.\n\nOther elements in the game have players jumping between three mine carts to avoid obstacles. Floating with angels wings between platforms. Swimming through a swinging guillotine river. Climbing wall vines, killing worms. Inching with Marlow's back to the wall to avoid either falling or gears. Clinging to cliff sides. Dodging flaming wrecking balls. Turret shooting the pistons on a giant lava scooper as you ride around a cart. Getting chased by helicopters. Seeing giant scorpions get crushed by huge boulders completely unscripted. Escaping under a door by rolling just before spikes crushed the enemies in the room. Fighting enemies on a helipad as it flipped and flew through the air.  Seeing the giant facility Marlow is in was really mobile with treads. \n\nIt all feels like a high budget game in a lot of ways, but lacking in a few, especially the cut scenes. There aren't many animated cut scenes, but the majority of the scenes are fly around of scenes. Its like bullet time. You'll see a still frame circling around Marlow as he's hacked through a flame throwing soldier. As the camera swings around, it will reveal a helicopter. Then Marlow leaping from the copter, only to swing around and show Marlow slashing through an insect.  I'm happy that the cut scenes are the worst part of the game, especially since they're skipable. They spent the time in the animation, character models and gameplay.\n\nThe game is well worth the $5 price tag it currently has. I am shocked this game doesn't have a cult following or more popularity. Even with a 7 hour run time and not too much frills for any replay value, I think this could stand shoulder to shoulder with God of War. The diversity really kept me engaged. Nothing overstayed its welcome. 7 hours was the right time. Its best to leave players wanting more. Odd now Steam says that I only played 5 hours.

It's a spectacle fighter with fairly decent gameplay, very good for the price point, I'd say.  Think God of War centered around Rambo's black cousin.\n\nA lot of the attacks don't really feel like they have a lot of weight to them, especially with the Whip, because the enemies don't really react like they were hit or get staggered in any way. The attacks certainly at least look pretty though, and some combos feel very satisfying. Generally the combat system is fairly fleshed out imo. There are a lot of combos and each of the four weapon types has their own combo system. \n\nMy biggest problems with the game are the camera and the fairly frequent crashes. Unless I missed something you have no control of the camera at all. It generally gets the job done but often picks some angles that wouldnt exactly have been my first choice, and sometimes gets kinda awkward. And the game definitely has some stability issues. I don't know if it just hates my machine, but I'd say I crash probably once per 20-30 mins. The games usually fun enough for me to relaunch it and keep going though. But I do strongly advise you to make frequent saves. The checkpoint system is generally alright but doesn't to add more buffers in case you crash (or fall into a pit in a platforming section). \n\nOther less major complaints would include a few turret sections that I didn't love but at least they weren't THAT long or overly frequent (think i've had 3 in a couple hours of gameplay), a few kinda annoying QTEs but again not that many or very long. I could have also lived without the audio-clips from Marlow's girlfriend but I think they can be skipped if they bug you enough. \n\nThe game does have some puzzle and platforming elements that you may or may not enjoy. Persnally I thought the platforming was just challenging enough to not be boring but it didn't get frustrating or overstay its welcome. If nothing else the companion makes a few funny remarks when/if you fail. The puzzles so far have generally been pretty simplistic and I could live without them but can also live with them. \n\nGenerally I'd say I've had a pretty good time with the game, and the positives have outweighed the few problems I've had with the game. The gameplay is pretty enjoyable and I personally rather like the humor with the banter from the companion, the villain, and the occasional 4th wall breaks.

ASTOUNDINGLY LOW THAT IS OOOOOOOOHHHH (see? I can write unfunny jokes, too).\n\nAt first, its actually a fun game: action, 'splosions, dumb one-liners, what more could you want from a game like this? But oh boy does it get old fast. This game really has it all and then doesn't give a shit about any of it: not about its action, not about its characters (which IS important - don't tell me Arnie isn't a cool character in everything he's in), and least of all about its originality.\n\nWhat killed the game for me was not just the immense level of copypasting off of God of War - although it really is so immense that it's not even funny any more: every single game mechanic from fighting to dodging, blocking, running, climbing, chain swinging, block pushing, orb collecting etc. was aped - but the fact that none of it was copied competently. The puzzles are insultingly easy, the stylized cutscenes (that were taken from the first GoW) are painfully slow and boring, the story itself is horrendously dull even for a game like this and the combat just didn't cut it. At one point, I accidently turned off my monitor during a fight and I decided to just humor the game - attempt the combat with the screen off. Yup, killed them all, no shits given.\n\nThe moment you receive the Chains of Olympus weapon was the moment the developers found even more shits to not give and did not even try hiding any more how blatantly they copied God of War. Half an hour later I heard the most forced and lamest tentacle porn joke in the history of hentai, and I suppose at that point you can guess what I refused to give.\n\nI feel like an asshole not recommending this game at this price but I just can't. Only buy this if you are willing to get no more than 30 minutes of fun from this game or you are really capable of ignoring absolutely all of your standards. The game gets cut a lot of slack for being silly (and dirt cheap), but I didn't find it was possible to oversee how few shits the developers gave about any of this. I was prepared (and hyped!) for a B-game \u00e0 la God Hand, but there is just no soul in this. As if the developers went out of their way to not give a shit.\n\nThe game is also a bit racist, but not to a level where I would consider it offensive.

And it is largely those things, but it's still not far from being mediocre.\n\nWhat the game has going for it is its cheesy, self-aware humor, and it did a great job of delivering on it. I smiled and got some genuine joy out of that aspect quite a number of times. I also enjoyed the set-pieces and technical-efficiency of the game. But past those, it's pretty much your run-of-the-mill CAG/hack-n-slash.\n\nAfter the novelty wore-off for me (maybe 2 hours in), I started to get increasingly bored as I progressed because the combat just didn't deliver. It's your standard button-masher where victory comes relatively easily, and where \"Hard\" mode doesn't make the game more difficult, but more tedious (eg, less forgiving, so you have to be more liberal with dodging, damage-sponge enemies). Any time I got into an enemy encounter, and couldn't just run past them or quickly kill them by throwing them off a cliff, I would find myself falling asleep, doing the same attacks and dodges repeatedly until everything was dead.\n\nSome other aspects that detracted were:\n\n[list]\n[*] The puzzles. They were all mind-numbingly easy, and executing them felt like a punishment.\n[*] The on-rails sections and quick-time events, because they took-away agency from me.\n[*] The story. I did mention that the game was pretty funny, and it is, but the story really is nothing special. And the \"panorama\"-style cutscenes -- which I took great indulgence in the first few times -- eventually got old and hampered the pace of the game. The audio-logs were also pretty pointless.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, Marlow Briggs is beautiful, funny, and a very competent budget-priced game.

platformer, with\n minimal options for attack, and repetitive attacks.  There are also limited puzzles, \nand a few turret sections.  The music, while respectable, was not used appropriately\nto emphasize action or atmosphere as you progress through the game.  There are \nleaderboards for those that enjoy them, and challenge areas that require a different\nstyle of combat both to change up the standard hack and slash feel, and to offer\na harder level of difficulty for those looking to increase their leaderboard rankings.\n\n\tThe graphics look good, and the story is decent,\nwith eclectic comedic aspects that come off as more corny than the game was trying for.  \nThe game doesn't take itself too seriously, which is good, but it has clung to certain\nstereotypes such as \"rescue the princess\" that are overdone in many adventure games.\n\n\tThe level design is vast and impressive, but there is a certain suspension of\ndisbelief required in the physics.   Some may find no fault in a full on battle while\nflying through the air, but most would probably question how the characters aren't\nthrown to their deaths.  The platforming is where this game excels in content. \nThey are designed very well, and you will spend more time platforming through the world \nthan doing anything else. There is a major problem with the camera angle, however, making it\ndifficult to see distances when platforming, and seeing enemies due to the angle.  it\ntakes away from the immersion into the game, and requiring memorization of challenges\nrather than going with the flow of the adventure.  I go more in depth into this\nproblem in the video for those that would like a visual example.\n\n\tThe combat in the game falls short of what it could be;  the weapons all\nessentially do the same thing, with differences in range or speed.  As you progress\nthrough the game, the enemies require more button smashing to defeat rather than any \ntactics or response to their abilities.  There are spells in the game, but they all\ncost an excessive amount of mana, couldn't be used often, and have little effect or\ndamage to the enemy, taking away from the fluidity of the game.  \n\n\tThe game has good graphics, but has a lot of issues.  The story doesn't propel\nyou forward, and doesn't encourage an emotional connection.  The battles lack fluidity\nand the camera view makes it more repetitive than immersive.  I never felt the game \nwas wasting my time, but I felt it was more boring than challenging.  You spend more\ntime platforming through the world than in combat.  If you expect more from games, then\ngood chance you will not enjoy this game, but if you are easily amused then this should\nbe good enough for you to enjoy. \n\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of \nwhat I cover in my video. \n\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho", "timestamp_created": 1416527682, "timestamp_updated": 1416527682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12998108": {"recommendationid": "12998108", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004061334", "num_games_owned": 999, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416346151}, "language": "english", "review": "If you've ever wanted to play a Michael Bay movie then this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1416346278, "timestamp_updated": 1416346278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592292", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12997738": {"recommendationid": "12997738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025278800", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416350085}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, sweet and stupid.

Really funny spectacle fighter/brawler game.\n\nMore:\nIt's a your-standard-generic-brawler game, like any DmC or Batman games this days, yet it offers a nice original story to it placed in Mayan ruins (or Aztecs, or Toltecs, or w/e ;)). There are small glitches here and there, the combat system is not as refined as in DmC, but it was a pleasure playing it. \n\nYou are a man who visits your Ancient South America (later referred to as ASA) linguist girlfriend and suddenly you are killed because reasons (not only monsters, but people as well don't like you in this game). However, the weapon you were killed with was possessed by some god of ASA and he recognizes you as The Spirit Warrior who will bring peace to this part of Earth. And so you get resurrected and have a scythe to get through hoardes of mercenaries, possessed mercenaries, ASA warriors and other monsters and gods from ASA believes.\n\nDuring your progress you get more weapons (in total: scythe, rouge-like weapon - my fav, whip with a blade and warhammer with one side bladed) as well as learn some magic by defeating gods (fire, earth, ice and wind). Spells are summoned by using mana.\n\nYou replenish you health by collecting red orbs/masks and mana by collecting blue ones. Your abilities can by upgraded by collecting enough of yellow ones. However the upgrades are simple: each weapon and spell has three levels, and with each level you get more dmg with it, unlock 2 new moves and your health or mana base value gets higher. It's much simpler than in e.g. Darksiders: there you needed to think what to put your exp into, but here, as the weapons and spells are added to your arsenal in balanced manner, almost always you'd get one thing upgraded before having the other one obtained. With that in mind, the fight system is extremely expanded and the actions you get through sometimes are the typical Hollywood star Bruce Willis level of awesomeness actions.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with the game was the mana system. When you are fully upgraded you get to fire exactly 2 spells. But the mana bar doesn't indicate you in any way if you have enough mana to cast the spell, so you mash the buttons once or twice trying to see if it can work. As stated previously, mana is obtainable in form of blue masks (placed directly on map) or blue orbs (flying out of defeated opponent). As fights are mostly in closed area arenas with god-knows-how-much-opponents going to jump at you in next wave (if there will be any, who knows), you try to limit the usage of blue masks nearby. After you die two or three times to some bigger tank monsters and even start using the masks because why the hell not, you find yourself in a place where you need a smallest amount of mana to use the spell one more time, but it doesn't regenerate in time, and isn't replenished with inflicted damage, so you spend time and time until you finish the monster, and voila, blue f-ing orbs which you don't need anymore. And before next fight it is certain that more than one blue mask will appear.\n\nAnother problem I had were some mini-missions/challenges where you would slide down and had to avoid rocks, pits etc. Alice: Nightmare Returns had some similar sequences, but in here the time between when you push the jump button and when it is registered by the character in game was many times too big for me and I've spent countless times on some of those agility jobs.\n\nAnd one smallest issue: the game needs some power to run smoothly. On my machine DmC was running 60fps on 1080p max settings while this one had to be changed to 720p and some of the graphic options needed to be disabled. I know that Unreal Engine which DmC was running on was tended professionally through years, and I have no idea what was Marlow Briggs build on, but I would expect a little more from the game fidelity.\n\nExcept of those two and a half points above the game was really nice: the story was addictive, the fight system, combos included, was sensationally developed and fluent, graphics caught your eyes and had some great sceneries and the music was always on spot. Also, your mask-god companion has a great sense of sarcastic humour and the voice acting for it is great, so you don't get bored.\n\nHaving in mind that it is actually a budget game (\u20ac5 without a sale) this is probably one of the best fun to price factor games you can get right now.\n\n[b]I do recommend this totally underestimated game, give it some love, ref![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1416175589, "timestamp_updated": 1416175954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12919338": {"recommendationid": "12919338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028204613", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422470284}, "language": "english", "review": "I can barely get through the first section of the game because of crashes and slowdown.

It is self-aware as can be, knowing it's a lot of nonsense. Marlow is armed with its crazy, ridiculous, and off-the-wall story: Marlow dies and is brought back to life to avenge his death, to save his girlfriend Eva, and stop a corrupt man from trying to rule the world. If that isn't enough - Marlow is constantly making a barrage of in-jokes aimed at video-games in general, action movies + games, and other things of that sort; and tons of non-stop action + explosions. And for most of this action/platforming game - what nonsense it is! Marlow is just tons of fun and will make you grin + smile, most of the time. \n\nMost of the time, constanly running at 60 frames per second on my PC (i7 950; GF GTX 560 Ti; 8 GB RAM; Win 7 64-bit) - Marlow runs extremely well. Very rarely did it even drop below 60! Not only that - but the art-direction + technical graphics are surprisingly actually good here, as well. Marlow's non-stop barrage of action feels fantastic in the controls department with an XBox 360 Controller, playing and feeling very similar to the Darksiders series - which is fantastic! Combat feels + looks smooth, fast, and always is on point! If you're into action-games like the Darksiders (which many feel is similar to God Of War series, which I don't have and haven't played b/c I am a PC gamer) - you'll probably feel right at home with Marlow.\n\nJust when you think you've had your fill of using a certain weapon or skill, expect more to suddenly come your way. Expect a suddeny upgrade to a skill or new game-mechanic introduced. And if this isn't enough - Marlow has mini-games of collecting objects in a race-like manner (which can be compared to on the Leaderboards); and even a mini-heliocopter game that feel like a throwback to Capcom's 1942 + Taito's Sky Shark. Marlow will constantly surprise the player with things like this, from in-jokes to game-references.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley, Marlow is sure to put a lot of cheesy smiles on the face of gamers. That is, until the last few levels come around, when the game decides to severely spike up in difficulty. Regardless, since most of your time spent for the 6-10 hours this campaign should last you (took me a bit longer than 10 hours b/c some areas were a bit frustrating to get though), Marlow is going to deliver a riotous, ridiculous, hilarious, and very fun action-packed roller-coaster ride of a game! \n\nFinal Grade = C+.", "timestamp_created": 1414258700, "timestamp_updated": 1440341198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12605625": {"recommendationid": "12605625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148084543", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 125, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446682464}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juegazo\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1 acion dinamica y rematada y una entretenida historia", "timestamp_created": 1414125308, "timestamp_updated": 1414125308, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12560202": {"recommendationid": "12560202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004410106", "num_games_owned": 605, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413602446}, "language": "english", "review": "Marlow Briggs is now the game I consider to be the most underatted and underplayed game of all time.

You have light and heavy attacks creating different combinations, blocks to reflect enemy projectiles, dodging, and magic. \n\n+4 different weapons and magic to fit your play style \n\n+ Throughout the game you will visit interesting locations each providing its own unique action set pieces. The game does a good job of varying up the gameplay to a certain degree to keep things interesting. \n\n+easy achievements\n\n+The game is short but I consider that pretty good for this game because it doesn't wear out its welcome, it does everything it sets out to do. \n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The game itself is very competently made, however its biggest \"flaw\" is that it is very unoriginal. God of War came out before this game and does just about everything better in every category. This is the biggest clone of God of War I have ever seen, from the combat to the platforming to the moves. This in itself isn't bad as many games copy each other however this game brings absolutely nothing new to the table. I know you should judge a game on its own merits but its highly obvious the developers looked at God of War and re-skinned it. \n\n- The story is an afterthought and serves as an excuse for you to kill lots and lots of enemies. After the first 5 minutes of the game the entire story is laid out before you. It doesn't help that the dialogue is terrible. \n\n- Every character in the game is generic, its hard to care about anyone in the game \n\n- Outside of combat the platforming and controls can be a bit flaky at times.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are looking for a fun mindless action game, then look no further, given the price of the game this is probably one of the better values you will find. If you enjoyed God of War then you should check this game out as its the closest thing you're going to play on steam. \n", "timestamp_created": 1413553321, "timestamp_updated": 1413553321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12520158": {"recommendationid": "12520158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019537638", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413778281}, "language": "english", "review": "I just started this game simply to try out my controller that just arrived in the mail replacing my old worn out one.

The gameplay is fantastic, with a character action-based style of liner gameplay, and four very fun movesets based on the weapons you unlock, each with it's own set of satisfying combos. The environments convey an enormous sense of scale, and the camera tricks you into thinking things look much bigger than they are. The environments are very surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the graphics on the PC are surprisingly fantastic. The action is awesome and very over-the-top, with an increase in scale and buildup that rivals that of Platinum's action games, and the fighting levels are broken up by decently lengthy minigames throughout, including an on-rails shooter boss battle and a shoot-em-up helicopter section. Even the end credits are a minigame (which sure beats most credits sequences in terms of enjoyability!). The characters are just developed and fun enough to make a VERY STUPID, yet enjoyable and decently funny story, and the main villain, (also extremely racist) is a very satisfying enemy to face in the final boss battle. At 5 dollars, this is some of the best value you can get form a Steam game purchase, and it's a game that will offer you significant enjoyment no matter who you are. Trust me, this game stands out.

The combat is satisfying with your standard light attack, heavy attack, block and dodge rolls. Some rather good platforming segments and other action segments break up the game from being just beating up enemies.\n\nIt doesn't do much wrong.

Now, bump it up to Hardcore and you're in for a challenge, except I'm now wondering if I had figured how to get the game to switch weapons sooner (Tab key doesn't work for me, I had to use the individual number keys), if it would've been easier. There is also a serviceable amount of platforming and puzzle-solving, though nothing any seasoned player will be stuck on for very long (with maybe an exception here or there).\n\nAnyway, the game is fast-paced, action-packed, and has lots of explosions and goofball banter between the main character and his floating Mayan mask spirit helper, and just about every action game cliche that's been invented in the past decade - bullet time, QTEs, slow-mo special moves, massive combo attacks, mini-game sequences - you name it, it's probably in here. Once you're past the factory settings near the beginning and into the Mayan jungles, it becomes one feast for the eyes after another (screenshots do not do it justice).\n\nThe game frequently goes on sale for around $1-$3, and if God of War clones or action games in general are your thing, I can easily recommend it for that. Even the current store price of $5 isn't a bad deal for it, but since I found it easy, I imagine that people who are more used to playing games of this genre than me might blow through it quickly, even on Hardcore.\n\nRating: 3.5/5", "timestamp_created": 1410192288, "timestamp_updated": 1410192288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504600", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12018163": {"recommendationid": "12018163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011770191", "num_games_owned": 444, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410123527}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like if God of War and Uncharted/Tomb Raider had a baby. \n\nFun and pretty short, yet challening.

Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death isn't so bad or terrible that it isn't simply worth playing, but it's a very straight forward God of War clone that didn't keep me interested. The highest mark for this game is the comedic banter between Marlow and the mask - it will make fun of you for dying and Marlow will say a line that is clearly meant to break the fourth wall - commentary that is self-aware. I genuinely laughed when the mask berated me for having magical powers and then jumping off into a pit and asked if I was looking for enemies when I jumped into another.\n\nAll aspects of the game are standard quality for 360 era spectacle fighter, except for some jumpiness with some animations. One cool feature that I like are the frozen cutscenes, involving the camera moving around a scene frozen in time and will \"update\" as it passes things that obscure's your view. This has maybe been done before, but it was done well before and it was nice to watch these cutscenes. \n\nStill, I found myself uniterested in continuing any further - many other games of this genre do it better, and the comedy and cutscenes are good, but not enough to keep me going. That said it is $5 as of writing, and it meets, arguably, exceeds that value if you intend on finishing it.

While it is nothing more than a God of War clone, it also starts off more exciting than any God of War, well paced and exciting. The problem is in the fact that the game falls apart toward the end, falling into the typical pitfalls of the character action genre, where you spend more time fighting sponges that prolong the game than feeling like you're actually accomplishing something. The first half is where the game is exceptionally entertaining but beyond that, be prepared for monotany. \n\nThat said, for a cheap-ass game like this, it sure has great value. Good graphics, sound, and gameplay. The story is weird and silly and the cutscenes seem to come out of nowhere sometimes, but that's part of the cheap-o charm. The game itself, as I said, is a God of War ripoff unabashedly. Which means it has the problems of God of War.

Extremely fast paced right from the start, with frequent check points so you never have to replay more than a few minutes of the game when you die. Graphics look good, with colorful and diverse environments. \n\nThe only major downfall is the frequency of MAJOR FPS SLOWDOWN, especially when you enter a new area or segment of one.The slowdown is particularly noticable during the 'avoid things as you go quickly forward on rails' levels. I did some googling and this seems to be a hit-or-miss problem, some players have no FPS problems at all, while others describe having the exact same issues.\n\nPROS\n+ FUN!  Extremely Action-Packed and Fast Paced right from the first few seconds.\n+ Controls are accurate and feel great (with 360 controller)\n+ Block puzzles are intuitive and don't require a guide.\n+ Very frequent check points.\n+ Short Shooting segments and on-rail events help mix things up.\n+ Nothing feels repetitive or grindy.

I dont know what caused them, but it took me about 5 DAYS to get past one particular scene cause it crashed every time there\n- the actual story is quite good, but Id have loved a bit more chat between Marlow and the Mask at the start. It kinda was \"Hey, Im ressurected by this mask. I shouldnt question it one bit and start my rampage imediately\"... this was a bit of wasted potential here.\n- the explosion effects where too much at a few times, making it hard to dodge attacks.\n\nAs I said, Id recommend this game. If you dont get the crashes, its fantastic. IF you get crashes and dont mind them that much, its still really good.\n\nI cant wait for a sequel!", "timestamp_created": 1406366319, "timestamp_updated": 1406366319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11411912": {"recommendationid": "11411912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014961110", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 783, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460179135}, "language": "english", "review": "Marlow Briggs is a fun, and entertaining game, for a great price.

Das Spiel ist bewusst in dem Stil eines fr\u00fchen '90er Jahre B-Action-Movie gehalten und nimmt sich selbst entsprechend auch wenig ernst. Der Humor ist gut und die Inszenierung ist recht episch und kreativ, so gibt es einige Level die mit unkoventionelle Ideen und es kommt generell keine Langeweile durch gestreckte Passagen auf. Die Spreche sind durchweg gut, auch wenn es nur englische Sprachausgabe besitzt. Die Gameplay-Elemente sind zwar keineswegs neu aber solide verbunden f\u00fcr ein stimmiges Gesamtergebnis. Es steckt viel Potenzial dahinter, dass sich leider nicht g\u00e4nzlich entfalten konnte, da der Entwickler nur ein kleines Team mit wenig Ressourcen ist, die aber merklich M\u00fche in den Titel investiert hat.\nLeider hat es aber auch Schw\u00e4chen: Das Kampfsystem hat in Gegensatz zu vergleichbaren Titeln weniger Tiefgang, so sind etwa die Waffen recht \u00e4hnlich, d.h. es gibt kaum Stellen wo man durch einen Wechsel wirklich einen Vorteil im Kampf bekommt. Au\u00dferdem ist das Magiesystem eher ein Gimmick als ein n\u00fctzlicher Zusatz im Arsenal, insbesondere da man auch mit voller ausgebauter Manaleiste nie mehr als ein Zauber am St\u00fcck ohne Nachf\u00fcllen ausf\u00fchren kann. Dennoch gibt es viele Kombos zum ausprobieren und lernen und eine f\u00fcr die Spiell\u00e4nge gute Anzahl an Gegnervariationen. Grafik geht soweit eigentlich in Ordnung, nur die Animationen sind zum Teil holprig.\nDie PC-Version lief stabil ohne Abst\u00fcrze oder nennenswerte Perfomanceeinbr\u00fcchen. W\u00fcnschenswert w\u00e4re aber eine Option zur Reduzierung der Effektdichte und eine bessere Kameraf\u00fchrung. So kommt es zum Teil vor, dass man den \u00dcberblick \u00fcber ein Kampf mal verlieren kann. Lobenswert erw\u00e4hnt werden sollte der fl\u00fcssige Wechsel von Tastatursteuerung zu Gamepad. Das ging on-the-fly und das Interface hat sich auch direkt umgestellt. Das ist selten und daran sollten sich Entwickler von AAA-Titel ein Beispiel nehmen.\n\nF\u00fcr Fans dieser Art von solchen Spielen lohnt es sich Marlow Briggs auf jeden Fall anzusehen. Es ist kurzweilige Unterhaltung f\u00fcr ca. 5 Stunden f\u00fcr 5\u20ac. Wenn es ist im Steam-Sale ist kann man wirklich bedenklos zuschlagen. W\u00fcrde mich freuen, wenn der Entwickler bei genug Unterst\u00fctzung einen zweiten Teil mit gr\u00f6\u00dferem Bugdet herausbringen kann.\nLeute, die Spectecal-Fighter vorher noch nie gespielt haben, sollten aber dann doch eher auf andere Titel wie die Darksiders I und II  zur\u00fcckgreifen.", "timestamp_created": 1404776830, "timestamp_updated": 1404776830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11125253": {"recommendationid": "11125253", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993201495", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448738656}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cheap, fun fighting system, absurd (in a positive way) story, setting and minigames.

Let's be clear here. This game is a shameless,  complete ripoff of God of War in everything except that it takes place in modern times and features South American mythology instead of Ancient Greece. I chuckled everytime I came across a new mechanic that was lifted straight from God of War. The graphics in this game are really good for a budget title. The locales in the game are a bit generic. There isn't anything that hasn't been seen before. The gameplay is broken up somewhat by sections where you're flying a plane and the game plays out in the style of a top-down shooter. There are also sections where you are sliding down a hill and are going for the quickest time down it.  It took around 7 hours to finish the game. It really was easy.

The sale is over and the game's regular price is 5 bucks. Is it worth it's regular price? Absolutely. \n\nThis game is the closest that exclusive PC gamers who refuse to game on a console will ever get to playing God of War. As a huge God of War fan I can tell you that Marlow Briggs gets the job done as the combat system is near identical and feels just as good as God of War. I will say that the quick time events are much more forgiving in this game and they do not seem to be as well placed as they are in God of War. However the story is much more light hearted and humerous, so the game does not take itself seriously in the slightest which is good. If you get this game do yourself a favor and turn the music and sound effects down so you can hear the dialog durring gameplay. What I really like about this game is that it has added some variety to the God of War formula by having places where you need to shoot things down with big gun turrets and added rooms with moving obstacles to avoid while fighting enemies. Some of the game's cutscenes are a bit too dragged out with the whole Matrix like, slow camera panning scenes which only seem to slow things down, but every cutscene is 100% skippable if you feel the game is dragging which is a great feature. Also just like God of War, I felt the game was a little too easy on the normal difficulty so I recommend the hard difficulty to really heat things up and to make fights not feel so one sided. \n\nIn the end, wether you pay a buck or five bucks, you will have a good time.

Eu me diverti muito mesmo com Marlow Briggs. Uma verdadeira j\u00f3ia.\n\nA hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o \u00e9 das mais originais, Marlow Briggs (protagonista do jogo) foi morto defendendo sua namorada (Eva), por\u00e9m ele foi morto com um artefato antigo misterioso, e isso fez com que ele, al\u00e9m de ressucitar, se tornar um Sacred Warrior, sendo revivido, ele decidi ir atras da namorada para salva-la. Apesar do contexto ser clich\u00ea, \u00e9 t\u00e3o bem desenvolvida a trama, t\u00e3o bom os dialogos e as dublagens, que voce acaba se envolvendo na hist\u00f3ria. Marlow e Tep (uma mascara - um ancestral que esta guiando Marlow) tem dialogos muito bons, h\u00e1 varias piadas, principalmente piadas internas, jogo de palavras e sarcasmo entre os dois, eles acabam se tornando amigos conforme o jogo vai se desenrolando, e realmente \u00e9 muito legal isso. As dublagens s\u00e3o t\u00e3o boas, que enquanto voce esta lutando, combando e tal, Tep fica pagando pau para Marlow e tirando onda dos inimigos que voce vence, e realmente isso \u00e9 bem bacana, algumas vezes chega at\u00e9 ser engra\u00e7ado. Marlow e Tep, s\u00e3o personagens muito carism\u00e1ticos.\n\nA gameplay do jogo, \u00e9 hack 'n slash. Voce corre, pula, ataca. Voce tamb\u00e9m pode escalar e at\u00e9 mesmo atacar pendurado na parede. \u00c9 poss\u00edvel nadar tamb\u00e9m. H\u00e1 uma boa variedade de golpes, e uma boa variedade de armas brancas. Voce posteriormente pode atirar alguns projeteis.  Conforme voce avan\u00e7a no jogo, voce vai liberando novas armas e golpes, inclusive golpes especiais, que usam mana. A interface mostra vida mana e Exp. Exp serve para dar upgrade nas armas e golpes.  H\u00e1 uma boa variedade de inimigos. A movimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de andar com o personagem nao das mais fluidas, mas durante as lutas \u00e9 razoavelmente boa. H\u00e1 algumas mascaras pelo cen\u00e1rio para pegar, vermelha azul e amarela, sendo respectivamente vida mana e exp. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m algumas caveira pegando fogo azul, estas d\u00e3o um monte de exp, por\u00e9m est\u00e3o escondidas pelo jogo. At\u00e9 o termino do jogo vai ser poss\u00edvel ter todos os upgrades explorando razoavelmente os cen\u00e1rios e vai sobrar exp at\u00e9. Vida e mana tamb\u00b4pem recebem upgrade, mas vem junto quando da upgrade nos golpes ou nas armas, vem como se fosse de brinde assim por dizer. O jogo conta com alguns mini games bem legais tamb\u00e9m, em algumas partes do jogo que voce pilota um vehiculo a\u00e9rio, tem um mini-game shoot 'm up, ao estilo sonic wings, jamestown, etc mesmo, e kra, \u00e9 realmente bem legal esse mini game. Os cr\u00e9ditos do jogo tamb\u00e9m possu\u00ed um mini-game bacana. A A\u00ed dos inimigos \u00e9 razoavel. H\u00e1 alguns audiologs pelo jogo. H\u00e1 alguns challeges opcionais durante a campanha, eles d\u00e3o exp bonus. O jogo possu\u00ed alguns chefes. Alguns deles haver\u00e1 quick time events, mais um motivo pelo qual recomendo o uso de controle neste jogo. A dificuldade do jogo \u00e9 dividida em cinco niveis, esta, adequada para qualquer tipo de jogador, para os que jogam mais descontraidos e aos que buscam mais desafios. A campanha do jogo dura em torno de 5 horas, o que na minha opini\u00e3o, \u00e9 um tempo muito bom, considerando tudo o que esse jogo tem a oferecer e considerando o pre\u00e7o desse jogo\n\nAs m\u00fasicas, s\u00e3o mais ou menos. para ser sincero, elas passam dispercebidas. Poderia ter melhorado neste aspecto, mas voce nem vai se importar muito com este fator no fim das contas.\n\nOs cen\u00e1rios s\u00e3o bem variados, contru\u00e7\u00f5es, floresta, pantano, montanhas, neve, templos, ruinas, etc. Apesar do jogo ser linear, da para apreciar bem os cen\u00e1rios, \u00e9 interessante explorar o pouco que tem tamb\u00e9m.\n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o la grandes coisas, mas, por esse pre\u00e7o, esta excelente, tem jogo por a\u00ed mais caro com visuais piores do que este.\n\nO jogo possu\u00ed alguns bugs e glitchs, mas como da para dar reload no \u00faltimo checkpoint, n\u00e3o chega nada a ser grave.\n\nQuando eu vi esse jogo, eu pensei: \"n\u00e3o ta com cara de ser muito bom\", ainda assim arrisquei e agora eu digo: \"as aparencias enganam\". Comprei por menos de 2 reais numa promo\u00e7\u00e3o, esse jogo \u00e9 uma j\u00f3ia na escurid\u00e3o, pois n\u00e3o houve muito marketing para esse jogo, mas ele \u00e9 muito bom. Pra ser sincero, este jogo bebeu de varias fontes, como: God of War, Devil May Cry, Castlevania, Darksiders, Enslaved, Dante's Inferno, etc. Mas, o jogo pegou a ess\u00eancia b\u00e1sica de cada um desses jogos e mesmo assim ele tem seu pr\u00f3prio charme. Se voce gosta de hack n slash, gosta de combar, e se esta afim de uma boa hist\u00f3ria, \u00e9 mais do que recomendado!

He has also done a insane amount of other movies and voice-overs, including work in Diablo 3.\n\nThe game loads up and just starts right away. No menu, nothing, just begins with the opening sequence. But it is automatically set at my resolution and refresh rate with vsync on which blows my mind that this obscure game can do that and hardly any other game can. I ALWAYS have to check res and vsync first thing in any game I ever start up for the first time. So hats off to this game for that, golf clap.\n\nThis first thing you will immediately notice within the first ten seconds is that your guy has a serious medical condition: his veins in his arms bulge out so much that they exist completely on the outside of his arms. No doubt they were trying to make him look ripped and badass but no man I have ever seen has veins that bulge to a point of being external. Hopefully I come across a medical clinic soon in the game to have that fixed or pick up a health pack or something.\n\nBy far the best deal and fun-to-dollar ratio of any game I have ever bought on steam. It was only 99 cents and it is a very good AAA game that was overlooked when it was released. It is a rail action game, meaning you do not control the camera, it just moves with you as you go along in the game. It actually works fine too this way. It's the same rail action as a game like Narco Terror. The gameplay is solid and flows nicely, and is much akin to the God of War games. The graphics are great, the entire game looks very good. Very vibrant with awesome effects. The story is instantly forgettable. If I want a good story I will play a RPG or read a book. The last place I would ever look for a good story is a action game, and there are very few exceptions.\n\nIt is really amazing that I found this gem on sale for only a dollar. If you are an action game fan there is no reason you should not like this unless you are ignorant. Since most players on steam play garbage like DayZ, then you probably already are dumb beyond words. It really is a pretty fun and well done solid game. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1404360777, "timestamp_updated": 1404360777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453927", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11042741": {"recommendationid": "11042741", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972022944", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404463723}, "language": "english", "review": "GOTY", "timestamp_created": 1404358844, "timestamp_updated": 1404358844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11041943": {"recommendationid": "11041943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047292914", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 408, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404360467}, "language": "english", "review": "After getting this as a gift I was a little skeptical at how good it might be but let me say this it's absouletely AMAZING !.

Wie bereits im obigen Einleitungsatz erw\u00e4hnt ist Marlow Briggs \u201eGod of War\u201c in Reinkultur. Schnetzeln & Kloppen, das ganze mit ein paar Combos verbinden, gelegentlich ein paar mehr oder weniger knifflige Springpassagen und fette Bossgegner \u2013 fertig ist ein Actionspiel der Sonderklasse das durchaus f\u00fcr einige Stunden gut unterhalten kann, eben so wie sein gro\u00dfes Vorbild.

Through it all the protagonist delivers a ton of action movie one-liners and amusing meta-commentary on the number of puzzles involving spikes, swinging blades, and fire. Instead of long, boring cut-scenes, we get cool \"freeze frame\" moments, with the camera swooping and panning around the frozen tableau as Marlow Briggs defeats an army of giant bugs, or cuts a helicopter in half, or survives the explosion of a cruise-ship-sized mining vehicle. It's also nice to see a black guy as the protagonist, with no one else in the game making a big deal out of it.\n\nThere is nothing new or original in this package, so don't expect it to change the definition of gaming.

It has a bit less polish but the game doesn't ever take itself seriously. There's 4 different weapons, 4 different powers, and probably 9-10 combos for each weapons. There's no chaining, no real reward for doing combos. Getting hit doesn't interrupt your combo, but it will push you back in most cases making you sit in a recovery time (which will probably run out the combo timer). It's closer to an arcade beatemup than a cuhrazee game. \n\nThe very last weapon you unlock has great weapon feel. It's too bad it was the last one because I really wanted to beat the shit out of more enemies with it. The base weapon has a pretty mediocre feel, the second weapon has nearly no response, and the 3rd has a pretty cool aoe hitbox, so I'll let it slide. \n\nThere's puzzles in the game, but none that are of any difficulty. However, they're \"new\" feeling enough to not feel boring. \nI laughed a few times in the game but for the most part it's a pretty cliche \"an ancient evil awakens (literally)\" storyline. It's not absurd enough or meta enough to really hold my interest too much though. \n\nThe graphics are pretty well displayed, you can tell it's a console port though. It almost feels like an Unreal engine style game graphically. The animations could have some improvement. When Marlow is sliding down a mountain or snow, his model hardly reacts to the ground. It's like he's on a Slip-and-slide. It feels a bit rushed or on a budget, maybe. I don't know any background information on the game. \n\nIn total, I think it was a good arcade style time waster, but I wouldn't go in expecting any sort of depth to anything about it, be it combat, story, or art. \n\nOverall it gets a 6.3/10. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1403955225, "timestamp_updated": 1403955225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10902499": {"recommendationid": "10902499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041432286", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445128463}, "language": "english", "review": "Better performance than Watch_Dogs", "timestamp_created": 1403953705, "timestamp_updated": 1403953705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10897560": {"recommendationid": "10897560", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059217701", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404217861}, "language": "english", "review": "Exterminator simulation 2014", "timestamp_created": 1403940123, "timestamp_updated": 1403940123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10895324": {"recommendationid": "10895324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065357215", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 498, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404015929}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u266b L\u00e1 vem o neg\u00e3o\nCheio de paix\u00e3o\nTe cat\u00e1, te cat\u00e1, te cat\u00e1 \u266b\n\nJogo \u00e9pico por um pre\u00e7o \u00e9pico! 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1403932600, "timestamp_updated": 1403932757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507545", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10893628": {"recommendationid": "10893628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037286078", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403723318}, "language": "english", "review": "MARLOW MOTHERF**KING BRIGGS IS A MOTHERF**KING BAD***", "timestamp_created": 1403927131, "timestamp_updated": 1403927131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10893019": {"recommendationid": "10893019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046332811", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403930275}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game.

There's Long, the villain, and  Marlow Brigg's assassin who teams up with him during his afterlife. The plot is average, but doesn't matter much in this type of game. You can tell production budget was somewhat low, but they still managed to get moments that are far more epic than $60 shooters. The graphics are fair and some of the views (such as of ancient temples and towns, plus the factory) are beautiful. It is like God of War in every way, and that is a good thing. You get new weapons as you go along, and you can upgrade these weapons. With new weapons comes new moves and more options during combat. You also get new mega-powers, such as summoning a hailstorm of lava or creating a blizzard that freeze enemies. Along with weapons and powers, you also get to fight new enemies with harder and harder difficulty. In addition, there are many different environments and fun mini games to play.

It is start-to-finish fast-paced hack-n-slash third-person action and fun set-pieces, only slowing down due to the incompetence of the player, yet even then the game is always pushing you in the right direction. At one point I was stuck and the Mask (companion) gave hints within 1 minute of me running around, and another minute later told me to just push the cart into the pistons, which was all I had to do. The game is also very forgiving with a ridiculous frequency of checkpoints.\nI wasn't even caring about the collectibles and the game still lasted me about 6 hours, 6 hours of straight and varied action with just a touch of puzzle-solving, no filler whatsoever. Looking back the combat seemed a little repetitive, though I guess that was just me using the same combos over and over. People are right when they say it is similar to God of War, though GOW is not on PC....\n\nThe game has an incredibly low asking price on steam, let alone sale price.

Als sie bei ihrem Chef (Typ: James Bond-Superschurke) k\u00fcndigen will, l\u00e4sst der Marlow kurzerhand umbringen und entf\u00fchrt die Freundin wegen ihrer Sprachkenntnisse. Marlow wird jedoch von der magischen Maske des Todes wiederbelebt und geht nun - als geheiligter Krieger - los um seine Freundin zu retten und dem Schurken das Handwerk zu legen.\n\nZum Gameplay:\nMB ist eine Mischung aus Elementen, die in erfolgreichen Spielen der letzten Jahre zu finden waren. Wir h\u00e4tten das Kampfsytem aus \"God of War\", die Sense als Waffe aus \"Dantes Inferno\", den Humor (Wortgefechte mit der Maske als Sidekick) aus \"Uncharted\" und die R\u00e4tsel und Sprungpassagen aus \"Tomb Raider\" (Sprung-/Kletterpassagen aus \"Legend\" bis \"Underworld\", die R\u00e4tsel aus \"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light\"). Insgesamt also nix Neues, aber die zusammengetragenen Elemente sind allesamt gut umgesetzt. Zwischendrin gibts immer wieder kleinere Auflockerungen, mal darf man mit einer Flak Hubschrauber abschie\u00dfen, mal gibt es Rutschpassagen wo man Hindernissen ausweichen muss und manchmal gibt es Verticalscroller-Shooterpassagen mit Hubschrauber oder Flugzeug. Und es gibt Geschicklichkeistpassagen, die recht schwierig sind - hier hilft oft nur vielfacher Versuch weiter.\n\nDabei bekommt man verschieden Waffen und Zauber (je 4), die mann jeweils in 2 Stufen aufleveln kann indem man gesammelte Erfahrungspunkte (von denen man im Spielverlauf mehr als genug f\u00fcr alles bekommt/findet) zum Freischalten benutzt. Dabei erh\u00f6hen Waffenauflevelungen auch die Gesundheit und Zauberauflevelungen auch das Mana.\n\nGesteuert wird wahlweise mit Gamepad (zu empfehlen) oder Maus und Tastatur oder nur Tastatur.\n\nFazit:\nObwohl MB nix wirklich neu macht, hat das Spiel doch \u00fcber seine 5-6 Stunden gut unterhalten. Der (beabsichtigte?) Trashfaktor (B\u00f6sewicht, Handlung, Anspielungen, Maske) ist passend und lustig und weiss auch \u00fcber die ganze Spielzeit zu am\u00fcsieren. Der normale Preis von 5 Euro stimmt auch.\n\nMB ist zwar kein AAA-Titel, aber dennoch einen Blick wert; es tr\u00e4gt das \"Underrated\"-Tag v\u00f6llig zu Recht.\n\nMit etwas mehr Budget k\u00f6nnte dem Entwickler im Falle einer Fortsetzung vielleicht sogar der ganz gro\u00dfe \u00dcberraschungswurf gelingen.", "timestamp_created": 1403864914, "timestamp_updated": 1403864914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10862262": {"recommendationid": "10862262", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096585712", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440568922}, "language": "english", "review": "If Michael Bay made God of War.", "timestamp_created": 1403855369, "timestamp_updated": 1403855369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10861813": {"recommendationid": "10861813", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989613660", "num_games_owned": 1255, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403852239}, "language": "english", "review": "amazing game for 99cents (during the summer sale 2014). if you like God of War ...ya gotta check this out. obviously the production values aren't gonna be as high ...but still a damn fine action game. especially for such a low price.\n\na wild and crazy ride. hopefully they make a sequel!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1403854036, "timestamp_updated": 1403854036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10861266": {"recommendationid": "10861266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004420558", "num_games_owned": 543, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426973837}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is fucking stupid, Like wow it doesn't even stop I got 79p in the steam sales and I would have paid hella more than that, This game is god of war mixed with a buddy cop movie only one of the cops is a floating magic mask of death \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1403852353, "timestamp_updated": 1403852353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10859931": {"recommendationid": "10859931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092489360", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425120336}, "language": "english", "review": "This is The GAME OF THE EVERY YEAR!\n\nThis game is GOD OF WAR directed by Micheal Bay!!!!\nTheres a chick similr to Megan Fox and is just amazing XD\nPlease Buy this!!!!!!\n\nBETTER THAN WATCH DOGS!!!!!!!\nTHIS GAME IS 100/100\nDA BEST!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1403847992, "timestamp_updated": 1403847992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10857845": {"recommendationid": "10857845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040134158", "num_games_owned": 1430, "num_reviews": 126, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406130508}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy this game and then buy 10 more copies for your friends.

It's refreshing to play a game that doesn't star yet another white guy with ambiguous motives. You play an every man trying to rescue his lady friend and defeat a flamboyant and merciless guy hellbent on destruction. I think one of my favorite aspects of this game is that, while the story could have been nothing due to the game mechanics being fun and tight feeling, it actually paints a really compelling picture. You can tell via the voice acting and writing that Marlow really cares about his significant other and vice versa. Other larger budget games often attempt to make you feel something when it comes to romantic interests/sub plots but this is one of the first that actually had me invested in their relationship. \n\nThe game mechanics are great. I really enjoy the fixed camera despite it being something that I haven't liked since Silent Hill 2 and it allows you to use your other thumbstick (I use a PS3 controller) to roll and evade making the combat even more refreshing. The difficulty also doesn't let up despite your character getting better weapons as you progress which keeps the game fresh and non-repetitive. \n\nI think the only negative mark I've found so far is that due to the fixed camera, there will be times where you make a move the game doesn't fully anticipate and the camera will float into space, causing you to restart from your last checkpoint. This has only happened twice and I can see how it could happen based on what actions I was trying to accomplish. Aside from that minor issue, the game is solid and it cost me less than a croissant.\n\nA+", "timestamp_created": 1403708413, "timestamp_updated": 1403708413, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10788044": {"recommendationid": "10788044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014844421", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498466275}, "language": "english", "review": "HOLY FUCKING SHIT I JUST SHOT DOWN 100 HELICOPTERS AND THEY ALL EXPLODED AND THE GROUND EXPLODED AND THE WALLS EXPLODED AND I'M ONLY ON LEVEL 3\n\nTHANK YOU MICHAEL BAY", "timestamp_created": 1403687850, "timestamp_updated": 1403687850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593034", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10785586": {"recommendationid": "10785586", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053712077", "num_games_owned": 1525, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419919547}, "language": "english", "review": "Marlow Briggs (and the Mask of Death) is a spectacle fighter, a \"God of War clone\" if you will, and most of the time, it's a decent one at that.

It's a budget title from ZootFly, famous for their Ghostbusters demo they released a few years before the actual game from Atari.  On paper, its a generic action game. You play Marlow Briggs, you work on a rig?..., bad guys come after you, you get infused with the power of the jungle, now you can fight the bad guys. \n\nBut Marlow Briggs, to experience Marlow Briggs, is entirely different thing all together.\n\n Imagine, almost to a fault, a Sony all-stars mashup. Imagine the world of Nathan Drake's Uncharted, invaded by a mildly pissed off Kratos, who is guided along his journey by the \u201cAku-Aku\u201d mask from Crash Bandicoot, roll them together like a Katamari Damacy ball and you have Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death.\n\n  This game, is for lack of a better definition a B-Game. It's story doesn't rival any of the before mentioned games, and it isn't trying to. Marlow is a clever mix, cherry picked from the finest parts of other games, and created it's own awe inspiring game.  It's fun, the action is constant and enjoyable. The story is simple, but the characters are interesting. Marlow is a tough, but soft hero, imagine a Keith David meets Sidney Poitier. He's a character who can be kind, but shake some sass if he has to. He's followed by the Mask of Death, who like the Aku-Aku mask follows the player around, providing the comic relief and instructional help.\n\n  The action is non stop. It just keeps blasting right around you. The gameplay is almost exactly like God of War or DMC, hack and slash, mowing down enemys left and right. \n\n  For $5.00, or if you've purchased it during the summer sale for $0.99, Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is a fantastic game. It has the polish and action of a AAA title, not a budget title, and could serve as the perfect black sheep to the family of Sony games that inspired it's creation. \n\nA must buy.", "timestamp_created": 1403283742, "timestamp_updated": 1403283742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10570697": {"recommendationid": "10570697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010280380", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 84, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403319435}, "language": "english", "review": "So Marlowe Briggs is essentially an explosion every five minutes and something about the mask from Crash Bandicoot being a sadist.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1403280451, "timestamp_updated": 1403280451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522502", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10555643": {"recommendationid": "10555643", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040315796", "num_games_owned": 551, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404506647}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0433\u0440 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u0432 \u043c\u044f\u0441\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432,\u0432\u0437\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0444\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e.\n11\\10 GOTY OMG WILL FAP ON THIS", "timestamp_created": 1403253048, "timestamp_updated": 1403253048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10555184": {"recommendationid": "10555184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000318824", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403498081}, "language": "english", "review": "I am down rating myself for not knowing about this game.

Schnell stellt sich jedoch heraus, dass es sich bei dem Auftraggeber der Ausgrabungen um einen skrupellosen reichen Kriminellen handelt. Marlow m\u00f6chte mit seiner Freundin die St\u00e4tte verlassen, aber das geht ordentlich schief und das Geschehen nimmt seinen Lauf.\n\nDie klischeehafte Handlung kann man getrost verschmerzen, denn das Hauptaugenmerk liegt bei Marlow Briggs ganz deutlich auf der Action. Action gibt es reichlich in Form von wilden Pr\u00fcgeleien inklusive Kombo-System mit verschiedenen Waffen wie z.B. einer Sense oder oder einer Peitsche. Diese lassen sich im Verlaufe des Spiels finden und aufwerten - wobei hier auch gleichzeitig Marlows Gesundheit und Magieleiste mit w\u00e4chst. Bei gef\u00fcllter Magieleiste lassen sich gegen Ende des Spiels insgesamt 4 verschiedene m\u00e4chtige Zauber wirken die dem Spieler mehr als nur einmal den Hintern retten k\u00f6nnen.\n\nDenn das Spiel kann einen in diversen Situationen ganz sch\u00f6n ins Schwitzen bringen. Die Gegner stecken zunehmend mehr ein und teilen zus\u00e4tzlich auch noch mehr aus. Ohne den gezielten Einsatz von Kombos und Magie ist ein Scheitern an bestimmten Gegnertypen oftmals vorprogrammiert. Gerade dann, wenn dann wenn man auch noch auf Fallen in der Umgebung achten muss. Gl\u00fccklicherweise wird bei einem Ableben des Charakters die Zeit zur\u00fcck gedreht und man kann es erneut versuchen - ganz ohne Bestrafungen.\n\nNeben den Pr\u00fcgeleien gibt es massig Abwechslung in Form von kleineren Puzzels und verschiedenen Minispielen wie z.B. Arcade-Flugzeugspielchen oder mehreren Frogger-Klonen. Witzig kommentiert wird das ganze immer wieder von den Hauptcharakteren, die offenbar stellenweise das ganze Geschehen nicht besonders ernst nehmen.\n\nErnst ist das Spiel n\u00e4mlich nicht, sondern zieht unaufdringlich das ganze Action-Genre geh\u00f6rig durch den Kakao. Anspielungen auf zahlreiche Klischees (z.B. wenn mal wieder \"rein zuf\u00e4llig\" ein hilfreicher Gegenstand mitten in der Gegend rumliegt) findet man an jeder Ecke.\n\nDie Steuerung geht fl\u00fcssig von der Hand, die Ger\u00e4uscheffekte und die Musik untermalen das Geschehen atmosph\u00e4risch und stimming. Die Grafik ist sehr sch\u00f6n und besticht durch detailierte Landschaften. Alleine die Charaktermodels h\u00e4tten hin und wieder einige Polygone mehr vertragen k\u00f6nnen. Die H\u00e4nde von Marlow sind z.B. auff\u00e4llig kantig geraten.\n\nDas Spiel konnte ich auf der Schwierigkeitsstufe \"Schwer\" innerhalb von 9 Stunden durchspielen. Wiederspielwert hat Marlow Briggs aufgrund der sehr linearen Level und der Tatsache, dass man s\u00e4mtliche Verbesserung innerhalb eines Durchlaufs freispielen kann leider nur wenig.\n\nBeim Durchspielen bin ich auf 2 technische Schwierigkeiten gesto\u00dfen:\n\n1) In einem Level das in Ruinen spielt kam es zu sehr vielen sporadischen Abst\u00fcrzen des Spiels. Ich musste meinen PC mehrfach neustarten um das Level zu durchqueren. Alle anderen Level lie\u00dfen sich jedoch ohne Probleme spielen.\n\n2) Das automatische Speichern des Spiels legte teilweise in sehr ung\u00fcnstigen Situationen einen Speicherpunkt an. So wurde mehrfach gespeichert wenn mein Charakter gerade \u00fcber sehr wenig Leben verf\u00fcgte und beim Sterben bin ich dann erneut mit sehr wenig Leben gestartet. Wenn man mit sehr wenig Leben vor einem Boss steht segnet man teils zwangsl\u00e4ufig das Zeitliche und das Spiel kann nicht fortgesetzt werden. Abhilfe lieferte hier das Laden des Spielstands von davor.\n\nBei einem Preis von nur 4,99\u20ac kann ich jedoch \u00fcber die wenigen technischen M\u00e4ngel hinwegsehen und empfehle Marlow Briggs aufgrund der sehr gelungenen Atmosph\u00e4re, dem Spielwitz und der insgesamt sehr unterhaltsamen 9 Spielstunden.", "timestamp_created": 1402086693, "timestamp_updated": 1402086693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10363170": {"recommendationid": "10363170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018183955", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402017598}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um jogo simples e com um enredo bacana", "timestamp_created": 1402018847, "timestamp_updated": 1402018847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.935961", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10346582": {"recommendationid": "10346582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047123031", "num_games_owned": 654, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1394404572}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game, it is like God of War.

Some of the jumping sections are also pretty obnoxious, with checkpoints set way too far back. The camera is not manually controllable, and whilst it usually does a decent job of being in the right place can be annoying when you just want to look around and work out a puzzle or plan a jump. There is a manual save function which can mitigate some of the frustration if you notice and remember to use it.\n\nWhilst the game certainly has its good points - the art is pretty cool, and the fights are fun at first - I found it too frustrating and with too many cheap-feeling deaths to get a recommendation.

Unfortunately Marlow gets killed with an ancient weapon and his girlfriend is kidnapped. Instead of dying, Marlow gets infused with an ancient power, becoming the sacred warrior, whose prophecy it is to protect the the old artefacts. His only aim is to rescue his girlfriend and stopping the old chinese of destroying the world. Xibalba can wait. Under the guidance of his new buddy, a flying mask, he starts to fight everything the jungle and militia have to offer - or he is just making some damn silly jokes. The gameplay isn't special. It's a God of War/Devil May Cry clone, but the copy works flawless and is entertaining and challenging. The optics are nice and the soundtrack is very good.

The cut scenes are almost a parody on typical Hollywood action movies, and their style is unique and beautiful (although after a while, it may become tedious to some, but you skip them). You've got an intesting 'companion' which constantly is either making fun of you, guiding you, or cheering depending on the situation.\nIf you're into silly humor and action-adventure hack&slash games, you'll totally love this game! It has some great puzzle sections which require some thought, but not too hard to make you get stuck. \nYou start with one weapon, but every hour or so you either get a new weapon or a new magic skill, which broadens your arsenal and keeps the combat fresh. Each weapon is the most efficient against a certain type of enemy, and that makes the combat interesting.\nThe game has a really nice checkpoint system, so that if you die, you almost never have to complete a whole section again. This fixed a frustration that I have with many games nowadays that use a checkpoint system. You also have the option to save manually.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\nI would've liked some more enemy variety for regular mobs though.

This is a great hack and slash in the same style as God of War, but in an action movie motif that screams 'Big Trouble in Little China' homage. Much like the 80s film, the hero (who may be the sidekick depending on opinion) is thrust into saving his girlfriend from the villain, voiced by James Hong who is once again typecast as the asian man who's trying to use a girl for a crazy ritual.\n\nThere's four weapons and four magic spells you can use. All of which level up quite quickly in the somewhat basic upgrade menu. What's a game without a tacked on upgrade system, mirite? It's not bad, but it has no fancy skill trees or anything.\n\nThe writing isn't the best, but it is entertaining. Especially the dialogue between Marlow and the floating Mayan mask he talks to. The voices are good in the sense that they're over the top and fit the style that the game is going for. \n\nThe pacing is great. A nice mix of platforming, combat, puzzles, wall climbing, sliding, and on rail shooting. They're spread out to keep things interesing as you progress. The combat itself is also pretty good. It doesn't feel sloppy or cheap. Good PC hack and slash titles are few and far between and this is one that I'm glad I got to play.\n\nIt's totally worth a purchase and playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1396405582, "timestamp_updated": 1396454274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.564116", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9693934": {"recommendationid": "9693934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002577796", "num_games_owned": 551, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 483, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396354007}, "language": "english", "review": "A little gem of a game.

You have to jump over fires and machines while doging rockets or jungle insects.

I only picked up the game today so I can't really judge the campaign even thou 'till now it's good. I would recommend it to everybody who likes slashing pyromaniacs/warriors/ninjas and much more xD . Now for the bad comment : The game is a lil overpriced just a little lets say take 5 eu/dollars off and it's fine (I bought it in sales wich whas the best 2,09 EU I ever spend on something haha.)

Gutes und einfaches Gameplay. (F\u00fcr viele bestimmt zu einfach!)\nLeider hin und wieder bei Herausforderungen frustrierend. Kamera l\u00e4sst sich nicht bewegen. Story zu klischeehaft.\nQuicktimes sind nervig. Klingt zwar mies, aber alles in allem ein gutes Spiel!\nMeine Empfehlung: Aktuell kostet es 2 \u20ac. Kaufen! (Bei 14 \u20ac wartet auf Sales. W\u00e4re aber kein Weltuntergang wenn nicht.)\n\n[ACHTUNG!]\n[WEITERE REVIEW ENTH\u00c4LT SPOILER!]\n\nMeinung:\nEin gutes Spiel mit recht vielen M\u00e4ngeln, die w\u00e4hrend des Spieles immer wieder auffallen.\nEcht schade! Dennoch bin ich froh es gespielt zu haben. Schlecht ist es n\u00e4mlich nicht.\n\nAussehen:\nDie Grafik (Umwelt, Tiere usw.) ist grunds\u00e4tzlich sehr h\u00fcbsch. Animationen in Zwischensequenzen sieht man nur am Anfang und am Ende. Animationen im Kampf sehen gut aus. Mimik ist bis auf Lippenbewegung eigentlich nicht vorhanden. Blendeneffekt (In-Sonne-guck-Kreise) sind mies. Die Inszenierung ist (vor allem am Anfang) erstklassisch, actionhaft!\n\nEndbossk\u00e4mpfe und normale Gegner:\nDie K\u00e4mpfe sind schnell vorbei und ziemlich einfach.\nManchmal erscheinen normale Gegner als Bossgegner da sie einzeln und in abgesperrten Arealen auftreten. Dies dient allerdings nur der Vorstellung dieser neuen Gegnertypen und deren Art zu k\u00e4mpfen. \nAn Gegnern gibt es:\nInsekten und Menschen, sowie starke Riesenskorpione und sp\u00e4ter geisterartige Rabenmenschen.\nDann gibt es noch weitere Normale die seltener auftreten (starker Schwerttyp) und Untergruppen (Berserker : Mensch). \nSowie einige Bosse (H\u00f6llenhund, Riese, Monster, Endboss etc.).\n\nGameplay:\nEs gibt eine ausreichend gro\u00dfe Anzahl an Kombos die man einfach einsetzen kann. Darauf kann man aber auch verzichten.\nLinke Maustaste ist ein schneller, und Rechte ist ein starker Angriff. Die K\u00e4mpfe gestalten sich sehr einfach.\nDabei hilft auch der niedrige Schwierigkeitsgrad (jedenfalls auf normal).\nOft denkt man: \"Ach du Schande! Wie soll ich das packen?\" und eine Minute sp\u00e4ter schaut man verdutzt auf die Leiche des Gegners oder steht schon im n\u00e4chsten Raum. \n\nLevel:\nDie Level gehen ohne Unterbrechungen (Zwischensequenzen nicht mitgez\u00e4hlt!) ineinander \u00fcber.\nSie beinhalten Sprung-, und Kletterpassagen, einfachen R\u00e4tsel und Abschnitte in denen gek\u00e4mpft wird. Ladezonen hab ich nie bemerkt! Gespeichert werden, kann \u00fcbrigends jederzeit und \u00fcberall.\n(glaube ohne Ausnahme). Checkpoints sind mehr als fair.\n\nQuicktime-Events:\nSelten (nur in wenigen Bossk\u00e4mpfen) trifft man auf einfache Quicktime-Events. Diese sagen einem pl\u00f6tzlich, dass man beispielsweise \"P\" dr\u00fccken soll (P = Rechte Maustaste). Wenn man allerdings mit der Maus spielt (statt beide H\u00e4nde auf der Tastatur), kann das schon ziemlich verwirren. Zum Gl\u00fcck sind sie aber sehr selten.\n\nKameraf\u00fchrung:\nEs gibt keine manuelle Kamera! Das ist einer der gr\u00f6\u00dften Kritikpunkte f\u00fcr mich! \nKamerafehler sind hier aber nicht das Problem!\nDie automatische Kameraf\u00fchrung schleudert, in actionreichen Inszenierungen von K\u00e4mpfen auf herunterfallenden Felsbroken und dergleichen, unkontrolliert und \u00fcbertrieben umher.\nAn manchen Stellen im Spiel, kommt man sich vor, als spiele man Bayonetta. ^^\n\nWaffen und Zauber:\nEs gibt vier Waffen und vier Zauber, die im Laufe der Story freigeschaltet werden. (Keine Optionalen)\nHier die Reihenfolge, und was sie so ungef\u00e4hr machen:\n\n[Kenne die echten Namen nicht, sry. ;) ]\n\nW1 = Sense (Anfangswaffe)\nZ1 = Kometenhagel (Verletzt Gegner um Spieler herum. Diese brennen dann.)\nW2 = Dolche (Schnelle Waffe)\nZ2 = Erdspie\u00dfe (Verletzt Gegner vor\u00b2 dem Spieler. Macht viel Schaden)\nW3 = Peitsche (Riesige Reichweite!)\nZ3 = Einfrieren (Friert Gegner ein. Wehrlos.)\nW4 = Hammer/Axt (Gr\u00f6\u00dfter Schaden. Kombos brechen Gegner-Angriffe ab!)\nZ4 = Wirbelwind (Verletzt Gegner um Spieler herum.)\n\n\u00b2das automatische Anvisieren nervt tierisch, da Mana nicht f\u00fcr zwei Zauber reicht.\n\nAls letztes lernt man das gleiten!\n\nJede der Waffen und Zauber kann man im Men\u00fc upraden. Von Stufe 0 auf Stufe 3.\nNach Graf Zahl macht das vier Stufen pro Waffe und Zauber. Mit jedem Upgrade w\u00e4chst die max. Mana oder max. HP und die Anzahl der Kombos.\n\nHerausforderungen:\nDas frustrierendste am Spiel sind mit Abstand die Herausforderungen.\nDiese treten in regelm\u00e4ssigen Abst\u00e4nden auf. (Man kann sie danach auch aus dem Hauptmen\u00fc heraus starten).\nDiese fordern je nach Hf. zwischen niedriger und hoher Reaktionszeit.\nAu\u00dferdem sind sie das Einzige am Spiel (jedenfalls bei mir) was verbuggt war. Wenn zB. eine Herausforderung startet, endet sie die Sekunde darauf. Nach 3-4 mal neustarten (der Herausforderung, nicht des Spiels!) gings dann aber immer wieder.\nZum Gl\u00fcck dauern die Herausforderungen nie wirklich lange. Sie bringen aber auch ein wenig Abwechslung ins Spiel. ZB. in Form von Shoot \u2019em ups.\n\nStory:\nDie Story ist ziemlich einfach und mir ein wenig zu klischeehaft.\nHier eine kurze (nicht sonderlich pr\u00e4zise) Zusammenfassung:\n\nProtagonist (Marlow Briggs) und seine Freundin (nennen wir sie... pff... Peach) gehen zu einem alten, asiatischen Gesch\u00e4ftsmann (\u00f6hm... Tang Ching), im Dschungel. Dieser ist der Boss von Peach. Der zwingt sie Texte in alten Ruinen zu lesen und l\u00e4sst Marlow t\u00f6ten weil er schwarz ist. Nurn Scherz :D. Marlow hat nur seine Freundin vor einem miesen Umgangston sch\u00fctzen wollen. Statt, dass die Assistentin vom... Ching... Marlow erschie\u00dft, soll sie ihn mit der Sense, die da rum steht, t\u00f6ten. Das macht sie. Marlow stirbt. Marlow kommt wieder zur\u00fcck. (Br\u00fctal Legend l\u00e4sst gr\u00fc\u00dfen :D)\nAb jetzt \u00fcbernehmen wir den \"sacred warrior\". Und dabei werden wir das gesamte Spiel \u00fcber von einer fliegenden Maske begleitet. (Irgendein alter Gott(?) der die Prohezeiung kennt).\n(Diese sieht man im Gameplay aber nicht, keine Sorge. Also nicht wie diese in Crash Bandicoot.)\n\nWir suchen nun Peach die uns immer wieder Briefe hinterl\u00e4sst, in denen sie uns verr\u00e4t, was sie f\u00fcr den alten Tang entschl\u00fcsselt hat. Wir trefen auf Tangs Assistentin und jagen Sie. Diese hilft uns und wir suchen weiter nach Peach.\nPeach erz\u00e4hlt (\u00fcber Briefe) von brutalen und brutaleren Ritualen die an den W\u00e4nden stehen.\nTang folgt denen ohne zu z\u00f6gern. Mit der Zeit wird klar, dass er ein Zauberer ist, der extremer Macht hinterherjagt.\n(Und mit \"mit der Zeit\" meine ich, als er ein inselgro\u00dfes St\u00fcck Land wachsen l\u00e4sst... \u00fcber \"Gestensteuerung\".)\nEs ist klar, dass wir ihn finden und t\u00f6ten, sowie Peach befreien m\u00fcssen. Diese gibt die Hoffnung aber so langsam auf, und bittet Marlow sie im Stich zu lassen, sodass wenigstens er \u00fcberlebt. \n\nWie es weitergeht d\u00fcrfte sich von selbst erkl\u00e4ren. ;)\n\nLogik:\n\u00d6fter mal hat das Spiel einige Logikfehler. Jeder von uns kennt sowas: \"Ach komm, du kannst aus Hubschraubern springen ohne, dass dir etwas passiert, doch f\u00e4llst du wo hin, wo du nicht hin darfst verreckst du?\" oder \"In den Zwischensequenzen und so killt der alle mit einem Schlag, doch im Gameplay stecken die Gegner mehr ein als 'n Pole.\" (nur Spa\u00df^^)\noder \"Nat\u00fcrlich kannst du da dr\u00fcber/hoch springen, du hast sogar 'nen schei\u00df Enterhaken!!!\"\nDas Spiel wimmelt bildlich von sowas. :D\n\nCredits:\nDie Credits sind in Form eines kleinen, recht schweren Minispiels aufgebaut. So muss man als Maske nach oben fliegen, w\u00e4hrend man den Namen der Mitwirkenden ausweicht. Innovativ, wenn auch ein tickelchen zu schwer. \nMan wird \u00fcbrigends f\u00fcr das zuendespielen der Credits mit einer Errungenschaft belohnt. :)\n\n\nIch hoffe, ich konnte dir die Entscheidung mit dieser Review erleichtern.\n(Und, dass du mir Interpunktions- und sonstige Fehler verzeihst. Das ist ein langer Text^^.)\n(Haupts\u00e4chlich Kommafehler... wetten? :D)\n\n//Fragen beantworte und Fehler korrigiere ich gerne. Einfach in die Kommis schreiben oder mit 'nem Zettel und 'nem Ziegelstein ab durch mein Fenster! (Bitte nicht! :D)\n\nAlles Liebe und viel Spa\u00df beim Spielen (oder auch nicht), Skeasy..,- ;)", "timestamp_created": 1395866164, "timestamp_updated": 1395963433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9637143": {"recommendationid": "9637143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025574371", "num_games_owned": 1445, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403821119}, "language": "english", "review": "Marlow Briggs is what we'd get if God of War gave up any pretense of being a serious game.

Un po' deludente invece la variet\u00e0 di nemici, anche se non mancheranno momenti particolarmente goduriosi contro alcuni boss e mid-boss. \nGraficamente c'\u00e8 poco da eccepire: per essere una produzione a basso costo la production value \u00e8 a livelli stellari, e alcuni livelli non sfigurano neanche se confrontati con alcuni giochi tripla A.\nMenzione d'onore per il doppiaggio, veramente eccezzionale e azzeccato, sopratutto per quanto riguarda il nostro compagno maschera che pi\u00f9 di una volta strapper\u00e0 il sorriso con i suoi battibecchi con Marlow.  \nChe dire, mi sono sentito non poco in colpa per averlo preso a prezzo scontatissimo ma ahim\u00e8, non ne avevo mai sentito parlare prima e ammetto di essermici imbattuto quasi \"per caso\", ed \u00e8 un vero peccato che un gioco simile sia passato cos\u00ec in sordina.\nNon fate il mio stesso errore, giocateci, godetevelo e passate parola.", "timestamp_created": 1393417228, "timestamp_updated": 1479991288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.657318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9266944": {"recommendationid": "9266944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033594299", "num_games_owned": 2130, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393474451}, "language": "english", "review": "I really enjoy this games, good control using both keyboard+mouse and controller :)\nFull action, and great story telling, the image is nice, make me wanna play more :D", "timestamp_created": 1393409414, "timestamp_updated": 1393409414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9263855": {"recommendationid": "9263855", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005960200", "num_games_owned": 1355, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 494, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434910141}, "language": "english", "review": "Upside Down Helicopter rides  \nEXPLOSIONS\nsweet sweet violence\nand you fucking die AT THE BEGINNING!\n\nTHIS GAME IS AWESOME\n\nYOU ARE A FOOL IF YOU DO NOT PLAY IT\n\nthis game is SOOOOOoooooo....... much FUN!", "timestamp_created": 1393378471, "timestamp_updated": 1393378518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496905", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9262091": {"recommendationid": "9262091", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060871246", "num_games_owned": 3084, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393575932}, "language": "english", "review": "Yay, yet another action adventure on rails. Then again, at least it's not a puzzle platformer! Honestly though, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/249680/]Marlow Briggs[/url] isn't all that bad as long as you don't mind the linearity. \n\nI have to say I have absolutely no idea where Marlow Briggs comes from, whether it's a franchise of some sorts or simply a new IP. What I do know is that it features a badass-looking African-American main character full of buff and somewhat lacking in smarts. As it happens Mr. Briggs decided to drop in an visit his sweetheart at the dig site where she works, spend some quality holiday time together. As it also happens, his sweetheart works for an unscrupulous mafia boss hell-bent on becoming a god. What follows is a standard man rescues woman plot, though in this case it's filled with cheesy jokes and commentary from the characters as well as lots of over-the-top action and destruction. Think 90's action movies maybe - big unbelievable machines, lots of explosions, and an evil mastermind who just can't help commenting on the main character's progress (and his own failures).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=197082945\n\nIn terms of game mechanics there isn't all that much here that hasn't been done before. Lots of running and jumping and avoiding various implements of death, a significant number of speed slaloming sections too. A few puzzles involving pressure-plates and levers too, though they're pretty easy to grasp and rather annoying to execute at times. A lot of those are also timer-based which only makes it more frustrating. Possibly to compensate for this there are a few turret sections and some top-down plane shmup sections too.\n\nCombat is based on combos composed of light and heavy attack mixes, though I have to give credit to the ingame combo tutor. In more detail there are 4 weapons that cover the usual variety - a standard balanced weapon, a set of daggers with high speed but low attack, a whip with massive range and rate of attack but even lower attack, and a massive scythe that probably should've been a sledgehammer given its slow but devastating attack. On top of that there are 4 types of magic - Fire, Earth, Water, and Wind - and a quickfire homing magic missile. Creep-wise there are several standard varieties - including but not limited to shield-bearers, heavies, giants, gunners, or huge scorpions - sadly those feel more like a chore past the few initial encounters. Every now and then a boss comes along (5 times, to be precise) and things get more entertaining.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=193176104\n\nVisually it's a decent offering, the models look plenty detailed and the environments are rich and vibrant. And I really mean this - initially there are massive excavation machines that resemble moving fortresses more than anything and later on lots of ruins and jungle and mountains. Maybe the textures don't hold up to AAA games upon closer inspection but overall there's nothing to complain about. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=226996285\n\nAnimation-wise there doesn't seem much to complain about, attacks look smooth and interrupts are more than an instant transition to a hit pose. Of particular note is the unusual style that some of the cutscenes are done it - stop-motion frames! It's kinda like what Batman: Arkham Asylum/City did - a series of snapshots of a 3D scene brimming with action an momentum. Hard to describe but pretty successful. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192811453\n\nNow on the audio side things are not as pretty though. There are a TON of dialogues and voiced chatter, and it's not the worst it could be. The main character actually sounds pretty decent, as does the main villain. However, I personally had issues and very few voice-overs actually played. If it wasn't for the subtitles I'd have no idea someone was talking. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=231662424\n\nThe only other big gripe I had with this title was the camera. I found the camera mighty awkward most of the time and there is no way to actually adjust the camera manually! This ties in into finding hidden bonuses and collectibles I suppose but those are few and far between to actually warrant that. And it's not like the camera actually follows behind at all times, nope, the angle seems to be pre-defined in most zones/areas/corridors.\n\n\nInitially I wasn't sure I'd stick through to the end. I've seen [url=www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zg9NHjHC-c]TotalBiscuit's WTF Is..[/url] on Marlow Briggs and got hooked. Then I fired it up and noticed the missing voice-overs. And this somewhat killed the mood for me. With the voice overs (and given their frequency) the game would've been pretty engaging, as it was it turned into a rather mundane experience.

Este vorba despre Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death, un joc de actiune hack and slash, 3rd person in stilul God of War, sau Darksiders 2, produs de ZootFly si distribuit de 505 Games. Imaginile din prezentare aratau bine, dar un lucru mi-a dat de gandit, pretul scazut al jocului, de 14 euro, mult sub media acestor tipuri de jocuri. Impresia de la inceput a fost ca e un joc slabut, dupa intro, dar cum a inceput gameplay-ul mi-am schimbat opinia. Este un joc extraordinar, face toti banii, chiar si mai mult si inca ma tine conectat.\n\nPovestea\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of Death este ca un film de actiune, povestea este asemanatoare cu productii cinematografice de categoria B, filme ce au in centru actori precum Jason Statham sau Silvester Stallone. Marlow Briggs, personajul principal, este un pompier musculos ajuns in America Centrala intr-o vizita la iubita lui, cercetatoare arheologica. Cei doi au parte de doar cateva minute impreuna, caci seful sitului, un psihopat avid de putere, o forteaza pe domnisoara sa lucreze in gasire unor artefacte care ar trebui sa-i confere puteri magice. Pana acum totul este clasic filmului de actiune, insa actiunea ia o intorsatura spre fantastic cand Marlow este ucis cu o arma descoperita in sit, fapt care trezeste la viata Mask of Death (Masca Mortii), un spirit razboinic, care il reinvie pe Briggs, anuntandu-l ca el este \u201ccel ales\u201d si-i confera puteri supraomenesti. Eroul nostru pleaca in cautarea iubitei, distrugand totul in cale si invatand abilitati noi cu fiecare misiune indeplinita. Totul pare un cliseu pana acum, dar cei de la ZootFly au reusit sa salveze povestea prin intruchiparea intr-un mod plin de umor a personajelor. Marlow are replici haioase in legatura cu tot ce se intampla, un umor simplu si bun si auto-critica. Masca, care il urmeaza peste tot este un fel de Jim Carrey, fiind foarte vorbareata si plina de replici taioase, ca deh, n-a mai vorbit cu nimeni de 2000 de ani si se plictisea.\n\nGameplay\n\nAvand in vedere ca Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death este un joc de actiune hack and slash trebuie sa ne asteptam sa avem la dispozitie o multime de taste menite sa execute multe miscari si scheme de actiune. Asa este, dar totul este intuitiv. Eu am jucat si pe tastatura si am testat si controllerul, pentru ca este disponibil in joc. De pe PC este relativ simplu, poti folosi doar tastatura sau combinatie tastatura + mouse, eu am ales ce-a de-a doua varianta, iar tastele de care am avut nevoie au fost WASD + E, F si SPACE si numerele cand schimbi armele, iar din mouse am executat schemele de bataie, folosiind click stanga si dreapta pentru atac direct si alternativ si click pe scroll pentru un atac cu un fel de energie, la distanta. Unele scheme necesita apasarea repetata si de 5 ori a aceleiasi taste, dar totul merge de la sine si daca apesi la nimereala. Cu controllerul e si mai simplu, tastele sunt mapate clasic si jocul ii foloseste toate functiile, ceea ce e extraordinar.\n\nAvem de-a face cu un joc de actiune/aventura 3rd person, in care nu poti controla camera. Exista momente cand camera nu este centrata cum trebuie si scapi din vedere personajul care poate pica in prapastie sau se bate in afara campului vizual. Nu m-a deranjat prea tare acest lucru, caci de fiecare data cand mori, Masca are cate o replica taioasa, punandu-ti sub semnul intrebari abilitatile, razand de tine cand mori, avand o remarca sarcastica despre ce doreai sa faci sau despre masculinitatea ta, ca si personaj.\n\nDe-a lungul jocului va trebui sa combini abilitati de lupta cu dexteritate in evitarea obstacolelor sau acuratetea unor sarituri de pe o platforma pe alta. Actiunea se petrece intr-un ritm extrem de alert, ceea ce m-a atras. Inamicii sunt de putine feluri, insa vin di nce in ce mai multi si nu te plictisesti. In plus, in fiecare parte a jocului vei primi anumite misiuni speciale care te vor face sa incerci de mai multe ori aceasi misiune pana iti iese cum trebuie. Sunt si momente cand trebuie sa iti folosesti inteligenta ca sa rezolvi anumite puzzle-uri si sa scapi din situatii dificile.\n\nPrintre adversari se numara muncitori si luptatori de gherila, apoi animale fantastice sau oameni posedati de spirite malefice, in functie de zona in care esti. Ce mi-a placut in timpul luptelor este faptul ca poti folosi aproape tot ce ai in jur, butoaie, cutii si explozibil, dar si mediul inconjurator. De exemplu, pe platforme poti inhata inamicii si sa-i arunci de pe margine, scapand astfel rapid de ei. De asemenea, arma cu care esti echipat are abilitatea de a bara/respinge atacuri, iar atunci cand esti atacat cu rachete, le poti bara si chiar crea un ricoseu, intorcand-o asupra atacatorului. In anumite locuri din jungla te vei trezi atacat de paianjeni sau scorpioni, mai mici la inceput, dar chiar si de dimensiuni mari, iar o abilitate care mi-a placut a fost ca, atunci cand reusesti o combinatie de lovituri asupra animalelor mari si le ametesti, poti folosi tasta E pentru a te urca pe aceasta si a o folosi in lupta.\n\nEu am jucat Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death direct pe nivelul dificil, lucru intelept si va recomand sa faceti la fel. Nu este imposibil de jucat astfel si vei beneficia de toate elementele posibile, oferindu-ti 8-10 ore de gameplay extrem de rapid si antrenant, lucru rar intalnit la jocurile single-player de acum, ceea ce il face si mai atractiv. Problema cu astfel de titluri este ca odata ce l-ai terminat e putin probabil sa-l rejoci, trebuind sa faci aceleasi lucruri din nou.\n\nGrafica si sunet\n\nCum am spus la inceputul articolului, video-ul de la inceput te induce in eroare, fiind de slaba calitate, insa jocul arata foarte bine. Grafica este surprinzator de buna, in lupta mediul nu devine haotic si esti constient de ceea ce se intampla in jurul tau fara probleme. Schemele executate sunt la viteza normala, dar se observa usor chiar si inamicii aruncati in sus si care pot fi loviti chiar si in aer. In lupta ai posibilitatea sa executi o lovitura mortala, iar acestea sunt derulate in slow motion, din nou placute la vedere, in stilul Assassin\u2019s Creed. O chestie care nu mi-a placut prea mult a fost in 3-4 momente ale jocului, cand am terminat o bataie cu un \u201cboss\u201d, atunci cand executi fatalitatea, imaginea se opreste, oferindu-ti cadre statice, vazute din mai multe unghiuri, un super slow-motion, care parca este mult prea incet, aproape ca in poze. Nu arata rau, sa nu ma intelegeti gresit, dar parca nu se imbina bine cu actiunea rapida de care ai parte in 99% din joc.\n\nSunetul nu m-a impresionat prea mult la prima incercare, dar cand am incercat jocul pe controller, conectat la televizor, pe Steam, totul s-a schimbat. Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death profita la maxim de capacitatile 7.1 ale sistemului de sunet si iti da impresia de film. Dialogurile sunt bune, pline de umor, dar pot deveni repetitive in unele momente. Sunetul de fundal este excelent, nu te disturba in joc, ceea ce m-a surprins in mod placut.\n\nConcluzie\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of Death este un joc surprinzator de bun, iar, avand in vedere pretul scazut, este in acest moment un best-buy pentru nisa actiune-aventura. Nu am vazut de mult un titlu asa de ieftin care sa ma tina conectat mai mult decat un joc prezentat ca un AAA, dar care dezamageste din multe puncte de vedere, spre deosebire de titlul dezvoltat de catre ZootFly. Gameplay-ul mi-a oferit aproape 10 ore de actiune intensa, extraordinara, lucru rar intalnit in aceste zile. Pot spune cu mana pe inima ca Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death este poate cel mai bun joc pe care l-am testat in ultima perioada, m-a surprins in multe aspecte si il recomandam cu placere.\n\nSursa: [url=http://steamgames.ro/game-review/volgarr-the-viking-review/]www.steamgames.ro[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1392118825, "timestamp_updated": 1392118825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514962", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9037524": {"recommendationid": "9037524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002184679", "num_games_owned": 2061, "num_reviews": 169, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391984780}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite looking like a Playstation 2 game, plus the added fact that there a lot more games out there that does everything Marlow Briggs does, but better .

It's a pretty good, bombastic, blacksploitation version of God of War for PC. If you've played God of War (or Dantes Inferno for that matter), you'll know the score here. Constantly dancing dealing death with bright weapon trails between simple platforming and puzzle sections.\n\nWhat's great about this game is the standard it sets. For such a small game, it really tries to stand out next to the AAA titles it mimics. The plot is a rather generic, tale of afterlife, revenge and rescuing a damsel in distress. The whole game uses voodoo and industrialism as it's theme, much like God of War uses greek mythology and the Underworld.\n\nThe graphics are pretty spectacular for such a short and budget developed game, with some excellent framed vistas which can be compared to the Uncharted series, the soundtrack can sometimes be repetitve and tiresome but the game is complimented by funny banter between Marlow and the titular Mask of Death, heckling Marlow's 'tough guy' one liners, in a sense, a buddy movie dynamic and not to far away from what the reboot of Shadow Warrior does. The game is full of Hollywood typical explosion visuals and solid sound effects.\n\nOccasionally, the game takes you by surprise and ejects you into a minigame of a race collecting orbs, sliding down pathways avoiding obstacles, or a magnificently over the top on rails shooting section shooting helicopters down from the back of a moving vehicle and finally a top down arcade shooter much like Capcom's 1942 series, which is a pleasant diversion,\n\nThe game took me eight hours to beat in total and if experienced to the hack and slash format, platforming and puzzles that GoW delivers, you'll find no problems getting through the game. Much like GoW acquired weapons and abilities can be upgraded, but the selection is very, very limited and it's incredibly easy to upgrade the weapons using collectable orbs.\n\nThe controls are pretty solid and translated for mouse and keyboard, much like Blades of Time, (another PC hack and slash game), my only issue is using magic abilities using the complicated layout of holding down left control and a numberic key 1-4, which can make fights difficult if you want to attempt to use a magic move to wear enemies down. The boss fights are nothing spectacular and are just more or less obstacles from one section or another or purely acquiring a new ability. There is also no opportunity of back tracking in this game whatsoever and for that matter, nothing to backtrack for.\n\nEven the credits are a bit of fun, you can tell the developers had a lot of fun making this title and it's totally worth a blast for a quick action/adventure/hack and slash title if you want to give it 6-8 hours.

They are the games that we remember decades after their release, and that continue to be cited as inspiration for new games long since we first revered at their brilliance. And then we have Marlow Briggs.\n\n[i]Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death[/i] is not a revolutionary game; it does little if anything unique borrowing heavily from games of yore without ever outdoing them in its own right. It's not the most polish, it's production values are noticeably low, and has some truly aggravating design decisions. But none of this matters because despite being formulaic and shallow Marlow Briggs is unquestionably a blast to play. If ever there was such a thing as a B-game this is it, and what ridiculous amounts of fun it is.\n\nAs the curtain rises we find Marlow Briggs, aka \"the man with large hands\", arriving to visit his archaeologist girlfriend on a digsite she has been working at lately. Unfortunately, as is usually the case, the operation is in fact being run by a maniacal psychopath possessing godlike magic powers and an army of mercenaries to back him up. Marlow doesn't like this, but before he can take three step towards the door he's sent on a one way trip to Xibalba and his girlfriend kidnapped. Cue flashing lightning and a talking mask and Marlow is reborn as the sacred warrior, hero of prophecy destined to save the sacred land that has been disturbed by the militias presence.\n\n It should be noted that all of this plays out in the span of about 60 seconds, at which point you are tossed straight into the action. This isn't a game that takes itself seriously; not remotely. The plot is absolutely absurd and the dialog cheesy beyond compare, but Marlow succeeds because it knows it's silly and revels in being as self-aware and goofy as possible as it jumps from setpiece to setpiece with little regard to exposition or the mounting continuity errors. This is a game that wants you to laugh with it not at it, with excellent (for what it is) writing and spot on delivery that made it impossible for me not to enjoy myself, grinning the whole way through.\n\nWhen Marlow and the Mask aren't cracking jokes they're smashing in skulls. It's impossible to ignore so to put it bluntly: this is a God of War clone. Right down to the distinctive way you open chests- er, collect skulls, it plays identically to [i]Sony Santa Monica's[/i] lovechild but that really isn't a bad thing. While it isn't as refined as that series, this is a comparable action game with some highly satisfying combat and impressive bossfights. It's nothing new, but it works well for the game and more than solid, with my only complaint being a large amount of overpowered enemies and occasionally getting locked into an animation.\n\nMixed together with the melee arena combat are a plethora of action movie moments such as shooting down helicopters with a mounted turret, and some light platforming and puzzle elements. The variety is great and helped alleviate much of the monotony that otherwise would have occurred from a strictly combat focus through the 6-7 hour campaign. \n\nWhile it won't win any graphics awards, this is actually a rather decent looking title. The environments in particular have a lot of detail put into them, and when the camera pans out for a vista it's a gorgeous site. For a budget title it's pretty impressive, but what I thought was most clever was how instead of using costly animation for the cutscenes, the majority are instead done as freeze frame 3D stills that the camera then slowly sifts through, using dynamic angles and purposely placed obstructions to allow for the scene without you actually seeing them do it. It's a neat idea and I have to applaud the developers for their ingenuity, even if it's a little jarring at times.\n\nI'm not sure how many more ways I can say it at this point; [i]Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death[/i] is plain uncomplicated fun. In the same way a dumb summer blockbuster is enjoyable, Marlow doesn't need to be original or perfectly polished to be entertaining. It's a nonsensical adventure that I think almost anyone could enjoy if they can give it a chance, and quite frankly is some of the most [i]fun[/i] I've had with any video game in a long time.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/01/30/marlow-briggs-and-the-mask-of-death-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1391081150, "timestamp_updated": 1425156594, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 298, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892589", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8854368": {"recommendationid": "8854368", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980059338", "num_games_owned": 961, "num_reviews": 101, "playtime_forever": 387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390734814}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430! \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u044f \u043e \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u044b\u0448\u0430\u043b, \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \"\u0442\u0451\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0430\". \u041d\u043e \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0451 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u0431\u0438\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0435 \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0434\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d.

Perhaps this game.  Admitedly its similarities with batman are only its slick combat, combo, weapons and powers system though without that the batman games are mostly just cool set pieces.  It picks up alot of tomb raider vibes in its well done platforming and puzzles etc.  What this game also has is a shit load of b-movie humour delivered by Steve Blum as the ancient aztec death mask who really does some of his finest work in this game.  \n\nThis game also has a failry unique setting besides the ancient ruins in the shape of monsterous industrial machines, facilities that blanket the jungle regions, like the keystone pipeline with a penchant for outofthisworld steroids.  The games weapon and power progression is straightforward and matches the slick gameplay.  This is probably in the top 10 platformers/beat-em-ups i've ever played though admittedly my console days are long behind me.  Still this game actually works perfectly fine with mouse and keyboard, though i could see some preferring to use a controller.\n\nThe games humour and slick combat and platforming though are why people should play this game, and based on the nearly all positive steam reviews I'm not alone.  Also at around 6 hours or so its a nice diversion from other game types.  It was also just another amusement to peruse the achivements and notice an achievement for skipping all in game cutscenes in a single playthrough...oh game.

The game doesn't take itself seriously and comes off as a nonstop action/adventure game. The game is defintely short, but can be picked up for very very cheap on sale (I got it for $3.76 on Amazon for example.) Despite the fact that the game is short, it is extremely enjoyable. Gameplay is very straightforward hack and slash combat with a splash of magic. Some puzzles, \"challenges\", and basic platforming breaks the pace between the combat. The story is forgettable and is reminicent of B action movies. It's one of those settings that is so bad that it's just so good. Between the senseless dialogue and childish jokes you'll find one or two genuinely humoruous lines. \n\nOverall it's a solid experience for a cheap price that shouldn't be missed if you are even a little bit intrested in simliar titles. At $14.99 it is way too expensive, but for under $10 you'll find a solid 6-7 hour game that is much better than \"professional\" reviews claim.", "timestamp_created": 1388976011, "timestamp_updated": 1388976176, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8581517": {"recommendationid": "8581517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040924074", "num_games_owned": 440, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388921472}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you remember those old, cheesy action movies that you used to love, regardless of how bad the actually movie was..?  As the trailer and store description implies, \"Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death\" is like *playing* one of those.  The fact you're basically in an over-the-top action film is frequently lampshaded throughout the game by characters comments such as \"Now if only there was a convenietly placed gun turrent so I could take out all these helicopters...\" and \"Stop making everything explode!\" XD \n\nThe Gameplay tends to be in the same tract as \"God Of War\" or \"Prince of Persia,\" in that it mixes heavy combat with platforming and puzzles.  Unlike such classics, however, none of the different elements aren't messed together very, with there being clear breaks between different parts of the game.  The camera is also locked in an isometric view, which is rather limiting despite the good graphics.  Despite these faults, gameplay is fun and challenging, with a decent plot and large amounts of genre savvy humor thrown in.\n\nIn short, \"Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death\" won't be winning awards for game-of-the-year anytime soon, but if you're looking for fast paced action, mindless violence, puzzles, humor, and enough pyrotechnics to make ten Michael Bay movies, you've found the right game.

The game's pace is frantic and non-stop from beginning to end switching you between combat sequences, platforming, rail shooting, sliding sequences and even SHUMP sections with the only lull being the games three puzzles.\n\nThe game looks surprisingly good for its $15 price tag with some notable backdrops looking really impressive, combat animations that flow nicely and a solid framerate throughout its entirety. However animations in the few cutscenes that are actually fully animated look really janky and awkward which is probably why they opted to do panning/ stop motion type sequences for most of their cutscenes which are unique and work quite well.\n\nWhere the game really shines though is its dialogue and sense of humor which is as plentiful and quickly paced as everything else in this game. \n\nIf you enjoy character action games or humorous over the top action stories you will definitely want to check this out.", "timestamp_created": 1388848430, "timestamp_updated": 1388848430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538766", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8540838": {"recommendationid": "8540838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029225589", "num_games_owned": 2516, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1389435201}, "language": "english", "review": "Perhaps one of the underrated, completely under-the-radar, unpolished gems of 2013.

Luckly this game proven me wrong in a way. I played couple of levels now and the story is intrestering, its just like watching Indiana Jones. The gameplay is easy to adapt to, and you get good hints if you get stuck too long in the game by the mysterious \"Mask of Death\". I also found the mask to be having a very dark sense of humor. While  many consider Marlow Briggs and the Mask of Death to be a bad game, what makes it stand out is that it was designed to be a bad game: which suddenly elevates it into so-bad-it-is-actually-great game.\n\nTechnical: So here are a few downsides. For all the great aspects of the game the limited budget does show through in some of the animations. Collision errors occur sometimes where characters are holding things and I did encounter one fall-through-the-world glitch. Those are the only major bad points. On the good side, the enemies are programmed with AI that acknowledges more than just yourself as an enemy. So for instance, if the human enemies encounter the giant bug enemies they will fight amongst themselves while also fighting you. None of that, \"Why are the human soldiers working in perfect tandem with the giant penis monsters from Mars?\" problems a lot of games have. Other than that everything if perfectly functional if a little raw in some places.\n\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of the Death is an action game inspired by blockbuster films, comic book heroes, and other action games and is filled with exciting combat and gameplay. I played the game using a X-Box controller, so the gameplay wasn't as bad when I tried it just using the keyboard. \n\nMarlow Briggs is a mix of Shadowman, Soul Reaver and God of War. Its not as well scripted, the acting is cery clich\u00ea, while the mask of death repetetive lines, can at times become very annoying. Overall the game gives you a decent amount of fun.

There is a bunch of unnecessary padding and quicktime events that just serve to waste your time, since they are not challenging, fun or add to the game in any way. Marlow Briggs overall is a fun game sometimes, but is just so flawed that I can't recommend it. Especially not for 15 bucks.

And, I have to admit, it's actually damn fun to play. \n\nMarlow plays like some sort of Devil May Cry or God Of War, but where these other games usually take a little break inbetween the action packed moments Marlow moves full speed ahead. There's hardly ever a dull moment in this game. You move from one crazy action packed scene to the next, with usually just a few seconds of breathing room before hacking away at the next group of enemies.\n\nThis game isn't extremely long, about 5-6 hours, which is more than enough. After finishing it you're probably done with it anyway. It's fun for a first playthrough, then you'll just delete if off your PC most likely. It doesn't have any replay value. Which might actually be the reason why it's just non-stop action.\n\nThe graphics look good, the voice acting is decent and the gameplay solid. \nMarlow Briggs is something you just have to play if you love action games.

Making use of pretty much all of the popular clich\u00e9s, the game is filled with mindless over-the-top action, tons of explosions and hilarious puns without ever taking itself seriously at any point.\n\nThe story proves this instantly: Your girlfriend translates ancient scripts for a rich company mogul somewhere in Central America. You visit her and she explains to you how her boss is up to no good because he wants to perform a ritual that would make him a powerful god and ruler of the world. So you try to take here with you back home, which her boss obviously doesn't like, so he gets you killed with an ancient scythe, not knowing that it is imbued with power that resurrects you and summons the Mask of Death, your new companion on your path to rescue your girlfriend and stop the bad boss.\n\nThe game is based on ZootFly's own proprietary, multi-platform engine called ZEN, which doesn't really provide any PC graphics options other than resolution, fullscreen and brightness. That's a shame because the game could've definitely used some AA, which would make the colorful and detailed enviroments look even better than they already do.\n\nWhile the level design as such is pretty linear, which tends to get boring after a while in a lot of games, ZootFly actually managed to add quite a lot of variety to it. Throughout the game you will encounter combat arenas, puzzles, deadly death traps, quick-reaction minigames, turret sequences and even some top-down shoot-em-up action. This sounds like a weird mix of gameplay elements but is incorporated extremely well into the game, so you never have the feeling that it is out of place.\n\nCombat and controls are exactly like what you would expect from a game like this. Throughout the story, you get access to 4 different and upgradable weapons, each of them with a variety of combos to deliver maximum damage. Additionally, by defeating the ancient gods of fire, earth, water and wind, you unlock their devastating ground attacks, which can help you out of tricky situations or simply cause widespread carnage when facing many of the varying enemies at once.\n\nThe puzzle elements in the game mostly consist of moving blocks on trigger platforms or flipping switches to open doors and while they never are overly challenging they actually provide a welcome change to the otherwise extremely fast-paced gameplay, so you can take a short break from all the action.\n\nUsually, with a low-budget title like this, the soundtrack and voice acting are two of the things where the developer tries to save money. Surprisingly enough, the soundtrack is actually pretty decent and, paired with the level design, builds up a really good atmosphere. While the dialogues are a bit cheesy at times, the voice acting itself is good and fits perfectly to the game characters, especially to Marlow and the Mask, who are constantly teasing each other verbally. That makes for some hilarious puns even in the weirdest situations. For example, while you are climbing a stone wall that is about to collapse and kill you, you are arguing with the Mask about who is whose sidekick in this game.\n\nWith around 8 hours of playtime for the story, the game provides an extremely decent bang for the buck and if you want to test your skills further, you can give the Challenge mode a shot where you replay the minigames from the story to achieve better scores and times to rank up in the online leaderboards.\n\nMarlow Briggs and the Mask of Death is cheesy. It's mindless. It's over-the-top action. But that is exactly what makes the game so enjoyable and so much fun and it's great to see some developers going bonkers with their games without trying to be serious, dramatic or mature.

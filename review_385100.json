Sounds dire? wait, thats not all, you can augment both of those slots with a variety of upgrades, and combine them for really interessting effects.\nAnd you have 5 slots for your ship augments, for example a simple heal, a shield, or do you want to sent a swarm of killerdrones at your enemy? \n\nEarlier i said the game shines on its exploration part, yes, indeed, while you can always teleport back to your starting planet, you can only upgrade flat stats on your \"garage\", but this wont do. The game actually forces you to go out there and visit space, because you can only progress (meaning getting your very important augments) when you find another planet, that has a merchant. AND again, merchants only offer you a limited amount of stuff, and while they may refresh their stock, its always better to search for more merchants, instead of just babysit there.\n\nThe game doesnt seem really challenging at first, but be warned, it can be really hard if you think guns blazin is the way to go. Especially when the game difficulty gets a little bit started, the game likes to use the secret art of \"throwing so much shit at you that you cant even see what hit you\". Kkeeping a cool head is key in later battles, and knowing when to retreat and come back later really helps, ESPECIALLY when you want to take out a fortress of enemies.\n\nall in all, its a solid game, not a blockbuster, but a secret pearl in this whirlpool of narrow rollercoster- gamedesign we have these days\n\ni say its a 9 / 11", "timestamp_created": 1470510033, "timestamp_updated": 1470510234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24409178": {"recommendationid": "24409178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085405990", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469031460}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430.\n\u042d\u0442\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430,\u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e 79 \u0440,\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0438 79 \u0440 \u0432\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0440\u043f\u0433 \u0441 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u043c \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0441\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438(NO MAN'S SKY \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043a)", "timestamp_created": 1468939950, "timestamp_updated": 1468939950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507874", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24363037": {"recommendationid": "24363037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000965264", "num_games_owned": 375, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468713558}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun, the fact that you have to figure out a lot of stuff by yourself can be a perk or minus depending on how you like to play.

The developer, S\u00f8rb, is a one man show and it truly shows throughout the creation of the game. I do not mean that as a negative either. It\u2019s a simple fact. Every game design choice all of the way through to the creation of game\u2019s engine is decided, designed and developed by S\u00f8rb. A very admirable effort is made to create a solid game and it achieves that status, solid.\n\nIt\u2019s space exploration at it\u2019s near pinnacle. You start the game not knowing what to do but you have a basic quest outline \u2013 attack X many space ships. You kill them. Then you\u2019re given another quest and then another. All of the while you\u2019re starting to realize just how gigantic space is. Space is never quite what you would imagine it to be and that is a good thing. Objects can transform, including quest objects, into all sorts of different things. It\u2019s arguably as close as you\u2019ll get to feeling like Han Solo in the Empires Strikes Back flying the Millennium Falcon when he tries to evade an asteroid field in order to find a safe place only to fly into the mouth of an Exogorth without knowing it. Space has so many different quirks such as this it\u2019s hard not to appreciate the amount of effort put into its design.\n\nThe variety of weapons, quests, planets, etc. are incredible creating a game world where there is seemingly always something to see and to enjoy. The sound and graphics are old school and therefore may not appeal to players demanding the latest and greatest but for someone who can appreciate the fact that sometimes less is more it is easy to look past and perhaps even appreciate more. Other than that there really isn\u2019t much to knock about the game and that\u2019s being fair. It\u2019s not the greatest game of all time but there\u2019s more than enough content here to spend a few hours with an enjoyable title.\n\nSadly with just 17 Steam reviews and an estimated 394 \u2013 1858 total owners (according to SteamSpy), Space \u2013 The Return of the Pixxelfrazzer has been a criminally overlooked title that is yearning to be played.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/", "timestamp_created": 1454053072, "timestamp_updated": 1454053072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561478", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19533074": {"recommendationid": "19533074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018101085", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508687803}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of customization, manually scaling difficulty, smooth and tight gameplay\nAfter a point you are only really getting bigger numbers though, there's not a whole lot of content, but what's there is really nice and easily 5+ hours of gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1449429713, "timestamp_updated": 1449429713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491401", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19446036": {"recommendationid": "19446036", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984505368", "num_games_owned": 1327, "num_reviews": 177, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449021642}, "language": "english", "review": "There's a very charming game of discovery and exploration in here - I think - I've hit a few snags but I'm slowly figuring-out what's going on.\n\nIn my first run I met a triangle who wanted to be my friend - some higsaw pieces who I reunited and some octopus-looking-things which glowed for - well - I've no idea but I intend to find out!\n\nMy only grumble is that dying = losing money which would be OK if that wasn't money 'lost forever' from that 'universe' - meaning your progress in that 'universe' was just stunted a bit.

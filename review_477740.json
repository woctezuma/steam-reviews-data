There were times when I thought I had the plot and game pegged as nothing more than a collection of anime clich\u00e9s, instead 999 used those tropes to subvert and misdirect me. Eventually, with some understated foreshadowing along with some well paced breadcrumbs the plot unfolds in such a way that my initial disappointment toward the first couple of endings vanished instantly while making those first few endings retroactively more enjoyable. Between the visual novel portions of the game, the gameplay of 999 consists entirely of escape the room puzzles which often make use of many other kinds of puzzles as well. I found them sufficiently challenging and clever.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nWhile the plot of 999 is fantastic and the characters well written I do feel it had a lack of character arcs. None of the characters grow or learn a lesson that is passed to the player. In this sense the story is a minor disappointment. Also, some dialog felt a little tiresome in the sense of hand holding the player through puzzles, ultimately undermining their clever execution. My only complaint with the plot would be a bit of foreshadowing that was too on the nose and ended up giving me a huge hint for a major plot point very early in the game. Lastly, I can't stress enough the importance of playing the game in novel mode as much as possible. It adds some narration and inner monologue for the main character that is completely gone while playing in adventure mode, and none of this is made clear by the game.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you're looking for a good puzzle game or a nice plot driven mystery then I highly recommend this game. Most of the complaints I have are minor. It also comes with the sequel which I haven't played and I will update this review when I do.", "timestamp_created": 1514798760, "timestamp_updated": 1514799111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38919292": {"recommendationid": "38919292", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009656318", "num_games_owned": 694, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 2386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2386, "last_played": 1514762998}, "language": "english", "review": "Score: 7.5/10 (8/10 for 999, 7/10 for VLR)\nTime to 100%: 40 hours (20 hours each)\nSimilar games [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/413410/Danganronpa_Trigger_Happy_Havoc/]Danganronpa[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/288160/The_Room/]The Room[/url]\n\nThe Nonary Games are two games in one, including both 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. They are story-rich, mystery visual novels where their core emphasis is on trust and betrayal. Locked in escape rooms where you must solve puzzles to survive, can you depend on the kindness of strangers? Or stab them in the back before they do so to you?\n\nPros:\n\n[b]The Rabbit Hole[/b] - Despite the differences between the two games, and there are quite a few, something they both share in common is their trippy writing. The games are meant to be played multiple times, as they have various branching storylines, each of which helps to further explain plots within the game, uncover mysteries and motives of the characters who are with you. \n\n[b]The Unusual Suspects[/b] - Speaking of characters, these games also do a great job of unraveling these mysterious people over the course of the gameplay. 999 in particular did a great job in this, as several of the characters I didn't like in the beginning I ended up liking more as the game progressed, while others did a complete 180 by the games final credits. In a good way.\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b] - The gameplay is your standard locked room puzzle fair. The kind of gameplay you would expect to see in games like Myst, The Room or many other point and click games of their ilk. It's your usual - Find key for the box/Open the box to find a red thingy/Put the red thingy in the red thingy hole - you know.  In 999 they are not too taxing, in VLR the puzzles can be a little bit trickier, and if you are doing hard mode expect to be caught out a couple of times. \n\nCons:\n\n[b]The Art Style[/b] - Most of my cons, and there are not many of them, mainly come from the second game. Personally I think the art style of the first game (999) holds up better than the second (VLR) as in the original they use animated sprites for the characters, whereas in the second they use 3D rendered characters, which look like something I'd see back in Playstation 2 era. It's a small gripe I have, I'm not sure why the developers chose to go in that direction. But it's nothing major, anyway.\n\n[b]Transitioning[/b] - This wasn't a problem in the first game but in the second one expect to see a map with a blinking dot and slowly opening doors MANY, MANY TIMES.\n\nAll-in-all a good series that I had found after looking for something to scratch my Danganronpa itch, which this had done and then some.

Without spoiling anything, the story explores a clever central mechanic in an original way. The cast of interesting characters develop well - you'll feel like you're solving the mystery along with them, as clues are slowly revealed and you're kept guessing up until the thrilling conclusion. Gameplay-wise, the story is punctuated with escape rooms, with puzzles that are mostly fair and full of \"aha!\" epiphany moments. A little bit of pseudoscientific nonsense slightly mars the story, and some might view the puzzles as too easy, but I was more than prepared to forgive both of these points. I also found the voice acting a little wooden, but changing the voices to Japanese solved this problem instantly.\n\nIn contrast, Virtue's Last Reward is a huge let-down. The opening puzzle is particularly weak (it invites you to make a subjective judgement of someone's terrible drawings, ambiguous enough that I felt compelled to brute force the solution), and later puzzles came across as equally unfair. The 3D character models used throughout look awful, and they seem to have had personality lobotomies, lacking the clear motivations and characteristics that the characters in 999 had. Meanwhile, the central \"ambidex game\" mechanic is the sort of fare that's been done to death on daytime game shows across the planet, and yet the writers still don't seem to understand it. You'll get subjected to a long judgemental lecture if you don't agree with the game's flawed reasoning. The dialogue is boring, with a lot of time wasted on convoluted explanations - a particularly stupid example is when the rules of the ambidex game are explained at length, and then a character pipes up with \"Hey! This is just like that famous problem in mathematical game theory! I will now spend a similar amount of time explaining that problem's rules in an identical fashion.\" Arrgh! Whatever happened to \"Show, Don't, Tell\"?! Meanwhile, unlockable secrets seem to reward you with spoiling the upcoming part of the story. I'm struggling to think of something the game did better than 999 - perhaps the ability to get hints by switching to \"easy\" mode, but frankly these hints were not helpful.\n\nIn conclusion, this bundle is worth it for 999 alone, but I'd have preferred to have purchased 999 by itself!", "timestamp_created": 1514505685, "timestamp_updated": 1514505685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38780213": {"recommendationid": "38780213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160561386", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3162, "last_played": 1514465499}, "language": "english", "review": "Completed run review of both 999 and VLR\n\n---- Zero Escape 999 ---\n\n+Excellent Story                                                \n+Excellect Characters\n+Great PC Port\n+2D Characters & Art (personal bias)\n+Math based puzzles (again personal bias)\n\nOverall 999 is a great VN and definitely worthwhile to play (which needs all routes to be 100% completed to understand the whole story). The math-based puzzles are really fun to work on, which compliments the story quite well - the 2D art and animation along with the excellent (japanese) voice over really makes the 25 hour-or-so play through an absolute blast. Personally had no complaints about 999 as it genuinely had my attention from start to finish, with very well polished writng and interesting subplots. \n\n\n--- Virtue's Last Reward ---\n\n+Great PC Port\n+Puzzles are challenging and plentiful\n+Excellent Characters\n+- Story is slightly more convoluted\n- 3D graphics (personal bias)\n- Really inconsistent presentation\n\nUnfortunately VLR have to be compared to 999, if you haven't played 999 then VLR holds up on its own but definitely not as good (in my eyes) as 999 once you have played the first game in the series. Unlike 999 the presentation on VLR uses 3D characters and animated cutcenes which are not that great, but they do their job to convey action. This is also the part where VLR feels inconsistent in terms of production and presentation, there are some 2D cutscenes much like 999 at some parts which makes the 3D ones extremely jarring to say the least. However if you like puzzles that are genuinely challenging VLR definitely has you covered, along with a likeable cast, the 30 hour or so full run through was enjoyable (but definitely not as engaging as its prequel).\n\n--- Overall Verdict ---\n\nDefinitely a must buy if these 2 title-bundles are on sale to anyone who likes (math) puzzles and VN, even if just to play 999 alone. In my personal opinion to a new player it might be of interest to play VLR first since the two titles can be played technically in a non-chronological order. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514468748, "timestamp_updated": 1514468748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38728389": {"recommendationid": "38728389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288542009", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1514361168}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u80fd\u51fa\u6c49\u5316\u5c31\u597d\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1514361065, "timestamp_updated": 1514361065, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38720815": {"recommendationid": "38720815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120494539", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1067, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1067, "last_played": 1514446663}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u63a8\u8350\u7ed9\u90a3\u4e9b\u7231\u601d\u8003\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\nPS:\u6050\u60e7\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u662f\u672a\u77e5", "timestamp_created": 1514341914, "timestamp_updated": 1514341914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38651410": {"recommendationid": "38651410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272205735", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510353947}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really a MASTERPIECE of earth and i love it to play.

Both games are visual novels. it's like reading a interactive book.

Oh! and the translation is realy good, something these games often suffer greatly from. I didn't have any problems with the english dub, all characters sounded fine to me and believable enough. But I gotta mention there is one character/voice actor in particular that is absolutely amazing, you will know when you get hare.\n\nThe puzzle are also amazing brain teasers. You may get stuck for a while (or a very long time), but soon realise that this is actualy just logic and not that hard when you think back at it. Maybe a bit of an unpopular opinion, but I liked the puzzles in 999 better than VLR. I can defently see why some may like the puzzles in VLR better, but the very much highlighted theme in 999 made it a bit better in my opinion.\n\n999 uses 2D pictures of the charaters, while VLR uses 3D characters. and let me just say some of these animations and shots in VLR look very uncanny like.

Aunque m\u00e1s bien, deber\u00eda decir que son dos novelas visuales con elementos de point and click y puzzles, que se combinan de manera sublime en una saga que, hasta ahora, si bien de tanto en tanto puede resultar repetitivo y tedioso, termina siendo una experiencia \u00fanica.\n\nAmbos juegos no son actuales, por lo que no esperes grandes gr\u00e1ficos. De hecho, el primero (999) no tiene animaciones sino dibujos semi est\u00e1ticos, mientras que el segundo tanto los personajes como el entorno est\u00e1n hecho con gr\u00e1ficos 3D m\u00e1s algunos dibujos est\u00e1ticos, pero los NPC s\u00f3lo tienen animaciones cuando se refieren al protagonista y no cuando interact\u00faan con el entorno, mientras que el protagonista s\u00f3lo es visto en dibujos est\u00e1ticos.\n\nLa m\u00fasica es verdaderamente buena y acompa\u00f1a perfectamente los diferentes momentos del juego (novela narrada, interacciones, situaciones de puzzles, etc.). Las voces son excelentes y se asocian perfectamente a cada personaje. Se extra\u00f1a una voz para el protagonista de VLR...\n\nLos puzzles son buenos (algunos son cl\u00e1sicos en P&C) no son dif\u00edciles en general pero algunos, en especial los finales, pueden tenerte un buen rato dando vueltas. El juego tiene una opci\u00f3n para bajar la dificultad de los mismos, en los cuales los NPC que te acompa\u00f1an te dar\u00e1n m\u00e1s pistas para resolverlos, pero eso derivar\u00e1 en que no podr\u00e1s encontrar la totalidad de documentos e informaci\u00f3n sobre el juego que el mismo puede dar.\n\nLo mejor de todo, sin duda, es la jugabilidad, la manera en que los puzzles se acoplan al juego y la HISTORIA, que es sublime en en muchos puntos te tendr\u00e1 en el borde de la silla, con la boca abierta, absorbiendo la informaci\u00f3n y los giros de la trama.\n\nAbsolutamente recomendado para los que gustan novelas visuales, y tambi\u00e9n para los que gustan de los P&C. Eso s\u00ed, para estos \u00faltimos, tener en cuenta que hay m\u00e1s tiempo en modo \"novela\" (donde se cuenta y desarrolla la historia) que en modo \"puzzles\".

From the writing to the structure of the many puzzles there is little to be criticized I am simply amazed by the hard work that must have gotten into making these games.\n\nThe games are part visual novel, part 3D point and click-puzzle games with an enormous emphasis on story. The two games follow a handful of people who are kidnapped and forced to play a game with their lives on the line with the purpose to escape... Or so you think hehehe.\n\nSince the story is so complicated and important I won't go further into it. I will just say that you will HAVE to play the games a few times to get the full experience and you are heavily encouraged to do so.\n\nThe presentation is fantastic for what it is. The games function and look almost identically so I will review them as a whole. During the visual novel parts you simply click to progress and the HUD looks and functions as you would expect. If you come to a part in the story that you've already encountered you can skip through it in a matter of seconds if you want. This happens a lot and the solution works perfectly. During the puzzleparts you work in a semi-3D environment to solve different puzzles and at the same time interact with the fun characters and items around you. Works perfectly\nThe world is presented in exactly the right way, with environments and characters with a lot of depth and mystery behind them.\n\nThe writing is absolutely spiffing, I cannot stress this enough. I envy the writers ability to write such complex stories and still make them make sense to the player with almost zero loose ends. This is really the selling point of the game. If you want a fantastic and complex story in a style that only the Japanese people can do: look no further.\n\nCan I say anything bad about the game? Well, they don't really look that great graphics-wise and the english voices are mediocre at best (except for Zero III omg she is so talented). Luckily you can choose to play with japanese voices and english text. Problem solved.\n\nOnto the graphics then. These games claim to be \"remastered\" in this new amazing bundle. Well, yes and no. The first game looks great for what is is compared to its original DS release. The second game does not. I really feel like the developers could have put more effort into making the character-models and the \"cut-scenes\" look better, they still look like they were made 2003.\n\nMy conclusion is still that these are hidden gems, invaluable treasures among modern puzzle/story driven games. The may not LOOK like it, but these games are a true work of art in story-telling. They changed the way I think about time and space, the way I think when I interact with other people and my standing point of swimsuits forever.

The writing style was not very good (both the translation as well as the Japanese) in that there is too much explanation going on. Everyone has to explain everything instead of showing their character through their actions. And the intro, which should be the hook, gets bogged down.\n\nI personally didn't find the story interesting at all. It had an okay premise, but it failed to capitalize on the drama of internal strife within the group. The danganronpa series had much more tension between the characters and the recurring theme that the greatest threat is not from the outside, but from within. I mean they have this great idea that only a certain group of people would be able to pass through a door, but none of the characters really think through to the end game which is probably one of the first things any normal person would do. \n\nThe puzzles were too easy. There isn't any part where you really have to think, you just have to click everywhere to serch for parts. It isn't a clever manipulation of inventory or lateral thinking, it's just a chore. This isn't a terrible spoiler, but just to be fair I'll put up spoiler tags: [spoiler] You have to put out a fire. Search around the room for a vase, and then fill it up with water in a tub and throw it on the fire. That's not a particularly inspired puzzle. Turn on two light switches and a bag of coins drop. Use those coins in a slot machine to get a card. [/spoiler] Those aren't puzzles. They're just a waste of time.\n\nThe problem with the game design, and this is just a personal peeve of mine is that you have to play the game through several times to get the 'good' ending. I played 4 hours and got a bad ending. And it's not because I made any bad decisions, it's just that to get the good ending you have to choose a certain path. That in and of itself wouldn't be so bad, but you aren't presented any information that would make one choice seem better than another. Basically, you have to choose between entering three doors. No one door is any more appealing than the other. And if you choose the wrong door, you end up playing for three or so hours only to get a bad ending. Sure, you learn a bit about the story, but it still leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. You pretty much have to use a walkthrough to find the correct path, unless you want to do trial and error with hours of your time.\n\nI'm going to play a bit more to get some of the other endings and maybe my opinion will change then. I don't know.

My favourite aspect in this game is the science bits, they threw in interesting theories and lectures here and there (which is relevant to the story), particular stuff like quantum physics and philosophy, which is interesting because you don't see subjects like this a lot, it's not something that is often explored in video games.

Now I won't pretend that these games are flawless. The dialogue can drag on at times and the english voice acting for 999 personally was a hit or miss for me. Virtue's Last Reward has significantly better voice acting in my eyes yet I know some people might be put off by this odd cast of characters. At first glance, this seems like any other visual novel game with seemingly stereotypical characters due to design. I mean, you got the fanservice character, the \"bland\" protagonist, the edgy mysterious man etc. But if this is the case, why would I write about a collection of games positively if I seem to be pointing out what is wrong with it right off the bat? Because quite simply it's my favorite game.\n\n Yes, I know this seems like an odd choice for anyone's favorite game. I mean, if you are looking for steller gameplay and/or a compelling story, there are obviously more well known titles to choose from. E.g, Dark souls, The Binding of Isaac, TF2, even Danganronpa for the visual novel fans. It's weird to say that a game can affect you as a person due to how cringy that can be interpreted depending on the person. However I can confidently say that this series is pretty damn special despite outdated graphics and average voice acting. It's almost impossible to describe the plot without spoiling anything, much like how the other reviews list the pros and cons while still remaining vague about what the story is actually about. \n\nDespite this, i'll briefly state a few things about why this game is special without giving anything away which will hopefully get you to consider buying this hidden gem. Personally, while I wouldn't say that I love every single one of the characters, there is still enough development to let you appreciate most of them as a character. Don't misunderstand, this doesn't mean I actually dislike any of the characters, it's simply I like a few of them more as people. What I mean by this is while I might not actually \"like\" some of them, I can still respect them as an individual and understand their motivations. In addition, the introduction of each character in my eyes, shows you enough personality to be invested. \n\nHowever, the main point of the game is gameplay obviously, so I'll attempt to briefly explain how the game works. It is split into two different sections. Novel and Puzzle. With the Novel side, it's almost exclusively reading so if you ain't a fan of reading, then you might not like this game. You can read it in two different styles but I strongly reccomend reading it in \"Novel\" rather than \"Adventure\" as it adds more description to your surroundings whilst still showing you the decent artwork. I know that sounds really vague but it will make more sense if you actually play the game. Anyways, the puzzle section is an \"escape the room\" scenario in which you solve puzzles, kind of like Professor Layton if I had to describe it. The puzzles are sometimes decent and sometimes they will stump you. Admittedly there are a few moments where one could call \"bullshit\" and I would fully agree that a very small amount of puzzles can get rather illogical at times. I don't mean the room you are trapped in, but rather the puzzles themselves. If you like puzzle games, chances are you will find this enjoyable.\n\n To sum it all up since admittedly I can be seen as just a fanboy due to a lack of knowledge in writing game reviews, this review might just seem to you as the ramblings of a weirdo on the internet who has a fondness for a game you most likely never heard of. I must clarify how important this game is to the fandom and why this is personally my favorite game series. Back in 2012 when Virtue's Last Reward was released, the sales in Japan were awful. Because of this, the idea of a third Zero Escape game seemed like a fairytail. However, because of the fanbase's extreme love for these games (Myself included), they created a group called \"Operation Bluebird\" to grab the attention of the creators of Zero Escape, Spike Chunsoft to point out that there is a fanbase demanding a last installment in the series. After approximately 3 years of waiting, we finally got the finale we were desperate for. So yeah, this review might seem a bit cringy or even pointless to some yet I simply wanted to spread the love for this game series. There's a reason this is the only game I actually bother people to buy. That and Danganronpa but that's because Monokuma rocks my socks. If you read the whole thing, thanks for listening to the ramblings of a dumb fanboy.\n\nTL:DR Good game, buy game. Favorite game for a reason.

I knew that when I played 999, all endings would be important and show me information that I wouldn't get from the others, but VLR takes this to a new level. In VLR, not only does each ending matter for you to play, but you can't get all the way through some endings without beating others. Also, you will see things happen in your current timeline that wasn't supposed to happen, but you seen it in another timeline. You will know what I mean when you see it. This is the best explanation that I can give while keeping my review spoiler free.\n\nFinal Update: Finished the second game. I am a little underwhelmed by the ending. It was really cool how they finished the game up, but they left a big plot hole that left me feeling uneasy. But they did provide tons and tons of story before then. I just really hope that Zero Time Dilemma clears up the questions that I have.\n\nI bought the Zero Escape trilogy, because I had already beaten Danganronpa and I wanted something similar to it. Little did I know that it was the same developers. About 30 minutes into the game I minimized and had to go check to see who made it because it had way too many similarities.\n\nThe first game was great and I am looking forward to the second and third games. $45 should be about spot on for what I think the first two games are worth. Well worth the money and a great experience.\n\nThere are multiple endings and when you get the ending that you didn't want (And I promise you will) you can start over at pretty much any point in the game.\n\nThe story was very intrigueing and it seems like they used theories and philosophies that had actually been discussed in real life. And for the first time in a long time, the good ending was fulfilling. \n\nI think it would be great to see an anime adaptation to this game just like they did for Danganronpa.\n\nAll of your decisions will effect the ending that you get. This is one of the few \"Choices Matter\" games that actually have real effects from what you chose to do. As you are playing, you may miss a few conversations that are really important and when you play to go through each ending, you will get more back story. I believe each ending was as needed as the true ending. There are 6 different endings in 999 and either 18 or 19 endings in the second game.  You are able to pull up the flow chart, as I mentioned earlier, to see which ending you are progressing toward or to rewind time to fix something that you messed up.\n\nIf you are a fan of Danganronpa, psychological thrillers, great story, or visual novels, this game is a must (even at full price). I have already gotten my money's worth at full price $44.99 with 49.3 hours. If I had to guess, I will have about 65 to 70 hours total when I am finished with both games. I am not a person who likes paying full price for games, I love sales. But, if I had paid $65 for this game, I wouldn't have been mad at myself for making a bad decision.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game like I was when I originally seen it for whatever reason ($45 is a lot of money or you aren't the biggest fan of what I mentioned above).

Both games feature a number of participants who are trapped in scenarios where they are forced to play deadly games, in which the deception of other participants is encouraged. No one in either of the games are quite who they seem, and while most participants may not know it, they all have a reason for being there.\n\nWhile the story in these games are intriguing and the mystery is great, the explanations are incredibly complicated. Two thirds through 999 and think you've figured out the twist? You are wroooong. You'll have logic thrown at you that you never imagined would be a possibility. And if you thought 999 was convoluted, VLR has so many curveballs that it's literally impossible to preemptively guess what's going on. I still don't know wtf Phi's deal is. Maybe Zero Time Dilemma will answer this. \n\nWhile the information that the \"game hosts\" give you is all [i]technically[/i] true, a fair portion of that information is misleading, and the few hints you are given as to what's actually going on are exceptionally subtle. In this way, the games kind of cheat out a lot of their big reveals.

It does a very similar insane, mind-bending story with no plot holes or improbable moments. It came out after 999 and probably inspired by it, but it addresses a lot of the issues I have with 999's plot.\n\n\nWhat seperates 999 from \"no-one has to die\" is the amazing puzzles. But 999 has an inexplicable urge to give away the anwser at every turn. Sometimes it's the way they present the question. Other times you fail at a puzzle and a hint comes down whether you like it or not, you won't even know it's a hint until it's too late.\n\nThis would all be solved by putting a hint button in the menu, or having a hard mode that disables hints. It's such a simple fix that I'm baffled by its absense. It's like sitting down with a really good book only to have the author come in and spoil everything.\n\nThen there are moments where the game just explains things to you without ever making a puzzle out of it.\n\nNow, I completely understand why they did this. The puzzles in this game can get hard. And some story exposition felt like you needed to be Sherlock Holmes to make the connection. Which is why this made me so much angrier, that I finally found a puzzle game that could stump me, but it was too afraid to do so.\n\nThere's a really good game buried here. And that last puzzle UGH it's soo good! Yet ultimately, I can't recommend a puzzle game that's afraid of letting the player get stuck. That's the whole point of a puzzle!\n\nI'm going to play Virtue's Last Reward next and see if they have fixed the issues above.

If you enjoy 999, then you'll enjoy Virtue's Last Reward because it is very good sequel that follows in the footsteps of its predecessor thus I'll be focusing my review on 999 for the most part to avoid spoiling anything for Virtue's Last Reward.\n\nIn 999, you play the role of Junpei, a young man forced into playing a game of life and death called the Nonary Game with 8 other participants whereby everyone must solve puzzles and escape from their predicament before the time's up, however not everything is as it seems.\n\n999 is a thriller puzzle \"escape the room\" visual novel where you as the player must solve \"Escape the Room\" style room puzzles whilst piecing together the overarching plot of the game over the course of multiple playthroughs.  \n\nPros\n- Puzzles are fun, they are just hard enough to be interesting and rewarding while not being frustrating.\n- Piecing together the intriguing overarching plot and learning more about various the characters is very enjoyable.\n- One scene in particular near the end was one hell of a rollercoaster that I won't be forgetting any time soon.\n- Fully voiced English VO is very well done and the script/dialogue is well written.\n\nCons\n- Using a Keyboard and Mouse in Virtue's Last Reward is playable but a little awkward, I'm assuming because the game was originally developed for the PSP whereas 999 was developed for the more PC-like (at least in terms of controls) DS.\n\nIf you enjoy intriguing stories, good puzzles and/or unique Japanese games then you can hardly go wrong with Zero Escape: The Nonary Games.", "timestamp_created": 1505091732, "timestamp_updated": 1505091732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34782019": {"recommendationid": "34782019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246834666", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 3560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503716766}, "language": "english", "review": "If your still trying to decide if to get this, Get it it is well worth the money i'd even pay more. 10/10 perfect games", "timestamp_created": 1504727232, "timestamp_updated": 1504727232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34741597": {"recommendationid": "34741597", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964702528", "num_games_owned": 1762, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 3448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493085699}, "language": "english", "review": "Clover is best waifu.", "timestamp_created": 1504551244, "timestamp_updated": 1504551244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34476566": {"recommendationid": "34476566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025393636", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499347762}, "language": "english", "review": "Two good VN games with some unfortunate issues that hold them down from being really incredible.\n\nStarting with 999 i found it quite disappointing. The writing is inconsistent - some parts are very tense, others don't fit at all: jokes that just don't work, huge info dumps out of nowhere and ridiculous fictional story bits that you can't take in seriously. Characters are mostly bland too and the true ending doesn't really explain all that much in the end, so you are left wondering what the hell really happened. \nPuzzles are fun enough for player to rest a bit from all the reading, they aren't too tough if you search for a challenge though. \nNavigating through the novel in the remastered version was made to be especially easy and fun, so in order to reach new routes and all endings, you don't need to replay any puzzle or to start the game from the very beginning several times. Voiced lines for the characters also is a fantastic addition. \n \nVirtue's Last Reward fixes the problem of previous game with incosistent writing. What you will get is some of the most incedible writing i've seen in gaming with an ending that will literally blow you away with how smart it really is. The concepts that are presented in the game are more or less believable and there are no more ridiculously unbelievable tonal jumps. \nThe problem is the very tedious way you will have to take in order to reach that satisfying ending. Different routes have too much of the same story bits and walls of the same text and going through all of them sometimes really bored me. You can use \"text skip\" function to go faster through the parts that you've already read, but it's not the most comfortable tool to make use of. The game literally is too long to remain enjoyable in all its routes and things like unskippable map travels just waste your time.\n\nEven with their flaws, these are enjoyable visual novels with a bit of puzzle solving for variety reasons. The story that is presented in both games is pretty interesting and have some clever ideas that you'll soon be checking on google to find if they really exist (and for the most part they do except some really ridiculous ones). \nBut as i mentioned, inconsistent writing in 999 and tedious structure of the game in VLR stops me from recommending this bundle to everyone. Still if you enjoy twisted, clever stories you should give these games a try, just don't expect a masterpiece like many people suggest that these games are, have moderate expectations and you might

story, this game is for you. If you want great, memorable characters, top tier comedy, or a dark narrative, this game is for you.\n\nZero Escape: The Nonary Games is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Both the games in this collection are mindblowing. I won't go too deep into the games, but just know that this series has some of the best storytelling to come from a video game. It `combines elements of horror, mystery, sci-fi, psychology, and comedy all the while telling a narrative that is out of this world.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to everyone, and I hope that one day we'll get another mystery visual novel as good as this.\n\n[spoiler] Tu fui, ego eris.

The general plot is that 9 strangers get trapped in basically a Saw like death game, except there is actually a story unlike Saw. \n\n999 is for the most part a fantastic game.  The puzzles are well designed and although the plot gets bonkers at points the actual murder mystery is very well constructed.  The mystery relies on actual things like motive and evidence.  You could literally use clues to solve the mystery.  It was so competently done I was quite impressed.  Most games botch telling murder mysteries to an insane degree\u2026because they will rely on ludicrous twists or information that is never conveyed to the player.  Everything that 999 does right the 2 sequels do wrong to just a stunning degree.\n\nI will say I disliked the very animey tropes in this game.  Clover and Lotus are just horribly handled from the way they are dressed to how infantile Clover is made\u2026despite the fact she is supposedly 18.  June comes off as a psychopath.  I think they were trying to make her flirty\u2026but that came across as disturbing when you are trapped in a death game.\n\n[spoiler] The time travel elements are handled well.  I enjoyed how it worked, but I did not like the ending that this paradox existed where June is both alive and dead\u2026sigh.  Also the True Ending where Alice shows up is just weird.  [/spoiler] If 999 was a stand alone game I would definitely recommend it though, because it\u2019s part of a series and literally ends on a cliff hanger I simply can\u2019t.\n\nVirtues Last Reward on the other hand is just a blatant mess.  The puzzles are all terrible.  The solutions are either utterly devoid of logic or extremely complex math puzzles.  I solved every puzzle in 999 and enjoyed them, in Virtues Last Reward I just used a walkthrough on every puzzle, they are just awful.  The only thing worse is the plot.\n\n[spoiler] What can I say.  This plot is a train wreck.  I also solved basically every single thing within the first hour and the game is a good 40 hours.  So it was a grueling slog, trying to get through, hoping that the game would pleasantly surprise me.  It did not.  Dio being the murderer was blatantly obvious, like seriously the guy constantly betrays everyone of course he\u2019s the murderer.  I guess I sure didn\u2019t see it coming that he worked for a secret cult that was bent on wiping out everyone in the world and helped release a virus that killed almost everyone on planet Earth and now the survivors live on the Moon.  I thought it was very obvious they lived on the Moon\u2026so that wasn\u2019t a surprise, but the fact that a bio weapon wiped out Earth was just stupid\u2026they then say, well it wasn\u2019t really the bioweapon, but the nuclear reactors of the planet being overloaded. Ugh, it\u2019s so painfully bad.  It was also obvious Luna was a robot and that Tenmioji was really Junpei from the future, and that the old woman was Akane.  It was painful waiting 40 hours for the characters to reveal what was so obvious from the start. [/spoiler]\n\nIt was just so disappointing.  I was hoping for a competent murder mystery again, what I got was an insane scifi story that never managed to capture my interest.  The fact it suffers from the same anime tropes of the first game did not help.  Why for god sakes does Alice only wear a necklace as her clothes, why is Clover in a bikini, why does Clover still act like a child despite being 19, why did the game think they needed some weird kid character running around.  Ugh, I guess this series was not meant for me.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m not sure if the game creators never actually read what the prisoners dilemma was\u2026or if they just meant for the characters to be stupid.  So, the main death trap in the game involves the prisoners dilemma where people have to vote Ally or Betray and those that vote ally/ally are rewarded a little and the those that vote betray/betray get nothing and those that vote ally/betray have the ally punished and the betrayer rewarded.  So I of course picked Ally\u2026but then all characters flip out on you for being stupid and not understanding how the prisoners dilemma works\u2026except that is the correct choice.  This game isn\u2019t the regular prisoners dilemma scenario, it\u2019s the repeating prisoners dilemma.  In the repeating prisoners dilemma the only solution is to ally/ally.  Whole books have been written explaining this\u2026so either the creator didn't know this\u2026or they purposely meant for all other characters in the game to be idiots.  The whole time I was waiting for someone to explain how in a repeating prisoners dilemma scenario those that pick betray always lose.  I guess it doesn\u2019t matter, because in the end it really had nothing to do with the game because it really has no impact on it. You have to go down all the paths anyway and there is no actual right choice, but it sure disappointed me.\n", "timestamp_created": 1502510774, "timestamp_updated": 1502510774, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.259852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34119214": {"recommendationid": "34119214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085401658", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503377636}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing visual novel.

However, it was frustrating for me because I couldn't jump to points in the narrative to change my decisions. You have to sit through the whole story over again and skip through bits you've already heard. I understand the mechanic, because you need to make some decisions during dialogue which affect what ending you get, but it was still frustrating having to listen to the same beginning of the game over and over again. Granted, there is a feature where you can skip the dialogue, but it isn't as convenient as in VLR. \n\nVLR, on the other hand, allows you to skip directly to decision-making points in the game to alter the histories (thanks for the change on that, Spike Chunsoft!). Moreover, the story is much more compelling and kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending could use some work, but I understand why the devs may have left it at such an anti-climactic point. \n\nAnyway, go ahead and get this package and play both these games.

gameplay , I must say this one is rather interesting and thrilling.\n \nDisclaimer : Just a short notice , don't forget this game includes 2 games which both are remastered.\nOne is ''9 Persons 9 Hours 9 Doors'' and the other one is ''Virtue's Last Reward'' I will review both of them seperately...Oh and I will tell the beginning of the games a little bit.(For review purposes)\n\n999:\n\nStory : You have been kidnapped by an individual calls himself/herself as ''Zero'' to be part of a gamecalled as ''Nonary Game''. After you passed out from a white smoke you inhaled , you wake up in a cabin room in a ship. You solve your first puzzle and get to the central staircase of the ship and find 8 more strangers woke up in different cabins that is participants of the Nonary Game like you too. When everyone groups up , Zero makes an announcement ;\n\n\n''Welcome aboard. I welcome you all, from the bottom of my heart, to this, my vessel. I am ''Zero''\n... The captain of this ship. I am also the person who invited you here. I mean to have you participate in a game. Some of you, I know, are familiar with this game. The ''Nonary Game''. It is a game...where you will put your life on the line. The rules of the ''Nonary Game'' can be found upon your persons. They are simple rules. Read them. There is one last thing I must tell you. As\nyou have no doubt surmised, this ship has begun to sink. On April 14th, 1912...the famous ocean liner Titanic crashed into an iceberg. After remaining afloat for 2 hours and 40 minutes, it sank beneath the waters of the North Atlantic. I will give you more time. 9 hours. That is the you will be \ngiven to make your escape. Now, it is time. Let our game begin. I wish you all the best of luck. ''\n\nSo you have 3 purposes in this game ;\n1-Learn the Nonary Game's purpose.\n2-Find out who ''Zero'' is.\n3-Escape\n\nRemember even a ''4-leaf clover bookmark'' can change the history completely.\n\nGameplay: \n\nThe gameplay is divided into to sections ;\n\n1-Novel\n2-Puzzle\n\nIn novel you get the chance to listen to this remastered English dubbed sounds and go deeper \nin the story... Novel section can change modes  anytime in game with Novel And Adventure modes.\n\nIn puzzle part you have to solve the room puzzle to escape from the room you trapped in and to continue to play the game. All of the room puzzles are unique and you have to play the game more than one time to solve all of the puzzles.Interesting enough all of the puzzle's are related to the truth behind the Nonary Game , so good luck about that. Lastly since it is a part of the gameplay I must tell you about the flowchart system and music... Musics are well...Not bad.\nNow about flowchart system...If you basically completed a novel section or complete the room puzzle until that part of the game you can access to that part without playing the game from the\nbeginning again thanks to the flowchart.\n\nVLR: \n\nStory: In this 2nd game of the series plot twists  get incredibly interesting.You are going to play as Sigma. A common 22 years old college student that is shooting for a PHd degree. You wake up in\nan elevator with somebody calls himself as Phi . After you escape from the elevator you find  7 more people just like in the first game but in this game the one who abducted you calls himself as\n''Zero III'' . As you will see in the game Zero III is an AI so that means the real Zero is one of you.\nBut Why would Zero himself play the game ? Why Sigma doesn't have a voice ? What about Zero II ? You will learn all this by of course playing this game so I won't give any spoilers other than this hints to not ruin this game for you.\n\nGameplay and Music : Since there isn't much change in the gameplay i can't state much mechanics in the game I am truly sorry. About the music part though the game has some\nimprovements.\n\nIn the end , these games is worth the money and a must have for all visual novel and mystery lovers.\n\nAverage point for the both games is total is : \n\n92/100\n\nP.S.

(TL/DR)\n\n\nAs for 9 Persons 9 Hours 9 Doors I'd give it a 8/10. \nI originally played this one to completion on the DS. I loved it! The puzzles well thought out, it fit the tone of each area of the game. The story, being trapped on a ship with 8 other people and slowly piecing together why each person is there and how to escape (Preferrably with as many people as possible), was a great concept as a narritive visual novel. As for this version of the game, I love the voice casting for this one a lot, I appriciate that the voice actors voiced all of the lined of dialouge outside of the escape sections, just like VLR and ZTD. The improved UI, but most importantly (Especially if you intend on running through all of the endings) is the inclusion of the flowchart introduced in Virtue's Last Reward. (I think) they changed several lines of dialouge from the original, (or I SHIFTed to a universe where the dialouge is initially different), but I suppose doesn't matter overall.\n\nVirtue's Last Reward... I think it's a 10/10\nI LOVED that game, perhaps it was the inclusion of more psuedoscience, more quantum physics/ quantum mechanics, paradoxes, and much more difficult puzzles than the first, accompanied by the same intriguing premise, being trapped, and needing to escape. However, the most intriguing part of VLR (In My Opinion) is the inclusion of the Ambidex Game. The Ambidex Game is a simple voting game based off of The Prisoner's Dilemma.

H\u00f6rte sich nach einem guten Deal an. Jetzt wo ich beide durchgespielt habe, w\u00e4re mir eines der beiden sogar den Preis f\u00fcr zwei Spiele wert.\n\nUm etwas Verwirrung aufzukl\u00e4ren: 999 und Virtue's Last Reward sind die ersten beiden Teile der Zero Escape Reihe. Der dritte Teil - Zero Time Dilemma - ist zwar schon letztes Jahr auf Steam erschienen, allerdings handelt es sich bei The Nonary Games um einen Port \u00e4lterer Spiele. Besonders bei 999 merkt man an einer gewissen Stelle auch, dass es eigentlich f\u00fcr die zwei Bildschirme eines Nintendo DS ausgelegt ist, weswegen hier gesagt sei: Der \"Adventure Mode\" war auf einem Bildschirm zu sehen, der \"Novel Mode\" auf dem anderen. Meine pers\u00f6nliche Empfehlung ist hierbei, das Spiel auf \"Novel Mode\" zu spielen.\n\nAber worum geht es bei Zero Escape eigentlich? In beiden Teilen werden 9 Leute entf\u00fchrt und gegen ihren Willen von einem gewissen \"Zero\" dazu gezwugen das Nonary Game zu spielen, wobei sich die genauen Regeln in den beiden Teilen unterscheiden. Eines bleibt jedoch gleich: Regelverletzungen f\u00fchren zur spontanen Exekution! Das h\u00e4lt die Spannung w\u00e4hrend beider Spiele konstant aufrecht, insbesondere dadurch, dass es f\u00fcr die Spieler von Vorteil sein kann, ihre Mitspieler zu beseitigen.\n\nBeide Spiele bestehen haups\u00e4chlich aus Folgendem:\n\n[b]Escape the Room[/b]\nL\u00f6se diverse R\u00e4tsel in einem abgeschlossenen Raum um dem Schl\u00fcssel zu finden, der die T\u00fcr \u00f6ffnet.\nDie R\u00e4tsel gehen von einfach bis mittelschwer, wobei das gr\u00f6\u00dfte Hindernis nicht die R\u00e4tsel selbst sind, sondern die eigene M\u00fcdigkeit, wenn man mal wieder bis sp\u00e4t in die Nacht einfach nicht aufh\u00f6ren kann, da man wissen muss, wie es weiter geht.\n\n[b]Entscheidungen[/b]\nEntscheidungen treten immer wieder auf und verleihen dem Spiel durch die vielen darauf basierenden Enden einen sehr hohen Wiederspielwert. Der soganannte Flow-Chart erlaubt sowohl einen guten \u00dcberlick \u00fcber alle Wege durchs Spiel, als auch das direkte Springen zu bestimmten Abschnitten, wodurch man nicht f\u00fcr ein alternatives Ende von Anfang an neu Spielen muss. Sieht man trotzdem etwas zweimal, gibt es die Skip-Funktion, die ab Teil 2 automatisch jeden Dialog vorspult, den man schon gesehen hat.\n\n[b]Visual Novel[/b]\nMit Text-Boxen als Untertitel und detailierten Charakter-Modellen wird die Geschichte voll synchronisiert erz\u00e4hlt. Das ist der eigentliche Kern des Spiels: Die grandiose und spannende Geschichte. Wer steckt hinter den Nonary Games? Was ist deren Zweck? Wer meiner Mitspieler plant einen Mord? Das ganze Spiel \u00fcber stellt man sich Fragen und die Antworten sind fast nie das was man erwartet h\u00e4tte.\n\nHier kommt auch schon der Hauptunterschied zwischen den beiden Spielen, was es etwas schwerer macht, beide auf einmal zu bewerten: Die Geschichte.\n\n[b]Die Geschichte in Teil 1[/b], so spannend sie auch sein mag, ist voll mit diversen Plotholes. Insbesondere gewisse Enden ergeben auf den zweiten Blick sehr wenig Sinn. [spoiler] z.B. warum niemand auf die Idee kommt, die Armb\u00e4nder der Verstorbenen zu verwenden NACHDEM es schon erwiesen ist, dass dies funktioniert.[/spoiler] Auch gewisse Enh\u00fcllungen st\u00f6ren mich enorm beim \"True Ending\". [spoiler]Die Anzeige eines gewissen Armbands hat \u00fcberhaut keinen direkten Bezug auf dessen wahren Wert, es gibt ein paar Armb\u00e4nder doppelt und der wahre Wert eines Armbands impliziert, dass die Person Zero ist, w\u00e4hrend die andere Person mit dem gleichen Armband es nicht ist. [/spoiler] Dennoch ist man quasi an den Stuhl gefesselt und muss einfach wissen wie es weitergeht. Ein Aspekt sticht hierbei besonders hervor: Die Spielregeln des Nonary Games erlauben es, auszurechnen, wer einen Mord begangen haben k\u00f6nnte. Nicht selten sa\u00df ich mit Stift und Papier vor dem Computer und habe herumgerechnet und es letztlich auch herausgefunden, ohne das es im Spiel schon erw\u00e4hnt wurde. Das war eine faszinierende Erfahrung, die ich so noch nicht erlebt habe.\nEin weiterer erw\u00e4hnenswerter Aspekt war die Schwierigkeit des allerletzten R\u00e4tsels. Ich pers\u00f6nlich habe die L\u00f6sung sofort gesehen, was an sich ziemlich schlecht w\u00e4re, w\u00fcrde es nicht so hervorragend in die Geschichte rund um [spoiler]danger und epiphany[/spoiler] passen. Falls es also mit Absicht so konzipiert war, dass man sofort die L\u00f6sung sehen kann, dann Hut ab!\n\n[b]Die Geschichte von Teil 2[/b] setzt Ma\u00dfst\u00e4be sondergleichen. Ich \u00fcbertreibe in keinstem Ma\u00df, wenn ich sage, dass sie jegliche Geschichte die ich vorher erleben durfte bei weitem in dem Schatten stellt. So viele Plottwists und \u00dcberraschung selbst im wer-wei\u00df-wie-vielten Durchlauf sind einfach nur Atemberaubend. Zum Teil rechnet man damit, dass eine Stelle genauso seien wird, wie im letzten Durchlauf und dann ist sie komplett anders. Und kennt man die gesamte Geschichte, ergibt es durchaus Sinn, warum es komplett anders ist. Aus diesem Grund ist [b]das mehrmalige Spielen ein absolutes Muss[/b] um auch nur im Ansatz in den vollen Genuss des Spiels zu kommen. Auch \u00fcberrascht das Spiel an mehreren Stellen, an denen man endlich die Antwort auf Fragen wie \"Wer ist Zero?\" oder \"Wer ist das unter dieser Maske?\" erwartet mit komplett anderen Enth\u00fcllungen, die nochmal nochmehr Fragen aufwerfen, die letztlich im \"True Ending\" beantwortet werden.\nDas beinhaltet noch nicht einmal die nervenaufreibenen Entscheidungen, die man im sogenannten Ambidex Game, ein Minigame im Nonary Game, treffen muss, welches auf dem ber\u00fchmten Gefangenen-Dilemma basiert. Und obwohl das Ambidex Game immer nur die selben zwei M\u00f6glichkeiten anbietet (Ally und Betray) ist die Situation jedes mal eine andere, was jedes einzelne Mal zu einer nervenaufreibenden Angelegenheit macht.\n\n[h1] Fazit [/h1]\n[b] Positiv [/b]\n+ Sehr spanndene Geschichte, der zahlreichen Plotholes zutrotz (999)\n+ Mit weitem Abstand die beste Geschichte, die ich je erlebt habe (Virtue's Last Reward)\n+ Plottwists ohne Ende, selbst bei vermeitlich \u00e4hnlichen Abschnitten\n+ Zahlreiche witzige Dialoge\n+ Voll synchronisiert in Story-Abschnitten und mit exzellenten Synchronsprechern\n+ Zahlreiche nervenaufreibende Entscheidungen mit zahlreichen komplett verschiedenen Enden\n+ Skip-Funktion zum \u00fcberspringen bereits gesehener Dialoge\n+ Enormer Wiederspielwert\n+ Stellenweise sehr gute musikalische Untermalung der Szenerie\n+ Funktioniert ausschlie\u00dflich als Spiel. Buch, Serie, Film etc. k\u00f6nnte der Geschichte niemals gerecht werden\n\n[b] Negativ [/b]\n- R\u00e4tsel manchmal zu leicht\n- Keine Hotspot-Anzeige wenn man etwas nicht finden kann\n- Plotholes\n- Nur in japanisch und englisch\n- Nicht einzeln erwerbar\n- Sorgt f\u00fcr Schlafmangel", "timestamp_created": 1499771269, "timestamp_updated": 1499863010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33425331": {"recommendationid": "33425331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031994154", "num_games_owned": 358, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 3013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499910144}, "language": "english", "review": "Stunning!

Those are interesting and neither too easy nor too hard I think. Now the story is the really interesting part: during the game you are able to make decisions and you can follow your progress in a flowchart....you should play all the endings to get the full experience and that works together really great!

Either way...\n\nIf you've ever wondered what Saw would be like if it were an anime that also had a weird obsession with history, conspiracy theories, and philosophy (a combination I certainly couldn't have come up with) then this is the game for you. And if not, well, how about an extremely tightly-written choose-your-own-adventure book, but written for adults that has breaks in the narration for you to excape death traps and locked rooms?\n\nI'm not quite as good about commenting on the visual novel aspect since I don't really PLAY visual novels, but, again, 17 hours in the first game alone in less than a week. I can safely say it's been a while since an actual novel was that engrossing for me.\n\nWhich isn't to mention the enhancements to both games from their originals, at least as far as I'm aware, since I never played the originals. Based on what I've read about them, this is definitely the definitive package with quality-of-life enhancements (a flowchart of choices and rooms for the first game, for instance), fixing of typographical errors, and the addition of full voice acting in both English and Japanese (prefer dubs over subs or vice versa? Who cares?! Both are here and both are actually pretty good).\n\nI'd have more to write, but I still have to play Virtue's Last Reward, which as far as I'm aware from most accounts is an even better sequel to an already amazing game. As said before, the first game by itself with these enhancements is worth the money, especially on sale, but stacking on top of THAT an even better sequel?

Quem conseguir passar pela porta de n\u00famero 9 estar\u00e1 livre.\n\nAo longo da noite, Junpei e os outros descobrir\u00e3o que eles foram escolhidos por um motivo para estar l\u00e1. Cabe ao jogador fazer as escolhas como Junpei e tentar sair vivo de l\u00e1. As escolhas levam a diversos finais, e achar o verdadeiro final depende de aprender com os erros das escolhas passadas. A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 recheada de momentos onde teorias cient\u00edficas s\u00e3o discutidas e fatos hist\u00f3ricos reais norteiam alguns momentos. O clima \u00e9 de suspense. Algumas revela\u00e7\u00f5es te surpreender\u00e3o, voc\u00ea se sentir\u00e1 compelido a entender o que se passa e provavemente vai se pegar refletindo sobre os acontecimentos durante algum tempo depois de conclu\u00ed-lo. Este \u00e9 um jogo que provavelmente figurar\u00e1 entre as melhores hist\u00f3rias que voc\u00ea j\u00e1 jogou.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 basicamente uma hist\u00f3ria que vai se desenrolando e voc\u00ea acompanha o ponto de vista de Junpei. Voc\u00ea tomar\u00e1 as decis\u00f5es por ele e resolver\u00e1 os quebra-cabe\u00e7as que est\u00e3o por tr\u00e1s de cada porta que seu grupo abre. E enquanto desvenda os quebra-cabe\u00e7as, l\u00ea os di\u00e1logos que as situa\u00e7\u00f5es trazem, se envolver\u00e1 com os personagens e se identificar\u00e1 com alguns deles.\n\nEste \u00e9 um port remasterizado de um jogo original do Nintendo DS. As m\u00fasicas e os efeitos sonoros colocam voc\u00ea no clima perfeito. As anima\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o simples, mas n\u00e3o prejudicam sua experi\u00eancia, que trata de voc\u00ea entrar na hist\u00f3ria e se envolver com a trama e os personagens. Recomendo que voc\u00ea jogue usando o audio japon\u00eas (detestei a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos atores em ingl\u00eas).\n\nEsse \u00e9 meu review de 999 - nine hours, nine persons, nine doors.\n\nVLR ainda n\u00e3o joguei.

Ce qui va faire la force du jeu ce sont les diff\u00e9rents choix et chemins  possibles qui vont former le sc\u00e9nario : il sera n\u00e9cessaire de faire TOUT les embrechements et choix possibles pour pouvoir comprendre l'histoire dans les moindres d\u00e9tails. Si vous vous contentez que d'un chemin vous n'allez pas comprendre certaines situtations n\u00e9cessitant d'avoir fait d'autres choix dans le pass\u00e9.\n\n Je vais \u00e9viter de trop parler du sc\u00e9nario qui est le point fort de ces deux jeux et surtout pour des VN. Mais celui ci est tout bonnement g\u00e9nial pour les deux jeux, la premi\u00e8re fois qu'on fait une des fins on se pose pleins de questions ce qui va nous \"forcer\" a faire les autres fins pour trouver des r\u00e9ponses et un conclusion a tout ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Il y a beaucoup d\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9lations innatendus avec un rythme bien soutenue et servi par une histoire haletante et des personnages charismatiques, un des meilleurs sc\u00e9nario que j'ai vu dans ce type de jeu.\n\nLe portage des deux jeux est assez bons, les deux jeux tournent a 60 fps sans gros soucis. On a le choix entre diverses r\u00e9solutions courantes et quelques options graphiques pour VLR.\nLes sprites de 999 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 revus pour s'adapter a nos r\u00e9solutions sur PC, celui ci \u00e9tant sur DS a la base, sa aurait pu etre mieux d\u00e9taill\u00e9s mais sa reste tr\u00e8s correct. Pour VLR, les contours des personnages sont soign\u00e9s et les textures revus a la hausse, par contre vu que c'est un portage d'un jeu 3DS les personnages manquent d'animations de de d\u00e9tails mais cela ne gache pas le plaisir du jeu. Par contre j'aurai aim\u00e9 qu'il garde les \"dessins en 2D\" comme dans 999, question de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n Par contre je trouve dommage que l'interface n'est pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mieux revus, on sent qu'on est sur un jeu DS avec certains onglets trop gros pour nos \u00e9crans mais passeraient bien sur du tactile et la r\u00e9solution de certains puzzles qui seraient plus pratiquent sur un \u00e9cran tactile. J'ai jouer a la majorit\u00e9 du jeu a la manette qui est plus agr\u00e9able pour le cot\u00e9 VN mais j'ai du passer a la souris sur certains puzzles ou je devaient d\u00e9placer des objets ou rentrer des chiffres/lettres, la sensibilit\u00e9 et la pr\u00e9cision de la manette n'aidant pas pour ces phaes la.\nOn notera que les deux jeux sont doubl\u00e9 de voix japonaises (surement en anglais aussi), ce qui est pas mal pour l'immerssion.\n\nA conseiller a tout les fans de VN ou a ceux qui cherchent un excellent sc\u00e9nario avec un gameplay simple bas\u00e9 sur des puzzles.A signaler que le jeu est int\u00e9gralement en anglais et demande un bon niveau pour tout comprendre.\n\nPoints positifs :\n\n-Deux jeux avec des sc\u00e9narios compl\u00e9tements dingues.\n-On est oblig\u00e9 de faire quasiment toutes les fins pour comprendre toute l'histoire.\n-Une liste de personnages attachants et ayant chacun une personalit\u00e9 bien diff\u00e9rente\n-Dans 999 les puzzles sont tr\u00e8s accessibles, ils sont un peu plus cors\u00e9s dans VLR mais ne gachent pas le sc\u00e9nario.\n-Possibilit\u00e9 de reprendre une sc\u00e8ne deja d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9 a tout moment, pratique si on veut voir les diff\u00e9rentes fins.

Zero Escapes: The Nonary Games packs up with two classic games from its series since 2009 on DS, and 2012 on 3DS. These two games are: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors (2009) and Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward (2012). \n\nAll Zero Escapes feature nine characters who are kidnapped by an unknown individual refer themselves as \"Zero\". They are forced to play a \"game\" which involve risk and danger. All the participants must do every means necessary to survive the game, even it means \"killing\" people. All the participants will have one thing in common, the bracelet. The bracelets serve as the mean to complete, and win the game. As well as the mean to execute the players, should they lose a game, or violent the rules.\n\n=====Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors=====\n\nNine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors is the first installment in the Zero Escape series. The game is played similar to visual novel adventure game with puzzle game to solve. The gameplay could be divided into two types: Novel and Escape. Novel is played exactly like the Visual Game. The player assumes the role of a man named Junpei, and progresses through the storyline and converses with other characters. During Novel sections, the player will sometimes be presented with decision options that affect the course of the game such as choosing which door to go with. The decisions made result in one of branching storylines in game, which player will end up with different ending.\n\nIn between Novel sections are Escape sections, which occur when the player finds themselves in a room from which they need to find the means of escape. These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player being able to move between different positions in each room. In order to escape, player will need to find various items and clues, then solving puzzles. At some points, the player may need to combine objects with each other to create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The non playable character who're teaming up with player will sometimes give a hints when player seems to struggle for too long.\n\nUnlike the DS version. The player has access to a flowchart that allows them to immediately revisit or \"jump\" to any previously completed Novel or Escape section without replaying the game from the beginning. This allows the player to transition to an earlier branching point in the story and choose a different option that causes the story to progress in another direction. The PC version now also include voice actors for a game.\n\nStory is excellent well written. Every details and lores in this Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors game are thoughtfully created to be related to Nonary game or a game of \"9\". The story also gives a sense of horror and gruesome, the fear of finding out the truth/secret behind each door. Although in between hopeless situation, there's relationship and encouragement from characters. This game is the most beautiful, amazing piece of narrative, every moments are memorable, either it's good or bad. On top of it, are the well composed original soundtracks that fit incredibly well within the situations in game.\n\nHowever due to terrible sale of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors in Japan. Because of many complaint about how cruel and gruesome the game was, Spike Chunsoft changed, and tweaked a theme of Zero Escape into new direction, the result was Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward. Including Distrust, the Danganronpa beta game, which was turned into the well known Danganronpa Series nowadays.\n\n=====Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward=====\n\nZero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward is the second installment in the Zero Escape series. It follows the storyline after the event of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. The player now assumes the role of a man named Sigma in this game. The game is played similar to visual novel adventure game with puzzle game to solve. The gameplay could be divided into two types: Novel and Escape, much similar to the first game. In Novel sections, the player advances through the storyline and converses with non-playable characters through visual novel segments. These sections require little interaction from the player other than reading the dialogue and text that appear on the screen. The player may be presented with decision options that affect the course of the game during the Novel section mode such as choosing which door to go with, and a decision option is a prisoner's dilemma-type choice where the player must choose to \"ally\" or \"betray\" the characters they are pitted against.\n\nIn between Novel sections are Escape sections, which occur when the player finds themselves in a room from which they need to find the means of escape. These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player being able to change angle, and investigate in each room. In order to escape, player will need to find various items and clues, then solving puzzles. At some points, the player may need to combine objects with each other to create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The player receives hints to the puzzle solutions from the game's characters, a more direct hints are received if the player changes the puzzle's difficulty level from \"hard\" to \"easy\".\n\nThe flowchart in this game is much bigger than the first game. The player has access to a flowchart that allows them to immediately revisit or \"jump\" to any previously completed Novel or Escape section without replaying the game from the beginning. This allows the player to transition to an earlier branching point in the story and choose a different option that causes the story to progress in another direction.\n\nStory is excellent well written, and even more big \"twist\" than the first game. The story still gives a sense of horror and gruesome events but not to extent of the first game due to the complaint survey they did in japan. There're more light-headed moment, and a more happy situation in this game, as a characters in game seem to easily adapt into situation unlike the first game. But they don't forget to include the sorrow moment that could easily rival the first game. The story is more well balanced this time. The game also has some of old reuse original soundtracks from the first game, including the large number of new ones. They're all memorable, and they fit the entire theme of Zero Escapes game, including puzzle rooms and an events after them. They manage to keep people excited throughout the whole game with perfect balance in story depiction. Some particular event is simply amazing piece of narrative.\n\nIn conclusion. Zero Escapes series is very good game. The PC ports are also very well done. With keyboard/mouse support, they also don't forget to include the controller support for preference choice.\n\nSince Spike Chunsoft has finally added the first two games into steam, including the third game, Zero Time Dilemma, you better start the series now or miss the entirely masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1493571010, "timestamp_updated": 1496346020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698508", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31458167": {"recommendationid": "31458167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272174636", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499679137}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ee5\u524d\u73a9\u8fc7\uff0c\u65b0\u7248\u8212\u670d\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u9c9c\u660e\u4e86\uff0c\u800c\u4e14cv\u4e5f\u5f88\u8c6a\u534e\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u82f1\u914d\u6ca1\u6709\u65e5\u914d\u5f97\u597d\uff0c\u7b80\u76f4\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u51fa235\u4e09\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u3002\u6e38\u620f \u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u80fd\u81ea\u5706\u5176\u8bf4\uff0c\u89e3\u5bc6\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4f46\u592a\u96be\u5c31\u6ca1\u5fc5\u8981\u4e86\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf\u5267\u60c5\u4e3a\u91cd\u3002\n\u5973\u4e3b\u5f88\u8ff7\uff0c\u73a9\u52303\u4ee3\u90fd\u8fd9\u4e48\u89c9\u5f97\uff0c\u5fc3\u75bc\u7537\u4e3b\uff0c\u6211\u6000\u7591\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u4ec7\uff0c\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e8b\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e00\u8d77\u9762\u5bf9\u554a\uff0c\u8bf4\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u4ed6\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6839\u672c\u770b\u4e0d\u5230\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\n\u82f1\u8bed\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b80\u5355...\u8bb2\u7684\u8fd8\u633a\u901a\u900f\u7684\uff0c\u8d70\u5728\u8def\u4e0a\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u8ddf\u4f60\u8bb2\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u75af\u72c2\u4e3e\u5217\u5b50\uff0c\u751f\u6015\u4f60\u4e0d\u7406\u89e3\u3002\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u8fbe\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u53ef\u7231\n", "timestamp_created": 1493539963, "timestamp_updated": 1493539963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31455888": {"recommendationid": "31455888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111932813", "num_games_owned": 1315, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 2861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492268259}, "language": "french", "review": "[h1]Au panth\u00e9on du jeu d'aventure japonais... et du jeu d'aventure tout court![/h1]\n\n[i]/i\\ R\u00e9sum\u00e9/Points n\u00e9gatifs-positifs en bas![/i]\n\nCette compilation est un remake PC de 2 jeux DS \u00e0 l'origine, qui font partis de la [b]trilogie dite \"Zero Escape\"[/b] ou \"The Nonary Games\".

Tout ce dont il se souvient, c'est d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9 chez lui par un \u00e9trange individu avec un masque.\nRapidement, Jumpei va d\u00e9couvrir le nom du cerveau derri\u00e8re cette op\u00e9ration, un psychopathe du nom de \"Z\u00e9ro\" et rapidement, il va d\u00e9couvrir que:\n-8 autre personnes sont dans la m\u00eame situation(9 personnes)\n-que tous ont un bracelet autour du poignet chacun num\u00e9rot\u00e9s de 1 \u00e0 9\n\nC'est l\u00e0 que le jeu de la mort cr\u00e9er par Z\u00e9ro va se d\u00e9voiler: les 9 victimes vont devoir coop\u00e9rer pour sortir de ce labyrinthe.\nIl y a deux moyens de se d\u00e9barrasser de leur bracelet:\n-trouver la porte num\u00e9ro 9\n-ou mourir\nSi il y a une porte num\u00e9ro 9, il y a donc des portes num\u00e9rot\u00e9es de 1 \u00e0 8(9 portes) et leur m\u00e9canisme d'ouverture est aussi tordu que machiav\u00e9lique: chaque porte s'ouvre avec au moins 3 personnes/bracelet sous peu que leur racine num\u00e9rique corresponde au num\u00e9ro de la porte.\n\nExplications: les bracelets 1,8 et 3 ont une racine num\u00e9rique de \n1 + 8 + 3 = 12 => 12 = 1 + 2 = 3...\nDonc cette combinaison ouvre la porte 3.\n\nSi par malheur la combinaison est fausse ou si moins de 3 personnes franchissent une porte, et bien les gens vont d\u00e9couvrir qu'ils vont tout simplement explos\u00e9s!\nOui y a une petite bombe \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de chacun, \u00e7a rajoute un peu de piment au tout...\n\nHa oui!

Although I've had a decent amount of exposure to Japanese VN prior to this, this is my first time playing this particular series, of which I've heard so much about.\n\nAs far as mechanics go, this port does improve a lot of features from its DS version (as seen from youtube videos), but there are other features that leaves more improvements to be desired. Overall though, it is very playable, and notably the map movement system saves players a lot of time and enables us to skip over already played parts quickly.\n\nI bought this game with a fairly low expectation. Two hours in I was expecting only a series of \"escape room\" scenarios like those popular online flash games, connected loosely by a story and the characters. Honestly I would be fine with that, except it ended up being a lot more than that. \n\n[MINOR SPOILERS]\n\nYou know what, Koutarou has done it again. It may be just that I am \"dumb\" when it comes to playing these games, but I'd rather believe otherwise. Even if the big plot twist bomb unfolded in the same way, I was still deeply shocked. He has done it again, what a genius.\n\n/////\n\nVLR is okay on its own but has issues.

The game is not graphically demanding but I suggest having high sound quality because the game will take advantage of that as the game sounds amazing. \n2  the story of this game is amazing, this game is not one that you want to have spoiled for you and fortunately the story is quite complex so it is difficult to spoil entirely. This game truly pushes the limits of what video game stories can do and yes choices do matter in this game. \n3 the soundtrack, the sound effects, the voice acting in many languages and the music direction in this game is amazing.

The music can truly scare you at times make you feel anger sadness and many other emotions. \n4 the gameplay is an escape the room puzzle game but at the same time a adventure visual novel. You will make multiple choices that matter then you will be stuck in a room and you must solve difficult puzzles to escape. If you do not like puzzles or you find them too hard VLR has a easy setting and hard setting for the puzzles while 999 does not. The puzzles are very difficult and I do not suggest solving them unless you have an education in various things.\n5 a few mechanics are a bit of a bother such as the flow chart, redoing the puzzles and a few unskippable cutscenes and once you finish all the routes in the game and once you finish with the story there is little replay value but you do get many hours worth of content for two games. \nTo Conclude VLR is the best in the Nonary games series and for that game alone it is well worth 50$ but you also get 999 VLR remastered and you can get a soundtrack for that much. That is well worth the price. I would only suggest not getting the game if you hate games with more story than gameplay, you don't like puzzle games and your not interesting in something new. I would suggest this game to someone looking for a brand new video game, someone who cares about story, and someone who just wants an amazing soundtrack.   \nDo I recommend you get this game? Yes absolutely VLR alone is one of my favorite games.", "timestamp_created": 1492227560, "timestamp_updated": 1492227560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494485", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31144656": {"recommendationid": "31144656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092231043", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508025760}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game, It has a really interesting story with really great plot twists.

At this point, I have completed 999 to its fullest and I can say I was extremely sastified with it. Now, on to the review.\n\n999 REVIEW: In this game, you play as Junpei, a man who wakes up on a ship with 8 other people and together they discover they are going to be playing a terrible game. A mysterious person named Zero is forcing them to get through 9 doors within 9 hours. If they don't, the ship will sink and they will die. There are more complications but it's best if you learn how the \"game\" for the characters works. A major things I enjoyed about this game were the puzzles and the mystery. To learn more about the mysterious things going on, you had to get through the puzzles in the rooms you search. The puzzles are fairly easy, some of them make you really think on how to do them and some are quite difficult. Another thing about the game is that to experience it at its fullest, you have to play through it repeatively to get through different endings and to learn different storylines. Thankfully, there is a flowchart in-game so you can move through the scenes you've already played and there's a text-skip option as well.\nI found this game very rewarding and very addictive. I kept playing the week I bought it and I now have almost 24 hours worth of gameplay. And I haven't even started the second game yet. I can't wait to see how VLR connects to 999.\nIf anything, I thought the save function was a little confusing. At one point, I had accidentally started over, which deleted all of my data and my flow chart was resetted so I had to start over. So that part sucked. I also felt like the ending to 999 was a bit vague in some details and I wish they would have elaberated a bit.\nOther than that, I quite enjoyed this game and definitely think it goes to my top list of my favorite Visual Novel/Story-Rich games.\n\nVIRTUE'S LAST REWARD REVIEW (note: I won't go too into depth of the game's mechanics as it's quite similar to the mechanics of 999): In this game - which is the sequel to 999 - you play as Sigma, a man that wakes up in a creepy warehouse type building. Instead of being alone, he is in a room with a woman he doesn't know. They soon find out that they aren't alone, and they're forced to play a game. Similar to 999, it's still the \"Nonary Game\" (a game of the number 9) as they need to escape through the number 9 door. But this is a bit different, as they will have to betray each other to escape. I won't spoil the how as it's fun to learn as you play.\nWhen I first started playing VLR, I wasn't sure if I would like it because of the noticible differences between it and 999. VLR has 3-D modeled characters which looked kinda creepy at first sight, and the character you play as (Sigma) doesn't have voice-over. He is the only character that lacks voice acting, which was disappointing.\nBut as I played, I began to like it a lot - possibly just as much or even more than 999. I started to connect with the characters quickly, and the story was intriguing to me. Also I can't help but love the voice of Zero Jr, a AI rabbit that speaks to the characters and tells them their tasks. All of these elements makes this an excellent sequel to the original game I loved.\nWhile I haven't finished all of the possible routes in VLR, I can say that this game is an incredible experience and a sastifying mystery, and I can't wait to finish all the routes and learn more of the mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1492208124, "timestamp_updated": 1499015658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31127706": {"recommendationid": "31127706", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963513013", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501110434}, "language": "english", "review": "I hate reading, but the story is sooooooooo engadging and amazing, I've stayed up late at night just to find out more and more.

Characters are a major strength. The voice acting ranges from good to fantastic and the art is pretty good for this type of game. The puzzles are decent, but not that great.\n\nVLR tones down some of the tension and takes a bit longer to develop, but manages to tell a grand tale that encompasses so many elements it's unbeliavable how well it all comes together.

Both games are quite old and one of them was released in 2009 which makes it ancient by modern standards. So it is a remake, and in case of 999 it is actually a remake of a remake which fixed a lot of stuff compared to the DS.\n\nI was never a fan of VN genre and my attempts to play some of the games that are considered as 'the best' (like Saya no uta or Ever 17) never succeeded mostly due to how fucling mindbogglingly BORING the whole process was. In case of Ever 17, as I recall, in first 10 hours game did not even manage to introduce all of the characters. What is this I don't even.\n\nNow I know the games are amazing and you spend sleepless nights playing them, yada yada, nobody fucling cares, this is review from VN hater for VN haters who are wondering if the game would be right for them. Well, yes and no.\n\n--- 999 ---\n\nI used to play 999 on DS because everybody around me could not shut up how OH MY GOD FUCLING GREAT AND AMAZING this game was, and it was a mixed experience. As I understand it was one of the first developer attempts into VN.\n\n999 is a part VN, part adventure game. VN part is not very long, it has maybe 2 or 3 forks and three endings. Every ending would take you about a hour, maybe two. I love how short it is. A proper VN should never be more than 10 hours long, top. \n\nWhat is really good is that it has so called \"Adventure Mode\" that cuts all of the useless SHIT. Adventure mode is a blast. Some fanboys would scream that you should not play this mode because it does not have a proper CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT and STORY DETAILS, and you know what, I played original 999 and I can certainly say that absolutely zero value was lost.\n\nAs for the character development and story, well it certainly can impress you if you, well, have never watched a single movie or read a book, I dunno. The only good thing I can say about the story is that it does not suck. I guess the bar was really set low if this achievement can really impress anyone.\n\nSome of the complains I have are mostly related to pacing, I don't like how puzzle sequences go after one another, I would prefer them to be splited by story sequence. Also all bad endings are waaay rushed. You barely started to follow story and BAM you are dead, game over.\n\n--- VLR ---\n\nJust when the things are starting to look good, VLR comes.\nI hate every second of VLR. First of all, it is way to long. 30 hour is an overkill. Especially given that the game has like 20 minute of actual content and the rest is filled with usual VN fillers and shit. You can literally cut off 99% of the game and it would be THE SAME FUCLING STORY.\n\nThe puzzles are really bad compared to 999. They are so boring and unimaginative that at some point I just gave up and went to gamefaqs only to not waste my time on 100500th number puzzle. The characters were a joke. There were maybe a couple of barely developed characters and the rest of the cast was a cardboard fest. The funniest part is that two of 999 characters were completely OOC, especially Clover.  I found that characters that had the least info and dialog actually turned to be the most interesting just because authors have no clue how to write a proper character background.\n\nWriting was awful. If you want a good writing go play Planescape Tornment. VLR writing felt like a bad Sonic fanfic written by 7 y old.\n\nApparently this game has a sequel called ZTD that is generally considered to be worse than VLR. Seriously. Worse.\nVLR was so bad that I refunded ZTD just to avoid 30 more hours of this holocaust of wasted time.\n\nSo, no, this is not a good game to introduce you to the VN genre. This is not a good game, well 999 kinda is, but I don't think bundled VLR will  justify the purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1492067378, "timestamp_updated": 1492068220, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.114503", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31092363": {"recommendationid": "31092363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006642638", "num_games_owned": 681, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 2840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492879821}, "language": "english", "review": "These games changed my mind", "timestamp_created": 1491981130, "timestamp_updated": 1492511871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491483", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31084156": {"recommendationid": "31084156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098225480", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2148, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490716303}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u6253\u8d8a\u8001\u8d3c\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u6765\u8bd5\u8bd5\n\u63a5\u89e6\u8fc7\u6253\u8d8a\u8001\u8d3c\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u8bf7\u5fd8\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\u518d\u6765\u8bd5\u8bd5\n[spoiler]\u67d0\u6210\u540d\u4f5c\u7684\u65e2\u89c6\u611f\u592a\u4e25\u91cd[/spoiler]\n\n[strike]\u522b\u53bb\u73a9\u96f6\u65f6\u56f0\u5883[/strike]", "timestamp_created": 1491938197, "timestamp_updated": 1491938197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31073968": {"recommendationid": "31073968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054465697", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494749516}, "language": "english", "review": "You should play this game if you want...\n...A choose-your-own-adventure mystery visual novel\n...An exceptionally well-architected game where every little thing has HUGE significance in the overarching story\n...Escape the room puzzles\n...A game that is relaxing and thought-provoking, and doesn't require a lot of mechanical skill\n\nYou should NOT play this game if you want...\n...Something fast-paced (it's pretty easy to get hung up on the puzzles; I used a guide a few times)\n...Something innocent (there are some pretty hardcore innuendos, and mild gore)\n\nAs of now, I've played about 80% of the way through 999, which is one of the two games in this bundle.

The game entertains in two ways. The first is puzzle solving, and the second is mystery. Solving puzzles give you little hints that slowly start to add up. However you cannot solve the mystery in the game with a single playthrough. The game has a total of 6 endings, and each are important to see if you want to get a full idea of what is really going on.\n\nAll that said though, if you are not a fan of visual novels with some puzzle solving and mystery inbetween, then you will probably not like these games.\n\nREVIEW OF VIRTUE'S LAST REWARD\n________________________\n\nAn amazing continuation of the original games story. I've been a hardcore gamer for as long as I can remember, and can say with confidence that these games are the best I have ever played. Even for visual novels, very few games go into the level of depth and mystery that this series offers. \n\nVLR takes everything from the first game and improves upon it. It does however, have one problem. Unlike 999, which is in 2D, VLR is in 3D. And since the game was originally meant for the DS... it's 3D is ugly and off putting, at least at first.

And yet, each puzzle was contained to the room you found it, so you always knew the answer was right around the corner. The flow chart added to 999 fixes the biggest problem with the original game which was having to replay it from the beginning. VLR looks great and plays great and has the same story as before. All around a fantastic package with great puzzles and a great story.

it at all. It is absolutely worth the full price.\n\nI had already previously played 999 on the DS before, but replaying it was great. They added a new voice acting that's actually good and the timeline feature present in the two sequels which makes it a lot easier to see all the endings. There was quite a bit of content I had not realized I skipped over in my original playthrough. My one complaint is the \"novel\" and \"adventure\" modes. The novel mode is all the dialogue and narration in text form that covers up the character's faces. It's not pretty. The adventure mode is better laid out with the text box at the bottom, but then you miss out on the excellent narration and inner dialogue of the main character. For that reason alone, I recommend playing through with the ugly novel mode. It's still an excellent game regardless.\n\nAs for Virtue's Last Reward, I had actually never played it before. I don't own a 3DS or Vita so I couldn't get my hands on it. For this reason, I skipped over it and played Zero Time Dilemma, the third in the series, when it released on PC. Unfortunately for me, that spoiled a lot of major plot points in VLR. However, I'm about 23 hours into VLR and still not nearly finished. It has left a great impression on me so far and I can definitely see now why most fans claim it to be the best in the series and why VLR felt a little lackluster in comparison. Personally, I prefer ZTD's presentation more despite its stiff animation simply because it doesn't use the typical visual novel layout with characters overlaid in front of a background and went more with a Telltale-style presentation. VLR definitely has a better story though and is a much longer game. The puzzles are very mind-bending, almost as much as the story itself. If you like escape the room games, you'll love the gameplay that is present in the entire series.\n\nDon't let the visual novel presentation stop you from enjoying one of the best sci-fi stories ever written. This isn't a cringey dating sim like you see flooding the Steam marketplace. This is an extremely engaging story from start to finish that will always leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more.", "timestamp_created": 1491114858, "timestamp_updated": 1491114858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30892697": {"recommendationid": "30892697", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993276341", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491079337}, "language": "english", "review": "This is actually two games: 999 and Virtue's Last Reward.

Fans and newcomers alike are finally able to experience this masterful hybrid of VN and room escape gameplay, freed from the limitations of their handheld platforms. Keep in mind that I've played both games on their home consoles and once again fully via the steam release. I'll review them separately. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=894938732&fileuploadsuccess=1\n\n[h1]Find a way out![/h1]\n9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors is the debut title in the Zero Escape series. Among the most gripping, suspenseful titles I've ever experienced, I refused to put this game down until I finished it.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe most common facet between both games are the basic elements. You have a branching storyline that plays out like a VN, staggered by occasional Room Escape puzzles. These are point-and-click adventure games restricted to one or a couple rooms. As a service for the players, this PC re-release has granted us the ability to jump to anywhere in the story's timeline. \n\n[u]IMPORTANT:[/u] The game omits more than half of the story by default. Click the top right of the screen to switch from Adventure mode to Novel mode. Here's an example. In Adventure Mode there's a scene where the protagonist says nothing. In Novel Mode, it becomes this much more vivid scene: \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=892548424\n\nIt likes to switch back to adventure mode after every room escape segment, so be sure to switch it back to novel. \n\n[b]Visual[/b]\nThe game runs at a solid 1080p. Some assets and models are noticeably better looking than I remember, but there are still plenty of low resolution, blurry textures sprinkled throughout. This game did debut in 2009 so I'm quick to forgive any slight visual hiccups.\n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nThe musical score flawlessly compliments the mood, and there's even one track I downloaded and threw in my playlist. Whether the game is trying to convey gut-wrenching suspense, mind-crushing introspection, or simply a bad case of sadness, the ost accommodates the mood perfectly.\n\nAs an added bonus, this game features an English dub that was absent from the original. After having listened to every line I can comfortably recommend you turn off the English voice acting or just mute the voices entirely. While several voices are spot on, there are others that miss the mark so egregiously that it takes away from the whole performance. \n\n[b]Plot[/b]\nThe plot takes center stage here, as this game is already mostly VN. The topics are amazingly broad, but efficiently tied in to match the story. Philosphy, ethics, theoretical physics, thought experiments and more are crammed into a storyline that's already brimming with suspicion, betrayal, and imminent death looming above you. Don't accidentally spoil it for yourself by reading any plot summaries. \n\n[b]Spectacle[/b]\nThe game doesn't waste five minutes before it grabs you by the ankles and dunks you screaming into the sheer abyss of thrilling suspense. \n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nThe room escape segments are the perfect level of difficulty. The solutions are neither obvious nor painfully obscure. You have everything you need to solve your problems in front of you. \n\n[b]Four out of Five Stars[/b]\nUsually I use the entire chair when I'm sitting down to read anything. I only needed the edge for this one. \n\n--------------------------\n\n[h1]Welcome to my Kingdom![/h1]\n999 recieved more positive response in the West than in the game's home country of Japan. The writer was browbeaten into softening the storyline into making it less suspenseful. In every other facet though this game brilliantly outshines its predecessor \n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nVery little change from the first game. There's more branching paths, a larger number of harder rooms to escape from, and even an easter egg in each room to find if you're feeling clever. \n\n[b]Visual[/b]\nBlowing the game up to a full 1080p reveals a lot of shortcomings that were masked on the original console's smaller screen sizes. I'll forgive the non-existant lip-sync, the painfully limited reactions each character model takes, and the occasional blurry wall texture the camera zooms in on since these are all relics of the original game. \n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nNot only did they develop an entirely new batch of songs, but they even pay homage to the most powerful title in the previous game. Also the voice acting in this game is vastly superior to the new dub created for 999. I kept it on and enjoyed it! \n\n[b]Plot[/b]\nIf you thought the last game had a bunch of crazy twists and emotions that couldn't be topped, prepare to be surprised. Avoid reading about the plot from anyone at all costs. Just shut yourself off from reality and the internet while you play it. The reveals and payoffs are magnificently executed. \n\n[b]Spectacle[/b]\nThis game harbors much less of the gritty darkness that gave the earlier game such a foreboding atmosphere. The developers wanted to appeal to the Japanese market but inadvertently alienated the Westerners who so dearly loved the first game. The man who chases two rabbits catches neither. \n\n[b]Difficulty[/b]\nA step above the challenge in the first game. Escaping the room isn't so hard as finding the Easter eggs, and if you're like me you just have to find all of them. A couple challenges teeter on the borderline of being absurdly hard though so don't fret over using a guide once or twice.\n\n[b]Four and a half out of five stars[/b]\nIf you're fretting over the price, just take this perspective. There's easily over 40 hours of content spread between these two games. Well worth it, especially if you haven't tried them before.", "timestamp_created": 1490924004, "timestamp_updated": 1490924004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661192", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30839589": {"recommendationid": "30839589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062332511", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490898990}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just an incrdible game and one of the best visual novels avaliable", "timestamp_created": 1490901956, "timestamp_updated": 1490901956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30836361": {"recommendationid": "30836361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000582697", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1932, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503053445}, "language": "italian", "review": "Premetto che \u00e8 il mio videogioco preferito sin dal 2012 (e probabilmente potrei dire che \u00e8 anche il mio romanzo preferito).

Be', che dire, ottima l'aggiunta del doppiaggio (le voci giapponesi sono buone, per alcuni personaggi mi sarei aspettato timbri un po' diversi ma la qualit\u00e0 va benissimo). Vedere le schermate a questa risoluzione \u00e8 una gioia per gli occhi, l'aggiunta della flowchart anche in 999 ci voleva.\n\nC'\u00e8 stato un cambiamento rispetto all'originale che francamente non ho capito e che mi ha fatto abbastanza storcere il naso. Si tratta del [spoiler]puzzle finale. Non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 un Sudoku, che ci stava perfettamente nel contesto, ma di una roba strana e insipida che non ha a che fare col numero 9 e non \u00e8 neanche interessante di per s\u00e9, per cui proprio non capisco.[/spoiler].\n\nPer tutta la durata del primo non ho sperimentato crash o altri problemi.

Ci sono una serie di temi lungo i tre capitoli, ben sviluppati, che possono catturare l'attenzione. Purtroppo a seconda della sensibilit\u00e0 di ciascuno potrebbero essere considerati spoiler, perch\u00e9 il fatto stesso che siano temi rilevanti \u00e8 una scoperta che viene fatta in gioco e che sorprende e cambia le carte in tavola. Per chi non avesse problemi a riguardo, provo a scriverne alcuni, a \"basso\" e poi ad \"alto\" livello di spoiler, secondo la mia sensibilit\u00e0 personale. Leggete a vostro rischio e pericolo. Mescolo indifferentemente i tre capitoli della saga.\n\nTEMI A BASSO CONTENUTO DI SPOILER:\n\n[spoiler]Paradosso di Teseo, parapsicologia, teorie sul rapporto corpo-mente, dilemma del prigioniero, problema di monty hall, paradosso della bella addormentata, teoria dei giochi, intelligenza artificiale, leggi della robotica di Asimov.[/spoiler]\n\nTEMI AD ALTO CONTENUTO DI SPOILER:\n\n[spoiler]Interpretazione a molti mondi e di Copenhagen della meccanica quantistica, gatto di Schroedinger, paradossi temporali, teoria dei campi morfogenetici.[/spoiler]\n\nComplessivamente il primo capitolo (999) \u00e8 pi\u00f9 breve e compatto. Ha 6 finali e volendo non ha bisogno dei seguiti, si pu\u00f2 considerare una storia che si chiude l\u00ec, in cui ogni elemento \u00e8 sapientemente incastrato senza sbavature per raccontare una vicenda parecchio intrigante. Rigiocandolo mi sono reso conto di una serie di dettagli per cui il lavoro che c'\u00e8 dietro per far combaciare una notevole serie di dettagli matematici (relativamente al numero di ciascun braccialetto dei personaggi) \u00e8 impressionante. \u00c8 tutto al suo posto, ogni \"ingranaggio\" contribuisce al disegno generale.\n\nIl secondo capitolo (Virtue's Last Reward) \u00e8 pi\u00f9 lungo, ha 24 finali anche se molti di questi sono dei semplici bad ending senza particolari risvolti di trama. Qui la qualit\u00e0 della colonna sonora e del doppiaggio secondo me schizzano alle stelle, oltre ad esserci molte scene toccanti (e a tutt'oggi ogni volta che ascolto il brano \"Blue Bird Lamentation\" mi viene la pelle d'oca). Col 3D dei poveri anzich\u00e9 il 2D invece credo si sia fatto un passo indietro, non c'era bisogno di cambiare se doveva essere fatto cos\u00ec. Se vi piace la teoria dei giochi vi far\u00e0 impazzire, credo sia l'unico esempio nel panorama videoludico a implementare il dilemma del prigioniero nel gameplay stesso e in modo cos\u00ec coinvolgente. La storia \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 cervellotica e contorta rispetto al primo capitolo, e anche alla fine quando tutto viene svelato si deve fare un certo sforzo mentale per seguire i passaggi (comunque ineccepibili).\n\nIl terzo capitolo (Zero Time Dilemma) non \u00e8 incluso in questo pacchetto. Ci tenevo a citarlo giusto per dire che credo perda un po' rispetto ai primi due, oltre ad avere un colpo di scena cos\u00ec grottesco e sbagliato da diventare quasi geniale. Comunque rimane una buona chiusura della trilogia, pur lasciando pi\u00f9 questioni aperte di quante ne chiuda introduce altri temi cervellotici fighissimi uno dietro l'altro.\n\nSu su giocateci :)", "timestamp_created": 1490891293, "timestamp_updated": 1490953069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530516", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30835458": {"recommendationid": "30835458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060946700", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491404788}, "language": "english", "review": "haha math is fun", "timestamp_created": 1490888244, "timestamp_updated": 1490888244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30833838": {"recommendationid": "30833838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061752754", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512275723}, "language": "english", "review": "Phenomenal game.

These are puzzle games, story drive, so more likenovel/puzzle games, and they give you many tools to make the experience better. For example, all endings and story paths are presented in the \"flow\" screen, so you can have an idea of how much you want to play, or in case you missed something you didn't know you missed, you will be able to notice. I recommned you go over the internet after finshing all endings, because like in any other novel, there is a LOT of content hidden, and I don't think anyone can find that content other than having luck. \n\nOverall, I recommend it very much, especially to those who played the danganronpa ports, and for you who did, I can say I was not impressed by this port, because Spike Chunsoft did an impressive job already in the dangan games, and their skills reflect in here.\n\nOne thing: I heavily recommend everyone that plays the game to save after a laaarge event or puzzle, because the only flaw to be found in this port, is that it crashes once in a while, and I mean a long while. For me it crashed twice during the 999 playthrough (around 20 hours). I still don't know where the crashed come from, but it was very annoying when I forgot about the crashes towards the end, and had to redo something. Thankfully, the game has a nice feature that I will mention here since it's kind of relatedto the topic, I am talking about the all skill feature. All skip is in the options menu in the start screen, and when the game crashed for the second time, it wasn't too bad to wait (I had a loooot to wait for because I didn't save, like two puzzle sections and a huge exposition event) because it skips all dialogue whether you have seen it or not.\n\nedit: omg just beat vlr so good omg", "timestamp_created": 1490865502, "timestamp_updated": 1492195810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30828699": {"recommendationid": "30828699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069566521", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490861222}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0430\u0437\u0437\u043b\u044b \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043a\u0438.\n\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442.\n\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438.\n\u0412\u0430\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u043a\u0430\u0439\u0444\u0443.", "timestamp_created": 1490861078, "timestamp_updated": 1490861078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.618308", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30827774": {"recommendationid": "30827774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000139087", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491372391}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would cry over sudoku again", "timestamp_created": 1490855999, "timestamp_updated": 1490855999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30824869": {"recommendationid": "30824869", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965855962", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491977466}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like Saw, but with a better story line.

"language": "english", "review": "(slight spoilers)\n\ni've followed this series for a long time and have played every adaption of this game thus far-- for DS, iOS, and now steam. in its original format, this game was already a 10/10 in my book-- the storyline, characters, pacing, twists, and ending are near flawless! there's a lot i could say about that, but i'll leave it at that-- those aspects remain the same in steam. this story is riveting and told perfectly.\n\nthe steam adaption is another story. it was very good in most regards-- the voice actors were chosen appropriately, performed well, and some of the voice actors that fell flat in the sequel games fared much better in 999. most of the game translates very well to this format.\n\nhowever... the adventure/novel mode isn't a perfect adaption of the twist from the DS version, and can be rather clunky at times. you often have to choose between seeing all of the screen and seeing all of the narration. most of the time, this isn't that big of an issue, but more of a nuisance. the flowchart is kind of confusing and attempting to use it properly led to me getting the same ending 7 times in a row despite trying to choose the correct doors. again, minor annoyance, but annoyance nonetheless.\n\nthe biggest failure is how the final puzzle is adapted, in my opinion-- it's confusing, not thematically appropriate, rather obscure, and it completely removes one of the most iconic parts of the original game. rather than sitting down for a pleasant, completely nerve-wracking game of sudoku, i pressed \"hint\" about twenty times without knowing what it was talking about until it basically gave me the answer-- one that was rather gimmicky, and relied more on that gimmick than on the puzzle rules it was attempting to explain. i then did the exact same thing on the next screen-- more frustrated guessing.\n\nthe puzzle is really the only huge drawback, and for new fans, it may not even be a bother. but it was pretty much the only major issue i had with an otherwise impressive steam adaption.", "timestamp_created": 1490831398, "timestamp_updated": 1490831398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny":

And I can confirm they are, the remastering, added voice acting and the improvements to the graphics and gameplay are all excellent.\n\nI recommend this game to you if you enjoyed Danganronpa, Ace Attorney, Steins;Gate or any other visual novel, as well as if you're a fan of complex intricate sci-fi mystery movies about supernatural phenomena or into trhillers about people being locked up and forced to play a game (Saw movies for example).\n\nOther than that I wholly recommend these games to two groups of people:\n1. People who enjoy adventure games with difficult puzzles and/or fans of room escape games (real or virtual) since the main gameplay portion of these games consists of a large variety of creative and engangingly complex room escape puzzles which piece by piece also reveal pieces of the narrative.\n2. Fans of dark science fiction mystery stories. Not only limitied to anime fans or to visual novel fans but everyone who can see themselves enjoying a celebral emotional and dark experience. The story is amazing in these games and since it makes up more than 50% of the time playing the game it better be. This is one of the most fascinating gamestories I have ever witnessed. \n\nBut if you are neither one of the two groups, I still would dare you to at least look into it a bit, since it can not be overstated how great these games are. They are hidden gems. \n\nThese games are much more than it seems on surface level. While playing you continuosly switch between novel sections and escape room section. While the novel sections consist of voice acted dialogue with the memorable cast and progresses the main chunk of the story the escape rooms are fully controlled by yourself wile you find clues and items and try to find the exit out of the room which mostly involves intricate puzzle solving and whole bunch of flexing your brain muscles. Sometimes you will find interesting information or items that relate to the main story during these escape room sessions.\n\nOne of the main appeals of the game is deciding where to go or what to do which will significantly impact your story. The game has multiple endings and in order to get the full story you need to try to get them all and sooner or later you will uncover the truth. Helping with this is the addition of a timeline-tree on which you can jump around between the different decisions, this was added in this remastered version for 999 (and has always been there for VLR). \n\nThis game will be one of the most engaging, emotional and suspenseful experiences you can hope for in a story, as you struggle together with the amazing other characters that are trapped alongside you and try to escape the nonary games.", "timestamp_created": 1490707316, "timestamp_updated": 1490707316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30790789": {"recommendationid": "30790789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167758862", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507895835}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know what else to say, this game is just great.", "timestamp_created": 1490699684, "timestamp_updated": 1490699684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30783588": {"recommendationid": "30783588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050600599", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2840, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494718631}, "language": "english", "review": "Morphogenetic field, huh?", "timestamp_created": 1490662880, "timestamp_updated": 1490662880, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30780989": {"recommendationid": "30780989", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973956113", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500161239}, "language": "english", "review": "Was ensnared in a death trap with two other people, and if we didn't escape soon we would die an awful death.\n\nSpent twenty minutes listening to an interesting story about the history of chemistry instead.\n\n10/10 would risk life for trivia again.", "timestamp_created": 1490651614, "timestamp_updated": 1490651614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30780594": {"recommendationid": "30780594", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972694609", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490556098}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, what can I say that has not been said yet?

[/h1] \n\nLacking as a portage, for 42\u20ac you'd expect nearly a remake. But the games are lenghty ( ~50h in total ) and these stories are ones of the best I have ever played, if not the best ( And trust me, I played a lot of games in my life, I got 253 other games in my steam library alone. ), so if you like great scenarios, it's worth the full price.\n\n[b]Cons[/b] :\n- VLR doesn't looks improved, you can see a lot of low-res texture in the environment.\n- Expensive, the games are becoming old. You'd expect more improvements for 42\u20ac, nearly a remake.\n\n[b]Pros[/b] :\n+ 999 and VLR on PC, finally !\n+++ Added voice acting for both 999 and VLR, which is a big thing, this stuff requires a looot of work. The quality of the acting may sounds inequal depending on the characters though.\n+ New interface for 999, improved sprites, a flowchart.\n+++ Greath Length ( 50h+ )\n+++++ AMAZING. STORY. It has everything, it's complex, well-written, has plottwists, is a thriller... \nThis is the point and quality of this game. \n\n--> [b]If you like excellent stories, jump on it. Otherwise, you should probably looks for something else than a Visual Novel.[/b] <--\n\n[h1]  Full review : [/h1] \n\nAs a portage, the game is lacking, while playing VLR, you really feel that it's a game imported from 3DS, blurry/low res textures, the environement may seems a bit empty ( but it fit the atmosphere though ), overall, it may even feel ugly. \nThe nice points are that both 999 and VLR are finally available on Steam, thay they both have English/Japanese voice acting, and 999 has several improvement on its interfaces and sprites. It's decent, but it definitively feels too expensive for 42\u20ac for games released 5 and 8 years ago, at this price, you would nearly expect a remake !\n\nBut, because there is a but, this is a blue review after all, and now that I finished VLR, I can say that this is was worth every cent.\nThe two games are visual novels. Expect a lot of text, a lot of reading, so, the games are quite lengthy. Took me 30 hours to finish VLR, and if I remember well 999 took around 20/25h. So, for this price, you get quite a lot of content.\nAnd then, the story, the fucking story. This is the only thing you should care about if you plan to buy it, because when get into the story, the graphics doesn't matter at all anymore.\nI played 999 on emulator quite a while ago, and waited for this portage to finally play VLR. Back then, 999 already blew my mind, because the scenario was so incredible, and excellent. The premise may looks like Saw for some ( People trapped in a weird place forced to play a sick game ), but it's not a horror game at all. See it as a tense thriller. I can't really talk much about the story, because I believe that the less you know about it, the more you enjoy it. \nVLR is the sequel of 999, so avoid as much as you can to play it before finishing 999, to avoid any spoiler. I just finished the game and in term of story-telling, it's a masterpiece. It tooks everything that 999 did, and pushed it a step further. The story is written in such way that you couldn't correctly tale it if it wasn't a video game ! They really did an amazing work.\n\nI'd like to tale you why this is so good, why you might like or not the scenario, but it would require me to spoil, so, if you like complex and well-written stories, thriller and plottwist, being mindblowed, amazing scenarios... Go for it.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention puzzles, there is a lot of puzzles in these games, some kind of Point'n'click escape room. It's nice, the difficulty is not too hard so don't worry about being stuck. I'm not really talking about it because there isn't much to say and I got only eyes for the story right now.", "timestamp_created": 1490521116, "timestamp_updated": 1491004069, "voted_up": true,

The Nonary Games. \n\nAksys and Spike have done a fine job getting these to us, in one of the best port-jobs I've ever seen. The critter with the biggest changes, of course, is 9 hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors. Not as much for Virtue's Last Reward, but there have been some updates there as well. \n\nFirst, 999: Gone is the split-screen interface that nearly no one paid attention to except for the last puzzle. 999 has been re-engineered for VLR's interface with 999's artwork, and it looks fantastic. More to the point, we now see little bits of animation here and there where it simply wasn't possible in the alloted space on the NDS cartridge. Same of the single save slot, which has been expanded by the Power of Proper Computers to 30, and the inclusion of voice acting during Novel sections. They also cleaned up the script to make it flow better, and so a solid re-entry all the way around. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm2LrwkpumQ\n\nThen, Virtue's Last Reward... What can I say here? Seeing Zero Jr. in all his rabbit-y glory on a screen that's not 5.5\" was a treat all by itself. The same 30 slots for saves, and again cleanup, some limited remodeling and re-animating of characters makes this port of the Vita edition a thing of great beauty. The controls didn't transfer as well, but that's what I get for being a mousey-keyboard semi-purist. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owUpakFpd7w\n\nFinally, some other bits before I go. Spike did us a solid bringing these games back in this fashion, so if you like the games, then show your support. They even added the much-needed timeline into 999, which I'm sure was no small feat. I'm  giving this a recommend, not because fanboy (although I am guilty as charged), but because Spike Chunsoft delivered on two games that would have been much cheaper consigned to the rubbish bin of video game history. \n\nIs it worth $45 US? I think so, but then I tend to go looking for games like this. If you're a hardcore CoD/Battlefield/Sports gamer, then this might not your cuppa tea. Your mileage may vary. \n\nWhat will come of this series after this? Likely nothing, as there are no more games planned. That said, I can maybe see where there might be space for some demented puzzle game down the \"good\" line traipsing away from Zero Time Dilemma...", "timestamp_created": 1490449719, "timestamp_updated": 1490484348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694892", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30725795": {"recommendationid": "30725795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256438001", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499130284}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u8fd9\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\uff08\u4e24\u6b3e\uff09\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0csteam\u7248\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u8db3\u8db3\u7b49\u4e86\u534a\u5e74\u4e86\n\n\u5173\u4e8e\u95ea\u9000\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u611f\u8c22\u7559\u8a00\u91cc\u8fd9\u4f4d\u53eb@\u5154\u5154\u90a3\u4e48\u53ef\u7231 \u7684\u670b\u53cb\uff01\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u76ee\u5f55\u91cc\u628aze1.exe\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3awin8\u517c\u5bb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u540e\u518d\u6ca1\u51fa\u73b0\u95ea\u9000\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u8fd8\u662f\u5e0c\u671b\u5b98\u65b9\u5c3d\u5feb\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\u5148\u7ed9\u4e2a\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u5f85\u6211\u901a\u5173\u540e\u518d\u8c08\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1490444693, "timestamp_updated": 1511396877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30724728": {"recommendationid": "30724728", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995424869", "num_games_owned": 325, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511468341}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Pek bi g\u00fczel oyun, DS vs 3DS'den sonra bilgisayarda daha bir harika.

Sprite and Artwork are all gorgeous and crisp although the only downside that i can find on pc version is it is not even a FULL HD remake on the background and some part of animation.\nI was a huge fan of the Nintendo DS title 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors, so I naturally picked this Zero Escape Trilogy(pc) when I was able to(for collection purpose). Virtue's Last Reward delivers more of the same escape the room-based gameplay that was so awesome in the previous installment, and definitely delivers on that part. However, I couldn't help but feel that the plot that was tied into these puzzles was weaker this time around. Perhaps it was the author's desire to create a trilogy out of the series that led to Virtue's Last Reward being a less impactful installment.\nWhile Virtue's Last Reward is an interesting, mind bending game that will keep you guessing until the very end, it suffers from issues with the setting and writing that make most of the game very slow paced. \nthe series still boasts one of the most engaging and well-written stories in visual novel genre and for and newcomers who didn\u2019t get a chance to play them on the 3DS or Vita would be remiss to pass it up now.\n\nVerdict: 4.5/5 \n[ 999 and Virtue\u2019s Last Reward aren\u2019t the most graphically impressive games around, but the series still boasts one of the most engaging and well-written stories.The Nonary Games does provide dual audio tracks though, so you could always swap to Japanese voices if you\u2019d like. The Flowchart could potentially spoil the experience by revealing the game\u2019s flow and how many possible outcomes you can get from a decision, especially for newcomers.\n\nThe Only problem i can found in this game is the choices mainly becomes an issue when you keep switching branches and are forced to play through nearly the same things over and over again.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed of Shinji Hosoe and consists of ambient electronic music. It does a good job of setting a tense scene, though there are no standout or truly memorable tracks.]\n\n(note:I have already play both game on new 3DS/DS so this review is just for reference purpose)", "timestamp_created": 1490435757, "timestamp_updated": 1490435853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776455", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30722584": {"recommendationid": "30722584", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970535484", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490511285}, "language": "english", "review": "Play 999 on an actual DS because this 'port' does not do it any justice, in fact it ruins what is one of the greatst uses of hardware for story telling in video games.

"english", "review": "This is a difficult review to write because I'm absolutely in love with these two games and have been ever since I first played them many years ago.\n\nThe problem is not that the games are bad, but that the ports are very shoddy, making the high asking price hard to justify. There has been very little polish put in here. The most notable addition, the new voice track in 999, has such terrible voice acting that you'll soon be searching for the option to mute it. The options themselves are oddly divided between a very primitive launcher and a game menu that is only accessible during the starting screen. \n\n999 has been somewhat rewritten to accommodate the lack of a 2nd screen, where you used to have a more traditional narrative taking place. It has been replaced by \"adventure mode\", where characters now speak their largely expositional thoughts out loud, giving way to clunky, unnatural dialogue (which is then made worse by the poor voice acting). There is a \"novel mode\" more closely resembling the VN format of the original, but the game likes to change between it and the adventure mode randomly, with seemingly no way to set it permanently on novel. Novel mode is also not a perfect carbon copy of the original, with much of the new clunky dialogue carrying over from adventure mode. The background CG has notably been reworked (or higher quality assets were retained) giving the game a nice visual facelift, but that is the only thing there is to gain here. They are still prerendered and the quality is less than native 1080p renderings, so it will not look good the higher you set your resolution.\n\nAs for VLR, while the dialogue and narrative stay very true to the original, this also applies to the visuals. Most of UI elements appear to be ripped directly from the 3DS game, with a mix of very low resolution pixelated menu items. Textures and animations remain completely untouched, and while this level of detail worked wonderfully on a 240p screen, at higher resolutions it resembles an N64 emulator being run at 4K. No one ever intended these assets to be viewed at such high resolutions, and much of the immersion is broken by having such a clear view of how simple everything is.\n\nIf you're a fan of the series, there is absolutely nothing to see here. You already have the definitive versions of the games to play somewhere else.\n\nIf on the other hand, you have yet to experience these games and just can't find a 3DS to borrow, then this is a low quality port of an unforgettable journey. Please don't miss it, but you might want to wait for a sale.

The updated graphics are nice and the keyboard and mouse controls are ok (the only thing I dont like about it is that when you hover over an option it is not recognized until you click on it, but is only a little nuisance and doesnt affect anything). The two reading modes are great, so you can select the format of visual novel you prefer, just to note that if you use ADV mode you miss some narrative texts, like descriptions of places and things like that, so consider it when deciding which one to use.\n\nAbout the game\n\nI have only played 999 on the DS and it is a great game. The story seems simple at first but gets very interesting quickly. The puzzles are fun and not frustating, and the voices added in the game seems to be pretty nice (only have heard the japanese dub, I cant talk about the english one)\n\nAbout the price\n\nThe price may seem excesive to some people, but if you take into account the new voice dub, the rework of the engine and that they are two games that together sum approximately 60 hours then its not a bad price. So consider picking it up, especially if you havent played them before because they are great.\n\nAbout the developer\n\nSpike Chunsoft is awesome and the port is pretty good as expected of them. I hope they bring more games to PC of this quality.\n\nAs far as I have played there have not been big bugs. The only thing I have encountered is that sometimes displaying inmediately(clicking) the text when a character is speaking makes them to stop, but I expect them to resolve it quickly because it doesnt seem to be nothing big.\n\n\nAs far as I have played: Totally recommended\n\nOn a side note, if you enjoy this game make sure to check Danganronpa because it is more or less the same style and its pretty good too.", "timestamp_created": 1490392569, "timestamp_updated": 1490398837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487636", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30713373": {"recommendationid": "30713373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002675684", "num_games_owned": 1157, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 2289, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492115736}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]First Impressions[/h1]\n\nA lot of people who review now will have played it on the handheld, so I thought it may be useful for someone who had not had any experience with the game give their initial impressions of the game.\n\n[h1]What I think after 2 hours?[/h1]\n\nIf I had to use a phrase it would be [b]\"Believe the hype\"[/b], I was told this was one of the best if not THE best VN there is and boy were they not wrong. After the short space of time I have had with the game I had high expectations, I was worried it wouldn't stand up alongside say Danganronpa or Steins;Gate. What struck me straight away was this is NOT just a VN, this is an old school point and click adventure game as well as a VN. The puzzles are challenging and were a welcome surprise to someone who knew nothing about the gameplay. The characters are interesting almost immediately and well introduced, a couple seem bland at the minute and typical VN trope characters but there is plenty of time for them to develop. There appears to be multiple routes to get to multiple endings, which is great, I love that I can see what route I am on currently and I'm sure that will develop into some form of gameplay mechanic as it is unusual to show you exactly the kind of path you are on. The voice acting is good without excelling, I'm sure I'll grow to love it but at the minute the protagonist is sort of \"meh\". A BIG surprise as well as the gameplay was the characters being animated during dialogues, I am SO used to the small movements or just the mouth movements, I loved it when the characters started moving.\n\nThe story seems like it is going to be stellar, lots of initial mysteries straight off the bat, decent pacing straight away. I'm hoping they can keep it up!\n\nOne crash in two hours, it did not like me alt + tab out of the game to go and browse the internet, so be mindful of that, no auto-save so I lost a bit of gameplay, but no biggie, plenty of games hate that and its as much an issue with my set up as the game.\n\n[h1]Future of this review[/h1]\n\nI'll edit this review when I've finished the game and give it a full proper run down, just thought I'd throw this up before the myriad of \"I love this game\" one liners got tossed up or the typical day 1 griefers who purposefully break the game and then decry the bugs they've found.", "timestamp_created": 1490391991, "timestamp_updated": 1490391991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 106, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893622", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30713208": {"recommendationid": "30713208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307042654", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499058678}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u50f9\u683c\u6709\u9ede\u8cb4\uff0c\u672c\u8457\u611b\u9084\u662f\u8cb7\u4e86\n\u76ee\u524d\u5f9e999\u7b2c\u4e00\u500b\u5834\u666f\u812b\u51fa\u4e86\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u4f86\u812b\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u6c92\u751a\u9ebc\u6539\u8b8a\nADV\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u589e\u52a0\u5c0d\u8a71\u9084\u6709\u5168\u8a9e\u97f3\uff0c\u4e0d\u904e\u812b\u51fa\u90e8\u5206\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6c92\u6709\n\u56db\u8449\u679c\u7136\u9084\u662f\u5f88\u53ef\u611b\n\n999\u65b0\u589e\u4e86\u548c\u5584\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e00\u6a23\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u7dda\u7cfb\u7d71\u9084\u6eff\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\n\n\u5584\u4eba\u6b7b\u4ea1\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u6709\u9ede\u9ebb\u7169\u3000\u800c\u4e14\u9ab0\u5b50\u8d85\u9b3c\u755c\n\u9664\u6b64\u4e4b\u5916\u90fd\u9084\u4e0d\u932f", "timestamp_created": 1490391322, "timestamp_updated": 1511502948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30712925": {"recommendationid": "30712925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198252398294", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1747, "last_played": 1514611285}, "language": "english", "review": "I've put hundreds of hours into the DS versions of these games.

But you can change to a custom resolution via the launcher.ini at\nMy Documents/My Games/Zero Escape The Nonary Games\n\n[*] Borderless Windowed Option\n\n[*] Simple graphic options menu, includes AA up to 16x and AF\n\n[*] Audio output seems bugged, my headset is the output, which is connected to a PCIe-Soundcard, deactivitating via Windows doesn't work. Workaround is to plug the speakers to the sound card, could be fixed in a patch as far as I can see\n\n[*] On my RX 480/i5 6600k Desktop 999 runs perfectly smooth and fine without dips. It was the same at first on my i5 2520M T420s, but for some reason it started to dip to 17 - 22 FPS within the second riddle. I turned off AA and AF and it's running without the severe frame tanking. Also, I can't see any difference in graphic fidelity with having those turned off. So I guess it's a must-have option to turn off AA and AF if you have a lower end system.\n\n[*] The UI does not scale at all as it seems, the Save Screen is huge and is convoluted, will update when getting further into the game\n\n[*] Menu options don't scroll with mouse wheel or with the movement of your mouse, only a click or using the arrow keys will change the highlighted menu button\n\n[*] There are keyboard shortcuts for the various interactions in the game, but are not rebindable. It's also completely playable only using the mouse so far.\n\n[*] It has only 30 save files, though that is more than enough for someone like me.\n\n[*] The game has native Steam Controller and Dualshock 4 support with the default profiles (thanks to Moskeeto)\n\n[*] 999 and VLR don't have a \"Close\"-button, but you can quit out of the game via Right Click in the Main Menu or via the B-Button on XBOX (or equivalent) controller\n\n[*] I forgot to note that both Virtues Last Reward and 999 have a options menu, where you can adjust seperate audio sliders like BGM, SFX and Voices. You also have a sensitivity choice for the cursor (if using a Gamepad is something you'd want to do), as well as a option to enable skip text and a choice between Japanese and English voices. I am using the Japanese voiceover and so far, besides the puzzle bits, it seems to be fully voiced with animations.\n\n[*] You can change between GamePad and Keyboard/Mouse on the fly, the only thing that the launcher option for the input device changes seems to be the shown input button ingame\n\n[*] Game speed seems to be tied to framerate, so thats unfortunate.\n\nIt seems alright besides the Audio issue.

The puzzles are nice - require some thinking, but everything is solvable without a walkthrough. The secrets within secrets are delectable, and while the game will explain everything if you finish, it's extremely satisfying to figure out plot points for yourself.

On top of that, I already played both titles (999 and VLR) on the DS with a friend, though that was years ago.\n\nGenerally speaking, I really enjoyed the game. I've always liked 'escape the room' type of games, and a good story, so it was  relatively easy to immerse myself into the game. I definitely found myself becoming attached to the characters and their stories, and there were definitely some moments that were just gut-wrenching.\n\nOut of the two, I would say 999 (the first of the series) was definitely my favourite. It was also much faster to complete. (I spent roughly 29.6 hours on 999, including times when I got up from the computer without closing the game). On the other hand, Virtue's Last Reward (VLR) had a much more detailed story imo and took significantly longer. (I ended somewhere around 40 hours or so).\n\nIf you're like me, and you work things out easier on paper, having a notebook nearby is very handy for this type of game. (I wrote a lot of notes....) But! I found that writing the puzzles down didn't detract from the gameplay, and made it easier to remember things! [spoiler]Especially when you needed to decode the message in the infirmary using the 25-digit key in VLR[/spoiler].\n\nBut enough about [i]how I played the game...[/i]\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n-The game is very engaging, and hardly becomes dull. The characters have interesting stories about \"facts\" or \"experiments\" that are truly fascinating, even if they're made up for the sake of the story. I mean, it is a visual novel after all, so it makes sense that it tells such an incredible story.\n-For the most part, all of the puzzles are different. There's always a different challenge behind each door that you choose, and it's just so interesting to work through them as well. \n-The characters feel more \"human\" than fictional - I swear. The characters in both 999 and VLR felt like they had so much more depth than most fictitious characters that you see nowadays. As I said earlier, it's too easy to grow attached to them.\n-The flowchart is a life-saver. I'm not to sure if this mechanic is popular in other visual novels, but not having to [i]restart the entire game in order to achieve a different ending[/i] is just something I appreciate so much. Without it, it probably would have taken me much, much, much longer to finish the game.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n-The control differences between 999 and VLR. (I was using a controller, for reference). They're not too major, honestly, and this might just be me nitpicking but it took me forever to get used to the differences in VLR. I found that the cursor moved much slower and that it wasn't as accurate. I often opted to use the mouse when inputting passwords, something that I didn't do in 999.\n-Some of the endings in 999 were complicated to achieve. Now, this is hardly an issue but there was a specific ending that I needed to complete and I just couldn't figure out how. It just wasn't obvious! So, I guess in short, there may be a lot of Googling with this game if you're like me and don't look at absolutely everything.\n-Honestly I found VLR far too long. It became a task closer to the end, trying to get essentially the \"true ending\" so to speak. [spoiler]Having to jump back and forth between several different timelines just to have the right information to clear the locks was honestly the most tedious thing about the game.[/spoiler]\n-My achievement for getting all the trophies didn't show up for over half an hour and honestly I'm still unjustly frustrated about that.\n\ntl;dr I highly recommend it to anyone who lieks visual novels, escape the room, or (hopefully) both!!!

Characters constantly repeat the same exact thing that your character said a few seconds earlier in 5 different ways like they don't expect the player to remember even the most basic details. It's so annoying and so frequent that I have to actually skip dialogue for some scenes. For example:\n\nYou: \"Wow, would you look at that stick over there!\"\nPerson 1: \"That stick over there sure is interesting\"\nPerson 2: \"There's a stick over there? Woah!\"\nYou: \"The directions say to throw the stick into the water and we'll summon a zombie shark.\"\nPerson 1: \"So what you're saying is, if we toss the stick over there into the water...\"\nPerson 2: \"A SHARK will show up!?\"\nYou: \"Let's do it!\"\nPerson 1: \"Alright!\"\nPerson 2: \"Ok!\"\n\nLike seriously, if I wanted to be treated like a mentally disabled toddler with the attention span of a fly I would watch sesame street or listen to some Snake dialogue from MGS3. What's almost as bad is when you figure out something plot related from an obvious clue, and then you have to wait an agonizing three scenes while your character thinks to himself like a mumbling idiot, using all of his peanut brain to figure out what he just saw. Currently the only thing that really bugs me about that game, but overall its a really great experience.", "timestamp_created": 1515712291, "timestamp_updated": 1515712291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39257866": {"recommendationid": "39257866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335518276", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1515067850}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u8bc4\u4ef7\u89e3\u8c1c\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u90fd\u662f\u89c6\u9891\u901a\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u89e3\u8c1c\u90e8\u5206\u90fd\u8df3\u8fc7\u3002\n\u5267\u672c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5178\u578b\u7684\u6253\u8d8a\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5403\u8fd9\u5957\u7684\u4eba\u4f1a\u5f88\u53d7\u7528\uff0c\u4e0d\u5403\u7684\u4eba\u89c9\u5f97\u5f88\u65e0\u804a\u3002\n1\u5176\u5b9e\u8f83\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u6211\u611f\u89c9\u672c\u6765\u6ca1\u60f3\u51fa2\uff0c3\u7684\uff0c2\uff0c3\u660e\u663e\u662f\u4e00\u4f53\n\u8bf4\u8bf4\u7f8e\u672f\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u6211\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u90a3\u79cd2D\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e8c\u4ee3\u8fd9\u4e2a3D\u5efa\u6a21\u7b80\u76f4\u8fa3\u773c\u775b\n[spoiler]\u8f6c\u6362\u89c6\u70b9\u7684\u624b\u6cd5\u4eceever17\u5f00\u59cb\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u70b9\u65b0\u610f\uff1f\n\u987a\u4fbf\u4e00\u4ee3\u7684\u7231\u4e3d\u4e1d\uff0c\u4ece\u4e8c\u4ee3\u6765\u770b\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5de5\uff0c\u8fd9\u592a\u6ca1\u8bda\u610f\u4e86\u5427\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6211\u8fd8\u6ca1\u73a9\u4e09\u4ee3\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6709\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5267\u60c5\uff1f[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1515683245, "timestamp_updated": 1515683482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39146447": {"recommendationid": "39146447", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040002911", "num_games_owned": 509, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1068, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1068, "last_played": 1515317671}, "language": "english", "review": "It's 5:00 am and I just spent a weekend glued to my television tearing through this game. \n\nFinished the first game 999, took 17 hours to get the good ending and I lucked into following the correct \"path\" of choosing the wrong endings my first few breakthroughs.

Otherwise you may just end up like me, tortured by regret and fury for all the wasted time and anticipation.\n \nI know, Japanese visual novels (also Japanese literature in general) are well known for verbose writing, I had this in mind before stepping into this game.  However, its excessive verboseness still overwhelmed me somehow. You might think I am exaggerating and overacting at this point, so, to sufficiently prove my points, I am going to give a demonstration of two techniques used in this game, two techniques that stretched this game from a story that could have been properly told in 5 hours into an endless marathon.\n\n\n\n[h1]Technique 1:[/h1]\nI don\u2019t know if this game is made for kids or not, but considering it is rated M in many countries, my suspicion might be incorrect. Anyway, the devs seem to have highly underestimated the elaborative faculty of the players to an almost offensive degree. \n\nAs if describing a fact or ratiocination that sticks out a mile by the narrator wasn\u2019t enough, they just have to recapitulate the same thing (indeed, the exactly same thing, no Rashomon effect involved) through the mouth of every character available at the scene again and again, and eventually, to have the protagonist to sum it up one extra time\u2026\n\nHere is an example:\n[b](Note that it\u2019s not an excerpt of any actual in-game scene, but a simplified demonstration of how this \u201ctechnique\u201d works, as is the example in the next part)[/b]\n\n\n[quote=Example 1] \nYou rushed to the door only to found its handle missing. \nWhere the handle was supposed to be, left only an empty socket behind.\nYou tried to force it open *BAM* *BAM* of no avail.\nPeople gathered around to investigate it. [b](\u201cnarrator describes the situation\u201d Check \u2713)[/b]\n\nCharacter 1: \u201cWhat are you doing? Let\u2019s open this door and proceed!\u201d\nYou: \u201cI just arrived and found its handle missing.\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cA door can only be opened by rotating its handle, I guess we cannot open the door then.\u201d \nCharacter 3: \u201dLet me handle this, I\u2019m full of muscle! *BANG* *BANG*\u201d\nYou: \u201cI tried, it didn\u2019t even budge.\u201d\nCharacter 5: \u201cLet me give you a hand!\u201d\nCharacter 3: \u201cRawr\u2026 Doesn\u2019t work!\u201d\nCharacter 6: \u201cWe can\u2019t open the door normally, nor force it open. I figure this door is off-limits to us.\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, we cannot open this door at this moment.\u201d\nCharacter 4: \u201cThen we are trapped! This is the only door we haven\u2019t entered!\u201d\nYou: \u201cMaybe there is some other ways to open a door?\u201d\nCharacter 6: \u201cLike teleporting through?\u201d \nCharacter 4: \u201cHow is that possible!?\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cHow about lockpicking?\u201d\nCharacter 1: \u201cWithout a handle, there isn\u2019t any lock to lockpick I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nCharacter 4: \u201cSo we are trapped! We are going to starve to death!\u201d\nYou: \u201cIs it possible to find some explosives to breach it?\u201d \nCharacter 2: \u201cWhew! Yes, we can plant some explosives to breach it through. Why haven\u2019t I figured that out.\u201d \nCharacter 6: \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s a tough door no doubt, but I don\u2019t think it can stand against explosion.\u201d\nCharacter 3: \u201cGood idea! I know I can count on you.\u201d\nYou: \u201cIs that truly the only way?\u201d\nCharacter 1: \u201cOr we can find the missing handle to fix the door, and open it the way a normal door would.\u201d\nCharacter 5: \u201cExactly what I was thinking. We can also try finding the missing handle.\u201d\nCharacter 4: \u201cDoes that mean we don\u2019t have to die here if we can find the missing handle or get some explosives to breach it?\u201d [b](\u201cevery character recaps the same thing at least once\u201d Check \u2713)[/b]\nYou: \u201cSo our current objective is clear, we either find the missing handle of the door, or get our hands on some explosives to breach it open. Everybody clear?\u201d [b](\u201cprotagonist sums it up one extra time\u201d Check \u2713)[/b]\n [/quote]\n\nDid you get how painfully annoying it is?\nAlso note that since every line is accompanied by dubs and character animations, any simple scenario like this one could easily last ages.\n\n\n\n[h1]Technique 2:[/h1]\nAs you might have already known, the game is consisted of two parts. One is the \u201c\nVisual Novel\u201d part, in which you simply read the story, and sometimes make decisions to push the story forward. The other one is the \u201cRoom Escape\u201d part, which plays just like any other room escape game, except for the puzzles being mind-numbingly easy and straightforward.\n\nWhat truly bothers me is that every character keeps saying sh*t that are either too intelligent and informative, or embarrassingly flirty (both from male and female), which is totally out the realm of their character personas and the overall atmosphere. There is one scene where they were just screaming and vomiting after the discovery of a bloody dismembered body, the next minute, they started flirting and recollecting childhood memories right beside the corpse!?\n\nAnd that isn\u2019t even the worst part, the worst part is that every character keeps commentating before/during/after your every single action! It might be hard to understand how, so here comes the demonstration. \n\nImagining yourself entering  a room with two other characters, the room is completely empty except for a tea table in the center and a key atop it. The exit is on the opposite of the room, locked. The solution here is quite self-evident, you grab the key, unlock the door and get out, not much to talk about really. However, such simple scenario would evolve like this in this game:\n\n[quote=Example 2] \n(Just when you enter the room, game freezes.)\nCharacter 2: \u201cOh, this room is so empty, can we just chill out here for a while and take a break?\u201d\nYou: \u201cTime is running out, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t afford the luxury.\u201d\nCharacter 1: \u201cYeah, let\u2019s find out the solution to this room.\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cYou men are always this rushy.\u201d\n\n\n(Game resumes control, you start to explore the room)\n\n\n(Just before you are about to grab the key)\nCharacter 2: \u201cLook! There is a key on the table.\u201d\nCharacter 1: \u201cYeah, I saw that too, I wonder what it opens.\u201d\nYou: \u201cLet\u2019s take a closer look.\u201d\n\n(Right after you pick up the key)\nCharacter 1: \u201cHey, what\u2019s that you\u2019re holding? A key?\u201d\nYou: \u201cYes, I just found it lying on the table.\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cOh, it looks so stiff and hard.\u201d\nYou: \u201cWait, can you say that again?\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cSay what again?\u201d\nYou: \u201cThe one you used to describe the key.\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cOh that\u2019s awkward, please forget about it!\u201d \n[b](\u201cridiculously unnecessary flirting\u201d Check \u2713)[/b]\n\n(While you attempt to further search the room)\nCharacter 1:  \u201cSince there are only two doors in this room, one is the one we just entered, the other one must be the exit, why don\u2019t we check it out.\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cIt looks locked though, but maybe you can unlock it with the key you just found?\u201d\nYou: \u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d\n\n(When you approach the door.)\nCharacter 1: \u201cOh, this door is so strongly fortified, there\u2019s no way we can force it open, got to use a key.\u201d\n\n(After you insert the key and open the door.) \nCharacter 1: \u201cMan, you are such a talented door-opener, I love the way you insert the key into the lockhole, how fierce.\u201d\nCharacter 2: \u201cYou guys are disgusting!\u201d \n[b](\u201cridiculously unnecessary flirting again, seriously?\u201d Check \u2713)[/b]\nYou: \u201cJust shut up and let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d\n [/quote]\n\n\nAre you feeling it now?", "timestamp_created": 1516299851, "timestamp_updated": 1516438359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39514110": {"recommendationid": "39514110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141340461", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1594, "last_played": 1516551929}, "language": "english", "review": "999 and VLR. Two of the most games I thought I would not have enjoyed...\n\nI was sadly mistaken. \n\nNormally, I'm not one for puzzle games so I have to admit, when I first heard of anything of the Zero Escape franchise, I was thinking, maybe not. The first time heard was the advertisments for Zero Time Dilemma here and I thought, pfft. Another puzzle game I would not be interested in. When I watched a youtuber play a bit of it, I was then thinking, looks interesting and searched up the franchise. I then found out that after a bit after the release of ZTD, they would then remaster the Nonary games on Steam and PS4. I decided on the whim to get Steams version because they had a sale recently to get the the bundle. Anyways, this isn't the point!\n\nThe point is that I normally dislike puzzle escape games, any puzzle games in general really. However, 999 changed that for me. It was fun and creative in how you would escape the rooms. As well as that, there were creative paths for the many different endings. The other thing is this. If you have played Until Dawn, then you will know about the Butterfly Effect (also can be referred to Ripple). Your decisions change the outcome in the games. It was interesting to see that incoporated in the game, and how you would have to alter your decisions to make sure you make the good endings. \n\nVLR also incorporates it. As well as that, there are more puzzles to go through. However, not goijng to lie. Some of the puzzles in the second game got harder and more challenging, so sometimes I got stressed out and had to take a break, especially when finding the secondary passwords to unlock the \"Redacted\" achievment. I managed to get through the two games in 52 hours with 100% achievments. I have to admit, it was also quite challenging needing to go back to certain points or finding clues that would unlock other points as you could not continue without certain passwords or whatever. That's about the only thing I didn;t like about the game. The constant returning to areas to look for things you should have noted down, whereas in 999, the things you unlock does not need passwords. \n\nDespite this, this game has made me slightly interested more in puzzle games. The game can be played in English and Japanese (in my case, I played the game in English with Japanese voices). It was interesting to see some of my favourite voice actors here in a few anime and different games (in this case, the voice actor for Quark was the VA for Alhonse Elric from Full Metal Alchemist, and Zero Junior's voice was done by the VA of Monokuma (can't remember if it was the game or anime though). \n\nThis game is great for both puzzle and anime enthsiasts, and those that like games that involve changing futures with the butterfly effect. \n\nMy personal rating of the game: 10/10, despite the reptitiveness at times.", "timestamp_created": 1516550548, "timestamp_updated": 1516550548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

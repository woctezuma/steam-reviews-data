This is an action/platformer/puzzle game that came out back in the day of the games like Jak & Daxer or Ratchet and Clank that has criminally low recognition. The  puzzles in this game are phenomenal and really make you think because they often are designed across the entire dungeon or map. I loved the utilization of the mummy in the dungeons. I've played a nice amount of platformers from this era of games, and some of them had puzzle elements, but not to many have had puzzles that were designed this beautifuly. The theme is wonderful and the characters are fun placesetters to help put you in the world that you will be running around in. From what I've seen of the original game, the graphics have been overhauled making it really great to look at. The controls are really nice and you never feel like a missed jump or rough landing was the games fault. Best played with a controller. Another great feature was that your saves are backlogged, so if something messes up or you miss something important and can't go back like an achievment, you can make one of your backlogged saves a save from the game just by changing a name in the saves folder. You will easily sink almost 20 hours into this game just beating and completing it and if you really enjoy it, like most of the people who picked this up for the nostalgia, than i'm sure you'll play it again.

From a nostalgic point of view I love this game but I can see what would turn people off from it. The game has its fair share of flaws but in my opinion none of them are outright deal breakers and arguably make the game more satisfying to complete as they provide an element of challenge that is not too often seen in games released in recent years. I would recommend this game to more than just the nostalgic old players on the condition that they don't mind the following constraints:\n\n- The controls in this game are ported over from XBox and are not the easiest to use on PC which can make the game irritating at times. I would strongly advise bookmarking a page online that has the controls aswell considering there are no real ways to determine what button does what in game.On a side note if you have a controller you will likely have an easier time.\n\n- There is quite a bit of backtracking in this game and the objectives may not always be spelled out for you or outright obvious so it is a smart idea to actually pay attention to the story, explore the zones and make note of stuff you may not be able to do ingame yet.\n\n- The level design is not the greatest at times, some jumps will seem impossible but are just in fact very difficult, making full use of the double jump feature obtained early on in the game.\n\n- There are bugs in this game however most of them have been fixed however I will post 2 that I encountered for the sake of awareness: \n+ Left eyes of sarcophagi are invisible\n+ A rare bug where conversation is inescapable and uninteracable with the NPC that runs the Heliopolis obstacle course.\n\n- Voice acting is pretty much non-existant outside of incomprehensable noises made by the characters in cutscenes. \n\nDespite the game's buggy behavior It has solid replay value and is a great fit for anyone that liked to play older action-adventure platformer games.\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513811153, "timestamp_updated": 1513811153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38429553": {"recommendationid": "38429553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343777943", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513685134}, "language": "english", "review": "This game brings back childhood memories! gald it finally made its wat to PC :)", "timestamp_created": 1513687544, "timestamp_updated": 1513687544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38384650": {"recommendationid": "38384650", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992123547", "num_games_owned": 914, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513821178}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello everybody, End World Gaming here to share an excerpt from my review for Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy HD by Eurocom and THQNordic.\n\nSphinx and the Cursed Mummy HD is a remaster of an action adventure game from 2003. As of writing this review the game has only been released on PC but I hope that the game will receive a console release (Again) in the future so more people can enjoy the game.\n\nThe game is based on Ancient Egyptian mythology and it features many of the gods and heroes from the time period, like Imhotep and Anubis.\n\nThe story follows two characters, the first is named Sphinx and he\u2019s used mostly for combat, while Tutankhamen is used to solve intricate puzzles. The game frequently alternate\u2019s between the two of them and in doing so it makes the game a lot less boring.\n\nEach area of the game is beautifully designed and the HD enhancements look great considering the game\u2019s age. Most of the areas are quite large as well and often have side quests for you to complete. Doing side quests also has benefits to the game itself but there are some that aren\u2019t required to complete the game, like capturing monsters for the museum, as an example.\n\nAs you progress through the game the puzzles that you encounter with Tutankhamen become increasingly more intricate and complex. Since he\u2019s a mummy for the majority of the game, he\u2019s immune to death and this fact is utilized in each of the game\u2019s puzzles. He can be set on fire, electrocuted, split into 3, and flattened. Each of these unique states lasts only for a short period of time so you must move quickly to solve each of the game\u2019s puzzles. If he\u2019s on fire or electrified, falling into the water will get rid of the effect and you\u2019ll need to go reacquire it again. Getting any of the effects will also automatically replace the existing effect too.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in control of sphinx you\u2019ll be able to use the Sword of Osiris to battle enemies. Enemies come in many shapes and sizes and each have their own unique abilities to them. They\u2019re pretty limited in skills though, so you can easily learn their moves without much effort.\n\nAt the start of the game, Sphinx\u2019s skills are pretty limited but as you complete major points in the story, he\u2019ll acquire items that grant bonus abilities such as fast swimming and double jumping.\n\nOverall, Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy HD is a very entertaining game and the developers did a great job on the remastering of it. There are some minor issues that I ran into like the usage of items being rather cumbersome and until recently the font being too small (Which has now been fixed thankfully). Outside of those, I\u2019ve been having a lot of fun with the game and I look forward to finishing up my video playthrough of the game. If you\u2019re a fan of action adventure games and want something that\u2019ll take up a lot of your time then Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy HD is a great choice.\n\nIf you're interested in checking out my full review or to find out my final score, you can find the review here: http://www.endworldgaming.com/action-adventure/sphinx-and-the-cursed-mummy-hd-reviews\n\nThanks for taking the time to check out the review folks and happy gaming!", "timestamp_created": 1513539424, "timestamp_updated": 1513539424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38247039": {"recommendationid": "38247039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154299846", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 278, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513042443}, "language": "english", "review": "Here is a great concept that was placed into a game but still is rather ruff around the edges.

Its strong 3D puzzle platforming and sense of nostalgia will endear it to a niche audience. Remnants of old game designs may frustrate those looking for a modern experience. Poor keyboard controls are hopefully only a temporary flaw in this otherwise good quality port. \n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1][list]\n[*]Puzzles that continually introduce fresh mechanics\n[*]Great pacing between Sphinx and Tutankhamen sections\n[*]Vibrant colors and character animations\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1][list]\n[*]Story never deviates from what you'd expect\n[*]No autosave function; semi-infrequent save points\n[*]Small moments of frustration add up\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]Expanded Review[/u][/b]\nEven as a newcomer to [i]Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy[/i] I felt pangs of nostalgia from playing it. Not because I recognized anything but because its designs and features felt so familiar. It is a puzzle action platformer that draws obvious inspiration from the [i]Zelda[/i] series. Coming from an era predating physics based puzzles ([i]Half Life 2[/i] would be released a year later) means you'll be solving puzzles with good old switches, buttons and an ever growing selection of equipment and environmental factors.\n\nAs the title suggests you'll be splitting your time between playing as Sphinx, the lion tailed hero, and Tutankhamen, the cursed mummy. The pacing is excellent as you swap between the two at predetermined times in the story. Sphinx plays like a hero should. He swings a sword, double jumps like a champ and knows how to use the tools he finds. And he does it all with a confident air and swagger in his step.\n\nMeanwhile Tutankhamen, once called \"the Misfortunate Mummy\" in the title, plays the slapstick comic relief. He is imprisoned from early on and his mission is one of stealth and thievery. There is no combat in his sections and item use is limited. Instead he uses his undead body as a tool. Among other things, he can be lit on fire, smashed flat and sawed into pieces. For all his misfortune he keeps a cheery demeanor.\n\nWith a launch price of 14.99$ and a run time averaging around 16 hours I'd call this a solid value for a niche audience. It took me just over 18 hours to 100% complete it. It will primarily appeal to those of us that were gaming back in 2003. Those looking for more 3D puzzle dungeon delving outside of the Zelda series should also find enjoyment in it.\n\nSee the full review with scores and screenshots at [url=https://www.pcaficionado.com/2017/11/25/sphinx-cursed-mummy-review/]PC Aficionado.com[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1511658725, "timestamp_updated": 1511658725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722598", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37587980": {"recommendationid": "37587980", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982567635", "num_games_owned": 474, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511874007}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid port job!

At one point you unlock a second player character who is a mummy but all this really does is shift the game towards a more stealth focus. There is also no voice acting and this really drags the entire game down and makes it feel like it lacks personality compared to something like Jak and Daxter. \n\nSphinx is interesting less because of it's value as a game but moreso how it was completely forgotten after it released and only gets discussed nowadays because of a massive oversight on the developers part with the original release. In the NTSC release, if you used a specific save game station. It locks a specific door you need to get through and makes you unable to complete the game. This massive technical problem affects almost everyone who played the original release and as a result very few people actually completed the game. \n\nThis is why I'm somewhat shocked that this game was ported to PC 14 years later since I was surprised someone else remembered it. This version does fix that bug and is fairly competent aside from that. But that's the word, competent. It doesn't do very much you haven't seen done better elsewhere. It's one of the most average games I've ever played and unless you grew up with it I doubt you'd be interested in it otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1510462679, "timestamp_updated": 1510810888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686007", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36459089": {"recommendationid": "36459089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079498092", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510617159}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Nostalgic of the ps2 game I owned when I was a kid.

I remember seeing the box art for this game and being fascinated. i had always had an interest in ancient Egypt, my favorite movie of the time was The Mummy, and i couldn't wait to get home and play it. I'm glad I did, too, Because it wound up becoming one of my top ten favorite games of all time. Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I find out that Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy is coming to PC. I haven't been so excited. I thinks it fair to say I love this game. However, I do have a few minor issues with this port.\n\nFirst, the text is far too small. When i'm at my computer desk playing it's not that much of a problem. However, in the living room, on my big TV, it's impossible to read. I've also noticed a lot of artifacting and broken bits of letters in the text box. I hear that a fix is coming for that and I hope it's soon. \n\nSecond, there seems to be a few minor graphical bugs. I'm running a GTX 1070, so i doubt it's my computers fault. A few cases of random things losing their eyes, one or both, and other cases of Sphinx's model nowhere near lined up with objects he's interacting with. Hopefully these issues can be fixed and if so, it will be done soon as well.\n\nOverall, nothing I've noticed has been game breaking or messed up my experience with this port. They're all just little things I notice while playing that make me chuckle and wonder what happened. Sphinx continues to be a pleasure to play and seeing it in HD makes me that much happier.

Unfortunately, the port is really buggy right now, though most of the major issues have been fixed. The developer has been really good with communication and pushing frequent fixes and updates but there are still some major issues waiting to be resolved, however it is very playable right now and I'm having a blast in spite of the issues.

YEAH!!\n\nThere is no hot-plug support for the Steam Controller as of right now, meaning the game can not detect when the controller has been turned on and thus requires you to have the controller on before you launch the game, and if it turns off while you're idle you'll have to relaunch the game in order to use the controller again. In fact, trying to play the game with the steam controller on my laptop results in an instant crash to desktop upon launch, but this does not happen on my my desktop PC. Keyboard controls are not a viable option and do not support remapping controls at this time. Hot-plug support on other xinput devices works fine, I've been told.\n\nThe controls are actually quite tight for controllers, and it's nice that they allow a lot of freedom in the FOV. You can keep it at the original 64FOV, lower it further for some reason, or crank it all the way up to 170FOV, not that you'd want to.

I can see how certain elements have been made HD, and with 60fps support the game. it truly is nostalgia overload. \n\nI may come back and update this review as I progress through the game, as I am currently still in the early stages. Aside from the minor freeze I had, and the GUI elements looking tiny, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this classic.\n\nUPDATE: I have experienced some more freezes, these are rare and last for about half a second each time it happens, not sure as to the exact cause, it's a minor nuisance and something I can see genuinely affecting other players who may understandably not be so lenient towards issues such as these. Other reviewers have mentioned sound stuttering bugs, I hadn't experienced any of these until I reached the level where you play as Tut and must find the Moon, Sun and Earth Planetarium Keys. It seems to continue every now and then from this point, but it is sometimes fixed by pressing the Back button and then again to go back into gameplay. At one point, I had to restart the game to fix it. Minor issues, but this won't stop me from enjoying the game! Hopefully these minor annoyances get fixed.\n\nUPDATE 2: The sound bug has now been fixed, I've only experienced very minor bugs since then and these do not affect gameplay. I'm nearing the end of the campaign and this has been an absolutely terrific nostalgic trip.

It really made me think, and gave me a strong sense of satisfaction whenever I managed to solve a puzzle efficiently.\n\nIn the skin of a recently graduated alchemist from the world's most renowned alchemy college, you must now face the challenges of an alchemist's life outside the university, by assembling different alchemical compounds with your trusty transmutation engine.\n\nWhat is a transmutation engine, you may ask? Well, it is sort of a meta-contraption of sorts, that gives you a series of parts that you may assemble into an useful machine that creates a desired output of molecules from a given input of atoms. At your disposal, there are several variations arms to grab and move atoms, gliphs to transmute atoms into different forms and join atoms into molecules, rails to move arms around and, of course, the atomic inputs and desirable output tray. The set of parts to use may seem rather small, but they allow for endless possibilities in each of the game's dozens of puzzles, especially considering that you may program the behavior of each individual arm separately through a set of simple instructions.\n\nAfter you finish solving a puzzle, the game will evaluate the performance of your contraption on three criteria: cost, time taken and size. While it is not strictly necessary to optimize any of these three atributes in order to proceed, if you're like me, you'll keep trying to make the best possible machine before moving on. There is also a pretty interesting minigame called Sigmar's Garden, decidedly simpler than the transmutation engine, that serves as a welcome breather between regular puzzles, allowing you to relax and do something easier for a few minutes.\n\nOther than the puzzles, which are obviously the meat of the game, Opus Magnum also presents a rather interesting story. As the head alchemist of one of the most affluent families in the city, you get to know more about each member's tribulations and problems as you set out to solve them with alchemy, and you befriend the sweet and funny Concordia Lem, that works at the house since she was very young.\n\nTo accompany the masterfully crafted puzzle mechanics and the nice storyline, there is an excellent soundtrack that manages to evoke a certain magical feeling without getting in the way of concentration, and satisfying sound effects that are triggered by the transmutation engine's many mechanisms. \n\nThe graphics don't disappoint either. From the simple, tiny graphics used in the transmutation engine's atoms and arms, to the character portraits and amazing backgrounds in the \"hub screen\", everything looks pretty, evoking feelings of a well organized, sumptuous steampunkish society.\n\nThis game is, in many different ways, a timesink. It will make you lose hours and hours of sleep trying to get your machines to be slightly better than your previous designs. However, unlike most timesink games out there, it didn't make me feel like I wasted my time when I finally let go of my five hour play sessions. Instead, I felt like it was all worthwhile, like the time I spent in it was more \"invested\" than \"wasted\", even though I'm fully aware this is just a game and won't make me rich or anything.\n\nAll in all, a pretty excellent puzzle game, providing hundreds of hours of head scratching gameplay and tons of different solutions for each challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1514652475, "timestamp_updated": 1514652720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38865800": {"recommendationid": "38865800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066838157", "num_games_owned": 496, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2250, "last_played": 1514786564}, "language": "english", "review": "It's The Codex of Alchemical Engineering, with the Shenzen I/O UI and attendant storyline excusing the crazy requests.\n\nIf you liked TCoAE, you'll definitely enjoy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1514649966, "timestamp_updated": 1514649966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38862034": {"recommendationid": "38862034", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068737570", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 57, "last_played": 1514525246}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "Good Game and I sharing my video\nhttps://youtu.be/LoIj8zlL8Y4", "timestamp_created": 1514643746, "timestamp_updated": 1514643746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38845915": {"recommendationid": "38845915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125153113", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 345, "last_played": 1514610699}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u52b9\u7387\u3092\u91cd\u8996\u3059\u308b\u3082\u3088\u3057\u898b\u6804\u3048\u306b\u51dd\u308b\u3082\u3088\u3057\u3002\n\u8a66\u884c\u932f\u8aa4\u306e\u672b\u5b8c\u6210\u3057\u305f\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u7a3c\u50cd\u3057\u59cb\u3081\u305f\u969b\u306e\u611f\u52d5\u306f\u4e00\u5165\u3002\n\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u7684\u306f\u6700\u521d\u3053\u305d\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u611f\u3058\u308b\u304c\u3001\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u6291\u3048\u3088\u3046\u3068\u304b\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u306b\u53ce\u3081\u3088\u3046\u3068\u304b\u8003\u3048\u306a\u3051\u308c\u3070\u3001\u5b9f\u306f\u305d\u3053\u307e\u3067\u82e6\u6226\u3057\u306a\u3044\u306f\u305a\u3002\n\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u82e6\u624b\u306a\u4eba\u3082\u5b89\u5fc3\u3057\u3066\u3088\u3044\u3057\u3001\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u5f97\u610f\u306a\u4eba\u3082\u5341\u5206\u3084\u308a\u8fbc\u3081\u308b\u79c0\u9038\u306a\u30d0\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u3002\n\u305f\u3060\u3057\u5b9f\u7e3e\u89e3\u9664\u306b\u304a\u3051\u308b\u30df\u30cb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u8981\u6c42\u56de\u6570100\u56de\u306f\u7d76\u5bfe\u306b\u8a31\u3055\u306a\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514608416, "timestamp_updated": 1514608416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38845510": {"recommendationid": "38845510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079851166", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1404, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1404, "last_played": 1514680683}, "language": "english", "review": "Watching the trailers I thought I would find this game boring\nI was wrong", "timestamp_created": 1514607265, "timestamp_updated": 1514607265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38844553": {"recommendationid": "38844553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081579718", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "last_played": 1514604770}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Zachtronics, what do you expect.", "timestamp_created": 1514604791, "timestamp_updated": 1514604791, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489130", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38842527": {"recommendationid": "38842527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092224917", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 703, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513461568}, "language": "english", "review": "Big fan of puzzle games.

You're either locked into dragging and dropping MANY small components in tedious fashion or using arbitrary hotkeys strictly designed for right-handed players.  There are manifest ways the task could be presented, such as selecting a track and double-clicking icons to apply them, but Zachtronics took the easiest route to implement instead of the best.  There is textual dialog interspersed between the puzzles, and it's pretty awful.  The user is required to click many times to progress the dialog before being allowed to proceed through the cumbersome menu.  Because the process could be so dramatically streamlined without sacrificing absolutely anything in terms of presentation or gameplay, the effect feels like a great hindrance to the overall flow of the game and highlights just how vapid and childish the story dialog is.\n\nThe gameplay is OK, but it's not groundbreaking or revolutionary.

At the time of this review I am on the last puzzle of the third act which I assume is aproximately half way through the campaign mode.\n\n\nOpus Magnum is a fantastic puzzle games made by the creators of Shenzen I/O, Spacechem, Infinifactory and TIS-100. To me, Opus Magnum it feels like the spiritual successor to Spacechem because of so many shared mechanics and puzzle styles. Fortunately, Opus Magnum seems like a more refined and polished experience compared to it's predecessor. First off the user interface has been significantly improved. Information is much more clearly displayed and player commands can all be easily edited unlike Spacechem where one mistake often meant rearranging half of your solution. \n\nThe majority of gameplay changes from Spacechem to Opus Magnum come from different methods of moving different puzzle peices. In Spacechem, atoms were moved along linear paths on a grid that snaked between eachother while bonding, rotating and unbonding before being deposited for collection. In Opus Magnum, diferent reagents are moved across a hex-based grid by mechanical arms, pistons and rails before being deposited for collection. Alongside these new methods of transportation, Opus Magnum throws away Spacechems concept of limited building area in favor of giving the player unlimited space to build in. While this change certainly makes it possible to make cool and crazy contraptions I also think it can make the puzzles in Opus Magnum significantly easier than puzzles in Spacechem. With nothing limiting the size or cost of your solution, you can simply make a super large and expensive machine that solves the puzzle instead of being limited by your availible space like in Spacechem. While limiting building area in Spacechem did make the puzzles harded it also made it so that if you couldnt find a way to fit all the manuvers you needed into the availible space you would be stuck on the level without any wasy to really progress withought finding the intended solution so I understand and appreciate that this change was made. Additionaly, this change makes the game much more accessible to players unfamiliar to Zacktronics games while still allowing veterans to create highly efficient and compact solutions. \n\nOverall, Opus Magnum is probably the most accessible Zacktronics game to date due to its easy-to-learn mechanics, great visuals and excelent puzzle design.\n\n11/13", "timestamp_created": 1514441546, "timestamp_updated": 1514441640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38767883": {"recommendationid": "38767883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240256314", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 615, "last_played": 1514387168}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u667a\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u53d7\uff01\n\u8fc7\u5173\u4e0d\u7b97\u7279\u522b\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u4f18\u5316\u8981\u8001\u547d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u6210\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u611f\u4e5f\u662f\u7206\u68da\uff0c\u770b\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u83ab\u540d\u7684\u723d\u611f\uff0cGIF\u5bfc\u51fa\u8fd9\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u4e5f\u662f\u8d5e\uff01\n\u6b64\u6e38\u620f\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f11\u95f2\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u504f\u91cd\u5ea6\u70e7\u8111\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u5fc3\u60c5\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u73a9\u3002\n\u603b\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\u662f\u4e2a\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514439078, "timestamp_updated": 1514439078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38767408": {"recommendationid": "38767408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108381658", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513509207}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6c89\u8ff7\u4f18\u5316\n\u6740\u65f6\u95f4\u5229\u5668\n\u611f\u89c9\u53ea\u662f-1s\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u5df2\u8fc7\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\n\u597d\u73a9\u597d\u73a9\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1514437886, "timestamp_updated": 1514438025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38766942": {"recommendationid": "38766942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078480852", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1157, "last_played": 1514791841}, "language": "english", "review": "fun, reasonable dificulty curb, interesting if casual story- and now im going to go hunt down other peoples solutions so i can figure out how they got their cycles so low.", "timestamp_created": 1514436805, "timestamp_updated": 1514436805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38765702": {"recommendationid": "38765702", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994331677", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1388, "last_played": 1514612549}, "language": "english", "review": "Addicting.

But then, your solution (your alchemy machine) has cost, size and amount of steps it uses to solve the puzzle. 3 numbers. If you want to (and you will) you can optimize those. How about making the cheapest ? The smallest? The fastest? You also can see statistics of other people (a hystogram), so, you can judge yourself if you have achieved the best possible cost, size or speed. And you can save gif of your solution directly from the game!\n   The presentation is also excelent, the graphics, the music is just sucks you in. There is even relatively good story (but who cares in puzzle game? But still, it adds up).\n   Of cource, there could be minor improvements done in any game. For example, you can not (or I can't find how) cut and paste the code, or keep the code when you change the element this code belongs to. But those are very minor things.\n   I was in doubt if I wanted to spend $20 on a puzzle game, but then, I decided that it is christmass and I can always refund it.

What I like most is that I don't have to be a computer programmer or engineer to be able to play it. You do need a decent sense of spatial awareness, but at least it's only in 2 dimensions. I've played a few other Zachtronics games like Spacechem and Infinifactory and I inevitably had to give up relatively early (20% progress or so) because they got impossibly hard. It was like juggling Rubik's cubes and solving them while calculating the trajectory of a space flight to Mars. The possibility space just kept expanding until it was an order of magnitude beyond my abilities. Opus Magnum leaves it up to the player, not the game, to decide when they're done. If you just want to unlock the next set of puzzles, there's usually an obvious but terribly inefficient method of solving the current one. \n\nElegant solutions are their own reward.

Aside from a few unique parts, there are no constraints to how much you can build, and you have infinite space - which means that there are practically infinite solutions to any one puzzle. Once you finish a puzzle, you get to see how your stats - cost, cycles, and area - stack up to other players, so there's an incentive to optimize your designs. You can also record GIFs of your solutions and share them, I thought that was a neat feature. There's also an optional little Solitaire-like minigame you can play, but I haven't really bothered with that, as the main appeal of the game lies in the actual puzzles for me.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThey're stunning. The parts all move individually, and they're all designed and animated beautifully. Once you put an intricate machine together, it's so satisfying to just watch all the parts move in harmony like a well-oiled machine. There are also some really well-drawn backgrounds for each story area.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n\nThe story is... surprisingly decent. Obviously, though, it's not the main focus of the game. I've only played up to the third chapter out of five, so I can't really make a complete judgment here. But it's enough to keep you occupied and provide a 'reason' behind each of the puzzles, if that makes any sense. Overall, it's nothing special, but it's certainly not bad. If you're buying this game for the story, though, then you might want to look elsewhere.\n\n[h1] Replayability [/h1]\n\nPractically infinite. As I said before, there's an unlimited number of solutions to each puzzle - you can build a gigantic, clunky machine, a tiny efficient one, or anything between. I'm sure you could spend hours on every puzzle trying to optimize it in all 3 categories.\n\n[h1] Summary [/h1]\n\nThe execution is flawless, with beautiful graphics and a surprisingly decent story to go along with the (already great) puzzles, if you're into that. There's almost nothing to critique about this game.\n\n[b] Gameplay: [/b] 10/10\n[b] Graphics: [/b] 10/10\n[b] Story: [/b] 7/10\n[b] Replayability: [/b] 10/10\n\n[b] Overall: [/b] 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1513547528, "timestamp_updated": 1513547528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552534", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38386872": {"recommendationid": "38386872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129072782", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 723, "last_played": 1514112913}, "language": "french", "review": "La satisfaction de r\u00e9soudre les \u00e9nigmes est incroyable, la prise en main est rapide mais l'optimisation reste copmpliqu\u00e9e a atteindre, de nombreuses heures de jeu a pr\u00e9voir.

There's nothing \"hidden\", it's just like building a real physical machine that moves marbles around and sticks them together. And if you don't like optimising, the play space is big enough to accept thousands of totally different workable solutions.\n\nMy only criticism at this point is that the \"reach\" of the grabber arms could be visualised a little better (e.g. show ghost arms when you hover over one, with a little rotatey arrow to match the instructions, and show the \"sweep\" of the arms). Thinking in hexagons is surprisingly difficult, and I've felt trial and error when preventing atoms colliding as they sweep past each other that isn't \"fun\" problem solving, and can be a bit tedious at first.\n\nAnyway, if you want to play a puzzle game : get it.

I've played (and enjoyed) Space Chem, Ironclad Tactics, and Shenzhen I/O, but Opus Magnum is, well, an accurate title.\n\nThe story is not deep, but I honestly found myself eager to open every new puzzle just to read the missives and conversations. The characters have a surprising amount of personality for ones you never actually meet or interact with, and I felt connected to them.\n\nThe mechanic is *extremely* satisfying. As usual, it has been tested an tweaked and feels like there aren't really any rough edges. Moreover, I feel like they did a very good job with the scoring system. Yes, it still uses the classic \"here's a histogram of what all the other players did\", but I felt very much more in control of how I wanted to optimize my crazy alchemy machine. Some puzzles I'd make as fast as possible, area and cost be damned; some I'd try to be frugal; some I'd strike a balance. (For those of you who love compact solutions, there's all of the production alchemy puzzles in the epilog---it's a nice bump in difficultly after you've finished the main story, definitely recommended.)\n\nAs for drawbacks, there are a few: it's not an especially long game. I mean, there will *always* be more puzzles, but you can completely explore every corner of the game in not too short order, so you will eventually lose that \"oh, well *that's* a neat trick I hadn't thought of before\" feeling. Also, at least in the version I played, I felt the controls weren't explained completely. I mean, you can totally get by with what they tell you, but there's a whole other set of options that make it much smoother and quicker to create machines (for instance, they didn't need to wait until the epilog to tell you that you can rotate pieces while you have them picked up with the mouse). If you poke around in the steam discussions, you can pick these up without too much trouble (holding alt and clicking on an instruction is my personal favorite---fast-forward-and-pause). I definitely recommend getting used to the keyboard shortcuts; it's much faster and smoother to create machines.\n\nAnyways, long story short, Zachtronics basically remade Space Chem, except better in basically evey dimension. If you like that, get this. It's totally worth it.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1513256282, "timestamp_updated": 1513256282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38300226": {"recommendationid": "38300226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014239465", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 168, "last_played": 1514513403}, "language": "english", "review": "It is so satisfying when after watching your machine fail you finally figure out what you did wrong and fix it.", "timestamp_created": 1513254941, "timestamp_updated": 1513254941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38299653": {"recommendationid": "38299653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054221629", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1513692835}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u7d55\u5c0d\u597d\u8a55\uff01\n\n\u9084\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c60\u699c\u4e92\u76f8\u50b7\u5bb3\u554a\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8\n\n\u300c\u590d\u300d\u5b57\u7684\u5b57\u9ad4\u5d29\u58de\u4e86\uff0c\u7f3a\u7701\u5230\u65e5\u6587\u5b57\u9ad4\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u53ea\u767c\u751f\u5728\u7e41\u9ad4\u4e2d\u6587\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e0b\u3002\n\n\u6c42\u539f\u8072\u5e36\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1513252717, "timestamp_updated": 1513252717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38299646": {"recommendationid": "38299646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000878199", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 55, "last_played": 1513671723}, "language": "english", "review": "Must buy if you enjoy puzzle games. \n\n-The initial levels might not seem too hard to solve, but the real challenge (And fun) comes in the leader boards.

The game just works.\n\nThe puzzles are very challanging, but the difficulty progresses nicely so that by the time the puzzles really get hard, you should be good to go from practice.  Another thing I love about this game is there are literally a hundred ways or more to do all of the puzzles.  There is no right or wrong way depending on what you want to do, its up to you.\n\nI am a full time professional programmer and this game is right up my alley, it requires and rewards creative thought and truely is sooo satisfying when you finally get a tough puzzle to work properly.\n\nI highly recommend if you like puzzles AT ALL.

If you like sandbox puzzle games, then this is a must-have.\n\nLong version: In typical Zachtronics style, Opus Magnum has a very small set of \"rules\" you need to learn to play the game, which is basically assembling elements of a factory to produce end-products from basic ingredients. But these rules work for solving an unlimited number of puzzles. And use of the Steam Workshop means that you will be able to play new and interesting puzzles designed by other players for a really, really long time. \n\nIn Opus Magnum, you aren't constrained by floor space, or how efficiently you build your machine to solve the puzzle.  Where the real challenge comes in is that you can optimize your machine for area, cost, or time -- or a combination of the three. If you don't want to optimize, you can just solve the puzzle however you want -- which means if you want an \"elegant\" solution rather than a more optimal one, no problem.  This is the hallmark of Zachtronics games -- come up with a solution *your way*. Play how you want -- the game only stipulates what tools you can use and what the end result for each puzzle needs to be -- how you get there is entirely up to you. And this means you can also play the same puzzles over and over again and enjoy yourself every time.\n", "timestamp_created": 1513002681, "timestamp_updated": 1513002681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38235842": {"recommendationid": "38235842", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966505872", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513393011}, "language": "english", "review": "Like Spacechem (more like The Codex of Alchemical Engineering if you remember that Flash game), only much more freeform in allowed solutions.

Opus Magnum is no exception.\n\nCompared to some of his other games, Opus Magnum definitely feels more accessible - there's no coding in assembly, no need to RTFM, and no space constraints to work around.  It feels like a polished, more \"casual\" (if such a word can be used to described a Zachtronics game) version of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/]SpaceChem[/url].  The only constraints you ever seem to have are a few specialized parts (e.g. \"Glyph of Disposal\") having limited numbers in a design.  Otherwise, you are free to take as much space and time, and as many parts, as you need...at least for your initial solution.  If you're like most players, you'll inevitably end up wanting to \"tighten up\" your solution and make it faster / smaller / cheaper.\n\nAs with most of the Zachtronics games, which could stand alone without any story, this game has a well-written little story to drive the narrative and puzzle-building along.  It also has an unobtrusive ambient music track which is well-suited to the gameplay.  As with [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/]Shenzhen I/O[/url], Opus Magnum contains a mini-game, in this case one that seems inspired by go and mahjong.   It's ok, but I preferred the Solitaire from Shenzhen I/O.\n\nIt took me a minute to get used to the synchronized timeline, but once you do it ends up contributing to this game feeling more \"casual\" as you don't have to manage synchronization.  It may eliminate the ability to do some clever tricks, but once I got used to it I haven't felt impeded by it.  The only thing that's really tripped me up so far is not being able to branch / jump as I've made a couple solutions that had some initial setup that only needed to be run the first time.  In both cases,  it was a simple fix to eliminate the initial setup (\"run once\") portion that was tripping me up.\n\nI do wish there was a way to set breakpoints to run until reaching a specific point, an option to zoom out on the design area, and an option to zoom out on the instructions area to show a longer timeline (especially) and more mechanisms (to a lesser degree).  I also found myself wishing that when my solution stopped (by error or manually) the cycle it stopped on would remain indicated in some fashion.  One final little gripe: you can tell a mechanism to repeat everything it had done or reset itself, but for both of these the actual actions taken aren't visible unless you are actively running the machine (it just shows a line indicating how many cycles it will take to do).  When trying to create an action for another mechanism to match a repeated block, it meant having to either start a run to see the actual actions or remembering which cycle within the repeated block the specific instruction was.  For example, trying to time a \"grab\" action on one mechanism to match the \"release\" action in a repeat instruction on another mechanism could mean remembering that the \"grab\" is in the third cycle of the repeating block (as all you would see is the repeat instruction with a line extending out however many cycles the complete repeat takes).", "timestamp_created": 1512860483, "timestamp_updated": 1512860656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782129", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38193417": {"recommendationid": "38193417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004573969", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512865224}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Zachtronics no defrauda, simplemente excelente", "timestamp_created": 1512858427, "timestamp_updated": 1512858427, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38193051": {"recommendationid": "38193051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129459976", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512864123}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a beautiful game that is wonderfully challenging.

En effet, \u00e0 part [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/226960/]Ironclad Tactics[/url][/b] qui est plut\u00f4t un jeu de cartes, m\u00eame si avec une m\u00e9canique assez particuli\u00e8re, ses autres jeux sont tr\u00e8s orient\u00e9s programmation. Soit de mani\u00e8re visuelle ([b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/]SpaceChem[/url][/b], [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/]Infinifactory[/url][/b]), ou de mani\u00e8re bien plus directe, en \u00e9crivant de l'assembleur ([b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/]TIS-100[/url][/b], [b][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/]SHENZHEN I/O[/url][/b]). [b]Opus Magnum[/b] est l'h\u00e9ritier direct de [b]SpaceChem[/b], en reprenant le principe de construction mol\u00e9culaire, mais en le transposant ici \u00e0 l'alchimie, et surtout en sortant la partie instructions de l'aire de jeu m\u00eame, ce qui am\u00e9liore grandement la lisibilit\u00e9. Pour raisonner par analogie, [b]Opus Magnum[/b] est \u00e0 [b]SpaceChem[/b] ce que [b]SHENZHEN I/O[/b] est \u00e0 [b]TIS-100[/b] : l\u00e0 o\u00f9 le premier \u00e9tait rugueux, le second est parfaitement peaufin\u00e9, tant au niveau visuel, sonore, que de la prise en mains. C'est tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant de voir l'\u00e9volution de ce d\u00e9veloppeur, et la mani\u00e8re dont il s'am\u00e9liore \u00e0 chaque nouveau jeu.\n\nConcernant [b]Opus Magnum[/b] m\u00eame, on retrouve une structure de jeu assez similaire aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, o\u00f9 les puzzles sont regroup\u00e9s par pallier, et peuvent donc \u00eatre r\u00e9solus en partie dans l'ordre que l'on veut. En partie seulement car une trentaine sont int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans une histoire simple mais sympathique, racont\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re peu intrusive, un peu comme un [i]visual novel[/i]. Pour pr\u00e9senter la coh\u00e9rence de l'histoire, il est donc n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9soudre tous les puzzles pour avancer. Une trentaine d'autres puzzles, hors histoire, sont d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9s une fois certaines parties de l'histoire pass\u00e9es, et sont pour certains assez cors\u00e9s.\n\nLa m\u00e9canique fondamentale d'[b]Opus Magnum[/b] est la construction de machineries alchimiques. Le but de chaque puzzle est la production d'un produit \u00e0 partir des quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments (terre, eau, air, feu), du sel, de certains m\u00e9taux et du vif-argent, en les assemblant \u00e0 l'aide de leviers, unit\u00e9s de liaison ou de s\u00e9paration, unit\u00e9s de transmutation. Cette machinerie se pilote au travers d'instructions simples : prendre un atome, le d\u00e9placer, le faire tourner, etc. Pour r\u00e9soudre un puzzle, il suffit de produire ce qui est demand\u00e9, quelle que soit la mani\u00e8re, tant qu'elle est valide.\n\nComme toujours dans les jeux de Zachtronics, il n'y a pas tant une notion de score qu'une \u00e9valuation des solutions sur trois crit\u00e8res, ici le co\u00fbt, le nombre de cycles et l'aire utilis\u00e9e. Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 titre indicatif, pour \u00e9ventuellement vous inciter \u00e0 trouver des solutions moins ch\u00e8res, ou plus rapide, ou plus compactes. Comme ce sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des axes antagonistes, vous avez la possibilit\u00e9 de facilement tester plusieurs solutions en parall\u00e8le.\n\n\u00c0 noter que l'une des s\u00e9ries de puzzles annexes pr\u00e9sente la particularit\u00e9 que ceux-ci doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9solus en aire tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e, et qu'une autre s\u00e9rie de puzzles annexes introduit un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment, la quintessence, avec ses m\u00e9canismes de transmutations propres.\n\nComme [b]SHENZHEN I/O[/b] proposait un jeu dans le jeu, le Shenzhen Solitaire, m\u00e9lange diabolique de solitaire (le jeu de cartes) et de mahjong, [b]Opus Magnum[/b] offre le Jardin de Sigmar, version alchimique du solitaire, mais en parlant cette fois-ci de la version o\u00f9 il faut retirer des billes. Gagner 100 parties permet de remporter un troph\u00e9e.\n\nDifficile de ne pas insister sur la finition du jeu, qui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans un \u00e9tat quasi final lors de son acc\u00e8s anticip\u00e9. Celui-ci a d'ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s court (moins de 2 mois), bien g\u00e9r\u00e9, principalement pour corriger quelques bugs ici ou l\u00e0, ajuster certains puzzles en fonction des retours. Disponible pour Windows, Mac et Linux, et dans plusieurs langues dont le fran\u00e7ais d\u00e8s l'acc\u00e8s anticip\u00e9. Outil de g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de GIF \u00e0 partir des solutions valid\u00e9es (vous pouvez voir les miennes [url=http://www.maddingue.net/img/opus-magnum/]ici[/url] ou [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/maddingue/images/?appid=558990]l\u00e0[/url]). \u00c0 ces qualit\u00e9s techniques s'ajoutent des puzzles dont la difficult\u00e9 augmente de mani\u00e8re progressive, m\u00eame s'ils restent globalement plus simples que ceux de leurs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents jeux.

The auto-speedup is a nice touch, though I think manual speed control is missing (maybe it's there somewhere).\n\nThe optimization aspect remains, to minimize cost, area, and cycles.

Even the mini-game within the campaign called \"Sigmars Garden\", a marble based logic game, is really fun to play.  I'd buy it standalone, on mobile maybe? :D (wink wink nudge nudge).

I am not the smartest guy in the world, but there is surely a lot of game here for anyone.  Plus, it already has workshop support and people are already coming up with really cool puzzles. \n\nPros:\n-Great open ended puzzles\n-Great UI\n-Great visuals/asthetic\n-Great music\n-Satisfying sound effects \n-Supppper satisfying to complete puzzles and watch your solutions\n-3 different criteria for measuring success of completion\n-Leaderboards that show your build on histograms in comparison to other players\n-Workshop support!!!!!\n-The story is also pretty interesting so far \n\nCons:\n-I've had to alt-tab twice to fix a bit of frame stuttering......\n-It's going to consume me. \n\n\n**\n30 hours in 3 days.

Unlike other Zachtronics games the mechanics can be learned quickly and aren't very technical.\nUnlike most puzzle games often times it isn't very hard to find a solution. But after finding one it is compared to the solutions of all other players in the categories of \"cost\", \"cyles\" (time) and \"area\". This is were the game gets really interesting. You can optimize your solution to be very good in one of those categories and only ok in the other two. Or kind of good in everything. It's left up to the player. \nIn this sense you need some ambition to truly enjoy this game. But the game does a good job in instilling the desire of wanting to be just a bit better in the player.\n\nBig bonus points for having the option to create a gif of your creations in order to brag about them on twitter.", "timestamp_created": 1512731550, "timestamp_updated": 1512731550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38150128": {"recommendationid": "38150128", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972690233", "num_games_owned": 1695, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2701, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 119, "last_played": 1513972842}, "language": "english", "review": "Opus Magnum is much more accessible than Zachtronics previous games, and possibly their best.  It's the free and open form of gameplay mean you are looking for a solution, rather than the solution. \n\nIt is still a fiendish puzzle game, casting you as an alchemist making machines to transmute and create molecules. But it is much more user friendly and accessible this time, with no restrictions at all. The aim is first to create what-ever based on a given input.   When you have built a machine, you are compared with what everyone else have done, and you can see how effective you have been, based on histograms of average costs  (gold, #cycles and area size), and it is up to you if you want o go back and try  to optimise it for a greater score in either category. It is a great incentive to just try to tweak it just a little bit more to cut down the cost or the cycles it uses, and creep a little bit higher up on statistics.   \n\nThe game give you all the tools from the get go, and there are no penalties, which means you do exactly what you want to complete a level. Whether you then want to spend time optimizing your creation, or just see what kind of silliness you can do. The game has a very gentle learning curve and a very good tutorial which teaches you everything you need to make the machines work. As it gives you all the tools you need from the start, complexity is introduced by the nature of the inputs and outputs, not by giving you new things to learn as you progress.  It already have a lot of levels, and access to user created levels (through Steam Workshop at the moment).  It also looks very good, and the ability to create shareable gifs of your working machines is a stroke of genius.  \n\npost-script: \nTo show the free form nature of this game, here are links two different gifs of two machines I made to solve the same puzzle (the Purified Gold level): \nhttps://gifyu.com/image/plMi\nhttps://giphy.com/gifs/3oxHQmkUabSKFROevC \n\nBottom line, very fun and accessible puzzle game, highly recommended \n", "timestamp_created": 1512730251, "timestamp_updated": 1512730251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38149902": {"recommendationid": "38149902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002235404", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "last_played": 1513929622}, "language": "french", "review": "Je suis simplement fan des jeu de Zachtronics, et quelle ne fut pas ma surprise lorsque j'ai vu qu'il venait d'en sortir un nouveau.

This guy could be playing something interesting instead. This is sooooo boring\". Then he finished whatever he was working on and it worked and it looked so satisfying, I couldn't stop looking at it. I kept thinking to myself - how can something so boring be so satisfying?\nNeedless to say - puzzle games are generally not my thing. But I just had to try it for myself after that. The game isn't expensive, so I figured - why not?\n\nAnd I bought it. Tried it. And it worked. And I felt a little bit smart, because I went for the \"area\" and made the smallest thing possible. And then I went for the next one. And the next one. And... you know, that's just it. It's very satisfying to see something work as intended. And then you start thinking - ok, it works... but... how can I optimize it?\nAnd there's another aspect of satisfaction - seeing someone else do it and compare to your solution.

For a start, it's actually fun. There are four different main colours of marbles each with a corresponding symbol for them, making it much easier for us colourblind folks to tell them apart (very appreciated there), and each matches to another of its exact kind There are also these grey coloured marbles which can match with each of the four basic coloured marbles, or themselves. You get a set number of each (8 of each main coloured one, and four of the grey ones). There are also a set of five paler grey marbles with a different symbol on, and six different coloured unique marbles with metallic colourations. These six marbles are unmatchable except in a specific order, and each metallic marble only matches with one of the paler grey marbles, with the sixth metal marble being able to be cleared without matching it with anything.\n\nThe idea is to clear the board entirely, and as you reach certain milestones, you unlock a nice little story between two friends talking about the game and its past, and learning a little about each other. There's a hundred levels in all, so the price is a little steep, but there's a lot of love gone into this game clearly, so I don't mind too much, and the written story is quite nice and the characters are interesting.\n\nThere is this weird unrelated tutorial thing you have to do first before you can play this game though, but the tutorial is pretty quickly over with and is actually fun where you combine the same marbles together like atoms or something, and to be honest I wish the game had been more about that? But this nice calming, soothing solitaire-esque game is really just too nice to be upset about this.\n\n...\n\nwhat?\n\n...what do you mean that the \"tutorial\" thing isn't unrelated, and that it's

I never find the plots in his games very strong, but the puzzles are outstanding in all of his creations. You spend ages just sitting, staring at the screen trying to figure out what to do. He's easily one of my favourite game designers.\n\n\nOpus Magnum is another great example of his. There are LOADS of puzzles, with many many solutions. In comparison to previous games, the learning curve is very gentle. \nEvery one of the puzzles offers a graph-style leaderboard on the 3 disciplines: \"cost\" (how many expensive parts), \"cycles\" (speed of the solution), and \"space\" (how big it is). You can create as many solutions as you like to beat all three.\n\nTHE KEY POSITIVES:\n\n\n- The game looks and sounds brilliant, feels really industrial\n\n\n- Many many puzzles\n\n\n- Good value\n\n\n- Can have more than 3 solutions to puzzles!\n\n\n\nTHE KEY NEGATIVES:\n\n\n- Game doesn't feel as polished as his other creations yet, for example, the game involves \"playing\" a solution of the assembly line-style creation, but you can't fast forward or rewind the play. On longer creations (especially space/cost saving ones), you can wait 15 seconds to get to the key point you've changed, every time you adjust something, just to find it doesn't work.\n\n\n- There is no zoom option.

The first of them was [url=https://www.kongregate.com/games/krispykrem/the-codex-of-alchemical-engineering]The Codex of Alchemical Engineering[/url]. The visuals and UI design weren't much compared to modern offerings and there was no story at all (good music though), but already there was that addictive problem-solving and optimizing gameplay that people would love in later games.\nAnd it had a sense of Art. There is a great satisfaction in the beauty you can create getting the timings just right, and I still remember exchanging elaborate solution designs in forum threads, using a text format you could paste into the game (it wasn't convenient to use animated gifs or youTube at the time).\n\nNow Opus Magnum is of course the developer revisiting Codex and bringing it to modern standards, with the production values and amount of content we've come to expect from their other games (as well as a decent amount of mechanics changes). For fans that will be enough already. For newcomers, I'll add that this is one the developer's more accessible titles, and is substantially more forgiving in that almost all of the levels leave you unconstrained in how much space and budget you want to use. This also means it's easier to create beautiful solutions, which you can then share using the built-in animated gif generator. If you're in doubt, be sure to take a look at some of the wonderful things people are doing in the community hub.

Um dies zu erreichen kann man auf dem Spielfeld mechanische Arme und verschiedene alchemistische Komponenten welche dadrauf liegende Kugeln manipulieren k\u00f6nnen. Nach dem man alles plaziert hat kann man den Armen Aktionsfolgen wie \"Nimm\" \"Dreh links rum\" \"Lass los\" \"Dreh rechts rum\". Wenn jetzt nichts schief l\u00e4uft wie das die Kugeln gegen Arme oder andere Kugeln knallen, wird das Spiel versuchen 6 mal das Produkt herzustellen und wenn es klappt hat man das Level gewonnen\n\nSPIELSPA\u00df:\nDer Spielspa\u00df kommt in erster Linie daher das egal wie man das Level l\u00f6st, ob effizient oder nicht, wird man am Ende extrem stolz sein auf seine Apperatur die man sich m\u00fchselig zusammen gebaut hat. Selbst wenn sie im grunde nichts besonderes ist, hat man immer freude daran am ende zu sehen wie super alles zusammen funktioniert und sich alles am drehen ist. Was hierbei auch genial ist, sind die GIFs die man sich am Ende des Levels von der Maschine erstellen lassen kann um seine Kunstwerke mit freunden zu teilen.\n\nDesweiteren kann man sich als Ziel setzten eine L\u00f6sung besonders gut zu optimieren und ein Wettrennen mit Freunden zu gestalten den nachdem man ein Level gel\u00f6st hat werden Statistiken zum Spiel angezeigt. \n\nDie Statisken zeigen Werte zu den Gesamtkosten der Apperatur,  der Fl\u00e4che die sie einnimmt und der Geschwindigkeit mit der sie die 6 produkte hergestellt hat. \n\nMan kann zu jedem dieser 3 Werte ein Balkendiagramm sehen welches Auskunft \u00fcber die Werte aller Spieler in der Welt ausgibt um zu sehen wie man Global optimiert hat und die Werte im eigenen Steam Freundeskreis. So dass ihr eure Freunde \u00e4rgern k\u00f6nntet wenn ihr ein Level besser gel\u00f6st habt als Sie :D\n\n\nSCHWIERIGKEIT:\nIch w\u00fcrde sagen das Spiel ist herausfordernd aber definitiv l\u00f6sbar. Im gegensatz zu denn vorherigen Spielen von Zachtronics wie Spacechem oder Shenzhen I/O, wo die Schwierigkeit aus Platzbegrenzungen jeglicher Art kamm, gibt es hier weder Limits an den Platz den eure l\u00f6sung einnimmt (Unendliches Spielfeld zum plazieren von Zeug) noch gibt es eine Grenze wie lang die Aktionsfolgen f\u00fcr die Arme sein k\u00f6nnen. \n\nBei manchen Levels muss man etwas mehr gr\u00fcbeln als bei anderen aber wenn einem effizienz erstmal egal ist, schafft man jedes Level ohne probleme da man sich immer an eine der vielen l\u00f6sungen ran tasten kann in dem man es laufen l\u00e4sst, einpaar neue aktionen hinzuf\u00fcgt und nochmal kurz laufen usw.\n\nSONSTIGES:\n- Super Hintergrundmusik: wird nicht Langweilig sie beim L\u00f6sen von Levels im Hintergrund zu haben\n- Tolles beigelegtes Minispiel das man zwischen durch spielen kann w\u00e4hrend man \u00fcber ein puzzle nachdenkt\n- Interessante Story, in der man durch das L\u00f6sen von Levels weiterkommt\n- Steam Workshop Intergration: Erstellt eure eigenen Levels und versucht die Kreativen Levels anderer Mitspieler zu l\u00f6sen (Unendlicher Wiederspielwert)\n\n\nAlles in allem ist das Spiel Opus Magnum, das bisher beste und zug\u00e4nglichste Zachtronics Spiel", "timestamp_created": 1511545748, "timestamp_updated": 1511545748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37378844": {"recommendationid": "37378844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019575849", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6979, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 40, "last_played": 1513704709}, "language": "french", "review": "Il est beau, intelligent, sollicite votre imagination aussi bien que votre logique.

To do this, you place arms, bonding areas and more and you give them instructions to turn, rotate, and move around. You test your solution, see what's missing, add some more instructions until it does what it's supposed to do.\n\n[h1]Content[/h1]\n[i][u]How much variety is there?[/u][/i]\nOn top of the fixed and telescopic arms that can do most of the job, you're equipped with conveyors, bonding/unbonding areas, areas to convert elements into other elements or combine them, and more. There is an infinity of techniques and design patterns to learn to make your solutions more efficient.\n\n[h1]Interface Design[/h1]\n[i][u]How convenient is it to play[/u][/i]\nA set of thoughtfully designed hotkeys makes it easy to place instructions as fast as you can think of them, just by muscle memory. As of writing this, copy-pasting and scrolling the instruction timeline were added to make the experience completely smooth.\n\n[h1]Sounds[/h1]\n[i][u]How are the music and the SFX?[/u][/i]\nThe sound effects are full of satisfying, mechanical-sounding clicks and thumps. The soundtrack upholds the long tradition of Zachtronics games having superb ambient \"thinking\" music.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n[i][u]How is the visual art?[/u][/i]\nThe backgrounds and details all contribute to giving a medieval-fantasy style alchemy feel to the game.\n\n[h1]Style[/h1]\n[i][u]What makes this game unique?[/u][/i]\nLike all Zachtronics games, this is a game with a very specific audience in mind, a \"game for nerds\" as it were. This game encourages thinking step-by-step, modularly, logically, spatially, out of the box, every kind of thinking you can muster.\n\n[h1]Annoyances[/h1]\n[i][u]What if anything about the game can make you feel bad?[/u][/i]\nThis game might make you feel guilty or helpless when you get stuck on a puzzle. You will need to force yourself away from the game at times, then come back with a fresh mind and try new approaches. The satisfaction of finally making your solution work is worth ten times that frustration though!\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n[i][u]Is this game worth it?[/u][/i]\nIf you've got the kind of personality to patiently, methodically toil your way through complex open-ended puzzles, then absolutely, without a doubt.\n\n[h1]Replayability[/h1]\n[i][u]How much does it give to play this game again?[/u][/i]\nWith a Steam Workshop based puzzle editor and a curated collection of challenges, the Journal of Alchemy, this game will keep you busy for as long as you want.", "timestamp_created": 1511537257, "timestamp_updated": 1511537257, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37353657": {"recommendationid": "37353657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281546685", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510469667}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u70e7\u8111...\u5f88\u559c\u6b22..", "timestamp_created": 1511536399, "timestamp_updated": 1511536399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37343797": {"recommendationid": "37343797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990585139", "num_games_owned": 1312, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511533540}, "language": "english", "review": "Great puzzle game similar to spacechem and zachtronics' other games.

time, it feels like the kind of thing anyone could pick up and have hours of fun with. In that lies sort of the genius of the way its set up. Much like any puzzle game, it introduces a few mechanics in which the game runs, and as it goes it increases in difficulty puzzle after puzzle increasing the complexity. But if you were just looking to complete the puzzles, each of them seems rather simple. For the most part, every puzzle has a rather easy solution you can make for it but it avoids feeling boring or unchallenging for the player, because it gives the player another challenge - to find the \"best\" solution. Playing through each puzzle and finding a solution can be fun much like any other, but you can also take it that step further if you are up to it to find one as fast as you can make it, as cheap, as small, perhaps the best of all three?\n\nBut the reason I really recommend it is not just for its fun puzzles, but because of the satisfaction you get when you complete one. Not only do you get that satisfaction after long time sunk into this project and finally having it work together like a well machine-oiled machine, but you get to SEE it work. With the simple little marbles (er sorry, alchemic proxies) and arms, every solution is so captivating to watch. Whether its one arm doing its best to fulfill the big order of making gold from nothing but lead, or if its a super fast deconstruction of a giant mollecule into its smallest parts - every solution is so satisfying and great to watch, and you can share it with your friends! Use the button in game and make a gif, share it to discord and show all your friends the machines you have made. Even if they know nothing about the game, so much is conveyed through it. Even to people who dont know about the game can look and see the simple beauty of it all.\n\nThe other bits of the game are also very good. The minigame inside is great to refresh yourself. Its simple and not overtly hard but its a good break for thinking, and every so many games you get to hear the characters talk more which is great fun to read. Theres a certain fun to each of the characters, which makes them very likeable and makes them feel like they have their own faults and strengths through just a little bit of text. Course the story isnt perfect by any means, but I can't say that I wasn't looking forward to the little conversations after beating each puzzle and advancing the story of the game.\n\nAll in all, I really do recommend the game. Whether you are a hardcore puzzle person or more casual, there is something in this game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1511520764, "timestamp_updated": 1511520764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

The story line of Opus Magnum is humorous: a nice idea to give a campaign feel and a sense of continuity to puzzle solving. It receives regular updates and as i understand (though i do not own any other games of this company) Zachtronics enjoys a very good reputation among it's customers which is good for EA titles.

Kept waiting for the difficulty to spike, but it never did. There were only one or two head scratching moments in the entire campaign, but they were quickly overcome, and the rest of the time was spent in tedious implementation rather than actual problem solving.\n\nA common theme in Zachtronics games could be: programming puzzles with especially strict constraints and/or lack of normal programming structures. For example in TIS-100 and Shenzhen I/O, you have almost no memory to work with, and while you have the ability to create loops and to jump, you have an extremely limited number of lines of code to work with, meaning that a simple loop takes up half of your available code space.\n\nIn Opus Magnum, you *don't* have jumps, loops, or almost any way at all to reduce code repetition, and you instead have infinite code space. The central challenge then becomes managing extremely long repetitive chains of commands and your ability to visualize what is happening during a 100+ long chain of nearly but not quite identical commands.\n\nThere is a single 'repeat' instruction which is rarely useful since you can't change anything about what is repeated, and is very hard to synchronize.\n\nI notice that I tended to score very well in cost and area, and extremely poorly in cycles, so it's possible that my designs are not sharing the burden of work between many arms, and instead do everything with only a few arms, resulting in incredibly long instruction chains. It's also possible that I'm missing ways to optimize the instructions. I notice that I did not use any of the multi-arms even once, and have no idea why I would even use them.", "timestamp_created": 1511123258, "timestamp_updated": 1511123258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36624075": {"recommendationid": "36624075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171725109", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1471, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 505, "last_played": 1514295455}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e48\u5de7\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7b80\u76f4\u548c\u4e0a\u73ed\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e24\u6837\u3002\n\u53ea\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u4f19\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u662f\u7f16\u7a0b\u8fc7\u7a0b[spoiler]\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u662f\u642c\u7816\u65f6\u7684\u9e92\u9e9f\u81c2[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1511100406, "timestamp_updated": 1511100406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36621749": {"recommendationid": "36621749", "author": {"steamid": "76561198346508139", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512273406}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u8001\u83ca\u89c6\u9891\u5165\u7684\u5751\uff0c\u4e00\u5929\u73a9\u4e86\u4e03\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u3002\u3002\u611f\u89c9\u667a\u5546\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u9ad8\u8fbe50\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u524d\u4ece\u6765\u6ca1\u6709\u73a9\u8fc7z\u793e\u4f5c\u54c1\u7684\u5c0f\u767d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c0f\u4f17\u7cbe\u54c1\u771f\u7684\u592a\u5bf9\u7535\u6ce2\u4e86\u554a\u554a\u554a\u554a\uff01\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba9\u6211skip\u4e24\u9910\u996d\uff08\u73b0\u5728\u997f\u5f97\u8981\u6b7b\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u6bd4\u6606\u7279\u724c\u8fd8\u8981\u4e0a\u763e\uff09\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u7f8e\u672f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548cbgm\u5f88\u60ca\u8273\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u4f5c\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u5f88\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u6545\u4e8b\u5927\u6982\u7b97\u7a0b\u5e8f\u733f\u505a\u5b8c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u5a31\u4e50\u6d88\u9063\uff08\u5bfc\u81f4\u73a9\u7740\u73a9\u7740\u5c31\u505c\u4e0d\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u5c34\u5c2c\u5c40\u9762\uff09\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\u611f\u8c22\u8001\u83ca\u8ba9\u6211\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e86z\u793e\u548c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff01\u4ee5\u53ca\u53c8\u8981\u901a\u5bb5\u87ba\u65cb\u70bc\u91d1\u4e86\uff08\u9003\n", "timestamp_created": 1511094181, "timestamp_updated": 1511094181, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36597524": {"recommendationid": "36597524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015413499", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1682, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511023509}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0442 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0430.\n\u0414\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0438\u0437 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u0432 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0442\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043c\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b \u0443\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438 -

I've passed a few of the games since then because while looking interesting, I figured would be not worth it for how much I would get out of it (looking at you Shenzen IO). So far Opus Magnum has been fantastic. The openness of puzzle solving goes beyond the openness of at least Space Chem. This means instead of getting out of my depth, I can solve the puzzle and then after solving it I can improve it either functionally or aestetically (which this game allows you to make very visually appealing even if not efficient solutions). \n\nPlus there is Sigmar's Garden. It's just a little added bonus that isn't really a big part of the game, but it is the right level of puzzle solving to do while trying to actively listening to a podcast or the like without having my mind get to focused on the puzzle or the podcast to really enjoy the other.

You can't create a solution that will satisfy cost, cycles and area efficiently so you're going to need tailor make a solution for each one.\n\nThe added side game could be a puzzle game in itself and is really unique and challenging.\n\nThis game also has the potential to drive you completely insane. I spent ages on a solution trying to work out how a friend on my leaderboards had gotten one less cycle than me.

and engineering puzzles. A good introduction to Zachtronics' puzzle games, with a friendlier difficulty curve than the others. If building intricate contraptions to solve puzzles sounds appealing, give it a try.\n\n[h1]In-depth[/h1]\nIf you're already familiar with Zachtronics' puzzle games (\"Zachlikes\", as coined by Rock Paper Shotgun), the overall feel of this will be familiar:\n\nYou need to build a mechanism that takes provided inputs and produces an expected output reliably. Then you'll get to see how your solution compares to others on a few axes, and boggle your mind wondering how anyone could possibly have found a solution that's faster / smaller / cheaper than what you've managed.\n\nIn their own way, all of the Zachlikes are ultimately games about synchronization. You need to get everything working just [b]so[/b], and when you do each part of the system will have what it needs at the moment it needs it and everything will run like clockwork. In [i]Opus Magnum[/i] that's fairly literal, too, as your constructions of spinning arms and [strike]marbles[/strike] [i]elemental proxies[/i] will bear a more-than-passing resemblance to the guts of Big Ben.\n\nWhat sets [i]Opus Magnum[/i] apart is that your program for this mechanism is [b]perfectly predictable[/b]. Every other game in Zachtronics' catalog has some notion of feedback; a way that some part of the mechanism can wait for some situation and change how it acts. In [i]Opus Magnum[/i], you have a program loop. Once each component starts running, it remains in lock-step with the others forever. This doesn't seem terribly important at first - or perhaps it feels constraining - but it's the thing that makes this game more approachable than its siblings. If there's an error in your mechanism, it's there for you to inspect, and you can always see what each other piece of the mechanism is doing on each \"tick\" of the program.\n\nIt's also friendlier than the others by being unconstrained - your program can be as long as you'd like, and your mechanism can sprawl to any size you might want. This makes it much easier to find [b]a[/b] solution to each level - though of course if you want to optimize you'll still be trying to make it shorter / smaller / cheaper to improve your score from there.", "timestamp_created": 1510528134, "timestamp_updated": 1510528134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639290", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36476041": {"recommendationid": "36476041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165950540", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 450, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510843547}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f11\u95f2\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u53ef\u4ee5\u73a9\u73a9\u3002\nps\uff1a\u6211\u770b\u5230\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u673a\u5668\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u5148\u8bf4\u660e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u673a\u5668\u548c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u533a\u522b\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u903b\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u673a\u5668\u5219\u662f\u9700\u8981\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u524d\u9762\u51e0\u5173\u8fd8\u80fd\u7528\u7b28\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5230\u4e8c\u5341\u591a\u5173\u5c31\u4e0d\u884c\u4e86\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u8981\u7528\u5230\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u89e3\u540e\u624d\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u73a9\u4e0b\u53bb\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0d\u662f\u7406\u5de5\u79d1\u5c31\u4e0d\u8981\u53bb\u4e70\u4e86\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1510510273, "timestamp_updated": 1510510273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36475935": {"recommendationid": "36475935", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970899214", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1467, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1514791807}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is seriously so well polished and enjoyable.

It takes the bit we all love of the earlier games (trying to optimise the hell out the easier levels to compete on your friends leaderboard) and then just makes that the whole game. It is perfect.\n\nIn addition this game benefits from being purely visual, no need to learn a programming language. The contraptions that you build and the way they animate are stunningly beautiful. It makes the automatic gif recording feature an extra reward for having completed a puzzle. Sharing your own gifs and seeing the gifs others have made is one of the best parts of this game. Every design seems unique and there's rarely one 'correct' way of optimising a particular puzzle so each design is valuable and fun to look at.\n\nThe coding UI, though, is tricky. It took me a while to understand how and when things loop, and even longer before I discovered all the handy key shortcuts for inputting code and copying and pasting... but once I did it unlocked a whole other level of design which gave the game another lease of life. \n\nThere is great depth here, and as I said at the beginning: It's not just the first few puzzles. It's the whole game.

It is an issue they don't hope to tackle until their NEXT game!\n\nThis has never been an issue on any other Zachtronics game .... but it is a big issue now. It goes like this, it appears they designed this aesthetically simple 2d puzzle game with 1080 resolution in mind, and nothing else. I am running 1366x768 ... and at this resolution, the game elements are HUGE ... the UI panels are HUGE ... and the gaming area you can see at any one time is TINY, likewise for the instruction lane that you need to input instructions is SHORT. You can only see 24 instructions at any one time, and this issue is compounded by the fact your view of the instruction pane won't scroll when you are trying to select a larger sequence of instructions, or when you're trying to paste a sequence you just selected (fingers crossed super firmly that at the very least that can be solved, otherwise consider this game a total write off if you want to play anything but the simplest of levels).\n\nthis is a big problem for more than just one reason .... 1st of all, the later puzzles of the game you will be asked to produce products that take up the entire visible gaming area (if you're on less than 1080) .... just imagine all the scrolling around you're going to have to do to manufacture the product, you will never have an over-view of the entire solution you are working on, and furthermore you will never completely see your solution in action unless you render it to gif and view it in a gif viewer .... what the actual feck.\n\nthe 2nd reason this is a significant problem, as if that really wasn't bad enough, is that the game is the most 'accessible' (i.e easiest, and I include optimisations in that summation) zachtronics game yet .... so to get a decent challenge going, you're going to be relying on those levels with larger products ... and if you're using a monitor that is less than 1080 the biggest challenge won't be in solving the puzzles, it will be in enduring the tedium of mousing around the gaming area of a 2d puzzler that absolutely should not be having this scaling problem.\n\npeople with 4k monitors seem to be having an inverse issue to this. But between people on the lower end of the resolution spectrum and the higher end of the resolution spectrum, this has been a frequently made feature request - to FIX this issue.\n\nSo, while I have not seen the issue addressed directly on Opus Magnum's Steam discussion area (where it should be addressed, I would have thought), I instead learn that Zachtronics have absolutely NO intention of fixing it via a Gamasutra podcast ... wtf ? .... Not only that, there is a brazen streak of arrogance in their manner of addressing the problem on that podcast .... basically anyone suffering with this problem has a 'terrible, dank, old laptop that's 5 years old' .... This laptop isn't 5 years old, it is a midrange toshiba 2.5+ years ago. Their attitude to 4k users isn't so toxic, but it is no more considerate. Basically if you're monitor isn't 1080, either larger or smaller, you're the problem .... Well, I put it to you that if a developer working on an aesthetically simple 2d puzzler is having these issues, to such degree that he can't solve it without 'rewriting the game' ... it is the visual programmer, or the game designer, who is the problem ... I am honestly not sure where the buck stops on that one, but I am really shocked that this is an issue. and an issue that won't be resolved.\n\nto add insult to injury, not only have they not addressed this on steam, but they haven't even made a note of it in the minimum tech requirements to play the game on the store page .... how can they in good conscious speak about this problem as brazenly and dismissively as they do on gaming podcasts, acknowledging that it won't be fixed, but still refuse to alert potential customers of this problem ? that seems to be bordering on willfull deceit, imo.\n\nthis game is good in other ways ... but just past the midway point and the UI/scaling problem is already causing serious interface issues where enjoyment is taking a hit, and more time is being spent trying to compensate for the programmer's failings. this will only get worse as the products you are asked to produce get bigger, and the instruction sequences get longer.\n\n\nSo if your monitor is not 1080 ... beware.

As you try to create products throughout the several puzzles in the game to complete, you'll see that you have so much more freedom than in other Zachtronics games to get the task done. This in turn, may not necessarily mean that the game is easier, but it sure feels more welcoming/accessible. (Perhaps that might just be for me though, as of writing this review I'm currently on chapter 4/5 of the main campaign after roughly 11 hours of gameplay.)\n\nI also appreciate the continuation of a story being behind all of the puzzles that you solve, just like how they did it in Shenzhen I/O. As a whole, it's very intriguing as well. This and the combination of the game's music changing from puzzle to puzzle acts as a nice motivation tool to keep going and see what happens next. (Everything's still enjoyable though, sorry if that sounded like they were just extremely minor to the game..which they kind of are, just not.. extremely.)\nOh, and the new solitaire, or rather, mahjong (the matching tile one, not [i]actual[/i] mahjong) mini game, Sigmar's Garden? Hell. Yeah. I kept coming back to it whenever I had some time to add a few wins to the counter or just relax from the main campaign before going back into it. Just like Shenzhen Solitaire it's easy to pick up and semi-hard to master.\n\nIf you're more into the non-coding Zachtronics games like Infinifactory, Spacechem, and The Codex, (especially The Codex,) I highly recommend giving Opus Magnum a try, it's beautiful.

game.\n\nGameplay is to program some alchemy machine arms (fsm) to grab marbles, bond together, put through glyphs, make an appropriate product and to send it into the output.\n\nIn comparison to the previous game (codex of xxxx), it feels much easier to pass the levels because of infinite area and instructions on arms. It is possible to pass most of the scenario levels with at most 2 piston arms, one with a long list of instructions, the other to specifically deal with triangle glyphs, so the deep part of the game lies in optimisation and workshop.\n\nThe game's UI and scenario are exceptional, which create an atmosphere of middle age alchemists' life. The development of characters are decent and backgrounds exactly suit the storyline. It also has an awesome gif capture feature that enables players to show off to friends, and sigmar's garden minigame to take mind breaks. Overall it is a brain consuming puzzle game, and recommended.\n\nAchievements are not enough though, could add some optimisation achievements or stuff like 'pass this level with only length 3 arms'.\nAlso the main scenario (and levels) are a little bit short. Maybe because of early access or too experienced with the previous game.\nAlso he could not make a philosopher's stone. Considering even Atelier Sophie could make one, this protagonist must need further practice and research into alchemy in order to become a successful alchemist.\n\nP.S. The Glyph of Disposal seems to cause flux pollution. For the environment of our beautiful city, please refrain from overuse of such glyphs.\n\n_=!![]+!![]+!![],__=_*_+_-!![]+_,___=_+__<<_^__*_+_;____=[][({}+\"\")[_+_-!![]]+({}+\"\")[_/_]+(_/![]+\"\")[_/_]+(\"\"+![])[_]+(\"\"+!![])[_-_]+(\"\"+!![])[_/_]+([][!![]]+\"\")[_-_]+({}+\"\")[_-!![]+_]+(\"\"+!![])[_-_]+({}+\"\")[_/_]+(\"\"+!![])[_/_]][({}+\"\")[!![]+_+!![]]+({}+\"\")[_/_]+(!![]/![]+\"\")[_/_]+(\"\"+![])[_]+(\"\"+!![])[_-_]+(\"\"+!![])[_/_]+([][!![]]+\"\")[_-_]+({}+\"\")[_+_-!![]]+(\"\"+!![])[_-_]+({}+\"\")[_/_]+(\"\"+!![])[_/_]];__$=!![]<<_+___;_$_=\"_$$=\\\"_$=\\\\\"+(_*_*__-_)+\"\\\\\"+(_/_^___)+\"\\\\\"+(___-_)+\"\\\\\"+(___-__)+\"\\\\\"+(___-_*_)+\"\\\\\"+(___/_^___|_)+\".\"+\"\\\\\"+(___/_^___)+\"\\\\\"+(___-_)+\"\\\\\"+(_+___-__+_)+\"\\\\\"+(_+___-__|_)+\"\\\\\"+(_+_|_<<___^_)+\"\\\\\"+(_/_^___-__)+\"\\\\\"+(_+__<<_|__^_)+\"\\\\\"+(___-_)+\"\\\\\"+(_+_|_<<___^_)+\"\\\\\"+(_+___-__+_)+\"\\\\\"+(__+__*_^___+_)+\"\\\\\"+(_+_^___-__)+\";\\\";\";(____(_$_))();(____(_$$))();_$_=_$(_<<___^_,_<<___^_|__,_<<___^__,_^__<<_,_<<___^_|__,_*_*_*_+_*_*_,_<<_+_^___,_*__|__,_*_*_*_+_*_*_,_<<___^_|__,_+_|_<<___^_,_+_<<_^_<<_,_+__<<_/_,__$*(_*_*_*_|_)+(__$-__-_),__$*(_<<___)+(_<<_|__*__),__$*(_*_<<_|__)+(_^__),__$*(__$>>_/_)+(__$-_),__$*(_*_*_*_)+(__$-_),__$*(_<<_+_^___)+(__<<_),__$*(_*_*_*_+__)+(_|__),__$*(_|__*_*_)+(_<<_^__),__$*(_*__|__<<_)+(__-_),_<<_^__*_,_+_<<_^_,_+_<<_^_,_+__<<_/_,_^__*_,_^__+_*__);(____(_$_))();", "timestamp_created": 1509009967, "timestamp_updated": 1509013547, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584906", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36005351": {"recommendationid": "36005351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030434695", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509788573}, "language": "english", "review": "Zachtronic games are amazing.

It's beautiful to watch, and incredibly fun to solve the puzzles. The difficulty is definitely lower than games like Spacechem because you are not limited by space or number of waldos. However, I think that makes the game great because you have the freedom to solve puzzles less efficently and go back later.\n\nSigmar's Garden is also quite fun. I was a little confused at first but now it's a very relaxing game that requires a little less thought than the actual puzzles.\n\nMy only concern is the quantity of puzzles. The story felt a little short, probably because of the lower difficulty. Luckily, there's still high scores to beat and custom puzzles to solve. I'm hoping there are more achievements added, specifically \"challenge\" modes of levels, like how Spacechem/TIS had achieves for beating levels in a certain way.\n\nEdit: The game has been updated with great new content! We have a new space-limited mode, which is actually amazing because it plays like SpaceChem- you need to be extremely wary of the space you take up.", "timestamp_created": 1508964711,

This would help immensly with automation, but I entirely understand why this feature probably won't be included in the game. \n\nI feel like I would be doing the game a disservice to compare it to Codex of Alchemical Engineering, even though it is for all intents and purposes conceptually similar, because this is Codex revisited with an artists eye. Absolutely go and play Codex if you want to compare the two, but I think that Opus Magnum will come out on top no questions asked. It is so polished and every puzzle just feels so good to build your own way. I've probably been having far too much fun building these massive rube-goldbergesque contraptions for even the simplest puzzles, but it's nice seeing everything working together.\n\nAs I've touched upon earlier the art style is gorgeous, and this extends into the interfaces and the hub from which you can select the various puzzles.

I think that there should have been another sequence wherein you start to tear down the actual alchemical workstation, but I'm not sure how those puzzles would function (Perhaps using the glyph of disposal to take your previous solutions as input and break it down, but I feel that this idea is rather clunky) \n\n100 games of Sigmar's Garden won. I feel good about how I managed to slowly understand the rules of the game, figuring out what moves gave me the most options and which among those were good moves. \n\nIt feels like there could maybe have been another chapter to the main campaign, but I'm not at all sure where it would go or how it could build on the existing game.

Shenzhen was great but I prefer a more fantasy settings of Opus Magnum; and especially when compared to SpaceChem I love how it offers you much more freedom - you choose the location of both input and output which may make it easier, but lets you get a lot more creative. Graphics are much improved and feel fresh compared to CAD-like Shenzhen. The story lets you feel like a powerful alchemist and while perhaps a bit cliched is really fun to explore and I would love to see expansion packs that explore the world a bit more. \n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game enough. If you like puzzles then this is definitely one of the best games on the market, if not THE best one. I really love it that what I do really means something - you're not just solving one puzzle after another to solve some mystery, but you get a lot of opportunities to produce something that will be of importance - like fuel for an airship, waterproof sealants for ships, or a device that will let the surplus lead be turned into gold. Solving every puzzle, however, lets you advance and explore the story so your price is twofold, at least for me. \n\nThe price is low for the amount of fun, and the game, though Early Access, is not buggy and seems very polished. It's truly a staple of quality.\n\n[b]What works[/b]\n1. The setting. I like it much more than the previous ones, and would really love to see it explored a bit more. \n2. The graphics - they are definitely a huge improvement over previous ones and are, simply put, gorgeous. The world is colorful, elements symbols are clear, and the way machinery works made me simply keep staring at the working machines for a long time - they are very elegant, yet simple, something that a person that loves engineering can truly appreciate. \n3. Steam Workshop - you can easily download and solve hundreds of different puzzles available online and easily make your own, which allows for an almost endless replayability. \n4. Sigmar's Garden - a rather simply minigame, but really addictive. \n5. And finally puzzles themselves - the difficulty progression curve is handled very smoothly, and you get a really well-planned tutorial that explains pretty much everything in a very simple way; the graphs that show how effective your design is compared to those of other players makes you feel really competitive, striving for the utmost perfection; and they're no longer too constrained due to the predefined inputs and outputs like in the previous games. Overall, solving them was much more fun than in any other puzzle game .\n\n[b]What doesn't work[/b]\n1. There are not that many metals available - just six, but that's a nitpick. \n2.

It blends the followable, mechanical interface of Spacechem with the simple-to-understand-and-execute objectives of TIS-100 or SHENZEN I/O without you needing to have a .pdf open in another window. \n\nOn top of that, it forgoes any notion of psuedoscience (\u00e0 la Spacechem) and instead builds a world grounded in its own fiction. The game (and therefore story) isn't terribly long but it accomplishes some admirable worldbuilding and character development in that time.\n\nGreat all around, Zachtronics continues to deliver!", "timestamp_created": 1508622550, "timestamp_updated": 1508622550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35902825": {"recommendationid": "35902825", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970545070", "num_games_owned": 1351, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508883024}, "language": "english", "review": "Opus Magnum has the definite \"feel\" of space-chem (probably hards back to joining atoms) but with a new and very elegant system of rules and processes to learn and manipulate.\n\nOnce again,  put the phone off the hook, turn your out-of-office alert on email and just run with it because this is all you're going to be thinking about for the next few days / weeks / months.\n", "timestamp_created": 1508620235, "timestamp_updated": 1508620235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35901913": {"recommendationid": "35901913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023686194", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509198118}, "language": "english", "review": "if you like any ideas in any zachtronics games but haven't been able to sink your teeth all the way in this is by far the best of them and the ideas felt much more intuitive at least to me", "timestamp_created": 1508617560, "timestamp_updated": 1508617560, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469256", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35901653": {"recommendationid": "35901653", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995492428", "num_games_owned": 588, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1514111764}, "language": "german", "review": "Mal wieder ein wunderbares Knobelspiel von Zachtronics.

This allows for a lot more leniancy in design of your solutions which, while making the game \"easier\" to create a functional solution, also creates a lot of potenital for optimization and faster running solutions. There are a few hidden features which should be more advertized (control drag to copy instructions or components, A/D to rotate selections while dragging) but it's pretty mninor. The story mode also feels a lot shorter than the other titles (It took this reviewer ~8 hours to complete, with fairly average solutions for someone not completely dedicated in finding optimal solutions). This isn't neccisairly a bad thing, with the promised additonal puzzles from community puzzles and the wealth of options in the Steam Workshop. The story is also quite charming, if a tad cliched. The artwork is wonderfully vibrant and colourful, and complements the story and gameplay well.\n\nThe solitaire mode, a Mahjong-solitaire like puzzle, is also very fun (and maybe even a little more addicitive than the main game!), set up so that every game is winnable from the start, which ensures the only frustration you get from a failed attempt is your own fault! (It also doesn't tell you when you've failed, which is a lot more satisfying than a pop-up exclaiming that you've lost!)\n\nOverall a great game, if a little more forgiving than fans of Zachtronics' unique brand of puzzle might have come to expect, but for the price, (for this user) a definate buy!", "timestamp_created": 1508611426, "timestamp_updated": 1508611426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.605956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35897889": {"recommendationid": "35897889", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036975440", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "last_played": 1514725648}, "language": "french", "review": "Comme tu le dis, c'est un Zachtronics, ce simple label me suffit pour d\u00e9clencher un achat.\n\nL'opus pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent qui s'en rapproche le plus serait SpaceChem (SC). Tu as ton plan de travail en 2D et bras pour manipuler tes \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\nJe dirais qu'opus magnum (OM) est un SC beaucoup plus accessible.

The rules are puzzling at first, but the elements of strategy and forward thinking gradually develop through play. It's relaxing to map out your pathing strategy around the quicksilver and metal marbles, or to find ways to cut through bunched up lanes. Overall, a great complement with absentminded YouTube watching. The attached game, Opus Magnum, is a pretty neat programming puzzler too.\n\n\nIn all seriousness, the main thing to mention is that Opus Magnum is the most beginner-friendly Zachtronics game yet. For instance, you get a luxurious unlimited scrolling canvas for you to make incredibly inefficient contraptions.  This makes the game so much less frustrating to work through, as you won't be constrained by space was you were in SHENZHEN I/O, more so in TIS-100, and infuriatingly so in SpaceChem. \n\nFor all the discussion about the game being easier, the real difficulty lies in defeating your friends' histograms, as Zach has somehow realized that friends do a much better job at motivating better solutions than a difficulty wall.  And really, there's something a lot more intuitive about clockwork arms passing around marbles, as opposed to trying to grok how XBUS works or avoiding message collisions between TIS-100 nodes.  As such, this is probably the most friendly game to start with for a newbie Zach-like player. \n\nThat the solutions often move like beautiful clockwork and can be easily exported as animated gifs also helps with the feeling of recreational accomplishment.\n\n\n\nUpdate 10-26-2017: (Finished the main story campaign, and ordered the iron-on patch)\n\nWow golly this game could use a way to speed up to later breakpoints, or to skip state to a program location. And divine architect help you if you need to insert more steps near the beginning of a long work-in-progress instruction chain, where you need to delay the rest of the concurrent multi-page instruction sequences in all the other components.\n\nStill, it's very doable to beat this game, but the last few levels involve some very intricate bonding patterns, and can take a ton of instructions to complete. In the end, I was satisfied with how the plot wraps up, though the level design was a grind for me at the end.\n\nI'm not sure if the depth of the systems and puzzle design lives up to those of SHENZHEN I/O, but the relative simplicity may be a strong reason to recommend this game as a first Zachtronics game. For more theoretical players, I'm not sure if the systems here are Turing Complete, and I can't imagine how you would implement NAND (perhaps the needed components can be introduced in a later update?).\n\nThat said, one could argue that it is elegance, not systems design, that shines in high skill play here. Along those lines, I'm looking forward to seeing some really elegant animated solutions from others. Just seeing Notch's solutions on Twitter just proves how messy my problem solving style was.\n\nIn the end, this setting and story is easily my favorite out of all the other Zachtronics games, being strongly evocative as a mashup of The Diamond Age and The Baroque Cycle. This is an incredible remake of The Codex Of Alchemical Engineering, and suggesting the latter flash game as a demo doesn't do justice to the massive improvements since the last decade.\n\nIf Opus Magnum was this much of an improvement, I'm kind of curious what a remake of Bureau of Steam Engineering could be like.

The gameplay is well designed for optimization, but I don't personally get much enjoyment out of optimizing the cost, size and time of a device with a completely abstract size, cost and run time.\n\nTo expand:\n\nSpaceChem, Infinifactory and Shenzhen I/O deal with real engineering concepts. Reactors are expensive so as an employee we would try to build fewer of them. A factory exists to produce a product so we would want to reduce the time it takes for a run cycle to maximize factory output. Smaller circuit boards can fit into smaller devices. Etc. These all fit the role that you play as an engineer. The alchemy machine is not physically represented in the game world (or reality) and is therefore a departure from past titles. It has no equivalent in our world apart from magic. Measuring the cost of a machine that can turn lead into gold is irrelavent in an economic sense, whereas real world chemicals have a known value. We have no idea how long alchemy takes since it has no bearing on gameplay or story and has no real world equivalent; the process could be effectively instantaneous for all we know. SpaceChem reactors could arguably be the same way, but sending chemicals through a pipe to a tanker does give us some kind of time frame. The alchemy machine is not represented physically and has apparently infinite internal space, and there is no need to optimize an infinte resource from an engineering point of view. \n\nI should specify that none of these issues I have relate to the puzzle component of the game. If your motivation is to puzzle for the sake of puzzling then yes, this game works very well. If, however, you are role-playing an engineer within the game world, which I derive enjoyment from, then the sudden lack of these underlying principles is a disappointing departure. Evidentally I am the only person who feels this way, but I stand by my assessment of engineering.\n\nOne last point: this game could have taken the opportunity to challenge you to optimize anything at all.

Es gibt keine vorgegebene L\u00f6sung; wie bei allen Tachtronic-Spielen ist der Weg das Ziel, was man jederzeit anpassen / verbessern / optimieren kann.

I, personally, was particularly excited to dive into it because (as much as I like all Zachtronics games) I prefer the visual puzzles and the satisfaction of moving gizmos in a complex machine to the code-based puzzles of more recent titles like Shenzhen I/O.\n\nAs for people who have never touched any Zachtronics games, I wouldn't necessarily say that this is a better entry point than any of the other games. It basically depends on what looks most interesting to you; SpaceChem for chemistry, Infinifactory for industry, Opus Magnum for Alchemy, and Shenzhen for electronic engineering. Beneath the theme, they all challenge your brain in a similar way, with freeform puzzles with infinite solutions, challenging you to find the fastest/smallest/cheapest design. If the idea of such \"creativity puzzles\" is appealing, you really can't go wrong with any of those games.\n\nAfter my short time with Magnum Opus, I would personally place it in a close second to Infinifactory, with SpaceChem coming in third.\n\nAn important note on Early Access: Zachtronics tends to have an unusual approach to early access releases, and Opus Magnum is no exception. Rather than releasing a beta version, Zach tends to more or less finish the game before it can even be purchased. There's rarely missing content or features, and the only changes tend to be very minor bug fixes or tweaks (with the exception of Infinifactory which was a little more ambitious, and had an extra story chapter). My guess would be that the \"full version\" will only differ in having more player-made puzzles. So, if you're the sort of person who shies away from early access, I'd say there's little to worry about here.

La raison: l'objet n'est pas strictement de r\u00e9soudre des puzzles, cet objectif facilement atteignable induisant pourtant d\u00e9j\u00e0 une satisfaction (on produit une solution et on observe en d\u00e9miurge sa cr\u00e9ature m\u00e9canique dans l'accomplissement de son oeuvre)  ; mais de les r\u00e9soudre au mieux possible.  Le mieux, bien que d\u00e9finit pourtant par des indicateurs comptables stricts (co\u00fbt, cycles, zone), \u00e9tant ressenti par le joueur, c'est le miracle des concepts Zachtronics, comme le plus \u00e9l\u00e9gant.\nQu\u00eate d'\u00e9l\u00e9gance donc et de perfection qui produit un satisfaction croissante jusqu'\u00e0 la jubiltation lorsque l\u2019artisan-joueur produit une m\u00e9canique qu\u2019il ressent comme parfaite (chef-d'oeuvre qu'il pourra immortaliser et partager en vid\u00e9o).  \nLa douceur de cette qu\u00eate n'est pas \u00e9trang\u00e8re au principe de classement unique qui fait loi chez Zachtronics : un classement par r\u00e9partition par tranches. Ce flou (on ne saura jamais si l'on a LA meilleure solution, on pourra se bercer de cette douce illusion, mais uniquement qu'on fait partie du groupe toujours plus restreints des artisans les plus \u00e9l\u00e9gants) induit ce qu'il faut de stimulation sans livrer le joueur \u00e0 la frustration et \u00e0 l'\u00e9puisement d'une qu\u00e8te obsessionelle pour LA premi\u00e8re place au classement. Tr\u00e8s sain.

Not worth 20 dollars. I'd place it at 10 dollars but if you're desperate for a new programming puzzler It's worth it.\n\nThe puzzles are programmed with tape on a hexagonal field. This is a very limited game because of this. Looping and control structures are extremely limited, to the point of being almost non existent. This means that your instructions will frequently be quite drawn out. It takes awhile to produce solutions for the larger puzzles and this isn't because they are difficult. The puzzles in this game never really get particularly difficult. It's the easiest zachtronics game. The nature of the game can make it take awhile to solve large puzzles, but doesn't allow for the puzzles to be hard. Even when the play field is constrained it's never that much of a brain bender. Of course, if you play for optomization I'm sure you can find plenty of challenge.\n\nHere's the thing: being an easier, less difficult game isn't a bad thing. If you play this expecting to be driven to insanity over mindbenders you're going to be dissapointed. If you play this to relax and zone out it's quite good. Turn off the background music, play something low key and just toy around with puzzles. They're still satisfying to solve because they take quite a bit of tinkering to function just right and it's fun to watch your solutions in motion. It's a good game, but because of limits inherent to the game itself it feels a bit overpriced at the moment.", "timestamp_created": 1515215802, "timestamp_updated": 1515215802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39100299": {"recommendationid": "39100299", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990869959", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515197428}, "language": "english", "review": "Every Zachtronics game is an instant buy on the release for me.

I highly recommend it to anyone who loves puzzle games.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515083168, "timestamp_updated": 1515083168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39053288": {"recommendationid": "39053288", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045149740", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 270, "playtime_forever": 1593, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 385, "last_played": 1515079287}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]Yet another masterpiece from Zach\n    [*]Simplest game yet\n    [*]Increasing difficulty of puzzle designs\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]If you\u2019ve never played a Zachtronics game before this is the easiest to understand and should start with this game. If you\u2019re a hardcore fan this game does limit what you can do compared to their previous games.\n\n    [*]First the game has a story that I completely skipped because who plays these game for stories. If you want a reason for what you\u2019re doing the game does that with each puzzle correlating with what\u2019s happening in the story. \n\n    [*]Now the meat of the game, you do have open ended puzzles that you get with all Zachtronics\u2019 games with the easiest intro into their games for newer people. You don\u2019t have to worry about syncing issues as the solution will make all items pad to the same time. This will make your solution slow but allows those that might struggle get a solution out instead of dealing with timings. You can still tweak it and make assembly line or anything that previous games could but with the new restrictions you can\u2019t change.\n\n    [*]The game is hex based instead of usually grid which means that rotating at different distances doesn\u2019t move items equally, but can be used to move items quicker if needed. The solution is fixed and can be rotated but not mirrored so you can waste time thinking your solution is good to only have it facing the wrong way. I don\u2019t remember if this was an issue in SpaceChem. The dumbest thing they didn\u2019t keep was debugging, you can\u2019t back step or add a function to stop right before a known issue so you can try and figure it out like previous games. This really makes it annoying to always having to replay and wait to pause right before the error and not have the ability to cycle backward or forward. I don\u2019t understand why this was not added.\n\n    [*]Your move sets are on a pictogram full of as many lines for each arm or piston that allow you to copy, move and rotate your whole solution and any part in-between along with the pictogram version of your solution if you need to quickly change any aspect of a mistake or redesign. This simple UI is so good. If you learn the hotkeys you can punch solutions out fast and rework with such ease. This design is great and hope to see in future titles.\n\n    [*]Once you beat the game you get 10 insanely limited space puzzles that will please those that love the most minimal area designing of solutions. Personally I don\u2019t care much for those. You also have an atom matching minigame that is optional that is a good timewaster like minesweeper or solitaire that would be good as a separate game for those that love playing these games at work. These are randomly generated and do require some thought as you can lock yourself into a loss and be forced to start a new game. You do get more story if you play enough of these, again I didn\u2019t care so I didn\u2019t do many of them. Just to see what this minigame was all about.\n\n    [*]Overall the game is a great addition to the Zachtronics\u2019 style game with it being only second to Infinifactory. I beat this game unlike SpaceChem so I already like it more. It\u2019s easier to get into yet puzzles that are still just as great and some that are hard. But nothing totally like the complexity near the end of SpaceChem. The ease of creating solutions and being able to quickly edit them is a great thing even with the annoyance of no back stepping. This is the best starting point unless they release more in the future that make it even easier to play\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]A+[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $18 [/b]\n[b]Completed in: 25 hours [/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*] Factorio\n    [*]Infinifactory\n    [*]Prelogate\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1515082252, "timestamp_updated": 1515082304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39051300": {"recommendationid": "39051300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032797108", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 341, "last_played": 1516052320}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f", "timestamp_created": 1515078630, "timestamp_updated": 1515078630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547038", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39044905": {"recommendationid": "39044905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198412608163", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 495, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 495, "last_played": 1515591261}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u7b80\u76f4\u6709\u6bd2\u54c8\u54c8\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u667a\u5546\u4e0d\u591f\u7528\u7cfb\u5217-.-\u628a\u7f16\u7a0b\u601d\u60f3\u548c\u70bc\u91d1\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff0c\u4eab\u53d7\u601d\u8003\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\u5427\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1515065617, "timestamp_updated": 1515067991, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39035741": {"recommendationid": "39035741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198234817072", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1515495373}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u8ba9\u4f60\u611f\u89c9\u81ea\u5df1\u5f88\u806a\u660e\u7684\u795e\u5947\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1515038941, "timestamp_updated": 1515038941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39015617": {"recommendationid": "39015617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261433506", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514995119}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65f6\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u53bb\u54ea\u513f\u4e86\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1514995340, "timestamp_updated": 1514995340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39013123": {"recommendationid": "39013123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053400872", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514998026}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice-looking game.\nUnfortunately, this is the only positive moment I found here.\n\nEvery time I'm trying to play it, I find myself thinking \"in SpaceChem it was better\". \n\nHexagonal field is ok, it requires a significant mindshift, and it's interesting. But everything else... \n\nSpaceChem was a puzzle \u2013 the requirement was to assemble complex molecules in very limited space. \nOpus Magnum is totally casual \u2013 field is endless, so just put more manipulators and other stuff, if you need. Game doesn't make a challenge for you. Seeing other player's incredible super-minimalistic solutions is not a real motivation.\n\nInstead, Opus Magnum introduces own, totally artifical restirctions. \n\nFirst, shape of molecula matters now: proper bounds between proper atoms are not enough, now you must properly rotate them also. As result, often you have to rebuild your completely working solution because two atoms are connected under wrong angle. \n\nSecond \u2013 alchemical tools are very inconvenient. Join 3 atoms in a row \u2013 so primitive task, but here you'll have to build some crazy machinery around, because atoms can be joined either one by one, or 4 at once but under 120deg angle. \n\nBoth of these restrictions are not looking reasonable. They are annoying. Nobody even tries to explain why angles are so important in alchemy world, or why noone invented simple binding glyph for 3 atoms in a row. There is a difference between solving a puzzle and fighting a game inconvenience, and Opus Magnum doesn't understand it, unfortunately.\n\nIn SpaceChem you opened new advanced tools with a time (often accordingly to storyline), so it was a sense of progress in the game. You was interested to play further to find more content and much more interesting puzzles.\nIn Opus Magnum you immediately have access to everything you may ever need \u2013 except of a few very very special tools, available only in special levels (I saw 3 of them so far). No progress, nothing new \u2013 just again and again build the same overcomplicated machines for primitive tasks. Booooooring.\n\nFinally, in SpaceChem there was a storyline \u2013 and gods, it was amazing. I won't even say about unique \"boss fight\" levels \u2013 just story itself. Pieces of exposition, describing locations, characters, situations, feelings and actions \u2013 it was like a real book, and I greedily solved puzzles one by one just to read next chapter.\nAnd in Opus Magnum... well... we have that dialogs between levels. That soooooooooo interesting dialogs about love potion for old duke and about exiting of making an super-lightweight alhemist's rope. Dialogs, full of empty meaningless phrases, imitating a real communication. I can't say without swearing how boring and useless that dialogs are. 90% of phrases can be completely removed from the game and nothing will change. It's an epic fail. \n\nAs conclusion. I'll repeat myself: SpaceChem was a hard and interesting puzzle game; Opus Magnum is a nice-looking casual time-killer. \nI see no reasons to spend money on Opus Magnum \u2013 better go play SpaceChem if you didn't.", "timestamp_created": 1514990723, "timestamp_updated": 1515091452, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496206", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39011936": {"recommendationid": "39011936", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122961251", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514904576}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u6b3e\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u521b\u610f\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4f11\u95f2\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u9aa8\u7070\u73a9\u5bb6\uff0c\u90fd\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514988509, "timestamp_updated": 1514988509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39007044": {"recommendationid": "39007044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179743259", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514977625}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u70bc\u91d1\u672f\u88ab\u7981\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514977674, "timestamp_updated": 1514977674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39005352": {"recommendationid": "39005352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198230932908", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1180, "last_played": 1516022448}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u7231\u6b7b\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1514973438, "timestamp_updated": 1514973438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38997130": {"recommendationid": "38997130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030164489", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 560, "last_played": 1516058979}, "language": "english", "review": "Opus Magnum is a must-buy for any fan of programming puzzle games and Zachtronics games.

Opus Magnum is an amazing title that inspires the engineer, artist and alchemist within us all. 9/10 \n\nPrior titles from Zachtronics, such as TIS-100 and Shenzen I/O, were a blast, but through the rigidity that is inherent in the environment of both titles (via the limitations of assembly programming/computer science principles), creativity is sacrificed and you must force yourself to see solutions that are appropriate within the context of the games logical limitation(s).\n\nPROS:\n+ This is where Opus Magnum really shines and easily becomes the most accessible title from Zachtronics. You aren't simply given a manual and then 'stuck' within certain low-level logic operations (transistors, logic gates, binary manipulation, registers, etc.) guiding your design decisions.\n+ In Opus Magnum, you aren't looking for THEE solution, you are given the freedom to invent ANY solution that assembles the necessary output (product) from the originally provided reagents. \n+ Opus Magnum is a beautiful visual representation of algorithms. Algorithm being defined as :  A finite set of unambiguous instructions that, given some set of initial conditions, can be performed in a prescribed sequence to achieve a certain goal and that has a recognizable set of end conditions.\n+ The pool of 12 instructions that is utilized when 'programming' life into your various alchemy related mechanisms is elegant and effecient. Not having to actually write these instructions, but merely snap them into the timeline, births the freedom of creativity I was mentioning earlier.\n\nCONS:\n- WHY IS THERE NO 'BACK' (<--) BUTTON after automating the system? You have stop, step, and play, but when debugging, a simple back button would work wonders! Especially on longer solutions where your code (instructions) run for a considerable amount of time before reaching the appropriate section you wish to alter.\nIf you don't pause the cycling of your machine prior to this section of interest, you will have to run it again, from the beginning, and 'catch' the spot you want to edit. \n\nSHAMELESS PLUG:\n  Check out some of my current working solutions: \n  https://giphy.com/channel/kylenull", "timestamp_created": 1514828955, "timestamp_updated": 1514829197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.659653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38939138": {"recommendationid": "38939138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033467616", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514985767}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u30ed\u30dc\u30c3\u30c8\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u5236\u5fa1\u30d1\u30ba\u30eb\u3002\u539f\u5b50\u3092\u5206\u96e2\u30fb\u7d50\u5408\u3055\u305b\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5b8c\u6210\u5f62\u3092\u76ee\u6307\u3059\u3002\u5358\u306b\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3059\u308b\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u3001\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\u306e\u30b3\u30b9\u30c8\u3092\u5207\u308a\u8a70\u3081\u305f\u308a\u3001\u9ad8\u901f\u5316\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3068\u30011\u3064\u306e\u9762\u3067\u3082\u4f55\u5ea6\u304b\u89e3\u6cd5\u3092\u8003\u3048\u3089\u308c\u308b\u3002\n\u30cf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\uff08\u8155\u306e\u914d\u7f6e\uff09\u3068\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30a6\u30a7\u30a2\uff08\u5236\u5fa1\u547d\u4ee4\uff09\u304c\u3042\u308b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5206\u96e2\u3067\u304d\u3001SpaceChem\u306e\u6b20\u70b9\u3060\u3063\u305f\u30b9\u30d1\u30b2\u30c6\u30a3\u30d7\u30ed\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\u3092\u5f37\u5236\u3055\u308c\u308b\u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30b9\u304c\u6e1b\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306f\u5b09\u3057\u3044\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514819424, "timestamp_updated": 1514819424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39438048": {"recommendationid": "39438048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028092154", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2730, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1516279475}, "language": "english", "review": "The puzzles are quite intriguing and the text based background actually helps a lot to set the atmosphere.

I would still recommend this game because the following won't apply to most users, but if you intend to play on a laptop or iterate on level solutions, beware.\n\nThe core concept of this game -- programming alchemical machines to build products -- is fun and well-executed. The levels are challenging and feel well-paced. The game's artwork is gorgeous and immersive. Almost all the goodwill earned by those things is wiped away by a variety of small irritants that added together degrade the experience.\n\nLet's start with performance. This game uses CPU like it's mining bitcoin. It's not at all clear what in the game is so expensive, but whatever it is drives the \"play-on-battery\" life of this game down into \"maybe an hour or so\" territory. That's considerably worse than more performant alternatives in this space (e.g. Factorio) and makes it difficult to play what should be a resource-friendly puzzler on an unplugged laptop.\n\nOf course, if you're unplugged, you might also not have Internet access. That's fine -- the game still runs -- but your friends' records aren't cached locally. If you were aiming to compete with one of them you'd best maintain a connection from time-to-time, which sounds easy in theory but results in multiple Steam restarts in practice, given Steam's inability to transition on- or offline cleanly.\n\nFinally, the game lacks a \"exit but don't save\" function and its absence is totally baffling. Suppose you're hard at work trying to hit a particular goal on a level -- M cycles, N area, whatever -- and you try a new design that's worse than your previous one. You have no ability, as a player, to exit the machine *without* saving your progress. If you want to design iterative solutions you need a new solution for each iteration or the ability to reconstruct your previous iteration from memory. It's an infuriating flaw in the save mechanic and is unfortunate because the game otherwise goes out of its way to preserve your work, even when you don't want it to.", "timestamp_created": 1516885978, "timestamp_updated": 1516886099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39604183": {"recommendationid": "39604183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046306049", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 451, "last_played": 1516888363}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Zachtronics mais uma vez com um excelente jogo de quebra-cabe\u00e7as.

Unlike a couple other Zachtronics games, this one doesn't really require you to rtfm and learn new syntax. So I'd say it\u2019s certainly more accessible. I think this is probably the best Zachtronics game, and I think that if you had fun with space chem you would likely enjoy this one as well. \n\nOne of the best things about this game is how open it is. It's not the kind of puzzle with one solution. Now this is good because 1) you're not forced into one direction, and so things are as easy as you want them to be (of course within the context of each puzzle) 2) you can be creative and make something totally unique, which is beautiful.\n\nAnother big plus for me here is that when you complete a puzzle you're shown the high scores of your friends as well as a bar graph of the general player base. These high scores are separated into 3 categories- cycles, size, cost. \n\nThis is huge for replayability. You can play the puzzle your first time just solving it as quickly and naturally as possible. Then the high scores will be revealed and you think \"oh poop!\" Now you can solve it another 2 or 3 times to try and optimize each category as much as you can.\n\nAnd this is where i think one of the best things of this game comes from- the difference in difficulty between solving the puzzles, and fully optimizing them is huge. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516844959, "timestamp_updated": 1516844959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39593943": {"recommendationid": "39593943", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986886471", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 49, "last_played": 1516791971}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant game, the best so far from Zachtronics in my opinion.\n\nI could not identify any bugs yet, and I love the good ol' stats where you can see if you have beaten everyone yet, or there's lots to optimise.

The controls while solving puzzles are awkward and tedious, and most menus are confusing and cumbersome. The game is also pretty boring to look at and listen to.

I went in with an open mind...and did not regret the purchase one bit. I'm a chemist in my other life; so, the pseudo-chemistry of alchemy was engaging, and had a bit of foundation in fact...reminded me a bit of my undergrad Organic Chemistry's lab lessons on modeling stereoisomers (molecules of the same mass oriented differently in 3 dimensions), albeit this game was a bit more sophisticated with its virtual manipulation versus my experience with the sticks and balls by which we used to build the 3-D structures by hand. \n\nAnyhow, my point is, the game is a learning experience while, at the same time, being quite enjoyable. I actually recommended the game to a colleague who is in charge of internal training in Six Sigma for possible use as a training module.

I've seen others on here criticize the $20USD price; I disagree - the price seems fair.

I really hate them. I want to know the solution, not think. That said, I love this game. This should tell you how well Zachtronics hits the mark with this one.\n\nMy first thought, after playing a few hours: any elementary school that wants to produce budding engineers or programmers should buy a few copies of OM. The fun of the game will wake up a sleeping ability for those things.\n\nA suggestion: add this concept to an adventure game and you will have something revolutionary. Make sure the adventure is great, though. Otherwise it will only be about the puzzle game.\n\nWho wouldn't love a game like Neverwinter Nights where you would get magical recipes, find/buy ingredients and use an alchemical machine to come up with explosive spells and items - cost depending on how well you set up the works? If you, instead of working your way through minor bosses, could find another path - or several - where you roam the countryside looking for ingredients and  completing minor tasks to come back later to blow the Big Boss sky high at one go? And on to the next city, or back to defeating the minor bosses just as an afterthought. \n\nThis would work as an addition in a warfare game just as well. Imagine a Total War game - a bit simplified one, perhaps - where you could use your alchemical skills to get better weapons for your crack troops, for instance. You would have to conquer a lead mine extra swift - and if you could add to it a Spring of Quintessence you gained through a deal with the Elves, you would have REALLY sharp swords dealing elemental damage and armor that can deal with almost any elemental damage. Spending money on a large alchemy machine is possible, but if you're ingenious you can let it run for a bit longer with cheaper bits, and if you're really patient you can fit it in a smaller package, make it do the work in 2/3 of the time and save some money on the side. Better chance your defenses will last long enough.\n\nOr you could buy the steel from the Dwarves, conquer the Spring of Quintessence, build up that salt mine in the sticks while conquering the town where they make Van Berlo wheels. \n\nIn such a game the battles could well be the old-fashioned turn based hex board battles just as well. It would be entertaining enough. I paid 20 for this, I would easily pay 40 for that. If the map, diplomacy and the rest were on par with more recent games, of course.\n\nAdd this to Endless Legend, for instance. Buy an expensive hero who can work alchemy. Suddenly your dust reserves will be inexhaustible - for as long as you have access to Hyperium. The Roving Clans will, of course, deny your access to the markets. Your dust reserve is worthless, all of a sudden. Crap. Should have dealt with the clans first. Wait! I can still work crossbow bolts that deal 5 times the damage they normally do. I do have plenty of titanium in reserve. Better get moving, clans. Someone else has an alchemist who can make bolts 6 times more powerful? I will have to readjust the engine. Maybe add another element to the equation? HEY! I gathered 100.000 dust before the Clans got wind of my plans! I will turn 80% of it into Blitzkrieg grade Antimorphiunium by bonding it with titanium and what little Hyperium I have. I will get impregnable armor, spells aside. The clans are in trouble.\n\nOf course this extra mechanism - in any game - would have to be a trump that only one or two factions have, and others would have to have something to counter it somehow. Otherwise everyone would play the same way. \n\nI really warmed up to the subject there. I hope someone else does, too.

Contraptions can and will go easily past the edge of the screen, and having to constantly \"fast-forward\" to a specific point to watch and rewatch what goes on in order to \"debug\" your solution is annoying. \nIn addition, the lack of any number labels to the timeline and inability to write notes within the timeline result in a lot of pointless confusion. \nSo between all of that, a few other minor points, optimizing for anything but steps (to completion) a mental struggle; note that I used \"struggle\" and not \"challenge\" since a lot of the optimization part of gameplay is stuff like having to search around for a part whose number is hidden under the arm of another part, having to keep a mental log of what number parts are in a group, and trying to remember the significance of a chunk of the 200+ commands you have on one arm...\n\nOverall though, definitely a 3.75/5 game.", "timestamp_created": 1517245553, "timestamp_updated": 1517245553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39709649": {"recommendationid": "39709649", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976651283", "num_games_owned": 279, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517244015}, "language": "english", "review": "I've bought most of the games released by Zachtronics, but to date I think Opus Magnum is their magnum opus.

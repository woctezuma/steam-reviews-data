Dieser will mit den V\u00f6geln den lang vergessenen Schatz seines Bruders finden. Dies zu verhindern und die V\u00f6gel zu befreien liegt nun in unserer, bzw. in Nelly Cootalots Hand.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nEin klassisches Point&Click mit kleinen Minispielen zwischendurch. Dabei sammelt man, ganz klassisch, einen Haufen Schmarrn im Inventar. Auch hat man einen kleinen Vogel als Sidekick, der bei einigen R\u00e4tseln hilft. \n\n[h1]Grafik und Sound[/h1]\nAlle Schaupl\u00e4tze sind detailreich und liebevoll gezeichnet und auch die Charaktere wissen zu gefallen. Auch die Tonausgabe ist (im Deutschen) stimmig und \u00fcberzeugt durch Wortwitz und unterschiedlichste Sprecher. Immer wieder ert\u00f6nt au\u00dferdem ein Liedchen, dass an die Deponia-Reihe erinnert und das Spielgeschehen am\u00fcsant begleitet.\n\n[h1]Steuerung[/h1]\nDie Maus ist wie bei vielen Point&Clicks das Eingabeger\u00e4t erster Wahl, aber auch der Controllersupport funktioniert. Mit Hilfe der Leertaste lassen sich au\u00dferdem Hotspots anzeigen.\n\n[h1]Schwierigkeit[/h1]\nDie Puzzles im Spiel waren mir leider etwas zu einfach. Viel zu schnell kommt man auf die richtige L\u00f6sung und es gibt keine alternativen L\u00f6sungen. Auch die Minispiele sind recht einfach gehalten. Dies hat zum einen den Vorteil, dass Nelly Cootalot auch f\u00fcr die j\u00fcngeren Spieler ein Erlebnis ist, jedoch das Spiel auch sehr verk\u00fcrzt.\n\n[h1]Spielzeit[/h1]\nWomit wir beim n\u00e4chsten Punkt sind. Trotz Achivementjagt war bei mir das Ende nach 4 Stunden erreicht. Das empfinde ich f\u00fcr ein Adventure in dieser Preisklasse leider als etwas zu wenig. Durch die nichtvorhandenen unterschiedlichen L\u00f6sungsm\u00f6glichkeiten hat man dann auch alles im Spiel gesehen und wirklich etwas zu entdecken gibt es dann nichts mehr. Auch fesselt oder bewegt die Story nicht so sehr, dass sich ein erh\u00f6hter Wiederspielwert ergibt.\n\n\n[h1]Fazit[/h1]\nEs ist schwierig hier f\u00fcr Nelly Cootalot eine abschlie\u00dfende Bewertung abzugeben. Das Spiel macht vieles richtig aber leider auch einiges nicht. Das Grundger\u00fcst ist toll. Die Charakt\u00e4re, die Sprachausgabe, die Details an den jeweiligen Orten und auch der manchmal leicht abgedrehte Humor. Leider macht es das Spiel dem Spieler leider zu einfach so, dass Genrefans hier schnell alle R\u00e4tsel gel\u00f6st haben. Die dadurch kurze Spielzeit wirkt dann, in Anbetracht des Preises, entt\u00e4uschend. Hier h\u00e4tte sich das Spiel mehr Zeit nehmen sollen um die Charaktere etwas genauer zu beleuchten. Auch w\u00e4ren knackigere R\u00e4tsel und Minigames w\u00fcnschenswert gewesen. So musste nur selten etwas im Inventar kombiniert werden. Zudem wird immer wieder auf die Vorgeschichte verwiesen, die es wohl kostenlos im Internet zu spielen gibt. Hier stellt sich die Frage, warum dies nicht ins Spiel inkludiert wird/wurde.\n\n\nAlles in allem bleibt Nelly Cootalot f\u00fcr mich ein gutes, aber nicht sehr gutes Point&Click, dass durch seinen Preis den Konkurrenzkampf mit anderen Spielen verliert.

Overall, highly recommended when at discount for those who like a great comedic point and click adventure game that is casual and forgiving for all types of players and don't mind a few minor bugs in the game. (I spotted 2 bugs during my playthrough, there is a bug that occurs rarely where sometimes selecting an item to try to combine with another item on inventory as an invalid item pair combination will somehow fail to close the inventory window and it is not possible to use the item on anything in the external environment until a delay afterwards. The second bug is the achievement Timewaster where it is not automatically awarded upon obtaining the second last achievement and the player has to close and restart the game to obtain the final achievement. Thank you ASHGAMES, Saraphel and Alexander Henn for working to fix this bug as mentioned in the game's discussion forums.

Nelly could well be Guybrush's and Elaine's daughter, if they ever got one. She's got Elaine's red hair and attitude, and Guybrush's witty and quirky sense of humour. Like the latter, she wants to be a pirate, but is absolutely clueless about how life at sea works.\n\nThe humour is the best part of the game. It's witty and, once again, resembles Monkey Island in almost every aspect, though with a few twists. The graphics are gorgeous. Everything is hand-drawn and incredibly detailed. You can stare at the backgrounds for minutes, over and over, and still notice new things each time you come back. The characters are fun and memorable (highlights include a Dylan-wannabe busker and a great, spooky villain by the name of Van Zandt). The soundtrack is above average and fits very well with the game.\n\nThe puzzles are well-balanced. It's fun to figure out what you're supposed to be doing and they're never too difficult. It may take some time to realize what you're supposed to do sometimes, but most of the time, you just have to think a little bit and explore the wonderful backgrounds in the game and look for details you can use. In other words, it's even a joy to get stuck and come back later. You want to come back to the game.\n\nNelly's charmingly British accent is also welcome in an over-exaggerated market of mostly American games. It also adds to the witty nature of the game.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that the game is relatively short. I finished it in a total of seven hours in my first run. It would also be nice to have a higher difficulty setting to choose, so you could come back later and explore even more things. There are also some problems with the control, where you sometimes have to wait for Nelly walk to the next room once you've clicked, even if you click on something else before she gets there. But these complaints are very minor.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this game. It takes me back to a time (circa 1997) when point-and-click adventures were still around and flourishing. It's the best find I've done in quite a while and the perfect compliment for you if you're waiting the Monkey Island sequel that never arrives.", "timestamp_created": 1485744172, "timestamp_updated": 1485744172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29575875": {"recommendationid": "29575875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123274967", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488626758}, "language": "english", "review": "Really is a terrific, well made game.

Et il ne s'arr\u00eate pas l\u00e0. De son imagination foisonnante est n\u00e9 le personnage de Nelly Cootalot, une jeune pirate rousse et espi\u00e8gle dont les premi\u00e8res aventures qu'il a illustr\u00e9es et anim\u00e9es \u00e9taient disponibles gratuitement. Aujourd'hui l'aventure continue avec \"The Fowl Fleet\", un projet plus long, plus ambitieux et d\u00e9j\u00e0 encens\u00e9 par la presse vid\u00e9oludique.[/i]\n\nNelly Cootalot est appel\u00e9e par son mentor, le v\u00e9n\u00e9rable pirate William Barbesang \u00e0 se lancer dans une qu\u00eate pour contrecarrer les plans machiav\u00e9liques du Baron Grandebarbe. Fervente protectrice des oiseaux, Nelly ne r\u00e9fl\u00e9chit pas une seconde lorsqu'elle apprend que le Baron les a captur\u00e9s afin de servir ses projets et se lance \u00e0 sa poursuite passant ainsi par un ensemble d'\u00eeles m\u00e9ridionales o\u00f9 les pirates sont rois et par une contr\u00e9e viking perdue dans le Grand Nord.\n\nLors des pr\u00e9mices de l'aventure, j'avais le sentiment \u00e9trange et d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able que le jeu \u00e9tait lisse, sans profondeur. Pourquoi ? La raison principale est que, ayant mis le jeu en fran\u00e7ais celui-ci \u00e9tait sous-titr\u00e9 (avec des sous-titres d'excellente qualit\u00e9, je tiens \u00e0 le pr\u00e9ciser) mais les doublages \u00e9taient absents, laissant ainsi les personnages remuer la bouche sans qu'aucun son ne s'en \u00e9chappe. C'est surtout ce point-l\u00e0 qui \u00e9tait \u00e9trange : pourquoi inclure une animation des l\u00e8vres s'il n'y a pas de doublages ? C'est apr\u00e8s coup que j'ai compris, le jeu est doubl\u00e9 en anglais et en allemand mais ne poss\u00e8de que des sous-titres pour ses versions fran\u00e7aise, italienne et espagnole. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=659370822 Pour gagner en immersion j'ai pass\u00e9 le jeu en anglais et il est bien dommage de ne pouvoir combiner sous-titres fran\u00e7ais et voix anglaises, donc si vous comprenez et lisez bien l'anglais activez les doublages, sinon vous devrez vous contenter de simples sous-titres. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/317320/discussions/0/385428943465731959/]Il est possible cependant que ce souci ne soit que provisoire car suite aux demandes des joueurs, une fonction permettant de combiner voix anglaises/allemandes et sous-titres d'une langue diff\u00e9rente est reconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e par le cr\u00e9ateur[/url]. [Mise \u00e0 jour du 21/12/16 : Finalement l'attente aura port\u00e9 ses fruits, les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont mis en place l'option permettant d'avoir les voix anglaises et les sous-titres de la langue de notre choix.]\n\nUne fois lanc\u00e9s, l'aventure se r\u00e9v\u00e8le \u00eatre plaisante \u00e0 suivre. Les lieux sont charmeurs, la patte du dessinateur est douce et tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able, quant aux personnages, ils sont cocasses et hauts en couleurs. On va tr\u00e8s vite se rendre compte que la com\u00e9die est le pilier de ce voyage qui fleure bon le [i]british humour[/i] d\u00e9complex\u00e9. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660888560 Les qu\u00eates restent elles-aussi dans le m\u00eame esprit, dr\u00f4les et parfois assez originales (retrouver le sens d'expressions propres \u00e0 la piraterie, d\u00e9duire l'emplacement des bateaux dans le port en lisant le registre du Commodore, trouver le moyen de saboter la course qui oppose de loufoques riches d\u00e9sargent\u00e9s, trouver le signe astrologique du cuistot chinois pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 le berner...etc). L'imagination n'est clairement pas en reste \u00e0 ce niveau-l\u00e0.\n\nToutefois, au bout d'un moment on va se sentir un peu perdus par l'avalanche de qu\u00eates, et surtout de qu\u00eates \"ench\u00e2ss\u00e9es\". Par exemple (petit spoiler alert), il nous faudra construire un d\u00e9tecteur d'oiseaux afin de retrouver la trace des bestioles disparues. Il nous faut donc une tige en or et tiens, il y a justement une \u00e9p\u00e9e en or chez le marchand de babioles mais (oui ce n'est jamais si simple) ce dernier ne la c\u00e8dera qu'en cas d'attaque navale. Il faut lui faire croire \u00e0 une attaque et on aura donc besoin d'un leurre. Pour obtenir l'objet en question il faudra rapporter une bi\u00e8re bien particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 un PNJ tiers et pour obtenir cette bi\u00e8re il faudra aider le barman qui ne s'en sort plus avec ses f\u00fbts. Pfiou ! Et ce n'est l\u00e0 que pour un objet parmi d'autres. On va donc se retrouver dans des situations o\u00f9 on se demandera : \"pourquoi j'ai besoin de ce truc en fait ?\" ou \"attends je dois aider ce type pour qu'il me donne ce bidule pour qu'un autre type me donne un autre bidule, c'est \u00e7a ?\". http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=663565888 Heureusement \u00e0 nos c\u00f4t\u00e9s se trouve Sebastien, un oiseau qui pourra nous rafraichir la m\u00e9moire quant \u00e0 nos qu\u00eates, nous offrir des informations sur des personnages et nous aider en interagissant avec l'environnement. De m\u00eame, les allers-retours sont facilit\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sence d'une carte des lieux, ce qui est appr\u00e9ciable \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le nombre de va-et-vient que l'on \u00e0 l'habitude de faire dans les jeux de ce type.\n\nSi je dois \u00e9voquer de petits d\u00e9fauts suppl\u00e9mentaires, j'ajouterais qu'un certain puzzle qui demandait de l'adresse \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t malvenu. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=662902271]Vous savez, une sorte de \"Docteur Maboul\" comme on a tous connu en jeu de plateau[/url], sauf que l\u00e0 c'est un simple dessin et qu'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne nous donne d'indication sur la profondeur de champ. On va donc toucher des bords invisibles sans arr\u00eat. La technique ? Faire doucement et trouver le bon chemin \u00e0 force d'essais, moyen comme puzzle.\nPar ailleurs, la musique du jeu est sympathique et entrainante mais tr\u00e8s oubliable aussi pour le coup. Les doublages, bien qu'in\u00e9gaux selon les personnages (j'aurai aim\u00e9 que l'actrice qui interpr\u00e8te Nelly ait une voix moins \"froide\" mais ce n'est que mon ressenti) restent d'une qualit\u00e9 convaincante.\n\nEn tout et pour tout, Nelly Cootalot est un point & click de bonne qualit\u00e9 qui, bien qu'il soit perfectible, n'a pas \u00e0 rougir \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 des plus grands jeux du genre. Humour, loufoquerie, belle galerie de lieux et de personnages, qu\u00eates int\u00e9ressantes, il ne manque qu'un peu de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 au niveau de la bande-son et un meilleur agencement des qu\u00eates pour \u00e9viter ce sentiment de \"fouillis\" que l'on ressent lorsque l'on d\u00e9bute une nouvelle zone.

Let\u2019s break down my impressions, from least important to the most:\n\nGraphics: I kinda miss the original hand-drawn look. It had a unique charm to it that the smoother and less unique 3d models lack. \n\nVoicework: Quite good all around. Except from some British TV guy \u2013 apparently everyone were so excited to have him on that they forgot to check whether his voice fits the character.\n\nControls: Remarkably bad, by adventure game standards. Everything feels a bit sluggish and slow to react to commands. Whenever you try to click two items in quick succession (quick = within a second or two) the game is sure to get confused and randomly misapply your clicks. \n\nPuzzle quality: Generally decent \u2013 moderately challenging at times, but logical and sensible. You never have to resort to random item combinations, your inventory is emptied of formerly useful items in regular intervals, and the big puzzle sets require just the right amount of thought. I got stuck on two separate occasions \u2013 one is a bit of accidental misinformation the developer promised to remove, while the other was a random piece of the puzzle stuck in a cluttered screen where it had no reason to be.\nHOWEVER. There are mini-games scattered at regular intervals, and they are terrible at conveying their control schemes and victory conditions. \n\nWriting quality: Maintains the quirky charm of the original, has a few laugh out loud moments every so often (helped by the voice work and decent comic timing). However, every so often you\u2019ll get a random meme shoved in, not at all meshing with the overall writing style. The game has an \u201carrow to the knee\u201d joke. In 2016(!)\nAlso, I think the ending and the airship section were severely cut during the production stage, and it SHOWS. Just a bit of a mess from the writing perspective.\n\nOverall: 7/10. Cute and charming, if not a particularly innovative. It\u2019s probably a bit too late to actually fix the ending into something coherent, but improving the controls, mini-game instructions and dumping the memes would bump the rating up to 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1459248141, "timestamp_updated": 1459248288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22110571": {"recommendationid": "22110571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170849943", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459356961}, "language": "german", "review": " Ein richtig sch\u00f6nes Point&Click Adventure ,sehr sch\u00f6n gestaltet und mit Humor und sch\u00f6nen R\u00e4tseln.", "timestamp_created": 1459191944, "timestamp_updated": 1459191944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22107542": {"recommendationid": "22107542", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040576344", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459276945}, "language": "german", "review": "Full German Review: http://stadt-bremerhaven.de/witziges-abenteuer-nelly-cootalot-the-fowl-fleet/\n\nNelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is a little Adventure Gem with lots of funny moments and some nice graphic art.

If you are now thinking \"Gosh, that's a bit like deciding to be a sprinter and challenging Usain Bolt to a race your first time out\" then that's a bit weird that we both thought of that, but you'd be correct. The shadow of [i]Monkey Island[/i] looms large over this game -- now I'm imagining a Lovecraft pastiche; [i]The Shadow Over Monkey Island[/i] -- but not only does the script acknowledge the influence, Nelly Cootalot is strong enough to stand up to and apart from its illustrious predecessor.\n\nThe writing for the most part is strong, and the characters' personalties come across well, helped in no small part by good voice acting throughout. Nelly herself is a charming protagonist; everyone seems to like her, and her cheerful approach to adventure is infectious. The main villains are a bit sketchy, and not in the appropriate sense of the word; I think they return from the original game in the series, but as I've not played that, their motivations and personalities seem a bit vague in this instalment. A new villain introduced in the middle section of the game comes across far better, although again his motivations and connection to the main plot are somewhat unclear. Still, it's Nelly and her friends who are most important and they are well-written and acted; aside from Nelly herself, I was most impressed by her sidekick Sebastian, voiced by Tom \"[i]Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior[/i]\" Baker. To be honest, I was expecting someone of Sir Tom's prestige to sleepwalk through his role but he brings a lot of personality to Sebastian, even though he has one of those voices that means you can never quite forget that there's an actor behind the character.\n\nThe game is funny, and there's a varied approach to the jokes, with plenty of references to films and games, a bit of witty wordplay, a dash of satire here and there, and at least one bit of smutty innuendo, although that last one doesn't land as well as it could have due to some clumsy back-pedalling. Some comments and reviews have claimed that the game is for children -- perhaps because of the art style -- but the latter joke suggests not, and some of the references are going to go right over the heads of most kids, unless they are showing Jack Nicholson films in primary schools these days.\n\nThe game looks good too. The trailers did look a bit ropey, with a flat animation style reminiscent of Flash or a cheap CBeebies programme, but the game itself looks much better. The character models look to be cel-shaded and that gives them a bit more weight, and they are for the most part well-animated; it is a bit of a shame that they don't tend to do anything when Nelly isn't interacting with them, but one has to remember that this isn't a multi-million pound game with a hundred-strong creative team behind it. That said, it's a pleasant surprise when you spot a character making a small movement or gesture that must have added time to the production schedule and is irrelevant to wider game, but helps to bring the character to life. It shows a dedication and craftsmanship that you don't often see in the aforementioned larger productions.\n\nI did encounter a couple of graphical glitches; during one part of the Guttering Howls section Nelly walks in front of and through something she should be behind, and in the penultimate chapter the inventory panel goes a bit wonky, but is still usable. I also had a bit of trouble with the game's interface being slow to register what was under the pointer, although the mechanics worked as expected, so it wasn't a major issue. I played the game on Linux Mint 17.3 and I don't know if these glitches are in every port.\n\nHeh, \"port\". Like sailors. Heh.\n\n[i]Nelly Cootalot[/i]'s puzzles are varied and often require different approaches and techniques to solve; even when they are of the give-item-A-to-person-B sort, they are at least presented in novel ways so the game never gets dull. In terms of difficulty, the puzzles are if not simple, then logical, so you are never hunting for rogue pixels or throwing every item at every character, hoping for the best.\n\nThat said if there is a flaw in [i]Nelly Cootalot[/i] -- and to be fair, it is the only thing I would consider a proper flaw -- it's the wider game and story logic surrounding the puzzles. On a few occasions I worked out the solution to a problem, and had all the correct items in my inventory ready to go, but I couldn't apply said solution because I hadn't gone to talk to someone -- often in another location -- who was supposed to give me the idea I'd already had. This led to frustration and -- in one case near the end of the game -- a suspicion that there was a game-breaking bug. On the plus side, Sebastian is able to give hints about what to do next, and in at least one case this helped resolve the impasse, although in the latter instance I did end up roaming around clicking on everything and everyone until I spoke to the right person.\n\nCreator Alasdair Beckett-King is a jolly nice fellow -- and is not bad at [i]Bomberman[/i] -- but it turns out he's quite good at making computer games too. I had great fun playing [i]Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet[/i] and although it is short -- it can be completed in about five hours or so, although getting the Steam achievements will take longer -- I think it is worth the \u00a312 I paid for it. There are rough edges, and places where I feel Alasdair and his team could have done a tiny bit more, but what's here is good, and I hope the game is enough of a success that we see more from him.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games, give this a try because you'll probably ike it.

The animation and art are wonderful and the voice acting was some of truly best I've ever heard.

I finished it in about 5.5 hours, and that's looking at every single thing. \n\nI would certainly recommend it, though. It's puzzles are well plotted and are much more logical than a lot of adventure games of old, but on the easy side for anyone who's played many adventure games. I've been playing them for over 20 years and had very little trouble with any of them. \n\nThere were a couple of bugs that I noticed. The cursor doesn't always change once you take it off of an item and hover over a different one (for example, you look at Crow's Nest and then Roof, but the cursor will still say Crow's Nest, even though it gives you information on Roof if you click on it). The other bug is when Nelly is supposed to be walking up a hill behind a building. It looks as though she's walking up the front of the building instead.\n\nThe only other thing I would say is that if you want to have a go at getting all of the achievements, they aren't all working yet. The final one (the Timewaster, the one for having achieved all the others) doesn't show up, despite having all the other 19.

The first minigame was the only one I didn't really grasp, and I still made it on my first try with a lucky guess. The others could have used some explanation at least for using their interfaces like Daedalic did for the Deponia series, but trial and error doesn't punish you for failure, so you can just figure it out on your own.\n\nThe main selling point of the game would be its humor, which had me not only smile at the numerous puns but genuinely laugh out loud at some of the main character's quips. Nelly herself is another high point of the game with her endearing mix of lawlessness and cluelessness. Her remarks make you want to look at every object twice to make sure you hear all the clever little things she has to say about them.\n\nOverall the game is a bit on the short side (a little over 5 hours for me), but a fun and relaxing interactive adventure throughout.

In this game, we're introduced to our heroine Nelly Cootalot in a tutorial set aboard the mailship Undeliverable. Here you'll learn how to interact with other characters, to examine, pick up and use items, and how to combine them in your inventory. This is also where you learn of the villanous Baron Widebeard's evil plans, which involves a fleet of hypnotised birds.\n\nAs a bird-lover and defender of adorable creatures, Nelly wants none of that, and sets off in pursuit of Widebeard to his last known location. In order to progress from there, you must figure out the Baron's next destination by correctly applying information from a log book to a wall chart of ship departures\u2014a puzzle that is one of my favorites in the game. You also have to gain permission to leave the docks by helping the miserable Admiral Woebegone by solving a classic \"three trials\" style branching puzzle.\n\nYour next leg of the journey takes you to the main area of the game, which is a large area of three connected islands. Among other things, it has two main streets, several stores, food and drink establishments and a few public service buildings. In short, most of what you'd expect of an actual town, and it reminds me of memorable areas of the classics, such as Rubacava and the towns of the Tri-Island Area. Luckily, you can double-click on exits to teleport, and there's also a map you can use for fast-travel.\n\nThis is also the most diverse area in the puzzle department, and it is where you'll spend most of your time with the game. A puzzle revolving around a pirate-ified version of the classic board game Operation offered the biggest challenge to me, but since there are several other puzzles to tackle, I never felt completely stuck. If you do though, you can always get your bird companion Sebastian to give you a recap of your current objectives, without running the risk of spoiling anything.\n\nA location placed inside the subconsious of a shaman monkey is also worth mentioning, but unfortunately it was all over rather quickly. There's also one large Viking inspired area left after that, but I don't want to spoil more than I already have.\n\nThe game features high-quality voice acting from a large cast of talented British actors, including Tom Baker of [i]Doctor Who[/i] and [i]Little Britain[/i]. It is also of the funnier games I have played, which should come as no surprise if you played the previous game or witnessed the Kickstarter pitch video or any of the YouTube announcements leading up to the release.\n\nAs a Kickstarter backer, I have participated in the beta since January, and I've been impressed by the developers, who have been very responsive in fixing all of the tricky Linux issues that cropped during the beta, and made me feel like a first-class customer. They have also been exceptionally friendly througout what must have been a long and stressful crunch.\n\nMy first playthrough of the beta took me 5\u20136 hours, according to my notes, but I've seen estimates of much longer play times, and it's of course highly dependent on your previous experience with the genre. A few of the puzzles felt a bit underwhelming, including a certain barrel puzzle and the finale. Other than that though, the game feels solid throughout, and I think it's a good all-rounder that will appeal to most players. \n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] This review was originally posted on [url=https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/a-review-of-point-and-click-adventure-nelly-cootalot-the-fowl-fleet-now-on-steam-.6869/]GamingOnLinux[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1458735495, "timestamp_updated": 1458735630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21995942": {"recommendationid": "21995942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048872484", "num_games_owned": 701, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458669182}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games I regret not having backed on Kickstarter.\n\nI had a great time playing this game, I loved the setting, the graphics and most of all the sense of humour.

Its a really fun game with lots of humour and a good story. The voice acting is really well done throughout and the hand drawn graphics suit the game and fit well with the story. Right clicking on all the clickable items results in some very funny descriptions. I would have liked the game to be longer, its a bit short and could be completed in about 6 hours if you don't fully explore all the areas.

She saved the Spoonbeaks once upon a time but now she\u2019s a lowly mail clerk on a mail ship. Her ol\u2019 ghost pirate pal, Bloodbeard, shows up to let her know that her great enemy Widebeard is up to his old tricks again. This time he\u2019s manipulating the Spoonbeaks and various other beards and using them to do his bidding. Now Nelly must find Widebeard and stop him before he releases his Fowl Fleet! \n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nNelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is the sequel to an Adventure Game Studio title called Nelly Cootalot: Spoonbeaks Ahoy! While that game featured a hand drawn 2D style of gameplay. The Fowl Fleet is beautifully rendered in vibrant 3D visuals. The animations for the various characters and actions are simple but sweet. Don\u2019t expect too much wacky movement outside of a few cut scenes and you should be golden. \n\nThe world of Nelly Cootalot likes to keep it simple, but there are still plenty of kicks to get out of the characters movements. One particularly humorous example is after Nelly helps a bird move to a new home, and he thanks her by giving her a hat full of his poop before sliding away into his new nest. It\u2019s simple and sweet and adds a different sort of hilarity to the world. \n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nNelly Cootalot is a comedic adventure title and it never stops reminding us. Nelly is gung-ho but completely dimwitted at the same time. She\u2019s like a stupider version of Drax from Guardians of the Galaxy. She takes most anything people tell her literally, so she\u2019ll end up asking ridiculous questions or won\u2019t fully understand basic innuendo. \n\nLuckily, a wide variety of the people she meets are quick to crack a few jokes or two. One of my favorite characters in the game is named, \u201cGusty Nethers.\u201d Yeah\u2026 that\u2019s right\u2026 Gusty Nethers. He also has a few other ridiculous names he starts to call himself over the course the game. Gusty is just one of many characters that don\u2019t take themselves too seriously. It makes for some wonderful back and forth banter between Nelly and the various characters.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThere are some downsides and most of it comes in the form of the voice acting. It\u2019s not to say that the voice acting is bad, in fact a lot of it is great. It\u2019s that the jokes fall flat because the timing or the emotion isn\u2019t particularly perfect. Sometimes Nelly or another character will tell a joke and there is no oomph to it whatsoever. Other times there will be a witty back and forth and the timing of a joke is just not enough to evoke laughter. It\u2019s the moments like these that are a bit of a drawback to The Fowl Fleet, because it\u2019s filled with hit and miss jokes. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nWhen it comes to the mechanics of the title. The team sought to make a game that isn\u2019t just ham-fisted with combining items and clicking things. There are quite a few thoughtful puzzles in the game that think outside the box. Lots of the brainteasers rely on some well thought out and even nostalgic design choices. The enigma of it all functions by figuring out elements of a puzzle and piecing it altogether to create one cohesive part. \n\nA sample of this is one of the first real puzzles, where Nelly has to figure out the route of a fleet of ships by studying a log. Using different days as a reference you have to piece together the name and location of a ship she has to board. There are a variation of moments like these that shirk the usual \u201cClick on random things\u201d design of most adventure titles. Nelly Cootalot gives me a Professor Layton vibe as it consistently gives us amusing and well-thought out puzzles to enjoy. \n\nNelly Cootalot may not be a particularly hard game, but how many Adventure games truly are? Most of them are difficult because you didn\u2019t click the right objects, or you missed some dialogue that you can\u2019t see again. Nelly Cootalot never leaves you lingering for too long on one of the many riddles. If you interact with the characters and observe the items, you\u2019ll zip through the game without being tied down by boring pixel clicking.\n\nI appreciate this, because I do enjoy the experience and the story of adventure games more than being stranded on Puzzle Island. I like to be challenged but not to the point where I\u2019m stuck in one specific area for three hours because of something I didn\u2019t notice. Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet is middle of the road in difficulty and I\u2019m perfectly fine with that. \n\n[h1]Issues[/h1]\n\nI have some early build concerns that hopefully will be addressed in the retail version. The first area of the game is ripe with UI and scrolling problems. The item slot would occasionally stay on-screen which impeded my ability to interact with anything else. Also, there were times when the screen would stop scrolling and I couldn\u2019t walk to an area I needed to visit.  This game doesn\u2019t realize when you\u2019re using dual-monitors and uses the secondary screen instead. I had to switch to single-screen settings if I wanted to record video of the game. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nNelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet started off as something I would have dismissed because it was trying too hard to be funny. It\u2019s not until I ran into the first real puzzle before I said, \u201cHey, this is actually different for an adventure game.\u201d Suddenly, I was hankering for the next new puzzle and engaged in solving any riddle that came my way.  \n\nI began to appreciate the simplistic animations and suddenly fell in love with the world of Nelly Cootalot. If you\u2019re looking for an entertaining and different Adventure title, Nelly Cootalot might be the game with just enough charm to draw you in.

The game's story/setting is charming/quirky and I enjoyed it a lot more than I was expecting. There are quite a few funny moments in the game as well.  The story might not appeal to everyone but I enjoyed it quite a bit. \n\nThe puzzles are pretty clever and well designed. Unlike some point and click adventure games the puzzles aren't obtuse where you have to guess your ways to the correct answer. The game is just really well made. \n\nI really only had two complaints with Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet. First the game is kind of on the shorter side. The game lasts around five to six hours. Since I was really enjoying the game I wish it was a little longer. The other problem is that for the most part I found the game to be kind of easy. You probably aren't going to be really challenged by the game. \n\nAlthough not totally necessary, I would recommend playing the original game first. You won't be lost if you don't play the first game but the game does sometimes address things that happen in the first game so you might be slightly confused a couple times in the game. The original game can be found online for free.\n\nIf you like point and click adventure games I think you will enjoy Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet.\n\nNote: I received a review copy from the developer but received no other compensation for this review.  \n\n[url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/nelly-cootalot-the-fowl-fleet-indie-game-review/] Read My Full Review[/url]\n", "timestamp_created": 1458672689, "timestamp_updated": 1458672689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21987227": {"recommendationid": "21987227", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991603271", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458639361}, "language": "spanish", "review": "An\u00e1lisis publicado en http://arsgaming.com/nelly-cootalot-the-fowl-fleet-analisis\n\nApplication Systems nos trae Nelly Cootalot, un juego que rescata todo el humor de Monkey Island. Nos pondremos bajo la piel de una despreocupada y divertida protagonista en una aventura gr\u00e1fica que llamar\u00e1 la atenci\u00f3n y arrancar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de una carcajada a los nost\u00e1lgicos y fans del g\u00e9nero.\n\nEste t\u00edtulo es la segunda aventura de Nelly Cootalot, cuya primera parte fue publicada en 2007 y se encuentra disponible para descargar de manera gratuita. Si bien las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de point & click no viven su mejor momento en cuanto a proyecci\u00f3n, este t\u00edtulo rescata el tono humor\u00edstico con referencias tronchantes y una magn\u00edfica adaptaci\u00f3n de los chistes al castellano, aspecto que hace que un juego de este estilo sea capaz de llegar correctamente a la comunidad hispanohablante.\n\nEl argumento es sencillo, Nelly Cootalot, que sue\u00f1a con ser pirata, se ve tentada para embarcarse en una gran aventura para detener al Baron Barbancha. Y como no puede ser de otra manera en este tipo de historias es la aparici\u00f3n de un legendario pirata al que Nelly admira, William Barbasangrienta, el detonante que inicia la gesta. Este se aparece en forma de esp\u00edritu y le pide que desbarate los mal\u00e9volos planes del Bar\u00f3n Barbancha que intenta robar su tesoro oculto. Tendremos por tanto que seguir los pasos de Barbancha mientras nos vamos labrando una reputaci\u00f3n, hacemos amigos y nos enfrentamos a villanos locales. Toda la historia se desarrolla en clave de humor, un aspecto que va desde los nombres a los personajes a multitud de referencias. Encontraremos alusiones a temas y personajes actuales y cl\u00e1sicos. Asimismo vamos a encontrar incluso referencias a cl\u00e1sicos literarios con gui\u00f1os sutiles y no tan sutiles que sin duda ayudan a hacer que el jugador se sienta part\u00edcipe de la historia. Entre algunas de las referencias que encontramos se encuentran los Rolling Stones, nombres de personajes de obras de Shakespeare, referencias a actores como Cristopher Lee e incluso a la quiebra de Lehman Brothers.\n\nEn cuanto a las mec\u00e1nicas de juego no hay grandes novedades si lo comparamos con otras aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de point & click. Tendremos que recorrer el mapeado hablando con los personajes, recolectando objetos y combin\u00e1ndolos. Esto nos permitir\u00e1 avanzar en la trama y llegar a nuevas \u00e1reas. Asimismo tendremos que ir resolviendo problemas de los diferentes personajes que nos vayamos encontrando y entre algunas de las actividades que tengamos que realizar se encuentra la de resolver algunos puzles con informaciones que se nos dan o memorizar de cara a responder a preguntas de otros personajes. Algunas de estas misiones que tendremos que completar para avanzar son ordenar un tablero con diferentes barcos a trav\u00e9s de unas notas, ordenar barriles o buscar palabras de la jerga pirata. Tambi\u00e9n hay alg\u00fan minijuego que tendremos que superar para conseguir ciertos objetivos lo que le da una sensaci\u00f3n de variedad al t\u00edtulo.\n\nLa resoluci\u00f3n de los acertijos y de ciertos puzles se puede tornar en algunos momentos m\u00e1s dura a causa de que hayamos pasado por alto alg\u00fan elemento del escenario, por lo que tendremos que revisarlos muy bien y visitar las zonas varias veces.\n\nSi en una de estas ocasiones en las que nos quedemos atascados opt\u00e1semos, ya sea por cuestiones de tiempo o de frustraci\u00f3n, por dejar el juego apartado durante un tiempo, tenemos a un compa\u00f1ero que nos ayudar\u00e1: Sebasti\u00e1n. Este se nos unir\u00e1 en los primeros compases de la partida y podremos valernos de \u00e9l para ciertas tareas. Adem\u00e1s nos dar\u00e1 consejos sobre las tareas que tenemos pendientes, lo que nos permite recuperar el hilo de la trama.\n\nEl apartado sonoro y gr\u00e1fico va mucho m\u00e1s all\u00e1 que la primera entrega, algo que le ha permitido su \u00e9xito en Kickstarter. Las ilustraciones art\u00edsticas dotan de una gran calidad a los paisajes aunque es cierto que las animaciones son algo r\u00fasticas, algo que por otro lado es com\u00fan en juegos del mismo estilo. En cuanto a la m\u00fasica es entretenida y amena aunque el hilo musical se nos puede hacer algo pesado si jugamos mucho tiempo seguido, ya que no es excesivamente largo.\n\nEn definitiva, Nelly Cootalot: The Fowl Fleet es un t\u00edtulo hecho para los jugadores cl\u00e1sicos que disfrutan con una aventura gr\u00e1fica pura y que quieren pasar un rato riendo con las ocurrencias de Nelly.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wj4noW-yZ58", "timestamp_created": 1458670482, "timestamp_updated": 1458670482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21986881": {"recommendationid": "21986881", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182769411", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458827976}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer gerne einen kleinen Einblick ins Spiel h\u00e4tte...: https://youtu.be/xi6XwYuZD-A\n\nEins gleich vornab: Nelly Cootalot ist ein Fest f\u00fcr alle Freunde des \"speziellen\" Humors, des point & clicks und der m\u00e4rchenhaften Adventures.

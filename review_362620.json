This is what early access wanted to achieve, bringing light to a game that otherwise might have gone by, giving power and hope to a passionate developer. Help smaller games gain a following and a growing community. \n\nEnough though for the early access rant. Let's dig into the game.\n\nFirst off, I hate comparing games as each game deserves to be views as a unique thing, but this game and some aspects of it remind me of Game Dev. Tycoon, a game that I really love. Software Inc. is like the bigger, better Game Dev. Tycoon. Much deeper and with more choices depending what you are going to develop.\n\nListing some of the things that make this game great (even in this Alpha State):\n\nFirst thing that caught my attention,\n\n-The music although nothing really special, is calming, chill and compliments the feel of the game really good.\n\n-Time Eater... I got into the game with every chance i got and loved to see the hour clock go by\n\n-Decorating and Building is a big aspect of the game as you have to take into account, when building, first of all the cost, then stuff like rent and temperature. All the employees you get, except you, are affected from thing like the temperature of the room they are in, the \"Decor\" score, privacy when working and lots more things.\n\n-Tons of Customizations, not only in the visual aspect of your building or Character, but in everything concerning your software. From Development to Marketing, Destribution, Printing copies and many more the game is full of choices that will either leave you scraping to get by, rushing products out there or leave you with more money you know what to do with.\n\n-Making something actually sell for the first time is a feeling of acomplishment that I cannot describe. Making your first \"Big Hit\" on the market feels amazing though you have to be carefull not to \"overextend\" your company too early on.\n\n-Things ACTUALY make sense. Making an Operating System is far more profitable in the 80s than later as the market was still pretty new and open to new things. Making a Game in the 2010s is far more profitable than trying to compete with companies makis OSs who have been doing it since the 80s.\n\n-All the micromanaging in general is what made me buy this Game. Thinking about where to build each room(Server room, Dining room, break room) so it does not affect the workflow of the employees. Managing all the salaries and costs. Placing and tasking each Team with a different thing, trying to find the most efficient, cost effective, fastest way to make a new product with the best quality possible. \n\nFinishing up, I think that this game deserves a great future. The developer seems to love it, being active with forum questions and general support. It is a game every Steam User interested in Tycoon/Management Type games should give a chance as I'm sure he/she/it/they will love it. I sure do! \n\nThank you for spending the time reading, I hope if you get the game, like it as much as I do.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515357140, "timestamp_updated": 1515357140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39136874": {"recommendationid": "39136874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205999693", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 615, "last_played": 1515707129}, "language": "english", "review": "needs tutorials", "timestamp_created": 1515288489, "timestamp_updated": 1515288489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39127815": {"recommendationid": "39127815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250080540", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509725359}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't even know why but it was boring...", "timestamp_created": 1515265369, "timestamp_updated": 1515265369, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.367751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39114248": {"recommendationid": "39114248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108759423", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1786, "last_played": 1516126359}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Very complex, when you understand it it realy is a great game!", "timestamp_created": 1515236878, "timestamp_updated": 1515236878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39074148": {"recommendationid": "39074148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198404812675", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1515929666}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430! \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430!", "timestamp_created": 1515131734, "timestamp_updated": 1515131750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39069189": {"recommendationid": "39069189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010002475", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 1213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515115886}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440\ud83d\ude35 \ud83c\udfc6\n\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443, \u043e\u0447\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044f 20 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u044f", "timestamp_created": 1515116190, "timestamp_updated": 1515546006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39064913": {"recommendationid": "39064913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277079414", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1828, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 63, "last_played": 1516281236}, "language": "english", "review": "it's good", "timestamp_created": 1515104849, "timestamp_updated": 1515104849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39062925": {"recommendationid": "39062925", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995931950", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515356756}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is already pretty great but I believe it's eventually going to be amazing.

the game (havent got any issues) but its obvious that the game needs more content about some details (but hey its early access) \n\ni have a wishlish so i hope the developers see this\n1- need of more items:  there are only 2 types of chairs and tables etc.. when you first look at the item categories you think ''oh there are a lots of things'' but in reality there are only 2-3 different options for the same kind of objects (exept computers and a few more items but they are more like ''buy the most advanced one and forget the rest'' kind) \nthe lack of items really show its downside when you encounter the social needs of your employess because there are only 2-3 items that fulfill this need.\ni hope there will be a lot of items for to really customise your workspace :)\n\n2- the need of things to spend money:   most stuff in the game is pretty cheap like you get the most expensive server for 2k etc.. only 1-2 things are relativly expensive but you dont spend money on them too often (like buying more land) so if you can pay your employess you are most likey to be rich in a short time so unless you dont develop any softwares or fail to deliver a good product 3-4 times in a row i dont think that you can lose money\nps: im not asking more reasons to lose money im asking more content to spend money :) \n\n3- U\u0130 of employees list: once you hire more than about 10-15 employess you start to lose tracking of who is who (like who is the 3d programmer and who is audio programmer etc..) and when someone get retired you will be like ''ok this guy was a programmer but did i hired him for 2d or system etc..''  \ni would like to see a drag and drop style feature with a customisble employee list so i can put the employee list in the order that i like\n\n4- montlly subscribtion mmo games:  so i can develop world of warcraft\n\n5- expansions and dlc's :  so i can develop expansions for world of warcraft and i can act like EA when i get bored\n\n6- game awards + expo (E3) :  no explanations needed for that.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514463432, "timestamp_updated": 1514463432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

I've been playing non-stop for the past week and I think I've done everything there is to do and more. Overall, great game! It adds a ton to the genre while maintaining the usual core features. Here are some but not all of my thoughts... I might add to this post later.\n\n----What I LIKED the most...----\n\n--Building offices. This was extremely fun... Getting the rooms right and positioning everything to minimize worker downtime while maintaining aesthetics was an amazing experience. Most of the productivity is lost through workers having to walk across a carpark or to go to a meeting room or get food. I think I came up with something quite scalable and optimal. I think logistics is a massive selling point of the game and building on this would be a great decision.\n\n--The market and company system. This was so much better than what's in Game Dev Tycoon. Managing competition and watching the market is really fun and engaging. My strategy is always rush to dominate one or two markets and shut down competitors, just like in real life I guess. Perhaps a little more depth though. I think the stock system has huge potential but is very lacking atm.\n\n--The early to mid game. By far the most fun part of the game is building up the company from nothing and trying to keep it afloat while the company rocks on the edge of chaos. There's an easy strategy where you have your founder develop an OS over 3 years and it will bring in 4+ million per month but even then the mid-game is still quite challenging. The late game needs to be overhauled.\n\n----What can be SIGNIFICANTLY improved----\n\n--Managing teams and employees. It is VERY clunky and sometimes even bugs out.\n\nThere should be a way to set HR management and time schedules on multiple teams at the same time. You need 3 of each team to cover three 8-hour shifts to maximise productivity. Multiply that with several teams and adding additional teams and it gets really tedious.\n\nI don't know what's up with HR education but it's either EXTREMELY slow or it just doesn't work. I just had a game where three identical teams with the same setting except for arrival/departure time. Two teams were sent to class and one team never gets sent. And it appears they always were sent on 1-month courses. It's better to just manually mass train employees on 3-month courses (Good thing that you can send multiple at the same time).\n\nIt should be allowed to reserve or prioritize parking spaces for specific teams or employees and staff. Currently, it seems to just flood the carpark from right to left, which is highly inefficient.\n\nAlso the functionality to set multiple roles on employees (Yes I heard it's coming in A10... Just wanted to mention it here).\n\n--Products and technologies. Right now all the different products are basically the same in terms of gameplay. X amount of code. Y amount of art. And a combination of required specializations. Similar for tech and research. Each just adds a little more to a specific product but nothing really unique. Art/code/design are also very similar. Same workspaces (Yes, I know about the add-ons you can place next to computers), and extremely similar development mechanics. The overall effect is extremely repetitive, grindy, and bland gameplay.\n\nThis can be spiced up in many ways. Different types of workstations and environments for different specializations and sub-specialisations. Office furnishings that boost specific jobs but are detrimental to others. Technologies that add unique requirements and pros/cons to a product. Some of the technology combos don't make sense. A MMO game with local multiplayer? A touch OS with no GUI? These should all have a huge negative impact on sales but right now it seems like you just want to research everything tick all the boxes.\n\n--The interface. It does very little to lessen the apparent complexity of the game. Every window is information overload. I'm 100% used to it now though and see the value of all the information but when I first started out it was VERY dizzying. Many windows can be simplified in ways such as grouping columns that are highly related together and apart from others, being able to collapse columns and sub-windows and setting some less-important information panels/columns to be collapsed on default to lessen the initial impact. There also no icons that allow for quick recognition anywhere apart from the buttons in the main UI. Everything is labeled with text including action buttons. Pop-up tooltips at the cursor when first opening a window would also be really good.\n\nThe WORST thing is the list of current tasks at the right. At first, it's great but as my company grew to a very large size it was quite hellish to manage that list. Even just reversing the order and putting new items at the top of the list would help massively.\n\n--Building rooms and mass placing objects is very clunky. A MASSIVE improvement here would be the ability to place snap and guidelines on the grid.\n\nA marquee tool to select objects would also be extremely helpful and time-saving. A lot of the time I want to select some of objects X, Y, and Z in a room but not all of them. Like just the printers or workstations in the corner or whatever. I have to individually select what I want at that point.\n\n----What I absolutely HATED and I think should be just scrapped----\n\n--Project Management. Either I'm not using it right or this absolutely SUCKS. It takes years to finish a project and the end completed product sucks. Not to mention that it starts marketing way too early.\n\nBUT EVEN if project management was as good as manually managing projects I wouldn't like this feature. This feature aims to completely trivialize a huge portion of the game. Managing projects is quite an engaging part of the game. Sometimes I need to take an art team off a project to prevent it from going overboard. Sometimes I need to re-prioritize teams to prevent a disaster with support. Managing multiple projects at the same time and getting it all on schedule feels amazing but that might just be me.\n\n--Contract Work. Also might just be me but this is probably my most hated part of in this game genre. It feels like a chore to do at the start of the game. It's not engaging or in-depth or challenging in any way. No thought and minimal strategy involved. It's a bore. Completely revamp contracts so they 1. scale into the late game and 2. are fun and in-depth. This is an area where the genre needs big innovation.\n\n----Other Suggestions----\n\n--Modding. It seems right now mods are limited to just adding predefined product and tech archetypes. I'd really like a much more extensive mod system, if that's possible. I wanted to create a mod that adds and improves to HR management but it didn't seem like that was possible.\n\n--Reviewer employees. How about permanent employees that constantly review the development of games? An estimated score will be shown at the development panel of the right and constantly updated as the reviewers work. Highly skilled reviewers know how to be unbiased.\n\n--Resource import system. Products with extensive features need additional resources to develop like arts and craft supplies. I think this would work really well with the hardware mods. Those mods right now don't really make sense with all hardware being developed on a computer and then printed or even digitally distributed.\n\nOverall\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10. Good stuff! Quite innovative, much more-so than the other games of the genre! Needs a lot of polish but the core game loop feels amazing.\n\nGraphics: 8/10. I suspect the dev went with a typical looking low-poly unity style because it's a one-man team. Though for one person it's impressive. Though granted, I'm already lagging when 300+ employees change shifts.\n\nSound: 9.5/10. The music and effects are on-point!

I came from Game Dev tycoon and also play the Sims and this really combines the important aspects of both into one cheerful game. I only have about 30 hours in, but my company is worth well over 2 Billion with hundreds of employees. I work for a tech company in real life and feel as though this matches pretty well in terms of teams, strategies, chemistry, roles etc. The UX took me a couple of days to figure out because there is so much that you can do, but once I started to get the hang of it, it felt pretty intuitive.\n\n\nI still haven't been able to keep all of my employees happy, even though they all get free food, their OWN offices and a huge campus, but you never will keep everyone happy. Support is my biggest challenge at this point. I'm so good at releasing stellar products that hundreds of support staff cant keep up. But that's a GOOD problem to have.\n\n\nI did run into issues with contract work at the beginning of the game. I couldn't get my player to begin work on one. But I then went right into an OS and had no troubles, made a few million and the rest is history. Also, resizing windows & resolutions has given me some issues in terms of not being able to see the 'x' to close some modals, not being able to drag them either.

Don't ask me why, I honestly couldn't tell you. Maybe I just really like micromanagement.\n\nIf you, like me, enjoy games like this for some inexplicable reason, you should pick up Software Inc. The premise is simple, starting in the 1970s and with one person, you build a software company from the ground up, complete with design teams, programmers, artists, a marketing department, server farms, and an office building that you design yourself.\n\nThink Game Dev Tycoon meets The Sims.\n\nYou can create a small company that solely makes RTS games, or you can create a megacorporation that designs operating systems and buys out smaller subsidiary companies. It's up to you, the player.\nThe thing that sets this game apart from others like it, is how complex it's game systems actually are, while remaining simple to understand and \"game-like\". Most other games that set out to achieve what this game does, are either overly complex, or too dumbed down. This game maintains a perfect balance between complexity and simplicity.\n\nThe one negative thing I can say about it is that once you figure out what works to make a profitable company, it becomes way too easy.

This game is cheep, packed full of content supprisingly for a early access title and fairly detailed.\n\nThe low poly graphics make this game stand out among the other management type games on steam and give it a uniqe look. With character customization and building aspects, the game may not have the details of a triple A game, but the simplistic style will have you focusing on what acually matters, the management.\n\nYou create and manage software, as the title inplys you create a comanpy as well. You hire, fire and manage each employee including your own character on projects you want to create. you give the project a name, go through the 3 stages -> Pre Production(Design) -> Production(Development) -> Post Production(Support/Marketing) and pray that you allocated your team and time right to create a sucessfull project. If you do you create millions, if you dont, you go bankrupt, unless you are already a multi billionair taking advangte of the games mechanics\n\nThe game includes a stock market, a highly abusable(at the moment) system that allows you to invest stocks into any company on the market, thing is, you can abuse this system by looking for new companys that startup with an OS. they will always make millions and in year 1 without making anything, you're already a multi-millionair. But even with that the one thing that kept me engaged was the micro-mangament and the little details that kept me interested\n\nSoftware can depend on other software, your OS can become big the next day because someone released a huge game for it and now you are making millions. You might be thinking \"Well thats it? i make money to make money\", its not that. the game keeps you engaged and on your toes most of the time when you are making that money. If you are like me you will be so focused on trying to get the perfect software, you lose track of time.\n\nOVERALL:\nThis game is highly addicting, highly rewarding and generally fun. The building mechanic will take hours away from your life while managing your staff and prodcuts will cut your time even more. I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a good managment game on the market. You will not be disapointed by the low price and fun gameplay\n\n[Pros]\n-Building System\n-Very Detailed\n-No Handholding\n-Micro-Managment\n[Cons]\n-Marketing is vauge\n-Stock market is too broken [over powered]\n-Fans make no sense\n-Bugs", "timestamp_created": 1511561465, "timestamp_updated": 1511561465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655257", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37420085": {"recommendationid": "37420085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166674410", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 13608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2304, "last_played": 1515454733}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 - \u0441\u043c\u0443\u0449\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0439 \u0432\u0438\u0434 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u0441 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0439 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439 (\u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c). \u041d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446, \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043b \u0433\u043b\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u043b \u0435\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435 - \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0444\u0442-\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438. \u0413\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0439\u0447\u0430\u0441, \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f. \u0423\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e \u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043a \u0438 \u043a \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u0441\u0443\u043f\u0435\u0440-\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044e. \u0422\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b: \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439, \u043f\u043e\u0437\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0441 \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u044b \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0436\u0434\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0448\u0443\u043c\u0430, \u043e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0438 \u043f\u0440.;

At present, however, it requires a lot of micromanagement which can be really tedious if you\u2019re running a larger company.\n\nI fully recommend it and the dev is quite active so it\u2019s good to support him, but I hope that they will add some really necessary quality of life features such as an automation of smaller projects or better teamwork inside your teams without the need to assign dozens of rooms to small teams. I will elaborate futher in this review.\n\n[b]What works[/b]\n1. The way you\u2019re designing programs - it allows a very deep level of customization as the mods clearly show.\n2. Mods - even now there are quite a few great mods that add a nice variety of features - new programs, new scenarios, and new furniture (you can even build a full bathroom thanks to them, not just the vanilla \u201cpoop machine\u201d).\n3. The team chemistry and different characteristics of your employees show promise and already allow you to have many different types of people in your company, some of which are easier to deal with, and some can really be a pain in the neck. \n4. The game simulates the market up until the moment you start your own business, meaning that there are many different programs and established corporations for you to compete with. It is a bit rudimentary as the whole world is treated as a one, huge market, but it\u2019s ok. Although I really hope that in the future they will realistically simulate how market kept changing and globalizing - largely local in the 80s but global in the 90s and 00s,\n5. The 80s - my favorite era of software development, full of pioneers and experiments. Not that many games include it and that\u2019s a shame, \n6, Outsourcing - you don\u2019t have to design everything yourself. You can make some good money working for someone else.\n7. Marketing, press releases, release dates, announcements, ads - it\u2019s all done pretty well but it\u2019s weird that you can only buy ads AFTER the release (not counting press builds and announcements). \n\n[b]What needs some improvement[/b]\n1. Individual skills - your employees must be the best in everything or the quality will suffer. You can\u2019t have an algorithm expert who would be average with system stuff - he would lower the quality significantly. I think that the game should not let someone with poor skills in a certain area to do what he\u2019s not good at. If he can, great, but you should be able to set a minimal level for each employee to contribute to each field - an algorithm expert who can\u2019t do much else should do just that, and not endanger the whole project. \n2. Less micromanagement, Teams are a very good addition but you really need to create a lot of them. Artists are the worst - you usually require less art units than code ones and so artists finish the job sooner. If they\u2019re in the same team as the programmers, you can\u2019t just order them to stop and do something else. Not really a problem yet, but as teams shouldn\u2019t share a room, you require a lot of smaller rooms which can get tedious - if a project requires 2 artists and you have 4 in your team, it will be finished slowly, the same when you have a 4 artists team and 2 projects that require 2 each. It's much better to create 2 separate teams but then you also need 2 rooms. Also, this screws up your leaders - instead of having one lead to help a larger group of maybe 10 employees, you need one to nanny 2 artists while the other handles 8 programmers and designers. Also, when you\u2019re taking on several small project that someone outsources, you have to keep checking the progress - it won\u2019t end automatically, and won\u2019t even move to beta once all the required units of code are done.\n3. Ability to rent offices in a larger building and move to a new building. Or repurpose an old warehouse. \n4. I would really love a dev support for somewhat realistic scenarios - like making sure that company A will produce X consoles in 1990 no matter what, while Microsoft will outclass non-human opponents like in real-life, which could then lead to great real-world mods,\n5. Recommended employees - this one needs some overhaul. I understand that with coding you can\u2019t really hire 50 programmers when you really need 5 and expect they\u2019ll do it 10 times faster, and this could even lead to chaos, meaning that it would take even longer. That\u2019s fine, although hiring 6 when 5 are recommended could speed things up, while in the game it only slowers it. Seemingly even if the programmer is currently training and not physically in the company, bothering no one. Artists, however, don\u2019t work this way - they have certain bits to do, and do them, the smaller they are the faster they tend to do them. Hiring 3 artists when 1 is recommended should speed things up. Maybe not 3 times faster, but perhaps twice as fast.\n6. Reputation - it seems like it\u2019s as hard to build a reputation in the 80s as it is in the 2010s. It requires a lot of great releases to become noticed. I think that this should be somewhat overhauled, along with the market percentages I mentioned before. Currently there are only several workflow programs on the market and they already dominate it in the 1980, while there should be many less common ones instead and so if a company develops a truly outstanding product when the market is not yet saturated, that company should become a lot more famous than a company that develops a great CAD program today when there are a lot of those already, some for quite a long time. The same with new programs - it was easier to create a Spotify when there were no companies as large as Spotify today, than it would have been now. In 1980 most program types were new and there were no truly dominant companies yet and the game should reflect that.\n7. The building designing part is qute cool but not perfect. It suffers from some poor design choices - you can\u2019t for example build a room inside a room - consequently you can\u2019t build a big rectangle and then add the rooms and if you do so, you\u2019re kinda screwed.\n\nAnyway, those are issues I can understand since it\u2019s only Early Access. The game seems to be moving in a good direction and those shouldn\u2019t leave an impression that this game is bad - it is definitely not.", "timestamp_created": 1509902501, "timestamp_updated": 1509909771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709778", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36278735": {"recommendationid": "36278735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058018522", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513355329}, "language": "german", "review": "Stellt euch vor: Ein Sims wo ihr eure eigene IT Firma aufbauen k\u00f6nnt.

Wir haben unseren Lebenstraum gefunden. Wir wollen Chef eines Welt-Softwarekonzerns werden. Software aus allen Bereichen sollen auf dem Markt kommen, mit unserem eigenen Firmennamen drauf und sollen auf der ganzen Welt bekannt sein. Ein ambitioniertes Unterfangen mit unseren gerade mal 9000 Euro angespartem Geld aber hey - 1980, Aufschwung des Software-Markts. Los geht's!\n\nSo in etwa kann man Software Inc. zu Anfang beschreiben. Eine komplexe Wirtschaftssimulation, die ihren Schwerpunkt auf Software-Entwicklung fokussiert, mit vereinfachter aber stilistisch passender Spielgrafik.\n\n\n[h1]Was gibt es zu tun?[/h1]\u200b\nWir haben das Ziel. ein Weltkonzern zu erschaffen und beginnen wahlweise im Jahr 1980. Wir haben in den Standarteinstellungen wenig angespartes Geld und m\u00fcssen das Beste daraus machen. Wir haben ein kleines leeres Grundst\u00fcck, auf dem wir schnell einen fl\u00fcchtigen Holzschuppen bauen. M\u00f6bel rein, nat\u00fcrlich auch den Computer und ein bisschen Gr\u00fcnzeug. Fertig ist die 2 mal 3 Felder gro\u00dfe Bude. Wir k\u00f6nnen aber nat\u00fcrlich nicht direkt loslegen, denn Gute Software ist teuer und aufwendig. Um unser Budget aufzubessern, haben wir die M\u00f6glichkeit, ein paar Auftr\u00e4ge von netten Firmen zu erledigen, die selber zu faul oder zu geizig sind, ihre eigenen Leute daf\u00fcr einzusetzen. Daf\u00fcr gibt es ja uns. Je nach Charaktereinstellung, bew\u00e4ltigen wir diese Aufgaben gut oder weniger gut. Egal, jedenfalls bringt uns das ein gutes Startkapital ein. Schlie\u00dflich m\u00fcssen wir auch unsere ersten Mitarbeiter einstellen. Programmierer Designer K\u00fcnstler und Vermarkter stehen uns zur Verf\u00fcgung. Der Stellenmarkt gibt uns zuf\u00e4llige Leute, in die wir investieren k\u00f6nnen. Doch die Wahl sollte gut \u00fcberlegt sein. Alles haben Schwerpunkte in denen sie gut sind und Punkte in denen sie ihre Inkompetenz zeigen. Je nach Projekt, das wir am Anfang beginnen wollen, m\u00fcssen wir passende Mitarbeiter finden und nat\u00fcrlich auch brauchen wir Vermarkter. Werbung ist schlie\u00dflich alles. \nWenn wir dann unsere ersten hunderttausenden Euro gemacht haben (falls es gut l\u00e4uft) k\u00f6nnen/ m\u00fcssen wir unser B\u00fcro Vergr\u00f6\u00dfern und mehr Mitarbeiter einstellen, um das ben\u00f6tigte know-how zu haben, um wiederum noch bessere Software zu entwickeln. So wird aus unserer kleine Bude, ein ger\u00e4umiges B\u00fcro das wir in Sims-Manier zu einem kleinen Hochhaus ausbauen k\u00f6nnen, wenn wir wollen. Haben wir alles richtig gemacht, den Markt gut im Auge behalten, gut gewirtschaftet und richtige Entscheidungen getroffen, besitzen wir viele Milliarden Euro, hunderte von Mitarbeiter und Software die jeder Mensch auf der Welt nun kennt. Gl\u00fcckwunsch an euch. Ihr habt soeben den Status eines Bill Gates erreicht.\n\n\n[h1]\u200bGameplay:[/h1]\u200b\nSoftware Inc. Spielt sich sehr gut allerdings wird man, das sage ich jetzt schon, erst mal viele male auf die Schnauze fallen, bevor die Kasse richtig klingelt. Das liegt nicht an Bugs, von denen ich keine nennenswerten entdecken konnte und auch nicht an der Balance, an der viel gearbeitet wird. Es liegt tats\u00e4chlich an all die Dinge, auf die wir aufpassen m\u00fcssen. Am Umfang des Spiels. Am Anfang m\u00fcssen wir Geld reinholen. Das hei\u00dft, Auftr\u00e4ge von Externen erledigen. Das Ganze l\u00e4uft dabei so ab, wie mit allem in Software Inc. Sobald wir eine Software beginnen zu entwickeln, beginnt die Designphase, aus der Folgt dann der Kern einer jeden Software: Das Schreiben des Quellcodes und das Programmieren und verarbeiten von Grafiken, falls ben\u00f6tigt. Schlussendlich, kommt die letzte Phase. Eine Beta-Phase in der die Software auf Fehler getestet wird. Dann kommt die Ver\u00f6ffentlichung und Bestellmenge. Wir selber aber entscheiden, wie lange dies Phasen dauern sollen. Wir k\u00f6nnen jederzeit die Software aufwerten, mit den entsprechen Konsequenzen, wenn es zu fr\u00fch war. Entwicklung braucht Zeit und Zeit ist Geld. So l\u00e4uft das Prinzip von Software Inc. ab. \nDer andere Aspekt ist nat\u00fcrlich: Wie sieht der Markt aus? Welcher Softwaretyp gibt es nur wenig? Welche dominieren? Die Marktbeobachtung ist der Schl\u00fcssel zum Erfolg. Gute, auf dem Markt kaum vorhandene Software, verkauft sich extrem gut wenn die Qualit\u00e4t stimmt. Um das den Leuten in der Welt klar zu machen, ist es auch erforderlich viel Marketing zu betreiben. Nur so k\u00f6nnen wir eine Fanbase aufbauen, die sich vergr\u00f6\u00dfert und auch auf unsere Software schlussendlich wartet. Zu guter Letzt, sind auch die Mitarbeiter wichtig, die F\u00e4higkeiten und Bed\u00fcrfnisse haben. Wir m\u00fcssen darauf achten, dass die Mitarbeiter alle Bed\u00fcrfnisse in unserem B\u00fcro erf\u00fcllen k\u00f6nnen und dass sie auch miteinander auskommen. Ein Unternehmen mit schlechten Betriebsklima, mag niemand und vermiest am Schluss jede Software.\n\n\n[h1]\u200bUmfang:[/h1]\u200b\nSoftware Inc. bietet uns eine ganze Reihe an M\u00f6glichkeiten, wie wir an unser Ziel kommen. Das Spiel bietet ein erstaunlich umfangreiches Bausystem das an Sims erinnert. Wir ziehen W\u00e4nde, bauen Fenster, T\u00fcren rein, setzen M\u00f6bel. Dabei gibt es viel Auswahl und wie in Sims auch Objekte, die die Bed\u00fcrfnisse unserer Mitarbeiter stillen. Alle anderen Features spielen sich in Men\u00fcs und Tabellen ab. Hauptaugenmerk ist dabei die Software-Gestaltung. Wir haben viele Software-Typen denen wir individuelle Features hinzuf\u00fcgen k\u00f6nnen. Je mehr es werden um so l\u00e4nger dauert die Entwicklung. Es gibt zudem ein Server-System, Team-Verwaltung, Mitarbeiterverwaltung, Aktien, Marketing, Wirtschaftsanalysen, Software-Verwaltung und noch einiges mehr. Es ist zudem m\u00f6glich, ohne Probleme, sehr gro\u00df zu bauen und hunderte von Mitarbeiter zu haben, die Verwaltet werden m\u00fcssen. Micromanagemet wird in dem Spiel gro\u00dfgeschrieben und bietet f\u00fcr sehr viel Stunden etwas zu tun.\n\n\n[h1]\u200bGrafik:[/h1]\u200b\nDie Grafik ist sehr einfach gehalten und doch ist der Stil der Grafik stimmig und passend. Objekte besitzen meist wenige Polygone und Texturen sind recht wenig vorhanden aber ein gut ausgestattetes B\u00fcro sieht wirtlich ansehnlich aus. FPS-Einbr\u00fcche, auf Grund der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der B\u00fcros oder der Anzahl der dargestellten Mitarbeiter sind mir nicht aufgefallen. Trotzdem scheint auch die vereinfachte Grafik, mehr Leistung zu brauchen, als eigentlich n\u00f6tig. Da ist noch Optimierungsarbeit geragt.\n\n\n[h1]\u200bSound:[/h1]\u200b\nMusik gibt es nicht wirklich und Sound auch nur minimal im B\u00fcro Geb\u00e4ude. Es ist ein insgesamt stilles Spiel. Vielleicht kommt da in Zukunft noch mehr. Tipp: Musik nebenbei laufen lassen.\n\n\n[h1]\u200bZusammengefasst:[/h1]\u200b\nWem Game Dev Tycoon\u200b zu einfach oder zu wenig war, wird mit Software Inc. gl\u00fccklich werden. Das Spiel gibt uns alle Freiheiten, die wir brauchen, um einen Weltkonzern auf die Beine zu stellen. Marketing, Mitarbeiter-Verwaltung, Aktien, Mark-Beobachtung, Software Entwicklung, Auflage drucken und so weiter, steht uns zur Verf\u00fcgung. Die Herausforderung besteht darin nun, all diese M\u00f6glichkeiten geschickt anzuwenden. Klingt leicht, ist aber schwer. Software Inc. ist ein schweres Spiel und erfordert viele Anl\u00e4ufe, bis man das Prinzip wirklich durchschaut hat. Der Aufbau des B\u00fcros macht dabei sehr viel Spa\u00df, sowie das Ausknobeln, wie man nun am meisten Profit machen kann\u200b. \nDie Schw\u00e4che bei Software Inc. liegt in der Entwicklungsphase der Software. Das stupide reine abarbeiten, der einzelnen Entwicklungsphasen, ist langweilig und ein reines warten, bis man die Software hochstufen kann. Ich finde hier m\u00fcssen die Entwickler etwas machen, damit auch diese Phase des Spiels, spa\u00df macht. Auch die manchmal willk\u00fcrlichen Ergebnisse sind merkw\u00fcrdig. Mal verkauft sich eine Software super, manchmal nicht. Das Spiel reflektiert hier zu wenig die Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr solche Ergebnisse. \n\nUnterm Strich ist Software Inc. ein sehr unterhaltsames Spiel und erf\u00fcllt kleine Tr\u00e4ume wie: Wenn ich Microsoft gegr\u00fcndet h\u00e4tte, wie w\u00e4re ich vorgegangen? Was w\u00fcrde ich als Bill Gates tun? Ein Spiel also das auch die Fantasie zudem anregt. Von mir gibt es eine Kaufempfehlung, da auch die Entwickler st\u00e4ndig am Ball bleiben und es eine moderte Anzahl von sehr guten Mods gibt.", "timestamp_created": 1505469023, "timestamp_updated": 1505469369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34965514": {"recommendationid": "34965514", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989308243", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505757220}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing!

Well I have to admit after getting to grips with it from the start, I started to get into it really quick. \n\nYes the graphics aren't what I expected, but the gameplay is brilliant. The amount of projects that you can build/create is huge. At first I perhaps expected great amounts of capital to be gained easily, rather too easily. However that isn't the case with certain products, largely down to your employees and your management of them. \n\nWhat attracts me the most is the fact that you're able to expand your business in a way that is both great and intruiging. Great because you make lots of capital so that you may indeed expand the business, intruiging because there is no end as to what type of building you can create in order to expand your business. And it is this aspect that draws me into this game because I'm sort of addicted to it. The stock market addition is a great idea that certainly comes in handy early on within the game, because you can make huge amounts of money with the right investments!\n\nIt has a small Modding community that comes in handy to help the game become better, even though the vanilla is pretty good in itself, but there's no harm in trying to improve it. \n\n                     ----- My Review was based on the Alpha 8 ---------\n\nBEWARE:- If you're thinking of getting this, ALPHA 9 is much more difficult than ALPHA 8. Progress bar has been taken from the alpha phase of projects. More difficult to know what is required at alpha phase than it were in ALPHA 8. The marketing is much more difficult too and imo too much of a chore. If I wanted to work instead of playing then I would play this all day in ALPHA 9, because that's what it feels like to me and NOT a game anymore. I wish the DEVS would look into this and at least help and make it more user friendly again like they did in ALPHA 8.

Unlike some other tycoon games that where fun such as planet coaster, this made you think about the business side of your company. I will admit that it took me a while to pick up on most of the finer details of the game (I would say about 20 hours or me figuring it out to really get good at it), but what kept me going and playing this game even though I was struggling and at the start not having much fun, was the fact that I saw the depth and potential of this title; I am very glad I stuck with it.  There are still several things that need to be polished or flushed-out, but even in its current state if you want a deeper tycoon game, then pick up this title.\nSome tips: Just because your character is good at development (let's say 2D), he is not good at developing anything that is not his specialty (like audio). I assumed (wrongly) that if your character was strong in development he got a boost in the one you chose and a slight penalty in the others, not so. Albeit I think if you can design 3D in real life, that most of your skills would carry over to 2D, this game treats one like learning math, and one like learning English (just because you improve in one does not affect the other). Also managing team size is very important as 10 people working on a project might be less productive than a 2-man team. \nThings the game needs to improve: wall placement tool is sometimes wonky and annoying. The stock market portion does not feel fleshed out. I also want set number of companies, it seems that if there are <21 companies the game just generates a new one. I want to buy up all the companies, or have some kind of end game.  For contract/deals I want to be able to issue them. For example, if I make an OS, I was to be able to go to another company and say hey for $x I will pay you to port your program to my OS, or make it exclusive to my OS, things that you do in real life. I also think the distribution system is still too wonky as the workload is high and you make no money, it is a loss leader from my experience.

I would really like for the devs to not add more features but to flesh out things that are already there. And I cannot stress enough that I did not experience a single crash or other hiccup during 50 hours of play (!!), but I also think the gameplay is unbalanced and ultimately not challenging at all.\n\nFeatures\n+ The core (building, forming teams, defining products, watch their progress) is fun!\n+ You really feel like a software developer\n- Hosting and defining different server farms is cool, but as of now not interesting. There are no impactul events like outages or spikes, total failures that ruin your work if you didnt plan for it. Have enough and forget about it.\n- Distribution channels, insurance, company takeovers are clearly unfinished. Either the devs find a fun and meaningful way to include them or they should scrap them and focus on other things.\n\nUI\n+ Cloning tool work great, so building a multi-storey office is quite easy \n+ Wall clock shows actual ingame time ;-)\n+ I like the programming \"animation\". Looks legit\n0 Graphic quality is okay for this type of game \n- The game often does not provide the information I want \n      * Are Development taks assigned to SCM\n      * How well does an employee fit into teams (without assigning them first)\n      * How much does a team member contribute to the progress?\n      * How big an impact does the furniture/his skills/ actually have?\n      * Why does a product not sell?\n- Or is cumbersome to use\n      * Porting multiple products to other OS\n      * Scrolling in lists to pick the correct team\n\n\nGameplay / Balancing - This might need the most work! (Played on hard btw)\n- Outstanding quality products with every single feature in the book sell only a few copies, while the good game with only two features rakes in millions. It seems to only depend on your overall standing in that market segment\n- 3D-Editors eventually sell to millions of customers grossing half a billion $ easily and while OS usually don't attract much customers, if they do that sort of ends the game. You can overtake all competitors within DAYS\n- Competitors spamming the market with OS, yet its unclear what attracts customers to a specific OS. It's not a unique buquet of top notch software not available on other OS. Tried it.\n- Full blown marketing offensive on all channels costs 6k + salaries ....\n- Competitors pay you by the month to develop their stuff, so you are incentivies to keep finished work around till the last mont\n- Customer decisions overall totally unclear. There are not multiple products with different features - Every product has every feature and of them has all the customers.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1501457168, "timestamp_updated": 1501457168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33914914": {"recommendationid": "33914914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350669461", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515037395}, "language": "english", "review": "This is by far a very promising game but in the next update i look for a bit more challenge", "timestamp_created": 1501451650, "timestamp_updated": 1501451650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33903313": {"recommendationid": "33903313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040036156", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503721208}, "language": "german", "review": "Schickes Spiel.

I personally enjoyed every minute of my roughly 45 hours of playthrough, but I now reached the point where my company has achieved everything that could be considered a challenge. From this experience I can very much recommend the game to very patient simulation players with a liking for strategic details.\n\nMany negative reviews say that the UI is badly designed ond convoluted. Despite the learning curve being pretty steep I had no problems at all with the UI - most things are pretty much self-explanatory, you just have to take the time to explore it a bit and read the tooltips. The tutorial was helpful to me, I just did not like that it made me read tutorials for very advanced features I would not need anyway until mid or end game. But I never used a third party guide or even tips from the forums and still \"won\" the game with my first company.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the mechanics just don't work at the moment or are pretty hard to control (e.g. connecting server farms, especially large ones, assigning workplaces to specific workers and some of the building tools). \n\nWhat I liked about the game is the interplay of building and team logistic. There are several ways to make your software firm efficient (e.g. choosing between the \"one-team-per-franchise\" or the \"one-team-per-role\" organization or the decision between large cubicle-office vs. small room offices). All strategies require different building styles and development chains.\n\nBut all of this interesting stuff is mid to late game content. In the beginning of the game, the excitement of whether your company will make the release in time to pay the bills might keep you entertained, but at the same time the endless cycle of production -> dumb minigames -> marketing -> reinvestment (until you finally manage to satisfy the market demands) feels dull after a while. Once you find your software niche, it starts to get interesting with respect to team and building management, but if you succeed, there is really nothing you could do wrong anymore. Your first real hit software will most of the time give you an enormous financial boost. All of a sudden, you won't ever look at a price tag again. Only the best is good enough and of course you will never release a piece of software too early so that your work will always result in \"outstanding\" software. But where's the fun if everything you do is always \"outstanding\"?\n\nThe game starts in the year 1980. At around 2003 I had a perfect market recognition and millions of fans for every single type of product. There were no more new features to unlock that I could add into new releases and there was no more research to be conducted to stay ahead of the competitors. Instead, I turned so insanely rich that I would just buy every IP from my competitors that could even remotely threaten my monopoly. That was the point were I considered the game finished (with the only feature left to explore being a holo computer in the year 2020 for my workers that would slightly increase programming speed and with the only thing left to do being to earn more money until I could buy every single firm)\n\nThe graphics of the game seemed odd at first, but you really grow to like the simplistic models. It might not be state of the art, but the design is definitely cute and the exaggerated animations are worth a chuckle. Unfortunately there was no music yet.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nGraphics: 6/10\nStability and bugs: 8/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1501034088, "timestamp_updated": 1501034088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.770641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33791892": {"recommendationid": "33791892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006572625", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 3581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1516456010}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game", "timestamp_created": 1501006766, "timestamp_updated": 1501006766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33762740": {"recommendationid": "33762740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374968613", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493377003}, "language": "english", "review": "A very Great Game, and quite Complex, i really like the design of the office.", "timestamp_created": 1500891434, "timestamp_updated": 1500891434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33761588": {"recommendationid": "33761588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198393246100", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1516050636}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love it!!

Et bien ce jeu r\u00e9pond \u00e0 certaines de mes questions, bienvenue sur Software Inc.\n\n[h1]De studio \u00e0 gratte-ciel[/h1]\n\nVous imaginez bien, tout les grands cr\u00e9ateurs de nos jours ont commencer d'une cave, ou un garage : ici, les d\u00e9veloppeurs sont bien plus cl\u00e9ment, votre d\u00e9marrage est customisable, vous d\u00e9ciderez avant tout de la tronche de votre PDG (c'est important de savoir si vous \u00eates un beauf en short ou bien un homme d'affaires bien habill\u00e9) pour ensuite choisir un des sc\u00e9narios, sachant qu'il est fortement recommand\u00e9 en pleine libert\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir cliquer sur quelques boutons pour d\u00e9finir les param\u00e8tres de votre partie, ainsi que de vos caract\u00e9ristiques (qui comportent de nombreux facteurs), vous serez enfin lancer en 1970, \u00e0 l'aube de l'\u00e8re informatique !\n\nEt bim ! Vous voil\u00e0 sur un terrain de petite taille, a devoir construire votre propre petit studio avec vos fonds, et commencer a faire quelques contrats pour des entreprises en plein d\u00e9veloppement afin de vous faire des fonds suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n\nAu far \u00e0 mesure de votre bourse, les choses deviendront plus compliqu\u00e9, bien que vous ayez une libert\u00e9 totale sur la cr\u00e9ation de votre studio (que ce soit de la forme, de l'\u00e9quipe), il vous sera n\u00e9cessaire de satisfaire les besoins de vos employ\u00e9s et de travailler en fonction de leurs comp\u00e9tences et de l'actualit\u00e9 (car le jeu est tr\u00e8s dynamique par la concurrence qui souhaite vous en mettre dans les roues !).\n\n[h1]La prise en main[/h1]\n\nLe point le plus important est la prise en main : par sa tendance graphique assez cubique, on porte \u00e0 croire que le jeu est tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifique, mais je ne peux que vous recommand\u00e9 d'acheter ce jeu et d'appuyer sur tout les boutons !\n\nEn t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeant avant tout le patch fran\u00e7ais (qui est constamment mis \u00e0 jour) et en suivant quelques vid\u00e9os (dont celles de Bill Silverlight, par exemple), vous comprendrez tr\u00e8s rapidement comment le jeu fonctionne, bien que la perfection semble encore lontaine, vous d\u00e9velopperez votre cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 \u00e0 travers la beaut\u00e9 de votre studio (le workshop est rempli de petits g\u00e9nies et architectes qui font de jolis structures) ou bien dans la formation d'\u00e9quipes sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es dans certaines t\u00e2ches.\n\nTout les boutons sont souvent accompagn\u00e9s d'explication, ou bien d'une ic\u00f4ne qui vous fera comprendre leur sens. La partie la plus int\u00e9ressante, la construction, est tr\u00e8s facile \u00e0 prendre en main, puisqu'il est bas\u00e9 sur un syst\u00e8me de case (\u00e0 la sims) qui sont ajustable selon les meubles, les murs, etc...\n\nLes interfaces sont toujours semblables, elles sont tr\u00e8s visible, facile \u00e0 lire, aucun soucis l\u00e0 dessus, la couleur blanche tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re ne d\u00e9truit pas la r\u00e9tine au bout de quelques heures de jeux.\n\n[h1]La curiosit\u00e9 et la facilit\u00e9[/h1]\n\nEn apprenant \u00e0 faire un empire de l'informatique, vous aurez le plaisir de travailler votre cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 et vouloir toujours faire plus, et mieux organis\u00e9s. Dans mon cas, j'ai ador\u00e9 construire diff\u00e9rents b\u00e2timents, tous diff\u00e9rents, avec des parkings sp\u00e9cifiques et des bureaux adapt\u00e9s \u00e0 mes \u00e9quipes.\n\nH\u00e9las, \u00e0 un certain point, le jeu devient presque trop facile : \u00e0 part suivre l'\u00e9volution des ann\u00e9es (qui prend quand m\u00eame, plusieurs heures), les revenues sont cons\u00e9quent, et parfois les projets sont r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs.\n\nLe Early Game est bien plus tripant que le Late Game.\n\n[h1]Ind\u00e9pendant mais constamment en d\u00e9veloppement[/h1]\n\nBien que petit, ce jeu est toujours travailler par son cr\u00e9ateur qui souhaite apporter le maximum de contenu li\u00e9e au monde de l'informatique, par exemple, il y a quelque mises \u00e0 jours est apparut la vente physique de jeux, logiciels... C'est des ajouts au Gameplay qui donne envie de revenir constamment sur des nouvelles parties afin de voir ce qu'il offre.\n\nEn enqu\u00e9tant sur le d\u00e9veloppement du jeu, j'ai appris qu'un Trello \u00e9tait disponible : Le Trello est un site regroupant tout ce qui est en cours de travail par des petites cartes ce qui permet au d\u00e9veloppeur de trier ses projets, on peut ainsi suivre les progr\u00e8s et voir les id\u00e9es que certains joueurs ont eu.\n\n[h1]Prix et recommandation[/h1]\n\nC'est une petite merveille pour un studio aussi petit, il m\u00e9rite son prix, et je le recommande grandement au fan de gestion/simulation !", "timestamp_created": 1499995622, "timestamp_updated": 1499995622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670494", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33494825": {"recommendationid": "33494825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355974304", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513513649}, "language": "spanish", "review": "miren le e hechado 30 horas se que son pocas pero yo estaba construyendo un imperio pero si tienes mas de 50 trabajadore se vuelve tedioso es demasiada microgestion ademas que los graficos tarari que te vi pero esperemos a que salga", "timestamp_created": 1499918296, "timestamp_updated": 1499918296, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33467383": {"recommendationid": "33467383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198335188026", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501801070}, "language": "english", "review": "This game... is absolutely amazing.

The UI's (User Interface) is also very clean and almost never get in the way of your game, if they do, it can be easily dragged out of the way.\n\nYes, this game is easily worth the price set, in my opinion. I also love how many different choices you can make in this game. Just in case you do get bored of the items you have, you can download mods for the game, like furniture, building blueprints, software and hardware expansions all of these I deem very useful.\n\nOne thing I'm not particularly happy about is the fact how you can't have more than 1 saved game. Perhaps you can toggle it or something, but I have a feeling I'm being dumb. \n\nIn conclusion, Software Inc is an amazing game with a lot of variety of designs and different Softwares, the graphics are good for a game like this and the sounds are also lovely.

Specialise or branch out? Go cautiously or risk it?\nThe game feels alive with the staff and their actions.\nThere is just enough micro management not to feel overwhelmed - like rolling mini problems to solve.\nYou get to build what and how you like.\nMod support!

When I first bought the game it started me out on alpha 8 and it was the best experience I have had in this game. I built a nice compnay with 50+ workers and many products and buildings. When I saw that there was alpha 9 and i opted into it I was displeased. The game got 50 billions times harder and I was never able to grow a company again. My BIGGEST GRIPE with this game in terms of alpha 9 is the new development system. In Alpha8 you had a little bar that referenced how the project was going. It was simple and clean and allowed me to work on other things while I watched that meter grow. NOW, your work is repesented in units of code or art. You will start developing your software and it will start growing, however you have no idea about when to stop. You could just get a review in from your team, but its just a biased review. You can try outsourcing this review but it costs buttloads of money which can hurt you in the early game. Which is the reason why I dont use it.\n\ntl;dr:\nbasically what i'm trying to get at here is that the development part of the game is extremely confusing and hard to judge.

I dumped hours into Game Dev Tycoon and regularly play games like Cities: Skylines wishing I could start and manage my own company in game. Then I heard about Software Inc., and immediately plunged into it, expecting a fantastic and detailed sim. And to be clear, that's what Software Inc. is at its core - an extremely detailed sim.\n\nHowever, it's far too impenetrable in its current state. The developer has succumbed to feature creep and the tutorials for the game are nowhere near as verbose and informative as they need to be relative to how many things you need to manage. Additionally, many of the core game mechanics are hidden behind menus and right-click panels ad infinitum. Some serious thought needs to be dedicated to the game's UI, because a simulation game with a bad UI is the absolute bane of the genre.\n\nI'm certain that somewhere under the tens of windows the first tutorials instruct you to open, Software Inc. is a deep and well-made simulation. But until it becomes far more clear to play - you should NOT have to look up third-party guides to start your first playthrough, contrary to what many on the reviews for this game say - I simply cannot recommend this game to anybody other than the most dedicated and hardcore simulation players. Prison Architect is another game that suffered from this problem early in its development, but recovered from it spectacularly. I certainly hope the developer of this one takes a page or two from that playbook, and I look forward to seeing what comes in future updates.\n\nI expect people to be upset to see a thumbs down on the reviews for this game, but I won't refund this game simply because I genuinely believe in this game's ability to succeed.

I do'nt sweat details or get down under the hood for worker skills other than starting hire talent with decent money & check off all boxes especially 'specialization' & personality traits etc. (Save your time for important stuff lik should you purchase a potted floor plant or the expresso machine.) Special note:  potential employees should be treated as an investment and do'nt be afraid of spending money on searching for it - high skill, plus psycho personality are a no-no  for my biz. Also do'nt let employee age stop you from gaining critical team members. ( you can always kick older talent to the curb after the project is complete.) Hav not used education for leveling up employees much in the early phase of building up my current biz which currently is a mean lean money machine with permanent receptionist, cook, IT - support, maintaince & six employees.  Only hav one team - core which includes lead, marketeer, 2 programers, 2 designers, network wonk - all employees hav secondary skills so far I neglected sending peeps school. Currently hav half dozen software titles with titles from audio tools & sequels thru 2d editor and virus protection software.  1) Most important start out with just yourself & tiny office single software project - 2) Until you bank enough cash with contract work U can save up to 60k or more . 3) Then start work on first software release which will prob. take couple months. 4) Choose software release that matchs your talent & biz specialty - example biz specialty if audio tools you should choose audio tools software . 5) Select smaller project that requires the least quality like ' bad ' as opposed to ' good ' fyi  - less quality means less work time for you, and getting your software sold.  6)  Remember before software release while your project is still not finished at the end of  the beta phase - you should hire a marketing talented employee who will boost your sales if you start market campaign before end of ur software projects beta phase. Note:  prior to software release market campaign use radio, newspaper, interwebs, tv etc. 7) Check for software reviews notification and soak up the praise - good review & proper marketing will boost sales for ur software sales.

Only other game I've ever done that with was Kenshi (another great Steam Early Access game). Most of that time was multiple restarts learning the game.  And idle time reading/watching tutorials. Most of which are very outdated. You will be hard pressed finding current tips/tricks for the newest builds. You're best bet is to just jump in the pool and learn as you go.\n\nThe modding community is active somewhat and I think in the future as more things are added to the game the mods will get better and more abundant. \n\nMy only complaint I guess is just how easy the game gets if you are the first to release a type of software. The game literally goes from red bankruptcy warnings to the next day having millions of dollars. You build yourself a closet with room for you and a co-worker. You start programming on fast speed for 6 months. If you finish before your competitor and release your software it becomes a totally different game from the one you started playing. I suppose the game is alot like winning the lottery in real life. You go from hoping to make the rent to buying a real house for your dog overnight.\n\nI can't recommend this game enough. If you like business sims then this is gonna be a homerun for you. Even if you don't play those types of games I'd give it a try. This is a game that seems to be done right.

A bit of flailing and one more hopeful \"undo\" and, boom, kaput. What do I see in the next update patch? \"Fix for the bug where walls disappear...\". This guy is on it. Good times.\n\nOne gripe I will give is an echo of what I see from the few thumbs down comments I've looked at, and that's the lack of feedback as you're going along. I've done a lot of exterior research and googling to get around the lack of tutorials or in-game help. While it hasn't hampered my experience, I can certainly appreciate why it would irk some people. This thing really leaves you to your own devices, which, come to think of it, is kind of like real life (no \"progress\" bars telling you when your job is done) but can be cumbersome when you waste a bunch of time going down a certain path only to lose ambition and/or hit a wall and go bankrupt. A bit more feedback/tutorials on different ways to develop a strategy would be helpful, but I have to imagine that is a ways down the road (still early alpha). Even with this small gripe, this is still a great game/experience.", "timestamp_created": 1497156492, "timestamp_updated": 1500413406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32323102": {"recommendationid": "32323102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008418659", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507755341}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best management games out there.

Not only can you make software there are tons of other things you do and it feels a lot close to actually running a company. Making good software is the core of this game and has other things like Stocks, Team Management, Research, Distribution channels, servers and ofcourse the fact that you can build everything from scratch. \n\nThis is the most detailed review I will ever give for a game I suppose because I have been looking for such a game for ages and I want it to be the best!\n\n[b]Pros[/b]-\n[list]\n[*]It is very very realistic .Examples- A perfectly good product will fail if you launch it after a bigger similar software is launched. If you fail to deliver on a contract, you lose credibility and you get lesser deals and lesser talents for hiring. You deliver contracts before time, your credibility increases. Over work your employees and you get bad products. Dont release a sequel to a successful product and you start losing fans. Every action you take will have a direct affect on a lot of things which is similar to what you would expect in real life.\n\n[*]It's not just about the software, there are a lot of other things you indulge in. You can research technologies and receive royalties. You can buy stocks of other companies and if you think any product will suit you, you can Trade IP or just buy out the company. You can make different teams and assign different works to them I had one support team to take up deals and support products, two core dev teams and one Marketing teams. You can take up hosting in your servers for other companies. There is insurance, pensions after retirement and loans.\n\n[*]You get a lot of information before you make a decision. You can see how other companies are faring and see their detailed charts like a public company should. You can see all the software released ever and all that will be released in the near future. You can see details of every employee like how are they fitting in the team, what is decreasing their productivity etc.  \n\n[*]A really detailed and easy building (Remins me of Sims). Things like selecting all the furniture in a room and modifying them, copy a whole desk setup etc are really helpful. Building management seems very real as well. You can assign rooms to teams or to roles, restrict room usage, decorate rooms etc.\u00a0You have to maintain the correct temperature and proper lighting. It's almost as good as the Sims(That's a huge compliment) but with lesser items and graphics\n\n[*]You can play it for hours without getting bored. The first time i played, I played 13 hours at a stretch!\n\n[*]The graphics is appealing, not realistic ofcourse, but good to look at!\n\n[*]MODS! I can see that once the game becomes popular and we have community modders, building wise, it will be The Sims. \n\n[*]No Bugs as such even though it is in Alpha. I mean I did not get any weird behavior or glitches like sofware failing for no reasons or workers not working for no valid reasons or not even graphics glitches. That's pretty big for a game still in Alpha!\n\n[*]The Multi-Window feature. You can keep multiple windows open and drag them around like Windows. It's very helpful when you want two information at the same time. Like if you are deciding which company share to buy, open \"All Companies\" window and then open \"Upcoming softwares\" window at the same time to make better decisions. It would have been very irritating (I am looking at you Sims!) if i had to close one and opne next because there is just a lot of infomation to keep track of! \n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]-\n\n\n[list]\n[*]It's very exciting and nail biting when you are starting out and short in money but all you need is one big success and then it becomes a cake walk. You just cannot lose after that. I launched one 2D editor which gave me 250 million dollars and then launched a Operating system which gave me 6 Billion dollars and I could actually buy out all the other companies! The problem is the software building costs. it will at most take you just 10 million dollars to make the top end software and you will lose atmost 5 million, thats nothing. Once you get big, software building costs should go up into hundreds of millions and you should lose a lot of money if the product fails.\n\n[*]The stocks system makes it very very easy. Once you have earned a couple of millions, all you have to do is buy out stocks of newly launched companies. 5 stocks will cost you 300000 dollars and they will return you atleast 50 million dollars. If they dont all you lose is the initial amount which is nothing! I once bought a 5 company shares worth 50000 each and each evaluated at 89 million dollars later. It can happen with one company once, not all of them. \nThere is a lot of things the dev can do- Bring concept of IPO, you cannot just buy companies as they come. It is upto the companies to decide that. Bring dilution that happens in real life. Just beacuse i bought 25% in 50000 doesnt mean it wiull remain 25% all the game. To maintain shares you have to keep on investing. That way you have higher chances of losing money, and that is what is exciting. It shouldn't be so damn easy to make 100 million dollars from 50000.  \n\n\n[*]No other company ever has reached a a billion dollar evaluation. Just like there is competition when you are starting out, there should be when you are successful. It's not exciting if there is no competition and you know you can buy out all the other companies. \n\n[*]The interactions between companies are non existent. I want other companies to buy my shares, offer me to buy my IP, threaten me with lawsuits, publicly say bad things about me to affect my credibility, Attempt to take over my company. I should be on the toes while making any decisions!\n\n[*]Project automation is not good. The first thing a team of 7 did on automation is build an OS. I think automation should be for taking up contracts or deals so that they can be independent but not stupid.\n\n[*]There is some optimization problems with lighting. at night whrn lights are on and esp in building more, the fps drops down to 8-10. Change the time of the day and then again it's smoothb as butter. I don't have a beast of a laptop (i5 6th Gen, 8GB RAM, GTX940M) but this seems more like a optimization issue rather than system requirements.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Suggestions[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Just because I took over a company, doesnt mean I want full controls. They can be independent companies owned wholly \nby me which i can invest in to make it bigger or sale it later. That's More realistic. Also I should be able to create a subsidary company which will only make games, which again will be independent. The bigger you grow, you would want to branch out.\n\n[*]There should be a way to do illegal stuff. Real life companies does it all the times. There is a risk of finding out and you can be sued for that by other companies or prosecutors. You can settle or fight in court. Also there should be prosecution by other rival companies even though you did not do anything illegal! It sounds exciting. Corporate espionage to find out important crucial data like what features the upcoming software has or to steal data sounds good too.\n\n[*]Employee poaching would be fun too. Employees don't leave the company now! What's the fun in that? It will be more exciting if the employees have a project value to them . If a programmer has built an OS and is then poached by a rival company, they will make a better OS from his experience and I would take time to find a equally good replacement. I should be able to poach employees of rivals as well who comes with value.\n\n[*]Some building items like lights, fans and exhaust dont need human interaction. So I should be able to place an exhaust on the wall which has a table in front of it, or a light anywhere.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1497095597, "timestamp_updated": 1497095597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 151, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.933376", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32304305": {"recommendationid": "32304305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094058297", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497193639}, "language": "english", "review": "For a game that's on early access, I assure you that you're gonna have an awesome time playing this.\n\n11/10", "timestamp_created": 1497050526, "timestamp_updated": 1497050616, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581679", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32275169": {"recommendationid": "32275169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150359247", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514484718}, "language": "english", "review": "its ok", "timestamp_created": 1496953776, "timestamp_updated": 1496953776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.362600", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32265931": {"recommendationid": "32265931", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998318318", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509276586}, "language": "german", "review": "Absolutely insane game!!\nReally nice Sim, it is very cool to build your own building and watch your company growing. \n\nVery good Tutorials, nice micromanagement but not to complex. \n\nPlay that game!!!

I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who like simulation games in general. \n\nThings I would like to see:\n- Offer Employees to become partners - This means that they effectively start working as your founder does.\n- Addition of Hardware - Though this is available in a mod but I don't think it is optimized all that well. A feature that would allow you to create an assembly line of hardware like servers, desktops, laptops etc.\n- Company mergers - I can be horrible wrong with this as it may already be in the game and remains unexplored by me, but,in my defence,  I did try to find out ways in which I may be able to buy a simulated company. I just couldn't figure out how to. If that is not in this game that addon would be absolutely incredible.\n\nLast but not the least.

Erbau seiner eigenen Gesch\u00e4ftsstelle. \n\nSo ist es zum Beispiel m\u00f6glich Aktienhandel zu betreiben, in diesem man viel gewinnen, aber auch viel verlieren kann. Meinen ersten Spielstand h\u00e4tte ich somit schon fast gegen die Wand gefahren, da ich in die falschen Companys investierte, die letztlich Pleite gingen. \nDazu kann man sich noch genaue Statistiken der Kontrahenten anzeigen lassen; Beispielsweise die Produkte die entwickelt wurden, wie hoch die Gehaltszahlungen, Dividenden, Abs\u00e4tze, allgemeine Ausgaben, Aktien-Investitionen usw. \u00fcber die letzten Monate & Jahre waren.\n\nBesonders cool finde ich, dass es eine M\u00f6glichkeit gibt, die jeweiligen Ver\u00f6ffentlichungs-Termine der Konkurrenz einzusehen (Sofern diese Bekannt gegeben wurden). So entsteht eine Art Konkurrenz-Kampf und erfordert Planungsgeschick. Entwickelt man beispielsweise gerade eine Game-Engine, deren Entwicklung einige Monate/Jahre in Anspruch nehmen kann, und man sieht, dass zu dem geplanten Wunsch-Release-Zeitraum, von Konkurrent A ebenfalls eine Game-Engine ver\u00f6ffentlicht wird, muss man absch\u00e4tzen ob es sich z.B. lohnen w\u00fcrde die eigene Software ein oder zwei Monate fr\u00fcher zu releasen. Was auf der anderen Seite wiederum mit Zeitdruck verbunden ist um ein optimales Ergebnis zu erzielen. \nDenn gerade am Anfang ist das Risiko des Scheiterns gro\u00df. Vor allem wenn der Konkurrent ein paar (Hundert-)Millionen Dollar/Euro, oder Fans, mehr auf dem Konto hat.\nOder aber man verzichtet auf den direkten Konkurrenz-Kampf und nimmt sich lieber einige, kostenintensive, Monate mehr, um den Release sp\u00e4ter zu vollziehen. \n\n\nDie andere gro\u00dfe, wenn nicht sogar die gr\u00f6\u00dfte St\u00e4rke, ist der Bau/Ausbau der eigenen Gesch\u00e4ftsstelle. Es gleicht wirklich einer Art Sims-Aufbau Spiel. \nMan hat praktisch v\u00f6llige Freiheit wie man sein Geb\u00e4ude gestalten & dekorieren will. Sp\u00e4ter, mit dem n\u00f6tigen Geld, sind sogar wahre & luxuri\u00f6se Geb\u00e4ude-Komplexe m\u00f6glich, die vom Server-Raum im Keller, bis hin zum Meeting-Raum in der obersten Chef-Etage reichen. \n\nEbenfalls gilt es die richtigen Mitarbeiter einzustellen, auszubilden etc. \nIn diesem Sinne ist es auch wichtig die Angestellten bei Laune zu halten. Eventuell mit einer Kantine, Ruhe-Raum, Wasser-Spender, sch\u00f6n dekorierten R\u00e4umen, oder kurzen Arbeitszeiten uvm. Ja, man kann sogar die Arbeits- sowie Urlaubszeiten festlegen!\n\n\nLetzten Endes m\u00f6chte ich auch keine weiteren gro\u00dfen Worte dar\u00fcber verlieren. Hier ist auf jeden Fall das Potenzial da, eine nette, spa\u00dfige & fordernde Manager-/Wirtschafts-Simulation zu werden, was man im momentanen Stadium wirklich sehr gut zeigt und sich auch von anderen Genre-Vertretern schon deutlich abhebt. \nMan sollte sich auch nicht vom Grafik-Stil abschrecken lassen. Er ist wirklich besser als man denkt und passt sehr gut ins Konzept. \n\nWer Aufbau- sowie Manager & Wirtschafts-Simulationen attraktiv findet, und auch Spiele wie Game Dev, oder Mad Games Tycoon spielt bzw. gespielt hat, kann um Software Inc. eigentlich nicht herum kommen. Vor allem bei diesem Preis nicht!\n\nMan sollte sich auch nicht von der englischen Sprache abschrecken lassen! Es gibt im Workshop auch gewisse Deutsch-Mods die einen gro\u00dfen Teil \u00fcbersetzen. Wenn auch nicht Alles, da einige S\u00e4tze wohl fest im Spiel verankert und nicht \u00e4nderbar sind.\n\nVon mir gibt es daher eine klare Kaufempfehlung! Da man f\u00fcr 14\u20ac wirklich einige Stunden in diesen Titel versenken kann. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492289421, "timestamp_updated": 1492289421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31160391": {"recommendationid": "31160391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021500938", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505244048}, "language": "english", "review": "These people have no clue what agile is! \nLots of potential.\nPure sim only atm, no reward system for end user.

I've played my share of time sinks like Minecraft, Factorio, and Fantasy Life.  These types of 'just play' games can be absolutely absorbing as you build, design and or grow.  With Software Inc. however, I have to be honest: I've never felt like I accomplished anything or even something I was happy about.  Your software is just a name among other pieces of software.  You never feel like you contributed to a changing market, or cornered your own slice of it.  Your software isn't special or unique, or even interesting.  Neither are your company or employees.  Factorio has no point, but I can examine my ridiculous supply chains and product lines knowing I built all of it and it's full of my own dumb solutions and compromises.  Software Inc just doesn't have ... satisfaction.\n\nIf I sat down and really chewed through it I could probably identify exactly why I don't like this game, but it really doesn't matter when the end result is my first point: when I'm done playing, I literally feel like I've wasted my time.

However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever get to a point where every piece of software you release will feel completely unique, as this was never the point. Software Inc. is a business management simulation and I can\u2019t think of many management focused games that achieves that sense of accomplishment you get from Factorio or Minecraft, as the focus is more on strategy, planning and gaining virtual money, rather than perceivable creativeness. \n\nNonetheless, I think Software Inc. adds that sense of accomplishment through the building mechanics. The management aspect of the game is supposed to feed into the building aspect, where you can get creative and build something unique, while working around the constraints of the system, like noise, temperature, environment, space optimization and minimizing walking distance. This part of the game suffers greatly from the fact, that once you make a successful product in Software Inc. there is no challenge, everything is just handed to you on a silver platter. I\u2019ll be aiming to balance construction costs in alpha 10, to make expanding your building and adding new wings more satisfying. I think adding the ability to rent office space at low cost will make building your own office that much more satisfying.\n\nI have taken you criticism into consideration and I do believe a lot could be done to make the development process feel more personal and in-depth. If you have any ideas to make the market feel more responsive I would like to hear it. The market is currently completely dynamic and responds to everything you release, I don\u2019t know if that comes across very clearly while playing, though."}, "30418407": {"recommendationid": "30418407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275810283", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489733313}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!

It's designed very well, both graphically and technically.\n\nI have so much fun playing it. My Software business feels alive. Most simulation games like the populare game dev simulators out there don't offer this \"feeling\". Other games feel very robotic, but Software Inc. has a nicely structured and well developed AI that feels less like an AI and more like a living software company.\n\nHopefully the modding community continure to release new assets like new furniture and other nice stuff. 3rd party furniture is a huge part of the game if you're into the designing aspect of Software Inc.\n\nFInal verdict - Early Access 10/10!\n\n_____________________\n\nFOR THE DEVS:\n\nThis game would improve by offering more granularity to the statistics that are viewable to the player and maybe a calculator that is part of the interface. (e.g. I have an outsourced support team that only does Support Deals. Currently, I can only see the total income from all Deals, but I would like the option to divide this further by deal type... support, marketting, hosting, etc. This will help manage the efficiency of my offices.)\n\nI also find it hard to manage people I send out on Education or I miss notifications that tell me when people retire. it would be nice to have separate sound effects for different types of notifications (with the option to enable and disable certain notification sounds in the options). It's nice that you have some color coding in the notification corner, but I play this game very fast (most of the time I'm on speed 3) and I have my eyes on different parts of the screen. It would be nice to rely on audio for my notifications.\n\nAlso when people retire I'd like to be able to see info about them so I know what role needs to be hired to fill the vacant position.\n\nAnother small detail that may be important to new players, whenever the next year starts and there are new things to research, there should be a sound effect and the research icon should glow or at least change color.\n\nLastly when the annual pay raise window pops up, I'd like more information about each person to help me with the decision of firing them or giving them the raise. :)\n\n\n\nThese are just some ideas that would benefit my playing style (less automation and more hectic manual management of the business), as I'm sure other people play the way I do. Great job on the game, it's a pleasure to play.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487822680, "timestamp_updated": 1487822680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642562", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30084409": {"recommendationid": "30084409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121860183", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 978, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487008001}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Oyun temel olarak \u00e7ok tatmin edici olmayabilir fakat mod deste\u011fi sayesinde oyunu olduk\u00e7a zenginle\u015ftirebiliyor, derinle\u015ftirebiliyorsunuz.

It's confusing, and everything you make starting out will be horrible quality. You and your employees will randomly sit there doing nothing, even when you have a contract to complete, or software to develop. I have no idea why they're doing this, and the game doesn't clearly tell you why. There's no clear way to increase your skills. Unlike other, similar games (from Game Dev Tycoon to even Game Dev Story) where you'll naturally become more skilled from projects you complete, you seem to stick on your poor skill level with Software, Inc. Overall, the game is obtuse with how you become better. It feels like in many ways the game strives for realism, but goes past the point where it should've stopped. Your software won't sell, you won't make any profit, and it just creates a frustrating and confusing enviroment. Even with tutorials out the wazoo (pretty much everything you click pops up with a tutorial), the game doesn't give you a clear path to success. I don't ask for the game to hold my hand, but just give me clear paths and steps I can take to get towards some amout of \"success\". I don't want to be forced to put a ton of hours into a game just to get remotely good. Other, similar games didn't ask this of me. They showed me that with every project my in-game skills would grow and improve, leading to better projects, more money, and a clear (though not always easy) path to success.\n\nI was really interested and curious about this game, but my expectations were no where near met, which saddens me greatly. I wanted to like this game so much. The videos I've seen of it make it seem so fun. But, in practice, I'm left dissapointed, especially someone who's budget doesn't allow him to constantly buy games. \n\nMaybe one day the game will be good, or at least good to me (my opinion in very much in the minority here). After all, this game is still in Alpha. I hope to give it another try, one day.

As habilidades s\u00e3o divididas em Sistema, 2D, 3D, Audio, Network, Algor\u00edtimo e \"Base Skill\", a \u00fanica que n\u00e3o pode ser adquirida com cursos de capacita\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nTodos essas categorias que citei anteriormente s\u00e3o divididas em at\u00e9 3 ramos, s\u00e3o eles, Design(Desenho), Programa\u00e7\u00e3o e Art, caso voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tenha nenhum proficional preparado em alguma dessas \u00e1reas certamente o seu software vai ter deficiencia em alguma coisa.\nAl\u00e9m das habilidades citadas anteriormente tamb\u00e9m h\u00e1 mais dois ramos que s\u00e3o \u00fanicos, habilidade em Marketing e em Lideran\u00e7a(Voc\u00ea pode pagar cursos para que seus funcion\u00e1rios aprendam essas \u00e1reas tamb\u00e9m), qualquer funcion\u00e1rio seu com uma boa taxa de lideran\u00e7a pode coordenar uma equipe para o desenvolvimento de qualquer trabalho que estaje sob a sua responsabilidade.\nSeparadamente o jogador tamb\u00e9m pode contratar funcion\u00e1rios \"secund\u00e1rios\", como faxineir@s, profissionais de TI, manuten\u00e7\u00e3o, cozinha, entrega, recepcionista e cozinheir@.\nEnfim, o jogo resume-se a isso, construir uma central de desenvolvimento, brincar com a arquitetura e a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos pr\u00e9dios, criar estacionamento, centro de destribui\u00e7\u00e3o, e assim que poss\u00edvel adquirir as empresas concorrentes.\n\nSeguindo o racioc\u00ednio l\u00e1 do come\u00e7o, o jogo demonstra uma incr\u00edvel linha de evolu\u00e7\u00e3o, quando eu comprei ainda estavam implementando o sistema de estacionamento, agora, quando voc\u00ea cosntroi estacionamento seus funcion\u00e1rios vem de carro, e n\u00e3o mais de \u00f4nibus, o que vai lhe dar algum tempo de trabalho a mais. Atualmente o jogo ficou um tempo parado pos os Devs tiveram de mudar de escrit\u00f3rio, mas agora j\u00e1 estamos recebendo o Alpha9, que conta com mais uma incr\u00edvel variedade de recursos, o que mais se destacou para mim foi sem d\u00favida poder imprimir c\u00f3pias f\u00edsicas dos seus produtos e distribuir, enfim, [b]o jogo mant\u00e9m-se em constante evolu\u00e7\u00e3o, nos bastidores podemos observar uma equipe cheia de potencial e amor pelo que faz, acredito que vale muito a pena, mesmo pelo seu pre\u00e7o integral(diga-se de passagem \u00e9 muito barato inclusive para n\u00f3s, R$ 26,99).[/b]\n\npara quem quiser acompanhar de perto os planos, segue o cronograma oficial do que deve vir em cada novo atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o:\nhttps://trello.com/b/9I286Mhu/software-inc", "timestamp_created": 1486505074, "timestamp_updated": 1486507108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29767236": {"recommendationid": "29767236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162391784", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513848372}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this is currently (and since years) one of the best management games.

Dies ist keine typische Game Studio Sim wie z.B Game Dev Tycoon. Das habe ich tats\u00e4chlich auch erst im nachhinein gemerkt, (H\u00e4tte besser recherchieren sollen) hat mich dann jedoch auch keineswegs gest\u00f6rt. Man merkt deutlich, dass der Entwickler sich sehr viele Gedanken \u00fcber die verschiedenen Prozesse gemacht hat und alles m\u00f6gliche bis ins kleinste Detail ausgearbeitet wird und wurde. Ich spiele zum Zeitpunkt der Review 54 Stunden und ich entdecke noch immer neue Dinge. Davon habe ich die meiste Zeit sogar ohne Mods spielen k\u00f6nnen (die ich tats\u00e4chlich auch erst vor ca. 4 Stunden reingepackt habe, um das mal zu testen.)\n\nIm Prinzip kann ich das Spiel jedem empfehlen, der Bock hat einfach ein bisschen rumzubasteln und ein cooles Software Studio zu bauen und damit den Markt in verschiedenen Kategorien zu erobern.\n\nWer auf den Wirtschaftsaspekt aus ist, der sollte vielleicht lieber noch ein bisschen warten. Der Teil ist n\u00e4mlich stark unbalanced. Du baust dir erst ein 2D Editor mit Qualit\u00e4t Outstanding und vermarktest das ordentlich... Wenn du alles richtig gemacht hast, hast du ab dem Zeitpunkt fast schon unendlich Geld. Ich habe mich als OS Entwicklerstudio versucht und habe nach ca. 10 Jahren schon 1.000.000.000\u20ac... Balancing l\u00e4sst also noch zu w\u00fcnschen \u00fcbrig. \n\nIch sehe das ganze tats\u00e4chlich eher als ein \"Die Sims - Entwicklerstudio\" wo ich einfach nur fr\u00f6hlich vor mich hinbaue und mir in meinem Kopf eigene Geschichten zusammenspinne. Wer darauf steht, der sollte hier zugreifen!\n\n\nFazit:\n+ Super gut durchdacht\n+ Sch\u00f6ne Grafik\n+ Super Spiel zum drauf losbauen\n\n- Aus finanzieller hinsicht noch zu unbalanced\n- K\u00f6nnte vielleicht noch die ein oder andere Komfortfunktion vertragen\n- An einigen Stellen fehlt es an Erkl\u00e4rung, warum etwas so ist, wie es ist. (z.B permanent vereinsamte Mitarbeiter, die trotz offenem B\u00fcro, einer Lounge, gro\u00dfe Kantine und regelm\u00e4\u00dfigen Teammeetings anscheinend keine Kontakte kn\u00fcpfen k\u00f6nnen und daher alle 2-3 Tage in deinem B\u00fcro stehen und eine Gehaltserh\u00f6hung als Entsch\u00e4digung wollen...)", "timestamp_created": 1485477405, "timestamp_updated": 1485477405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29510770": {"recommendationid": "29510770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013915326", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512908334}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable management sim/tycoon.

Tutaj te\u017c musze wspomnie\u0107 o beznadziejnym systemie \"projektowania\" tych program\u00f3w.

Wraz ze wzrostem firmy gra zaczyna si\u0119 robi\u0107 problematycznym klikaczem, dlatego s\u0105 opcje automatyzacji zespo\u0142\u00f3w i samej produkcji (co te zespo\u0142y maj\u0105 produkowa\u0107 wybieramy sami, one zajmuj\u0105 si\u0119 samym procesem tworzenia od zera do wydania, akurat \"wymy\u015blanie produkt\u00f3w\" zjecha\u0142em wy\u017cej).\n\nGra ma tragiczny GUI, jest on ma\u0142o czytelny, trudny do opanowania dla nowego u\u017cytkownika oraz niesp\u00f3jny, s\u0105 tutoriale ale s\u0105 stworzone na podstawie z\u0142ego GUI przez co niewiele pomagaj\u0105. Warto te\u017c pami\u0119ta\u0107, \u017ce gra posiada szcz\u0105tkowy i przeci\u0119tny soundtrack w\u0142\u0105czaj\u0105cy si\u0119 tylko czasami, natomiast d\u017awi\u0119ki otoczenia s\u0105 takie jakie powinny by\u0107.\n\nGraficznie i optymalizacyjnie nie jest \u017ale. Gra obecnie zawiera benchmark, kt\u00f3ry automatycznie ustawi ci opcje. Og\u00f3\u0142em powinno p\u00f3j\u015b\u0107 na jakim\u015b intel hd graphics w niskiej rozdzielczo\u015bci, ale jest tak du\u017co opcji, \u017ce nawet gtx 1080ti gra wym\u0119czy. Ja posiadam gtx 970 i i5 4590, gra sugeruje ustawienie medium i na dosy\u0107 podobnych gram. Minimalne wymagania s\u0105 lekko przek\u0142amane, to jest bardziej to co autor chce \u017ceby by\u0142o minimalnymi wymaganiami, obecnie gra poch\u0142ania gigantyczne ilo\u015bci ramu, 8 gb wci\u0105ga bez problem\u00f3w. Prawda jest taka, \u017ce gra jest bardzo zaawansowan\u0105 symulacj\u0105 i po prostu musi troch\u0119 wymaga\u0107, mimo prostej grafiki.\n\nNajwi\u0119kszym minusem gry jest poziom trudno\u015bci - gra jest banalnie prosta i ma s\u0142abo zbalansowany system ekonomiczny.

You can choose the difficulty, speed of gameplay, starting funds, starting time period, traits, and skills of your founder +. You are able to set a basic appearance for the founder, but this is clearly not a focus of the game +/-. \n\nYou cannot customize the size/capabilities of the competition outside of the basic difficulty selector -. This games does not simulate real companies and products, but it does realistic simulate technical progress +/-. That means you won't find Microsoft or Valve in the game. On the plus side, this means the market is unique to each playthrough, vastly improving replayability +.  \n\nOnce you set up your world, the game will simulate a number of years before your start date. This creates a background market (operating systems and some other various basic programs are already on the market) in the game...the software industry does not spring out of nowhere +. \n\nYou start off by designing your office which can be a challenge in your first game +/-. The building interface is reminiscent of the Sims and is very intuitive and the interface flags things that you might have forgotten (temperature control, for instance). The office is fully 3D, and you can make very impressive multi-level structures +. Because of the time dilation, office optimization is much more important in this game than in real life (takes a lot longer for an employee to get somewhere than in real life) -, but that is par for the entire tycoon genre +/-. \n\nYou make profit generally by releasing software or doing contract work for other companies. The game accounts for personnel management and some basic asset handling (insurance, your stocks, pension, investment in other companies, and your distribution vector). This kind of stuff is information heavy and marks it as a more serious management game compared to a casual simulation (which is a + for me). \n\nThe nuts and bolts of the game is in balancing your cash flow so that you can produce software in a timely manner but also somehow pay for your employees in the mean time. This appears to be an accurate portrayal of the industry from an outsider's perspective (I am a banker, not a tech company developer in real life) +.\n\nPersonnel management is well developed. Employees are individualized with looks, traits and compatability. They can be assigned to teams, request raises, get sick, come in late and go to training/education +, There is an HR level in the game that can be automated which means hiring/firing/assignment/raises etc can be delegated to in-game employees. The same exists for project leads which allows you to scale your business to the dozens or potentially hundreds of employees and not be -as- bogged down in micromanagement +.  \n\nThere is a basic R&D component in the game, centering around patents +/-. The implementation at this point is not very good -, but it is a new feature at the time of this review. Otherwise, tech progress is a function the game year and not otherwise controllable. At this time, research is not a major part of the gameplay -.\n\nThere is a large selection of software types and the 'features' that make them up. The more features, the more powerful the product, but the more time it takes to develop. Software Inc. does a very good job in tying together the various kinds of software you develop together +. For example, you use your visual and audio editors (or license another company's) as well as a game engine to produce a game. This is quite natural and lets you enjoy intermediate products (editors, for instance) as well as the more well-known end-user ones (games, etc.) +.\n\nMarketing exists in Software Inc., but only in a basic fashion. You can choose your vector (internet, radio, etc.) and simply pour money and manpower into it +/-. This is being fleshed out to include timing releases with marketing in the next update +. There is a similar gameplay depth in running servers and your own (abstracted) store. In the next update, physical distribution (printing your software onto media to be shipped out) is also being added to the game.\n\nThe difficulty curve is inverted. It is quite difficult in the beginning and becomes easier +/-. While this is similar to reality, games tend to avoid this. It is too cheap to scale your company -. After your breakthrough release, the game is easy -. The other gameplay scales fairly well and plays interestingly at both the one-person company level to the I don't know the names of all of my employees level +. \n\nThe structural and world graphics are nice enough for this level of game +/-, but are not comparable to larger budget sims (Planet Coaster for instance). In particular, character models and animation are still quite weak -, but they've improved significantly recently +. There is a feature to save layouts for buildings in game, which is a massive + for replayability (if you don't want a unique office in every game), and there is a function for copying individual rooms if you want to copy/paste standardized designs in your structure(s).\n\nSoftware Inc. supports mods and the workshop +. Because the gameplay design is in flux, gameplay mods are usually broken and the community is small -. Most 'mods' are office designs -.\n\nSound quality in the game is not memorable +/-. If there is music (and I don't think there is), I can't remember it at all, even after a lot of hours -. Audio production is clearly not a goal for this game which is reasonable for the genre +/-.\n\nIt is very bug-free for an EA title, but bugs do exist. Stability is no concern in this game +. Because it is developed on Unity, it is not ever going to be greatly optimized -, but the current state of optimization is sufficient for its scope +/-. It is too heavy for its weight, but that doesn't make it a heavyweight game, so to speak +/-.\n\nThere is no tutorial/campaign mode -. It is pure sandbox, so if you are expecting a narrative or progressive objectives (do this, do that!), this is not the game for you. I never play the campaigns in tycoon type games myself, so this isn't a concern +/-. No campaign means you are thrust into the thick of it, relying on the interface to teach you the game -. It wasn't a big problem for me, but for players who are not genre-savvy, it could be a concern +/-. \n\nThis is an EA game run by a single developer made on Unity. Be aware of this if you buy this game +/-. That said, the developer is both industrious and transparent (has a public development Trello). In other words, you don't need to trust the developer. You can check on his progress at any time and make your own judgment. Because of these traits, I have great faith in the developer +. Just Google Trello and Software Inc. if you want to check it.\n\nAt this point, the developer could release the game and abandon it and would be a decent game that I would recommend +, and in its current state can give many players a good cost/hour ratio. This is a safe purchase in that sense +.\n\nSoftware Inc. is a good game. It shines as an example of a successful single-dev EA game. However, the genre has weak competition and is not well developed. There are some game development simulators out there, and I enjoyed Mad Games Tycoon, but it is a different class of game. Software Inc. feels and plays like a PC game. The other ones feel and play like console/mobile games, if you understand my comparison. If you want a more streamlined, casual/arcadey simulator, this may not be the game for you. Software Inc. is more akin to Football Manager in a genre full of FIFAs (+ for me).", "timestamp_created": 1484181802, "timestamp_updated": 1484183787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 60, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842838", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29192739": {"recommendationid": "29192739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159473586", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 94, "last_played": 1515814097}, "language": "english", "review": "Software Inc. is extremely fun!

Not for the more action- or graphics oriented gamer and not too much of a challenge to be had (if you're decent at simulation games that is :P).\n\n[h1] What is the game about? [/h1]\nThis is a great example of one of those little gems out there made by indie developers. Software Inc. currently already has quite enough options and variety in what is essentially a sandbox game. With the basic starting settings you begin with a few thousand bucks and the tools to use those to build yourself a tiny room/garage with a table and computer. Your ingame avatar then starts hammering at his keyboard alternating between developing new software titles and doing some contract work, because the latter pays a lot more bills at the start. It's impossible to compete against the pre-existing companies out there at that moment. You start getting some consumer recognition, improve your skills, hire some employees and proceed to take over the (entire?) software market if done right. You do this by out-earning your competitors and buying all of their stock and do a hostile takeover (netting you their intellectual properties along the way). It's fun, can be quite engrossing (with a bit of roleplay, because otherwise it's all just managing sliders and figures) and is worth it's current \u20ac 14 (or regional equivalent) pricetag. Is it perfect? No, not quite. Here's a breakdown of what I consider the game's good, bad and noteworthy 'neutral' characteristics:\n\n[h1] The good: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]It's a proper simulated sandbox game:[/b] meaning that there is no handholding and the game simply has a set of rules that will net you a win if understood and exploited properly. For instance, it's important to note what (kind of) software you release. If you release a few decent virus scanners the consumer will notice and your \"fans\" will increase future interest, sales and thus profit of another released virus scanner. Not so much if you change tack and decide to release a first person shooter instead. It might still do ok, but nobody figured that your company \"Kapsersky\" would release a decent game. Makes sense, right? Other companies don't sit still either and will constantly develop new software. Looking at the \"upcoming releases\" it's important not to time your small company's anti-virus release with \"Bug Squasher 6\" made by the current dominant force in the game. There's more examples -and- there probably is more pseudo-simulation going on than is apparently noticeable, but it feels involved and complex enough and not like you're being railroaded from a garage to a medium office to a captain of industry.\n[*][b]The building and office customization you can do is well done:[/b] the game offers a fairly powerful and easy to use build mode a la the Sims where you can go crazy in building the office you like (of course constrained by your current budget). [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/voeter/screenshot/428232315148646337]Here[/url] is my first playthrough attempt of a software company office. You can customise the building exterior, interior, flooring, colours and of course the furniture. The only downside here (that will hopefully improve over time) is a limited selection of placeable furniture. [b]edit[/b] After looking at the workshop, there apparently are already a load of mods out there that add a -lot- of extra furniture to play with. If you have an interest in decorating your office I recommend you check them out! [b]/edit[/b]\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The bad: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Lack of a challenge, especially mid-/lategame:[/b] Once you get past the first start-up hurdle it seems pretty much impossible to lose the game. At the start I guess you -could- lose by refusing to take contracts (that will easily net you enough money for ingame years of fiddling around with software development) and/or going crazy and hiring a bunch of employees you cannot afford, but other than that I've never felt -any- pressure to perform so I won't lose/go bankrupt/get bought out by the AI (if the latter is even possible). I'm hoping/kind of expecting this to change as the game develops further though.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The noteworthy neutral: [/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The graphics: The game isn't exactly built on the cryengine. It looks fairly basic (as you can see from the screenshots) but in my opinion does have it's charm. When you have customised your own office, zoom out a bit and look at it through cloudy skies I kind of like it. Your employees hammering away at their keyboards with outstretched arms when coding their next masterpiece is fun to see too. On the upside, although not the best looker the visual part of the engine is coded well and gives me an excellent framerate all the time. There's lots of similar \"meh\"-looking games out there that for some reason tank your fps to slideshow speed with too many actors on the screen, lots of lighting to be rendered, when going into build mode, etc. Never the case for me with this game\n[*][b]Limited replayability(?):[/b] After about 15 hours I nearly finished my first playthough. I expect to buy out every competitor in about an hour or so more of churning out my top of the market programmes. I'll probably start over once more and try a different approach/specialisation in certain softwares but that'll be it for me. I'm not really that interested in creating huge works of architecture or 'winning' even faster by building an office 10-20-50x the one I have now and managing dozens of projects at the same time. I like to play sims to enjoy the simulation, the associated emergent gameplay and to basically -not lose-. Considering I've pretty much seen (and enjoyed) the first two and the not losing part isn't really relevant I hope future additions, changes and/or mods will help in the future :) As for you reading this review, if you got this far, I hope my bit of insight helps you to consider if this is an issue for you or not.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1477164837, "timestamp_updated": 1477170403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492590", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26147906": {"recommendationid": "26147906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042718233", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495477496}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a lot of potential.

Take a few months off to get educated.\n\n1982 - start your first serious development project by hiring a 2-3 staff, a couple to help your founder develop and code, plus a marketer to hit the phones so the thing actually makes money. Rinse, lather and repeat.\n\n1984 - work out that your teams are much happier and more productive if you make one of them a Lead and make the team have meetings and co-ordinate their efforts, and most importantly, get to know each other's most shameful secrets. (\"I liked the ewoks!\" - *gasp*)\n\n1986 - one of your titles (probably 2D or 3D editor with innovative features) takes off and now you can afford a dedicated team to create an operating system while you have other teams working on smaller projects - mostly sequels to your hit to keep the cash coming.\n\n1990 - Your first OS does well enough to make a reasonable profit, but it's definitely niche and only used by people who've heard of the internet. Start working on Version 2,\n\n1992 - you have enough people working in your firm that you need several cooks to keep them fed. Hope they like spaghetti bolognese.\n\n1995 - Congratulations, you are Microsoft. Commence driving your competitors to the wall until Apple gets Steve Jobs back.\n\nI bought this as EA a while back, it was a bit barebones but the potential was there. Fortunately, development has continued and I am now pleasantly surprised how \"sticky\" the game is now since I've gotten back into it (October 2016).\n\nThere's quite a bit more meat on the bones, and is now pretty compelling as what is basically an office sim - if you work in a office, you can pretty much set up. Software just happens to be the product your worker drones. It is quite dry, but is also cute in its own way. It seems a little more free-form, in that once you get the cashflow working you can set up several teams working on different projects at various stages. (By this point I'd say the UI/UX could use a few quality of life improvements, as you start having to scroll the job list to keep track of it all, but it's really not too bad as is)\n\nI guess if there's one element that could do with some balancing, it's the end-game progression which can hit you pretty quick and the monetary challenge just goes *puff*. But then you can build an enormous office full of drones and commence world domination. The 3D modelling is representative rather than realistic but to me, it's just about right between eye-candy and performance, given that you could potentially employ hundreds (I haven't really pushed the limits yet!).\n\nOf course, this is still in Early Access, so there's probably more features and improvements to come. For instance, maybe more variety of furniture and building objects (although the building system is really quite flexible since you now build things at weird angles), a little more sophistication behind the economic and technology models, although these probably need a tweak more than an overhaul. \n\nThere's also a pretty decent modding scene on Workshop, with a bunch of furniture, building blueprints, as well as new software and even hardware types that you can develop just in case vanilla doesn't give you enough to do.\n\nSo def recommend as it is already pretty solid, although I would like to see more stuff added to it.", "timestamp_created": 1476345750, "timestamp_updated": 1476345750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744649", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26007113": {"recommendationid": "26007113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090782901", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 3135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515963028}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good.

This feels somewhat like it, just on a whole different level.\n\nI enjoyed this game a lot yet (and I will enjoy it more!).\n\nPros:\n- Sims-style building with much freedom\n- Very funny simulation of workers (e.g. team-meetings and eating in canteen)\n- A whole, huge software-ecosystem that you step into with many different software kinds to specialize in\n- Intuitive controls, simple and clean UI, everything works beautifully\n- I like the graphics-style. No pseudo-realistic shit that drops your performance, just right for a simulation game\n- Extensible a lot!\n\nCons:\n- Performance goes to shit after 600 employees for me, even when I set all graphics to very low (Playing with all on high and it gets 60 FPS with lower amounts of employees). There's a lot of space for improvements.\n- Only like 10 building stories possible. No trump tower :(\n- More software-kinds would be awesome. I also feel that specialization isn't worth it mostly and the impact of education is pretty low. I'd rather have it that one team that developed OS for years shouldn't be able to quickly switch to developing a game. Actively educating employees should feel more rewarding.\n- At a later point in the game it seems too easy to simply buy all competitors out,\n- Software needs even more traits to choose from, every half year should unlock something new for all software types as at later stages most software you produce is basically the same as before, maybe one new trait added.\n\n\nSteam Workshop...meh...I'd like to have some kind of object-packs with provide stable new objects to build and maybe new software kinds of many different ways, but I can't really list this as a con, as it's about what the community will produce in the future.

I have several (many!) like it, because I love these kind of management games. This, however, is a cut above the rest already! It's surprisingly deep and seems extremely well balanced for realism; and I do have some experience of this, since I am a software developer for real (yeah, I know... I play a fictional software developer in my free time, now, too!)\n\nStarting off as a struggling developer working out of a 3x2 'shed', reluctantly doing contract work to fund my own pet project, ultimately to be disappointed by the traction of your first and second releases, dealing with exorbitant development licenses just to be able to build your software for the latest and greatest operating systems, and paying for game engines and image editing software and the like. A little later, one of my projects finally catches a few thousand peoples attention, and I make 100k profit from it; enough to increase my office space, add a few creature comforts and take on a likeminded individual to help me with version 2. By the time we complete it, operating systems have moved on, and the money we spent on licenses is all for nought. Fortunately, we are able to port it to the latest version of the OS (at a cost, naturally!).\n\nFast forward 15 years, and I now employ 40 people including a dedicated design team and support team, and not only do I do my own software, I design, test, support and server host for a range of companies... many that I have bought shares in when they were new in the market, then helped to succeed (or fail... in order to buy a particularly juicy piece of IP from them!.). I have a bunch of team and project leaders to help me delegate and organise; I can't do everything myself! \n\nI even have my own software distribution system, and now my ambition is to become the next Steam. ;)\n\nAs I said, it's a pretty deep game, with research, OS and engine dependancies, porting of software, marketing, trading IPs, stocks and shares etc as well as the people and resource management you expect. Not to mention the freeform building and furnishing of your offices, which gives it an additional and very personal sort of 'The Sims if you were micromanaging their work instead of their lives' vibe, rather than just manipulating a bunch of stats.\n\nYour employees are surprisingly complex, too. They have personality, skills, learning abilities, laziness, likes, dislikes etc that affects their interactions and efficiency as a team. I have employees that I actually hate - that the rest of the team hate - but they're so darn good at their jobs I put up with them. The fact that individual employees can evoke this kind of reaction rather than just being 'some generic employee' is testament to how well this game plays.\n\nSo anyway, the fact that you can do all of the above within the confines of a \u00a310 early access game is extremely encouraging and though I'm not sure what else there is to add in an already well rounded game, I'm sure it can only get better. \n\n\ntl;dr: I'm always cautious about early access but if you like micromanagement business sims, this is as good as they get and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1474459046, "timestamp_updated": 1474459046, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25596626": {"recommendationid": "25596626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089421060", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507928802}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good.

I haven't had a game pull me in like this for a while, it's a lot of fun.\n\nThe building tools are fantastic, allowing effortless construction, merging of rooms, moving of furniture (with clever grouping of items - ie. move a desk and the chair, computer, phone all move with it). You can build multiple stories and below ground, customise styles and colours, copy and apply styles, it really is one of the nicest building tool-sets I've used, there seems to be a way to do everything from the simple right click menu. The only time I had some trouble with them was when I enclosed an outside area by adding other rooms and couldn't understand why it wasn't behaving like a room should, but once I realised what the problem was I simply used the wall tool to trace the room and could then manipulate it properly.\n\nI really like the variety in the approaches, there appear to be lots of ways to play the game, specialising in different kinds of software, buying and selling IPs, researching new technologies and licensing them, running hosting servers for other companies, as well as a few others. My first software company specialised in making video games (in fact only RPGs and Adventure Games) but I'm really excited to start again and try a completely different approach. It will be interesting to see how many are viable ways to run a successful company.\n\nThe tutorial popups are a nice touch, as a lot of early access games throw you in the deep end with little to no guidance of what you should be doing. They're certainly not perfect, and there were definitely times when I was confused about certain aspects and wished there was a little bit more information, but it was definitely helpful when just getting started.\n\nBeing early access, there are of course parts of the game that still need to be further fleshed out, there definitely could be more feedback on exactly why certain things fail to sell as well as perhaps adding ways to do market research or see market trends. A lot of the things I felt were missing or incomplete (like software expansions) are already on the development road map for inclusion in future updates so plenty to look forward to.\n\nI wouldn't normally recommend an early access title unless you really wanted to support the developer and help steer development/find bugs, however in this case I think you'll already be getting a fun game on top of that.", "timestamp_created": 1474276182, "timestamp_updated": 1474276274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590612", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25579917": {"recommendationid": "25579917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109723782", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499621352}, "language": "english", "review": "\n\nBuilt my measely company up from a couple of thousand pounds and now earn over \u00a3450,0000,000 a month.\n\nI have bought stock in all my rivals and the dividends support my staff wage bill.\n\nI Own all the patents, or at least a share in each company that has one.\n\nI just wish this was real because I wouldn't be typing this, or if I was, id be typing it from my private island...

Haven't had this much fun since the original Transport Tycoon.\n\nYou're basically a developer / entrepreneur who's come into some money in the 80's / 90's / 2000's (all defined by you before you begin the game) to start a business - in the software industry.\n\nYou start off with building a little shed for yourself (similar to your first ever cave in minecraft) and begin coding away. A few contracts for other firms to gather some money and before you know it you're designing your first application. You market it, it sells somewhat decent and you find yourself with a load of cash and start dreaming bigger.\n\nFast forward to two extra offices and a mid sized team crunching away to deliver what you hope the piece of software that will put you on the map!... But.. things aren't going as fast as you'd hoped and that wad of money you got from your first application is waning dangerously low. In a state of panic you lay everyone off and try and finish the app yourself. It takes forever and you realise you're pretty much broke.\n\nPut the project on hold - grab a few contracts - get yourself some leeway and back to the project! You manage to finish it in twice the time you would find acceptable but there it is anyway. Fingers crossed you do your marketing and release it.\n\nYou can't wait for the next day to pluck the fruit of the huge amount of work that went into this - only to find out it sold shit.

I can't find any real pattern within in. Sometimes you create something and you earn $5.000.000. Other times you don't. No feedback on what works or not whatsoever. The game is complex but this is not the problem. The problem is that 90% of the time, there are formulas you have no idea about working behind it.\n\nFor example, you can get the IP to a software that will earn you millions for a few tens of thousands. On the other hand, you need to pay millions for a software that generates virtually nothing. As a matter of fact, if you simply want to skip playing the game, just get some money through projects and buy IPs. The first time I've done this, I've made close to a billion in a single day. \n\nPlus, I don't understand how it scales. I can get 100 programmers, 100 designers and 100 artists and put them to work on a single project but honestly, it will be just as fast as using five of them.

You could be the owner of a huge business with many micro teams while a main team owns and runs the entire company. With a huge engrossing on the power of time technology has grown in, making better upgrades to your company and having a better array of decoration, power, and servers for your company to have. It makes the game seem endless in design, and in ways, it is if you added custom scenarios or just go on the \"Free-play\" mode.\nEven though the game is still in alpha, it still has it's gritty bugs that can be annoying, but, the developer is quick in their bug fixes. Having at least weekly to bi-weekly updates to the game. Even allows users to go to the unstable build of the game if they so desire to; to see how the progess is going in the game, frankly myself goes on the unstable build but however it's very stable, just some bugs like a simple menu not popping up or already minimized. But with the game still being in alpha, it's offered me over 25 hours of enjoyment. And I still have that itch to keep playing the game but personally I want to wait until the next build before I go and play the game. \n\"The game is overly complicated,\" or \"This or this doesn't work, negative review cause so and so,\" are obvious oversensitive remarks about the game to just give it a negative review, making buyers fear that the game is way too difficult. Honestly it's not, it's just a game of trial and error. You're working in the techno world of business, you have your ups and downs, and the game gives you a loan of 50k USD to help get you on your feet and yes, you have to pay back the loan with interests. It's a business game, not a simple, \"Oh you failed, have some candy,\" kind of game. It still has that sense of realism to it.

This was a really un-fun amount of micromanagement, having to click 50 different prompts to advance the contracts through the different stages of completion before the month whizzed by and I was bankrupt again.

I liked the customization, loved the mechanics, and all together found the game a GREAT time waster. However, as this is an early access game, it has shifted in direction and evolved as updates have been released. Some of these changes are really great, but in its current state, I cannot recommend this game. The balance went from forgiving and inviting, to a perfect glass ceiling, in which you will not, no matter how well you play, reach in the billions of dollars as you could in previous titles. Sometimes, it takes me 10-15 in game years to reach $50mil, other times, longer. This frustrating brick wall, combined with new distribution systems, Sound - which is difficult to work around, resulting in several office rebuilds, and other new implimentations, make me think twice about recommending it.\n\nThere is a good game in here, I've seen it firsthand, but it's not where it needs to be.

The continutation of adding depth and the subsequent variation that provides is resulting in one of the best management simulations I have played in recent years. Add to that the fact that this is a one-man operation makes it all the more impressive. \n\nI'm not generally a fan of the graphical style used here. However, that this is all done by one person makes it a sensible and pragmatic design choice, and I think it works very well. \n\nI'd like to see some more options in the way of keeping track of employees, as I find that once I get beyond a staff of 10, I'm more focussed on building an overall cohesive unit, as opposed to perhaps focusing on the individuals within the team. I'd also like to be able to see what role a retired employee used to do, and perhaps have the option to increase their pension! I do feel bad when someone retires early on, and they're essentially left with a pittance compared to employees who retire later. \n\nThe development mechanics work very well, with the addition of overstaffed teams having a negative impact on the development of a given product. I love being able to create and expand my company office space, and I think the tools given to do that are very well implemented. I'd like to have more choice in terms of items and equipment, maybe with different brands, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, and perhaps even with employees preferring a certain brand. For example, in terms of office equipment, Dell vs HP vs Viglen vs Apple. \n\nI would love to see implemented a mechanic where if you buy out a company, you can keep it operating, perhaps elevating one of your team leaders to oversee that company, and build a larger conglomerate within the game world.\n\nI haven't yet checked out the latest Alpha, but I am excited to see where the developer goes with the game, and I really thoroughly recommend it to anyone who loves an immersive management sim.

A lot of the features still need developing but it plays as a solid, if sometimes bare-bones Tycoon game. That being, said, it is one of the most complex Simulation games I've ever experienced. You have a great deal of customization with the software you put out, and micromanaging your team is surprisingly enjoyable. \n\nOne of my favorite parts, however, is office customization. Using a Sims-style building system, you construct an office to meet the needs of your staff and your development style. It's surprising how rigorous this system is even with the admittedly little content the game currently has. I daresay 40% of my playtime is customizing and recustomizing my office as I grow and adjust my company. \n\nThere are some things that definitely still need work. The sheer amount of information to keep track of is often overwhelming, but very little of it seems relevant. I imagine a little simplification is in order paired with some better UI design. Furthermore, sometimes building or managing individual staff members can get frustrating due to the counterintuitive order of actions you have to do to move an object or assign a computer to someone. \n\nOverall, an absolutely excellent experience even in this alpha phase, even if it definitely needs some improvements before it can be the excellent Tycoon game it is so clearly shaping up to be.\n\n-PROS-\n-Complexity for days, interlocking systems and plenty of control of every minor decision.\n-Extreme Customization, moreso than I've seen in almost any other Tycoon game.\n-Simple, low-poly visual style lends itself well without looking cheesy.\n-Very flexible difficulties and decent tutorials to learn at your own pace\n-Excellent mod support, with plenty of Custom Content in the workshop.\n\n-CONS-\n-Missing music and sound. VERY lacking from an Audio standpoint. Dev says he has contracted out for music, so hopefully that will be in here soon.\n-Clunky, Ugly UI.  Arguably my biggest complaint. While certain parts move sleekly, the UI is very poorly designed, flow from one window to another is confusing and the presentation of information makes it unclear what you're supposed to be prioritizing. The general aesthetic of the UI also leaves much to be desired.\n-The Simulation and Competition doesn't really feel present in the current build. The news feature I never check aside from when I release software and there's no announcements of developments or new technology, so it's hard to get a feel for how you should be driving your company in light of the competition.\n-The lack of content is apparent, and hopefully will be continued to be rectified. This is a game that thrives from it's rich, deep simulation, so the few items that come in game are frustratingly limiting.", "timestamp_created": 1468802418, "timestamp_updated": 1468802418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24381196": {"recommendationid": "24381196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253453591", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496837431}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon jeu :)", "timestamp_created": 1468799292, "timestamp_updated": 1468799292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24378237": {"recommendationid": "24378237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062688862", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1063, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503617557}, "language": "german", "review": "Eine erfrischende neue Ann\u00e4herung an das Sub-Genre der Spieleentwickler Wirtschafts Simualtion,\nWer sich nicht nur auf Spieleentwicklung sondern vor allem auf Mangement & allgemeiner Software Entwicklung, gepaart mit Aufbau Elementen \u00e4hnlich der Sims Spiele einlassen will, der ist hier genau richtig.\n\nDie Grafik ist simpel, aber mit Hilfe von Licht und durch geringe Texturierung \u00e4u\u00dferst Stimmungsvoll.\n\nDer Sound beschr\u00e4nkt sich zu gro\u00dfen Teilen auf Ambient sounds, welche aber jederzeit passen.\n\nDas gameplay ist fordernd und komplex aber nie zu schwierig.\n\nWer sich f\u00fcr solche Spiele interessiert sollte zugrifen, alle anderen sollten auf einen Sale warten, und dem Spiel eine Chance geben.", "timestamp_created": 1468785766, "timestamp_updated": 1468785766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24364042": {"recommendationid": "24364042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023598497", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 8443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505009202}, "language": "english", "review": "JUST BUY IT!

I was dead wrong about that.\n\nIn fact, it almost bombarded me with micromanagement details, from the smallest character flaws of potential employees to a robust server system and a catalog of options on types of software to zone in on and carve my very own virtual niche in the market. It was everything I wanted, and much more. Almost too much more. An overwhelming sense of more.\n\nIt was a bit much, more than I expected, and I admit to not catching onto the learning curve until my second jump in.\n\nOnce I caught it, however, it's been non-stop. \n\nSo there is a bit of a learning curve to it, but the tutorials are nice and simple and helpful. For once, I caught myself wanting those tutorials, rather than letting my hand go to roam about on my own.\n\nWhat an enjoyable game. The freedom and flexibility to either stay super small, a clique of \"buds\" that just crank out some indy games and scrape by, riding the waves of the popular tides and not making waves.

I liked Game Dev Tycoon but ultimately it was too easy and not in depth enough. But this game, holy sweet tits - I don't even know what to say or where to begin. So I am going to make it a nice Good/Bad list.\n\nGood:\n- You can make hundreds of decisions. You can develop an OS, an Audio Tool or even a game (and a lot more) and you can go into specifics for each piece of software. What OS should your game run on, what engine does it use, what features do you want to have,... You have hundreds of options to create exactly what you want!\n- You can hire hundreds of workers and divide them into teams. You can have a support team who support your already released software, you can have a Sports Game team who releases a new Fifa every year,... SO MANY POSSIBILITIES!\n- You can build your company's HQ like a sims game. Build rooms, add windows, buy servers, pcs, drawing tablets, plants, build parking spots, elevators, a reception desk, air conditioning,...\n- Your workers have needs and you need to fulfill them. They don't want to work in a cold and loud room with a bunch of people who don't fit their personality!\n- You can automate a lot of work. If you want you can do most stuff by yourself but after 20+ employees it becomes tedious to look for new meat and you might want to hire a team leader who helps you with that. Same goes for cleaning, maintenance, IT support,...\n- You have competition out there. Be it other games, a console, 3D software tools or even a store (yes, you can create your own version of Steam and dominate the PC platform) - you have competition. You can look up all (upcoming) releases in a database, look at their features, success,...\n- There is soooo much more, too much to cover (Insurance, Stocks, Advertising, server management,...)\n- The graphics are cute and it runs very well (not sure how good it runs once you have 1000+ employees but so far it runs stable on highest settings without a single crash)\n- Steam workshop support\n- The industry changes fast. You can't just release your software on the same OS with the same tools for 20 years. You have to take risks. For example I created the first game engine with 3D rendering but at the time there was only one OS with 3D rendering support which had only sold ~100k units. I took the gamble and still developed the engine for that OS and thankfully their operating system took off so my engine did as well. What if their OS didn't get popular? I would have had a huge problem! Great risk/reward!\n\nBad:\n- The interface can sometimes be a bit clunky\n- Generic names for competitors so you forget them too quickly (Did I release my game on OS7 or OS8? Or was it Pen7 or Pen8?). Maybe colors/logos would help, I don't know.\n\nVerdict:\nI am totally in love with this game. And it isn't even close to being finished yet. The first hour can be a bit slow (thankfully the tutorial is solid) but then the game takes off. Expanding your company, taking risks, eating competitors and being part of history is very rewarding and fun.

Do not get this game if you aren't comfortable with failing and learning.\n\nI was a bit hesitant to purchase Software Inc. because of the early acccess bit, but after browsing the game's official forums and the steam forums I can see that the developer pays attention to and shares information with the community. For being a solo developer, that's quite impressive and I'm glad that I can support him by getting his game.\n\nRegarding the actual gameplay, it's essentially Game Dev Tycoon on steroids with the Sims, with micromanagement and far more complex mechanics. You will fail multiple times on your first few companies until you learn how to get off the ground and stay above the red. I enjoyed the learning process because I felt it somewhat emulated real life tech startups (failing multiple times to succeed).\n\nOnce you grasp the core mechanics and gameplay loop, you'll find quite a few interesting systems to interact with. Some of these systems are as follows:\n\n1) A stock market (you can release stocks, buy out other companies, etc.)\n2) Distribution networks (change who sells your software, online/brick-n-mortar, etc.)\n3) Server management (some software will require you to set up a network for server access)\n4) Employees/teams (build teams, assign work to them, train/management)\n5) Research\n6) Development cycle (design, alpha, marketing, beta, post-release support)\n7) Mods (easy to mod due to developer support, almost anyone can mod XML files)\n\nSo yeah. Get the game if you're on the fence about it. It's a fantastic simulation game even in alpha with great promise and a developer who communicates with his community.", "timestamp_created": 1467046084, "timestamp_updated": 1467046084, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23863475": {"recommendationid": "23863475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015074035", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480795417}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Pros:\n-Little to no bugs.\n-Now upgraded with decent graphics (could be a bit better tho, more realistic)\n-Nice building system\n-Lots of options for the kinds of software and hardware to make (especially with installed mods from workshop)\n-User friendly\n-Regular updates and hot fixes. \n\nCons:\n-Can get a bit repetetive \n-Very easy to get a lots of money and not as big of a challange (i like it)\n-Could be more building objects available, like grass, small fences, grills, more paintings, etc. (dont get me wrong, there are lot of objects ingame, and workshop offers a lot too)\n\n\nUltimately i recommend this game.

The way you can manage staff and construct so many different types of software makes it a very deep in depth game for Early Access.

J\u00e1 me diverti muito criando empresas mega bilion\u00e1rias que praticamente dominam o mercado, como tamb\u00e9m ja criei empresas mais enxutas que fizeram bilh\u00f5es apenas com poucos produtos. \n\nCom a ajuda de alguns mods \u00e9 poss\u00edvel deixar o jogo melhor, mais op\u00e7\u00f5es de softwares a serem desenvolvidos, possibilidade de se come\u00e7ar nos anos 70 por exemplo e come\u00e7ar com um dinheiro absurdamente reduzido. Como os arquivos s\u00e3o em XML, eu mesmo editei alguns deles para deixar o jogo mais dificil, como os softwares que dependem de auto-update, se tiverem muita venda, consumirem muito de um servidor, obrigando a voc\u00ea criar verdadeiras \"server farm\" gigantescas com teras e mais teras e mais teras de capacidade.\n\nMaaas agora vamos aos problemas.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 facil, bem f\u00e1cil, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 muita dificuldade nele, apenas algumas decis\u00f5es erradas no come\u00e7o podem te fazer ir a fal\u00eancia, mas... \u00e9 90% de chances de voc\u00ea \"vender bem\" no primeiro produto, e dai, voc\u00ea s\u00f3 vai crescer, crescer e crescer e virar arqui-bilion\u00e1rio com dinheiro suficiente para comprar o Planeta Terra.\n\nO Desenvolvedor planeja inserir algumas coisas como uma nova distribui\u00e7\u00e3o (ao inv\u00e9s de digital) como f\u00edsica tamb\u00e9m, porque n\u00e3o \u00e9 realista nos anos 80/70 existir distribui\u00e7\u00e3o por via de download.

This teaches you the ropes of how to manage your employees while they're working. Then it'll ask you to start hiring some staff, and to do this you have to pay for and manage an interview process, which allows you to choose a good fit for your company. Then it'll ask you to build some software, and oh boy, does the game open up here. You have to consider a bunch of things, like what competition will be releasing soon, how long it will take you to finish the software, how big your audience will be which is defined by what operating systems you choose to build the software for.. and I could go on. It's so in depth and if you love that kind of thing then this game is definitely for you.\n\nMake sure you follow the tutorials at least once, as they'll teach you some vital stuff, it's so worth it when you get that first overnight million in the bank and it feels like you earned it because you were managing everything to earn it.\n\nAnother thing to note is the dev seems really active with the community, and is also building the game out with more features at quite a fast pace, which is fantastic and refreshing to see in the early access scene.", "timestamp_created": 1466276333, "timestamp_updated": 1466276333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23633171": {"recommendationid": "23633171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059507774", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491066800}, "language": "english", "review": "Steve Jobs simulator.", "timestamp_created": 1466259795, "timestamp_updated": 1466259795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502999", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23624622": {"recommendationid": "23624622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307513938", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496688483}, "language": "english", "review": "I Pay $13.99 For A Game That Crash's Ever 30 Seconds", "timestamp_created": 1466215468, "timestamp_updated": 1466215468, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.322440", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23624116": {"recommendationid": "23624116", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045496838", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486846148}, "language": "english", "review": "It is everything you could possibly want in a game from this genre, You can micromanage everything or you can automate your company.

I accidentally found it while searching for tycoon games and what a surprise it was! This is the best software development game I've played compared with Game Dev Tycoon, GamersGoMakers, Mad Games Tycoon etc.\n\nWhat sets it apart is the simple graphics and the smooth interface. It is easy to learn the controls and build big impressive looking office complexes. \n\nYou start as the founder of the company starting to work on a few small contracts. From there you start developing your own software: Antivirus, games, operating systems, audio and visual design software, ect. As you grow, you can expand your office and workforce. It's entirely up to you how much you'd like to micromanage. You can assign team leaders and send them on HR and project management courses allowing them to hire and manage teams and their own projects completely independently. The game scales incredibly well as you expand your company.\n\nSome might find the micromanagement a little overwhelming. This game was really well thought out and you have all the data you might need at your disposal.\n\nIt is early access so there are some glitches, and the game could do with more content.

There is too much of a gap between 1990 and 2000\n- The interface for assigning teams to projects needs to be in a single screen, where you can drag and drop and see where they allocated/overallocated\n- What about creating toilet cubicles.... why must I enclose each toilet with a wall?\n- I don't understand/like the HR manager and Project Manager implementation, why aren't these separate roles like IRL\n- I know the same is about Software, but why not introduce a Hardware manufacturing element (DLC maybe?).

Perhaps you can commission a report to see what people think about your product and suggested pricing points?\n- Time to develop should increase with better equipment, it doesn't feel like this every changes\n- Servers never seem to keep up with demand and the wiring mechanic is screwed. Why can't they all be linked together, there seems to be some arbitrary limitation that is beyond comprehension?!!?\n- Stocks: There has to be a better way to implement this. Also it would be cool to be able to take control of companies after you own more than 50% and set their objectives. i.e. what they can and can't make.

A Commodore 64 and an Amiga 500. Games genres didn't seem to have boundaries and game developers came up with cool ideas and concepts. You could walk into independent stores and see shelves of games you had never heard of, take a punt with your weekly pocket money and usually find an gem.\n\nThen games companies found a \"formula\", make an FPS or RTS and it's a money spinner. People \"designing\" games stopped being gamers and devs and started being business men and bean counters. Things got grim...until...indie devs making their ideas into games in their home offices (and normally trying to hold down a proper job at the same time). We got back to the golden years of spending a pocket money amount and finding a gem of a game that is just different.\n\nThis game is a \"golden years gem\". It's different, it's not following the formula. OK there are a few indie games you could say the same of but this game just feels, well, different!\n\nHow? Well to start with it's the detail. I'm a software developer in real life, we follow the Agile development process and before that we just did everything sit of pants style. This game allows you to create your software company following (loosely) the same methods. Start off as a 1 man team doing everything very seat of pants. Hire staff, grow, expand your business and offices. As you get bigger then start creating teams of devs and designers to either work on core software or more ad-hoc titles. \n\nYou can choose to be a business software company, games, art packages or do a bit of both. And here is the gotcha, you actually start to \"care\" about your business and staff, the game draws you in that deeply.\n\nAt the point it's still in early access but I've had no issues with crashes or anything major. There are some points that need polish:\n\n-Needs more options on furniture and equipment. 10 years before a computer terminal is upgraded is a long time and we all know tech moves a lot quicker!\n\n-Non-squre rooms are sometimes difficult to recreate with a 2nd floor (walls don't seem to want to snap to endpoint)\n\n-Networks: I'd like to create networks between servers and desktop machines so I can have control over who have access to what\n\n-Accounts Dept: What about adding an accounts team to pay bills, chase detbers etc?\n\nThere is a modding ability so I'm sure the furniture issue will get filled quickly by the community though.\n\nOn the whole however this is a great game. I can certainly recommend it to anyone who is working in the IT community and even if you're not apart of the IT Crowd you'll still enjoy the game plus get some insight into how these companies work.\n\nDefinately worth my pcoket money!", "timestamp_created": 1462705221, "timestamp_updated": 1462705221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511515", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22849424": {"recommendationid": "22849424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140417928", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508663735}, "language": "english", "review": "Very Good game. if your on the fence about getting it dont be its a great game with lots to do it looks hard to pay but wuth the hints and tips to help you with the game its easy to get used to", "timestamp_created": 1462647044, "timestamp_updated": 1462647044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22843255": {"recommendationid": "22843255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013792053", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507662324}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game, but!\n\nI don't really understand the concept of the game.

I'll probably go in spurts of 10 or so hours though while it goes through updates. the tycoon gameplay is awesome. build animation tools and mobile connection stuff. youll be a billionaire pretty instantly. i only had 10 or so million dollars and in a couple days after building my first 3d animation tool i had 200 mil. 5 hours later and i have 4 bil. \n\npros - \n-really really fun gameplay. the management style of the game is great. you really need to pay attention to what your employees are good at and assign them to the right team/room\n-its fun to mod and have a very high number of possible creations\n-i really enjoy giving the teams some autonomy to create their own products\n-for all of the management and software aspects, the developer still made the building very deep and intricate. much appreciated. \n\ncons - \n-I may be doing this wrong, but i believe that you can assign multiple chairs to one employee. this gets annoying if you want to switch what room they work in and they have multiple chairs assigned to them. it gets really annoying when you have 75 employees. \n-I appreciate the minigames to help speed up the software process. i think the developer knows it is slow going early on for the player. but lets just say its pretty slow in the beginning. not that that is a bad thing, but im hoping for more softwares that are easy to make that might not be as easy to market to help the player build up that bank account in the beginning rather than having to type words in your design stage. \n\nin all, extremely solid game. i love it. i am looking forward to more updates and the final release. \n\ncurrent rating: 9.5/10 (any game this good in early access is worth buying, so buy it!)", "timestamp_created": 1462492461, "timestamp_updated": 1462492461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503246", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22803693": {"recommendationid": "22803693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030607210", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513130008}, "language": "english", "review": "Capitalism's wet dream.", "timestamp_created": 1462411813, "timestamp_updated": 1462411813, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22803599": {"recommendationid": "22803599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275959320", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504710860}, "language": "english", "review": "Great early access game", "timestamp_created": 1462411185, "timestamp_updated": 1462411185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495846", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22803419": {"recommendationid": "22803419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254525465", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510467569}, "language": "english", "review": "The First few hours of this games was know what to do and how to do it was a bit harsh for casual users but as time passes and my knowledge of this game increases, the game gets more addicting as time passes.

Support this game if you loved Game Dev Tycoon but thought it was too simplistic and limited.\n\nMechanically, this is what I hoped and wished Game Dev Tycoon to be, after 4 hours of playing it.

Mechanically, it's still not finished, but already very good.\n\nContent-wise, even at this stage, it would need more to really make the mechanics work. More than Game Dev Tycoon, while at this point it still has much less. And what content is there is weakly signalled, or not at all (when do researches become available? where do certain software technologies? why can't I influence that by research? making it more a standard research tree and using the times only at least as a partial lock would benefit the game greatly, I think, the player needs at least the theoretical power to leave competition technologically in dust).\n\nAnd for the research to work at all, there needs to be more of the content, more of technologies, I was playing until 2020 because I saw the holocomputer in the build menu and I expected a related technology to appear/unlock at which point I was prepared to throw my whole 60people, 30bilion$ company to creating a holographic networked OS... But no technology came...\n\nI have many suggestions that are better placed in forums, I guess. Also, the interface is a bit... obnoxious when you try to manage larger number of people in larger number of teams.\n\nBut overall, a great start and it seems dev knows where he's headed, and he's headed to a good place.

GREAT Feedback to supporters\n\nCons:\n- Product diversity could improve (planned in future releases already)\n- Hiring is slightly flawed (should have limited employees available each month, not unlimited at a price of virtual dollars)\n- Graphics can use some upgrades, but it definitely has a unique feel as it currently sits\n- Animations can use work, but this game is about gameplay and content above all else, and in that area, it excels.\n\nOverall:\n- This is the most UNDERRATED Early Access game on Steam. Excellent business simulation, interesting concepts, great design, simple to use, and challenging to really master. Needs some more work, but is regularly updated by development team (one person!!). Excellent response to supporters, and the Dev takes ideas from fans/gamers and runs with them.\n\n9/10 - Recommendation:  BUY NOW!", "timestamp_created": 1460053002, "timestamp_updated": 1460053615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22278018": {"recommendationid": "22278018", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194407466", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 5464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507603601}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub098\ub9cc\uc758 \ud68c\uc0ac\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud574\uc11c \uc18c\ud504\ud2b8\uc6e8\uc5b4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e4\uace0 \uc2f6\ub2e4\uace0\uc694?\n\uadf8\ub7fc \uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc815\ub9d0 \ucd5c\uc120\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4!\n\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1459991916, "timestamp_updated": 1511398288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22276174": {"recommendationid": "22276174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208626267", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488095733}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game,gets better & more fun all the time with lots of updates.", "timestamp_created": 1459980928, "timestamp_updated": 1459980928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22252786": {"recommendationid": "22252786", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989689695", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463026552}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is all i can wish for as far as simluation and management goes.

It's not exactly \"The Sims\", but it gets the job done, once you've memorized the categorization of items. The building part is solid. It all happens on grids, but then again you are building an office and not a theme park. It doesn't throw standard rooms at you. The game gives you the freedom to build and think about your layout and build a muli storied building to be proud of, because those things aren't cheap to build.\n\nSpeaking of money, the economy in this game is maybe not the best presented, but DEFINITELY the most detailed of all current indie games about management. It's all there; A field of competitors putting out their games, a stock market of your competitors, including hostile takeovers, aswell as a software market that is ever shifting from one product to the next. Distribution channels matter. Marketing matters. You create your own office and structure it in groups and rooms that help you engineer the software. The other companies will always keep you on your toes!\nIf you don't have the leading Operating System at the beginning of the Game, there will be a decision to be made: Go with your hope on your own OS, but a small portion of the market, or bow to the big guy and just develop tools for his OS. If you make more money than him that way, you might actually be able to buy the next bigger company. Sweet monopoly!\n\nYou can take your company on many paths in the game. You don't have to be a video game company, as in all the other games. You can be the guys that do tech support for other companies and do contract work in separate teams. You can stay a small company and just serve a high priced nich\u00e9 product, like putting out the best 2D or 3D graphics tool. You can be a company that just creates marketing bubbles, etc.\n\nThe path to success isn't an easy one at first. You will have to put some effort into the first hours. The way I learned, was to try over and over again on a limited budget, without endulging the 500k starting option, which is also there. If you do well in the beginning, you can take a 100k loan over 2 years and actually pay it back!\n\nThe game is steadily developing, but not exactly at the speed of light. The technology is solid and it's completely playable with lots of features. The detail in some parts of the game, makes you wish for even more options and challenges. I literally wished, the game ran at a slower pace, but gave me more trouble in the day-to-day management. I barely remember any of the workers names after a game. They are totally just numbers, because they are looking like little plastic figures.\n\nIf I have to fire Karen from accounting (accounting should also be in the game and isn't btw.), it should feel a bit of a downer, because I should be able to see the sad little face afterwards and I'm not, which ironically gives me a sad face, which you can't see either.\n\nTL;DR\n\nSolid stuff; Walls of Numbers; Detailed Market; Learning Curve\nbuy it, play it, love it.

Honestly one of the most underrated titles on the Store in my opinion. The Workshop is a little bleak at the minute but with the addition of blueprints it's starting to really flesh itself out now. The developer has provided ample information on his website for those wanting to write small XML files to give themselves \u00a35b and start in 1971.\n\nBottom line: Frequent and substantial updates. A small but growing community via his DevBlog, Twitter, Reddit and the Workshop.

I missed the release last year and accidentally found the game while searching for games under the management tag, and what a nice surprise it was! This is hands down the best software development game I've played, and there are quite a few in the market now (Game Dev Tycoon, GamersGoMakers, Mad Games Tycoon etc.)\n\nWhat sets it apart for me is the soft simple graphics and the smooth interface. It is very easy to learn the controls and build big impressive looking office complexes. It also allows you to customize the pace, difficulty and starting locations for varied experiences. In the simulation/management genre, this game is right up there with the best of them.\n\nYou start with youself as the founder of the company building a simple little office and starting to work on a few small contracts. From there you start developing your own software: Antivirus, games, operating systems, audio and visual design software, and more. As you grow, you can expand your office and workforce. It's entirely up to you how much you'd like to micromanage. You can assign team leaders and send them on HR and project management courses allowing them to hire and manage teams and their own projects completely independently. The game scales incredibly well as you expand your company.\n\nSome might find the spreadsheets a little overwhelming. I actually like it because it makes my little virtual company feel real. This game was really well thought out and you have all the data you might need at your disposal.\n\nNegatives? Not much. It is early access so there are some glitches, and the game could do with more content. Most notably furniture is currently a bit limited, but that said all the necessary stuff is already there for you to have heaps of fun. There's also some minor balancing issues that will be sorted out later but again nothing gamebreaking and nothing that will ruin your fun.

Even now in alpha, there's hours of enjoyment to be had. Admittedly, It doesn't take very long to build up your company to endgame level (having so much money you could never possibly spend it, and quite literally dominating the market)\n\nBut it is an early access game, and there's incredibly frequent updates. \n\n[b]The best bits about the game so far (in my opinion) are;[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Incredibly detailed building mode allows you to construct your very own office for your company, including a basement level and up to ten stories.\n[*]Interesting market simulation generates competitor companies and products.\n[*]In depth HR management allows you to take control of each of your employees, their salaries, roles, and which team they work in - you can even dictate where they sit and which toilet they use.\n[*]Adjustable timescale is incredibly handy, if you want a quick game you can set it up so that there's only one ingame day per month of the simulation (your employees will come in for a days work and the next day will be a new month) and vice versa. \n[/list]\n\n[b]There are, ofcourse things that need some work, and obviously it's a very early alpha so these aren't criticisms -  just things that, in my opinion, aren't all that they could be;[/b]\n\n[list]\n[*]Performance, I don't know if this is something the Dev can fix or if it's more to do with the engine - but it should be noted that [i]this game doesn't really run all that well[/i]. I'm playing with a GTX 980 and an i7 CPU and my system is barely keeping up - the game drops frames especially hard when buildings go over a certain size / too many employees are on the screen.\n[*]The game is far too easy once you get used to playing. Unlike Game Dev Tycoon which seemed to randomize how well your products would perform - if you make software in Software Inc, it's pretty much guaranteed to sell well unless you make blatantly awful software.\n[*]Not enough furniture (not nescessarily important, I just obsess over customizing my office.)\n[*]As mentioned earlier, it's easy to make billions in an hour or two and then never have to worry about cash again (aslong as you keep pumping out software) - ideally I'd like to see more ways in which I can spend my money - kind of ties into my above comment but still, it takes some of the fun out of it once you get to Microsoft level of market dominance. \n[/list]\n\nOverall, I'm having fun with Software Inc, and I look forward to each new update. I appreciate that the developer is active and I am convinced that if he continues to put as much effort in as he has been, this is going to be quite a great game once there's more added to it. \n\nI'd recommend if you're willing to go into the game in it's current state, it is Early Access after all.", "timestamp_created": 1458022264, "timestamp_updated": 1458022617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21847465": {"recommendationid": "21847465", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010902122", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512021106}, "language": "english", "review": "In this game, you can choose wether you want to be EA or Rockstar. \n\n100/10 would play forever", "timestamp_created": 1458021726, "timestamp_updated": 1458021726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21844731": {"recommendationid": "21844731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119186743", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2757, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508475884}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Overview[/b]\nThe depth to this game, even as an Alpha game, is quite impressive.

I also run into the problem often where my employees will just sit around, or complain about not having good or a place to pee when there is a kitchen and a bathroom. I'm going to go ahead and give it a thumbs up because it's a good game, and the developer works really hard on it and does frequent updates. However, be aware that, while this use to be a good casual management game, now it has a ton of micromanagement, and it's easy to start bleeding money and go into debt if you try to move past a one person dev team too fast x]. (But I guess it's really good training for learning how to think of business in real life).", "timestamp_created": 1456816471, "timestamp_updated": 1504990043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21538740": {"recommendationid": "21538740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198227756136", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468112464}, "language": "english", "review": "Great realistic game.

I plan to play it for a couple hours, then 14 hours later realize I'm late for work. It's like a rough diamond however, in that it still feels a touch bland and is rough around the edges, but I've been loving it. I'm going to review this game in an as-is state, rather than reviewing it based on what it can be.\n\nPros:\n-Very enjoyable game development sim (I find it more enjoyable than Game Dev Story or Game Dev Tycoon.)\n\n-Building system works amazing. It isn't quite like the Sims or something where you have hundreds of objects to place, but the developer has stated that furniture modding is coming as is more furniture overall.\n\n-Dev listens to feedback and is very active in the community.\n\n-Very large updates, all clear improvements upon the last. Larger than some of the big studios, and nowhere near as buggy as some other EA titles do their updates.\n\n-Modding support (Can mod new software, features, companies, people, etc,) that the dev has plans of making stronger (Looking forward to furniture modding.)\n\nMeh:\n-Updates are slow. The game is made by one man, and the updates are large and stable, so I wouldn't say this is too bad of a thing.\n\n-Performance can start to die rapidly if you go overboard growing your company. I can handle up to about 350 staff members without lag, but once I go over a certain threshold I drop to 5FPS in a heartbeat. Keep in mind that there is basically never going to be any need whatsoever for that much staff in the games current state, so this is hard to blame the dev for.\n\n-The graphics. I don't hate them, but I also don't love them. Doesn't detract from the gameplay too much however, and I can still make buildings that look nice.\n\nCons:\n-Very little endgame content. There's a point once you've automated teams to design all the software types and effectively own the entire market. The dev has intentions of working on this however, and so far I've been fine just starting a new save whenever the game gets stale. I did feel like this is something worth mentioning though, as some people hate starting new saves in games.\n\n-Not enough furniture variety, though this is another thing the dev is working on.\n\n-The difficulty curve is a little wonky. I found the game extremely difficult for my first 15 hours or so, but after that point I just sort of figured out exactly how the game works and game became extremely easy in a manner of a few hours. The dev has plans for working on this too.\n\n-I've had the occasional crash, but only WELL into long gaming sessions where most programs and games tend to crash anyways. Hard to fault the developer for this one as well.\n\n-Other than parking lots and roads, you can't do anything with the outdoors other than place more buildings.

Completely blown away that there were no Open Source license options when starting out, especially since the whole point is to \"start lean\" and grow into a larger company.\n\nThe controls are a bit weird. You use WASD to move around the map and UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT to operate the camera. Personally my natural reaction is to click on the ground and drag around until the camera view is perfect. The developer should change it to this way because WASD+arrows+MOUSE is too much functionality to handle when you are also dealing with a very complex UI.\n\nIf I gave it more of a chance I would probably like it more.

Probably not, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't do that.\n\nSoftware Inc. is a game in which you can start with next-to-no money and work your butt off to make the biggest and best pieces of software on the market - including Operating Systems, Game Engines, Games, and more. You start out with a solo developer (who you can customise and name, likely after yourself) and who's stats you can adjust to make them better at things like programming, design, art, marketing, etc...\n\nOnce you've built your first office using a system that's simultaneously more simple and more complex than building in The Sims, you're good to get working. Fast forward a few successful releases and you're likely going to be looking at hiring and managing different teams of staff, each of which you can have specialised in one aspect of software development. Personally, I enjoy splitting one team in to three teams, each part specialising in the three aspects of software production - Design, Programming, and Art.\n\nAs your bank balance grows, your company grows, the land you own grows, and your buildings will grow. You can start with a room, and eventually own and fill the space equivalent to several city blocks, all because of your successful software company - and this really is just scratching the surface of the game. You also manage company insurance, you can buy and sell stocks, you can sabotage other (computer controlled) companies, buy out companies, buy and sell intellectual property, and much more.\n\nAnd this is all just in Alpha 7.\n\nIf that doesn't convince you, [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRT48VU3K4p2Gj6jHVS1nWLpn6hfAxbBe]these 67 videos[/url] might.", "timestamp_created": 1454539697, "timestamp_updated": 1454539697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20936175": {"recommendationid": "20936175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060260275", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494103890}, "language": "english", "review": "I would honestly have happily paid double what I did for this game.\n\nFor one man to create this is awesome.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1454523662, "timestamp_updated": 1454523662, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20934486": {"recommendationid": "20934486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099016550", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454436052}, "language": "english", "review": "no", "timestamp_created": 1454517717, "timestamp_updated": 1454517717, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.220798", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20916948": {"recommendationid": "20916948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116124263", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 3117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506704725}, "language": "english", "review": "All your money are belong to us.", "timestamp_created": 1454439720, "timestamp_updated": 1499302611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20879664": {"recommendationid": "20879664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138302039", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 21357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503433663}, "language": "english", "review": "The last update fucked up my life", "timestamp_created": 1454268801, "timestamp_updated": 1459969465, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.388128", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20879208": {"recommendationid": "20879208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000731916", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488048616}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun business-management game about creating and selling software.\n\nI highly recommend this game and have a lot of respect for the dev who remains active in the forums as he continues working on the game.", "timestamp_created": 1454267445, "timestamp_updated": 1454267445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "20874220": {"recommendationid": "20874220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159825318", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 683, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478916185}, "language": "english", "review": "The developer of this game has some great ideas (existing & planned) for this IP.

What makes this game so much different than other early release games is that the developer is still constantly working on it and is providing updates almost every week.

This is a game that is constantly being tweaked and changed for the better, the developer is entirely transparent about those changes and welcomes the community feedback about what could make the game better. This is a chance for players to watch a game actually grow and evolve, as well as a chance to support a small developer whose actions have very clearly shown that they take pride in their work and have made a commitment to this game and its players.

It has taken me this long to get my head around the core gameplay as there is a bit of a learning curve but nothing that should prevent you from playing at its full potential.\nThe gameplay and mechanics have a great amount of depth and work well together and the game is super stable. The ability to build a software company from the ground up is the key nature of this game. You'll build your first office to get started and before long you are running multi stories and building server farms, then there's the employees that are another key aspect. there's not a great deal of objects in yet but what is there is functional and customizable to your chosen color palette(s). Building is pleasurable and the ability to build what you want is huge which brings me to the map size, I would say you will have a hard time filling it especially considering you can go up 10 levels and down 1, the map is massive which gives you free reign to do as you please. I'm hoping to see updated graphics and new objects and styles for customization in future builds.\nNow to the core gameplay which is developing software, marketing it and supporting it. There are a number of options for you to choose, maybe an Operating System? (this can take a long time to make) or perhaps a visual program that's linked to a few different OS's? There are different features within your software as well that you can choose to add or not. Put your best design team into action and get that puppy to the development stage, the more time you put in the better the quality, smash the bugs or do half and have your support division take on squashing them as they come up after you've released. Now market the hell out of it until it's not worth it anymore and watch the dollars roll in. Maybe take on some contracts early game to get some funds to kick off that killer program that will launch you into the business world. Once you get your head around multiple teams you could plop down a reception and get paid to develop, design, support or market other companies software. Don't forget to get that server room up and running to help support your online distribution store or for compiling your new code and tackling bugs easier. Maybe you could develop an online OS that requires a server that's running 24/7? \nThe options in this game are amazing and I haven't seen depth like this in a tycoon game for a number of years, if your on the fence then check out some game play videos on Youtube and check it out. I would say just go ahead and grab it, the price is actually much less than this game is worth for sure. \nOh did I metion the mods that are available and easy to install? Well they add new software development options such as Mobile OS, Web Browsers, Forums, VOIP servers. The list is long and once you get your head around the game I would recommend starting a new game on hard with mods and see how you go. \n\nThis game is still in development and can only become exceptional, the tycoon aspects of building a software business are massive with great management aspects all so. \n\n[B][H1]Rating 8/10 (leaving room for the extra stuff that is still being added)[/H1][/B]", "timestamp_created": 1450620174, "timestamp_updated": 1450620871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594103", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19800246": {"recommendationid": "19800246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040103849", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498146383}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra z wielkim potencja\u0142em, Nareszcie nie zajmujesz si\u0119 tylko tworzeniem gier lecz ca\u0142\u0105 firm\u0105,naprawami,moralami i wieloma innymi rzeczami.Nie brakuje r\u00f3wnie\u017c aktualizacij.\nKt\u00f3re najcz\u0119\u015bciej naprawiaj\u0105 bugi i niestabilno\u015bci w grze.\nJak najbardziej polecam.", "timestamp_created": 1450606299, "timestamp_updated": 1450606352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19796898": {"recommendationid": "19796898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059380525", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512318441}, "language": "english", "review": "Software inc. is the best simulation game out on steam at the moment. i hope to see more updates and progress the game further and add new items and features. i dont under stand the insurance part of the game, but otherwise great game support", "timestamp_created": 1450588370, "timestamp_updated": 1450588370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19796325": {"recommendationid": "19796325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191016373", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499615746}, "language": "english", "review": "Very addictive!!", "timestamp_created": 1450585114, "timestamp_updated": 1450585114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500735", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19768210": {"recommendationid": "19768210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183420238", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461766562}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased this after watching Skye Storme (check him on YouTube) playing it.

I think the game just needs more polish since many of the interfaces are extremely clunky. I despise those silly radial menues that are so hard to control. They remind me too much of Castle Story.\n\nI also think there is serious feature creep. If I was making this game in the game, it would be a medium scope game with recommended 5 developers being written by a single dev. Stuff like distribution and project/hr management are really good ideas but the amount of code required to make them functional/useful/interesting would far exceed the scope of this game.\n\nHere's some more of my opinions/advice for the developer\n\n-I don't think a UML minigame is medium priority, more low priority.\n-Need way better server management system, I mean come on you can't be seriously asking me to manually place 200 servers\n-Need better furniture management system, I mean come on you can't be seriously asking me to manually move 200 servers\n-IT requirements are too low. I have a ton of servers all managed by one IT guy who works only 4 hours a day.\n-AI companies are really weak, by year 4 I was worth double any other company in the game\n-There's an opportunity to develop a really cool financial system - play Railroad Tycoon II to get a feel of what I'm talking about. The current system is a bit lacking.\n-I don't think loans scale up. The max I could ever borrow is 100K.\n-Salary management is a massive hassle. I find myself just hitting accept & close every time because manually going through 50 employees is not worth the 5K/month.\n\nThere's a lot of other stuff but the main point is that the game is already pretty fun, don't ruin it with features you can't implement right that will crash/bug out the game.\n\nCongrats on going full time, I envy you.", "timestamp_created": 1448913979, "timestamp_updated": 1448913979, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651095", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "19389520": {"recommendationid": "19389520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044133533", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459094071}, "language": "french", "review": "La version courte:\nDu potentiel, oui, mais un long chemin\navant la fin du d\u00e9veloppement.\nC'est agr\u00e9able, simple dans les graphismes et\net pourtant bien complexe en gestion, pas mal\nde d\u00e9tails, de choix, etc.\n\n\nVersion longue:\nD'apr\u00e8s ce que j'ai compris, ce jeu est le fruit\nd'un seul d\u00e9veloppeur, qui a laisser son job\nfin novembre pour ce consacrer \u00e0 ce jeu, son r\u00eave.\nC'est magnifique de vivre en r\u00e9alisant ses r\u00eaves,\nc'est aussi pour cela que j'ai acheter le jeu, \nd'ordinaire j'attend les soldes, et encore + si c'est en EA,\nmais l\u00e0 j'ai financer un jeu+la personne qui le d\u00e9veloppe.\n\nDonc du potentiel, de la motivation et plusieurs modes\nd\u00e9j\u00e0 disponibles comme les multiples traduction dont le\nfran\u00e7ais (sinon je ne l'aurais pas pris).\n\nLa grande question, acheter:  oui ou non? \nSi vous voulez soutenir le d\u00e9v, voir le jeu s'am\u00e9liorer,\nproposer des am\u00e9liorations bref le but de l'EA alors oui.\n\nMais c'est en EA justement, donc \u00e0 risque par d\u00e9finition, \nun produit non fini, et actuellement il n'y a pas beaucoup\nde contenu et des bugs, donc voila pour le non.\n\nEn conclusion, si vous le prenez, c'est surtout dans l'imm\u00e9diat\npour soutenir le d\u00e9v et donc financer le d\u00e9veloppement.\nLe jeu en lui m\u00eame c'est pas extraordinaire, c'est m\u00eame plut\u00f4t ordinaire. \nA mettre en liste de souhait et \u00e0 surveiller mais franchement \nje dirais pas avant 2017 pour avoir des changements significatifs.\nDonc c'est jouable, mais on en est encore qu'au d\u00e9but.\n\n*Astuce: pour garder l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du jeu, il vaut mieux faire \ndes petites sessions de jeu avec un ou quelques objectifs\ngenre embaucher, construire, etc. Sinon c'est r\u00e9p\u00e9titif.\n\nPour la traduction en francais: \nEn mod sur le forum ou en lien direct:\nhttp://softwareinc.coredumping.com/forum/index.php?topic=287.0\n\n\nEdit mars 2016: \n\nCa avance, des ajouts dans tous les domaines que ce soit meuble, \nenvironnement, logiciel, donc c'est positif.\nEn comparaison, je trouve MadGame Tycoon plus simple et fonctionnel,\nmais forc\u00e9ment le travail est pr\u00e9-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 en amont, alors qu'ici on doit\nv\u00e9ritablement construire son entreprise, les murs, fen\u00eatres, TOUT!\nUn exemple, dans MG, on pose un bureau, et voila!

It's fun being creative and trying different ways of getting your company off the ground.\n- After having a scroll through the news, it seems this game is updated pretty regularly and just gets better and better.\n\nWhat I'd like to see:\n- MUSIC! I appreciate all the little sounds (the typing of the keyboard, the birds chirping, etc), but it gets really dry without any music. I suggest something relaxing, something along the lines of the infamous Minecraft soundtrack. \n- The user interface is good for the most part, but there are still some small problems that are fine at first but get very frustrating with repetition. Many of these problems occur because of a lack of information when you need it and the player needs to backtrack through menus to find it. Players get really specific in the discussion board when they address these problems, let's get them fixed!\n- I find that the interest on insurace is a bit too high later in the game... I got to a point where I'm making millions, yet my reputation is low, my workers are unhappy, and my products are not the best...

I would recommend 1GB of video memory for best FPS. With my iMac, I can hardly get 30FPS with high graphics, but it's still very playable.

There is mod support too.\nGameplay can be found on Youtube but some of the videos are of some pretty early versions of the game.\nWhat's in the game so far: pathfinding is really good but there is some improvement that is being made, ability to hire, train   (through education or leadership skills) and fire (but there is a penalty for this) workers, bonus items for your workers including managers( called lead in this game), better chairs, room decoration, food and coffee, toilets, windows, lights, heating and air conditioning, servers for control management as well as for web store and online game servers,  software contracts and other jobs(deals) through a receptionist feature, multi-story building (up to 10 stories) and a basement. Recent addition is polygon rooms. There is also an automation feature too!\nYou get to control the quality of the software you produce at the expense of more time developing and programming. There is also reputation in the game which can influence how your customers perceive you. There is a stock market.\nWhen creating software you can choose to sell to the market, give it away (open source) or use it in-house (this may change shortly so you can use in-house then sell in the marketplace).\n\nWeaknesses: As stated above, graphics and audio leave a lot to be desired but in my opinion are fine as they are.

Salvo enganho publiquei 53 softwares no total.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 RIDICULAMENTE F\u00c1CIL.\n\n\n\n- Analise anterior:\n\nO jogo, inicialmente, parece ser complexo e dar ao jogador grande possibilidade de varia\u00e7\u00e3o, isso \u00e9, parece que realmente ter\u00e1 que fazer muita coisa para come\u00e7ar a ganhar algum dinheiro e passa a sensa\u00e7\u00e3o que ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil falir.\n\nEntretanto, o jogo \u00e9 extremamente f\u00e1cil.\nO jogo segue o ritmo \"Publicidade \u00e9 a alma do negocio\". \n\nN\u00e3o sei se \u00e9 porque estou altamente acostumado com jogos \"Tycoon\", basicamente j\u00e1 joguei todos os mais populares (e milhares de desconhecidos tamb\u00e9m, inclusive at\u00e9 hoje jogo \"Transport Tycoon\" em meu celular, para ter ideia).\n\nO jogo entrega a possiblidade de ver lan\u00e7amentos da concorrencia, estranho \u00e9 que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa escolher ou anunciar o lan\u00e7amento para os seus proprios softwares. Sabendo disso \u00e9 f\u00e1cil. Lance o que os outros v\u00e3o lan\u00e7ar, mas, antes deles.\n\nFiz o primeiro anti-virus, ganhei mais de 15 milh\u00f5es. Com isso, fiquei mais de 5 anos fazendo um OS, ok. Publiquei o sistema operacional antes de todos (e com reputa\u00e7\u00e3o \"Great\") fiquei com 130 milh\u00f5es. Isso sem ter o n\u00famero de funcion\u00e1rios minimos e sem ter treinado nenhum deles. \n\nUma coisa que achei MUITO RUIM \u00e9 que os funcion\u00e1rios tiram ferias por conta propria! Achava que o jogo poderia permitir que elaborasse seu proprio contrato de emprego, assim, removendo (ou adicionando) f\u00e9rias ou b\u00f4nus do s\u00e1lario, por exemplo. Uma coisa mais complexa seria escolher onde montar a empresa, baseada em \"leis trabalhistas\" (se houver) de cada pa\u00eds. ;)\n\nMas, isso n\u00e3o ocorre.\n\nA ideia do jogo \u00e9 boa, mas, somente a ideia. \n\nMuita (muitaaaaaaa) coisa deveria ser balanceado.\nN\u00e3o h\u00e1 como abrir 'loja fisica', isso \u00e9, seus concorrentes podem possuir lojas (na parada de \"Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o\") e voc\u00ea apenas poder\u00e1 ter distribui\u00e7\u00e3o digital, usando seus servidores.\n\nDai h\u00e1 outro problema. \nN\u00e3o h\u00e1 como voc\u00ea escolher onde quer distribuir seu software, o que \u00e9 falho. Afinal, voc\u00ea pode montar (e ver concorrentes) que distribuiem, mas n\u00e3o pode escolher onde vai distribuir suas proprias cria\u00e7\u00f5es.\n\nO jogo te obriga a ter servidores locais, isso \u00e9 legal. Afinal, realmente h\u00e1 empresas que tem servidores proprios para seus softwares. Mas... Pequenos desenvoledores (lembre-se voc\u00ea come\u00e7a pequeno!) poderiam ter a possibilitar de alocar servidores de outras empresa, pagando por X por seu uso, como ocorre na vida real. Mas, o jogo n\u00e3o tem isso, voc\u00ea tem que usar v\u00e1rios servidores, em cima de uma mesa (kk) quando come\u00e7a o jogo! ;)\n\nEnfim.\nPor enquanto, n\u00e3o recomendo a compra ou aguarde uma promo\u00e7\u00e3o de 75%.\n\nPara os 'amantes de Tycoon', n\u00e3o espere muita dificuldade, embora ele aparenta ter.\nEsperava uma parada mais dificil. :(\n\nVoltarei a minha procura por mais jogos de administra\u00e7\u00f5es, est\u00e1 dificil achar algum novo. :'(", "timestamp_created": 1442606172, "timestamp_updated": 1462777795, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18087764": {"recommendationid": "18087764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053057264", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2082, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492679300}, "language": "english", "review": "***********A Simulation Games Review************\nI cant believe this game is made by a one man band the depth this game goes in to in unblieveable. \nThis is the only game that i have come across that gives realistic time for developing a product is spot on.

Nicely made trailer, great concept, very cheap price and I have a weakness for theses kinds of simulation games. \n\nBut unfortunately I cannot recommend a game that is far from a playable state. The tutorials are very in depth, but they wouldn't need to be if the controls where simpler. \n\nThe method of assigning employees to a team doesn't work. My method of making an employee do it's job is look at the tutorial 50 times, do EXACTLY what it told be to do and it still wouldn't work. (I think it is a bug, which is another reason why I can't recommend)\n\nAlso most of the time I had no idea exactly what I had to do after accepting a contract or what was actually required to develop software?\n\nAlso lack of any ambient sounds, and main menu music first made me think that the game was broken, but it turned out that it hadn't be added yet.\n\nIts Early Access. I should have expected an unfinished game.\n\nIn its current state, I would avoid it.

For myself i find the fine level of detail that is put into the developing of software appealing. As much as I can tell now the developer seems to be active both in supporting the people through the steam forums or by actually developing the game further.\n\nThe biggest advantages are micromanagement and the opportunity to develop more than games (Operating Systems or Antivirus Software Kits are just an example). Also the graphics might seem very simplistic - which they are - but for me it gives the game its own charm.\n\nNow for the critics. The difficulty jump between the settings from easy to hard is extremly high so you need to be actually quite into the game to survive there. Also the tutorial may explain everything but it takes quite a while to get through all of it. One should also notice that save games which break sometimes when a big patch arrives need to be planned it.\n\nFor all those who are not familiar with buying Early Access stuff: DO NOT BUY STUFF UNLESS YOU ARE SURE WHAT YOU BUY. The games are still developed so give the game a bit more freedom in the negative side. For me it helps to get along with a game principle. Even if you think you wasted money after the buy you can still use that to have some actual fun with the game.\n\nOkey last but not least the conclusion guys.\nI love this game from heart, simply because it allows people to actually be the guy developing the game - a big plus if you usually are the consumer in my opinion. I apologize for any grammar or spelling mistakes ( I always appreciate constructive criticism. )\n\nAnyways:\nBuy it if you love tycoon games with micromanagement that also involves the not so popular topic of game developing and not playing.\nLeave it if you get annoyed fast by having to restart quite a few times and being crazily focused about the graphics.

You have a overiew your employees, what they need to do, their skills, their negative skills, effectiveness, and can see if anyone is idle, at work, sick or at home.\n\nIn the game you will have a overview as a leader to make your  employees do assigned jobs, which you agreed to with other companies. There will be a payment, marketing, successrate, and overall overview of groups people are assigned into. You can assign groups for different people, with different skills for different rooms. - Also, you can hire cleanup crew, It-supporter, receptionist etc. If you make a good profit you can make contact to shops for phsycal copies etc. etc.\n\nEverything has it effect on the game. If you make a company without cooling, your servers will be have critical issues, and of course the game will have more content besides this.\n\nOverall designing of the game is really good. I don't like how you must make rooms to the last wall, instead of using the \"sims skill\" for making anything around cornors or that there isn't any music / bagground / in-game music. Without the music, you will feel a bit of emptyness which might let you quit unless you got a touch for the game it self. \n\nThe game it self has surprisingly alot to offer, where i would mark this game for the advanced user who like to have control of every single detail etc. insurance. So if you like advanced games that's \"Sims mixed up with simcity\" look a like, where you can touch any detail, which you do in-real life aswell, then this game is for you. \n\nIf you think something else, well.

But that is where the similiarites end as Software Inc. goes beyond that level and brings new stuff to the table.\n\nOne of those items is new stuff to develop such as operating systems, audio and visual tools, antivirus etc. The game tries to simulate the experiences of Microsoft, Google, Apple and various other software companies. The simulation is done quite well imo with all the various software. The game also brings a Sims style office building which is pretty simple. But the building needs improvement such as having to building rooms into rooms without having to merge them which is a pain.\n\nIn this game you compete with other software companies that are generated in the game. Those companies in my opnion are extremely easy to surpass early in the game when you learn the tricks of developing software. it is almost laughable. Those companies rarely surpass the 3-4 million worth point and after that the game just is boring as the your  worth just soars above others. I think the ai should innovative and agressive as the difficulty increases because even on hard after learning the tricks it is easy to beat them. Maybe in the hardest difficulty add a companie that is massive to the point where it almost monopolizes the software industry. I also wish you could engage in greater diplomatic relations with the companies besides doing these small errands your recive at the reciponist desk. Maybe allow a deal that allows companies to merge into one giant company or allow large companies to form subsidaries of bankrupt companies.\n\nIt would alse be nice to add a historcal feature into the game later on that follows the history of software companies as they progress through the eras. Allow products that were made in software history such as games and OS to give a historical feel to the game similair to Game Dev Tycoon. The software you developed in the game also easy to master. you just wait a few months or years and look you produced a masterful product and your just earning mad money. Thats maybe one of the reasons why i think the softwares your develop are soo lifeless.\n\nOverall, i would probably give this game a 6/10 for where it is right now but this game has MASSIVE POTENTIAL to be amazing with hopefully better company ai and interactions, better build mode, better software development, etc.", "timestamp_created": 1436495885, "timestamp_updated": 1436495885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16966361": {"recommendationid": "16966361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028500429", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 5533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485622851}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect ! cant wait for full version.", "timestamp_created": 1436482160, "timestamp_updated": 1436482160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16954875": {"recommendationid": "16954875", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983748225", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513714941}, "language": "english", "review": "Loads and loads of fun.

Then I grew up and realized how gosh darn hard that really can be. Software Inc totally takes out the middleman and lets you live out your gaming fantasies, in extreme micro management detail and complexity. Rise from a lowly developer all the way to a mega mogul, who has no soul. As you buy out your enemies and release \"Skylight 98\" a new OS that will earn you so much cash you literally won't know what to do with it. Software Inc comes with quite a steep learning curve, from stocks, retail, development, HR, insurance, you will manage every facet of a business in the gaming/technology industry. What makes Software Inc beautiful is it also allows you a great amount of freedom how you go about it. You can construct your own headquarters, choose your employes and design your own CEO. Once you master the systems in place, Software Inc truly shines and suddenly 40 hours of your life are gone. The only negative thing I can think of to say about Software Inc is that the game still needs quite a bit of personality injected into it. There isn't any music and most of time your staring at menus, this isn't really anything major given the nature of tycoon games and the fact this title is still in Early Access/Alpha. So if you're looking for a business management game with a focus on taking over the world of gaming.

Finally a game that could compete with another one of my favorites, Game Dev Tycoon. This game resembles Game Dev Tycoon but takes everything a step further basically.\n\nSo what is Software Inc. about? In this game you start and run your own software company where you will need to manage a budget, your team and make decisions on what to create and how to market it among other things. You can also build your own office and buy more land. Different teams can be assigned to different rooms and work on different projects while another team does something else. You can also hire maintenance crews to come clean, do maintenace or provide IT support for your released products.\n\nIn this game you can create games as we have seen in other similar games but here you can also make operating systems, visual tools, audio tools and game engines which can all be used to make other software. You can also chose to keep your software in-house, release and sell it or open source it and give it away for free.\n\nOh and did I say you can have multiple floors for your office? and you can build parking lots? There is so much you can do in this game that I won\u2019t be able to fit all the good parts in this review.\n\nSo what are the negatives? Well the graphics could be improved but I rather have good gameplay than graphics and I did not feel that it took away from the fun of the game. There were also some small bugs where I couldn\u2019t rotate a set of objects when moving them but these are to be expected in an early access game.\n\nIn future updates I would love to see more items, better stock value (it should be more advanced than just following the cash in the company), and possibly multiplayer if it can be done in a nice way.\n\nI would recommend buying this game, it is already great fun and the developer seems active with regular updates. I hope that this will continue but as you know with any early access game, you never know what the final outcome will be like.", "timestamp_created": 1434932057, "timestamp_updated": 1434932057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16590154": {"recommendationid": "16590154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176530323", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501769959}, "language": "english", "review": "Updates helping alot, Game alot more stable than it was a few updates ago.

It's a real simulation where you can build and control everything. Its scope is huge as well. Not only can you develop your own games, but also other kind of software and operating systems, and reuse them for bigger projects.\n\nYou need to handle your employees' satisfaction, behavior, compatibility with each other, salary expectations and regular raises, skill training, and so on. You build and maintain every piece of your office, and you need to keep it functional, accounting for light, noise, cleanliness and temperature levels. As your office and employee pool grow, you create different teams that can work on multiple projects at the same time. You can even build a multi-story building!\n\nAll the aspects of software development seem to be present and well implemented, despite the early access state of the game: contract work, design / alpha / beta phases, debugging, marketing, distribution channels, support (fixing bugs reported by customers), team leadership, market shares, server management, competitors... Heck, you even hire cleaners and IT support to maintain your office.\n\nDespite its depth, it's easy to learn, thanks to the tutorials that appear automatically each time you try something new. I'm usually not into management games and I don't like micro-management, but here nothing seemed tedious, and so far my game sessions have been very enjoyable. I'm waiting to see how it scales up with many employees and a big office.\n\nSince it's in early access, there's no music (yet) and not many sound effects.

Cheap, dirty bastards.\n- Overall, a lot of improvements/fixes/adjustments to be made (that's why it's an Alpha :D)\n\nIf you're into strategies and want to get behind something new, innovative, and extremely addicting, then you've come to the right place. Although there are still PLENTY of bugs at this stage, the developer seems rather set on game development, even if his abilities are limited.

When I say that I mean imagine a game where your Sims can have a custom job and live in a custom made office with your own staff and everything. So far I was able to sample the game enough to get a fair and accurate review of Software Inc. and I have to say... its different.\n\nI made a boss named the Canadian Devil and the business Pay2Win Inc. I first didn't understand how the staffing worked but I played a few game developer clones and quickly found my way around although I had to restart a couple times. My first mistake was making 2 rooms one with a kitchen and one the main office but found out that you can only have one team per room and so I stuck my advertising team in the kitchen with the bathrooms, the team would call in sick then quit after two months reporting to news that well I was the Canadian Devil not letting them pee and eat. Then I realized every project I started took six to eight months to just get the bare minimum and have the reviews say \"surprise Pay2Win made yet another bad product.\" and only sell 50 units. I finally found out that you can take on jobs for other businesses to earn some quick and more effective cash however sending staff to school seemed like more of sending them to Las Vegas for a week.\n\nOverall the game delivered what it said it was but there's 1 glaring issue that should be addressed minus the 4x timer sometimes makes the time go faster and the workers stay at 2x but the lack of a good tutorial to show players what does what and why. Don't get me wrong I still recommend this game but I recommend it as a fun \"The Sims at work\" type game for now.

The game has grown by leaps and bounds especially considering that there is only one developer. Many new features have been added to the game, the buisness simulation has been fleshed out, AI companies are fleshed out, and generally the game has a better feel. The graphics have also been upgraded which is a nice plus especially considering that its a simulation game. After a year since my original review(below) I continue to support my decision to reccommend this game. Please buy and play this game. My main complaint so far is the lack of guidence as to how to get succesful software out. I realize that most of the fun is figuring out how to make good software and when to release, but the first few hours I played were spent being frustrated that my good, great, and oustanding softwares were going unnoticed. \n\n*Original Review* 5/15/2015\nGreat early access game. Is updated pretty often, has surprising depth considering its being made by one guy, and has a lot of charm and potential.

(This isn't really a con for me, i don't care about graphics or audio for these types of games).\n-Some finicky in game mechanics could use some fleshing out such as how effectiveness & happiness numbers really work. \n-A few graphical glitches but do not have an impact on gameplay.\n\nOne last line,\n\nThis game has so much potential, a fellow Dane appears to be the primary (or only?) developer for this title, and so far he/she is off to a great start.

Graphics are plain, but I don't normally care about graphics in the first place so it doesn't bother me. It is quite funny to see the animation of your employees, it is like they are just hitting their keyboard very hard.\n\nThe game is unique for its type. It is a lot better than Dev Tycoon or other related games by far. There's more to do and you aren't limited on what you can do. Expand, hire employees, manage, make servers, connect servers, make Software for your company and many more features. There's a ton of management in this game too, which is great.\n\nTutorials are buggy and a few systems could use some touching up. It has its bugs, but what Early Access game doesn't?\n\nThe main problem I came across was, is the game is too easy. Given 1 hour of my played time was reading through the tutorials and learning how the game works. However, once you get your skills up (Marketing mainly: which doesn't take long) for your employees, money is too easy to receive. Of course that means you can expand further and try to dominate your competitors. I created an OS with just two employees (recommended was 7 team members) and I received over $950,000 in revenue, after that I still gained over hundreds of thousands every month until it finally stopped. I now have over 2 million dollars.\n\nI'm just pointing out that this game should be more challenging or at least more time consuming to get up to that amount of money.\n\nThe other portion of the game I don't enjoy is you constantly have to keep fast-forwarding (don't have to but normal speed is super slow if you don't). Perhaps if the game values and progress worked at a different speed you wouldn't need to fast-forward so much.\n\nIn due time this game will get better and I can't wait to see the finish product. I'll still play regardless to dominate my competition as the most successful company in the game. I still recommend this game regardless of what I wrote, especially at the price it is at because there is a lot of features in this game, currently.

Comme Prison Arch., c'est vous qui posez les murs de vos locaux. Vous pouvez vous agrandir, fusionner des espaces, etc. A l'int\u00e9rieur, vous n'avez rien \u00e0 zoner, il faut placer les meubles. La m\u00e9t\u00e9o peut impacter vos machines, etc. La gestion de votre activit\u00e9 est unifi\u00e9e. \n\nEmbauchez des profils mais avec la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'avoir des personnalit\u00e9s compatibles. R\u00e9partissez les en \u00e9quipes ad-hoc : un nouveau projet ? C'est l'\u00e9quipe lambda qui s'en charge, on a besoin de liquidit\u00e9s rapides ? On prend un contract en parall\u00e8le et on d\u00e9tache 2 membres de l'\u00e9quipe Lambda dans la nouvelle \u00e9quipe pi qui se focalisera uniquement sur lui. Vos employ\u00e9s doivent manger, excr\u00e9ter, avoir chaud, \u00eatre dans un cadre propre, confortable et fonctionnel. \n\nLes machines peuvent tomber en panne et ont besoin d'un technicien IT. Un tech. de surface nettoye, un concierge se charge de la clim. etc. Si votre bureau est constitu\u00e9 de 4 murs et d'une table, l'employ\u00e9 r\u00e2le, le moral chute et la productivit\u00e9 aussi. On y rem\u00e9die avec des plantes, des machines \u00e0 expresso,etc. Software Inc. offre la possibilit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s s\u00e9duisante de g\u00e9rer des \u00e9tages, c'est au point mais aucun imp\u00e9ratif ne le justifie. \n\nEnfin, vous concevez des jeux/OS/moteur/logiciel design Audio ou video. Si vous faite un jeu, vous aurez besoin de choisir le logiciel vid\u00e9o et l'audio en plus du moteur, la qualit\u00e9 du logiciel et son \u00e9tat technique affectent alors le jeu cr\u00e9\u00e9. Mais le titre ne propose aucun genre/sous genre, ni de recherche (d\u00e9verrouillage dans le temps). Il est le plus maigre en contenu mais c'est aussi lui qui a le plus fort potentiel. [/quote]\n\n[h1]Le probl\u00e8me[/h1]\nCes 3 titres, on jurerait qu'ils proviennent du m\u00eame cahier des charges. Grossi\u00e8rement, on peut m\u00eame dire qu'ils partagent les m\u00eames faiblesses et les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles.\nJe brosse le podium : Mad G. T. s'illustre par sa vari\u00e9t\u00e9\nG. Dev. T. s'illustre par sa concision et sa place de nouvel arrivant\nSoftw. Inc. s'illustre lui par son style et son approche plus large (Logiciel, pas uniquement des jeux/moteurs/plateformes).\n\nCe qui ne me va pas ? C'est simple, ils sont incomplets, en retard et d\u00e9rivent de standards anormalement bas. Tant\u00f4t l'on voit de la 2D qui rappelle les pires moments du Clipart, tant\u00f4t un gameplay aussi fig\u00e9 et peu dynamique les pages web de la fin des ann\u00e9es 90. Un d\u00e9faut court  m\u00eame, sur les 3 titres, le sentiment que chaque Asset (objet, agent) a n\u00e9cessite 10 jours de brainstorming,  3 semaines en processing via une ferme de rendu et encore 2 mois d'\u00e9quilibrage. Dans les faits, il faut dessiner un meuble en 2D ou en 3D et placer des chiffres derri\u00e8re. Enfin, d\u00e9cliner ce pattern suffisamment de fois pour atteindre la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 du monde r\u00e9el.\n\nAucun des jeux ne proposent un mod\u00e8le \u00e9conomique pouss\u00e9 ou une approche vraiment cr\u00e9ative d'un produit. \n\u00ab Alors le jeu que je veux faire,  euuh... je voudrais qu'il soit cool ! Ouai style horreur ! Apr\u00e8s, ben, j'sais pas, en 3D pcq c'est cool aussi. Et finalement, mettons le curseur plus \u00e0 droite pour de l'action dans mon jeu d'horreur et je m'en fiche du sc\u00e9nario. Trop bon lol, j'ai un d\u00e9veloppeur dont la jauge de connaissance en 3D est pleine, \u00e7a va aller plus vite  YOLO ! \u00bb \n\n[h1]Ce qui existe d\u00e9j\u00e0[/h1]\nMais dans quel monde cela peut-il suffire ? \nVous savez ce qu'ont en commun : Simcity, RollerCoaster, Industry Giant, Pizza Connection, ... Ils sont tous construit autour de 2 principes simples : satisfaire une demande, se maintenir en \u00e9quilibre en le faisant... de la gestion donc. Vous savez quel est leur autre point commun ? Ils viennent tous de loin dans le pass\u00e9 du jeu. On ne peut pas cr\u00e9er un titre en ignorant tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait auparavant et en reprenant tout \u00e0 0 (sauf quand on a du g\u00e9nie). Le trio semble nous crier \u00ab Peu importe ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, la flem de m'y int\u00e9resser, allons-y \u00e0 l'aveuglette, je vais tout r\u00e9inventer, on verra bien sur le moment ! \u00bb \nQuel manque d'humilit\u00e9 et quel manque de respect envers le joueur. C'est une m\u00e9thode de travail inqui\u00e9tante, qui va \u00e0 l'encontre du principe capital de la transmission du savoir \u00ab Je me sert de qui existe soit pour faire mieux, soit pour traiter autrement les probl\u00e8mes que l'on y trouve \u00bb. C'est cela, qui permet \u00e0 un genre d'\u00e9voluer, de passer de Wolfenstein 3D \u00e0 Bioshock Infinite. Avec chaque it\u00e9ration, cela se raffine, s'am\u00e9liore. Si chaque humain sur Terre s'attelait \u00e0 recr\u00e9er ses outils et ses id\u00e9es, nous en serions toujours \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge pierre. \n\n[h1]Les rem\u00e8des avanc\u00e9s[/h1]\nA ce stade, je me demande ce que nous avons bien pu faire pour m\u00e9riter une punition aussi s\u00e9v\u00e8re que ce trio. Malheureusement, le constat s'aggrave lorsque l'on s'aper\u00e7oit que de nombreux ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes r\u00e9cents n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mod\u00e9lis\u00e9s. Il y a les plus subtils : la guerre des prix des revendeurs de cl\u00e9s, qui se positionnent comme un interm\u00e9diaire entre la distrib. num\u00e9rique et le d\u00e9v. Les bundles et p\u00e9riodes de promo d\u00e9brid\u00e9es. La guerre entre 2 franchises, le marketing mondialis\u00e9 aspirant 80% d'un budget. Un jeu devenant si populaire que tout le studio met la cr\u00e9ation en pause pour g\u00e9rer la communaut\u00e9 et proposer du contenu, la transformation progressive des Alpha/Beta en d\u00e9mo et op\u00e9ration de com. Les outils de d\u00e9veloppement int\u00e9gr\u00e9s qui vont au del\u00e0 d'un simple moteur de jeux. Twitch et le streaming et il en reste...\n[h1]Les rem\u00e8des basiques[/h1]\nOn pourrait comprendre que cela soit trop lourd/complexe \u00e0 mod\u00e9liser/impl\u00e9menter. \nMais il reste 3 camions de points plus simples : DLC/Extensions/Stand-alone (pas juste des \"suites\"). Le financement participatif et ses plateformes. Le titre qui s'oriente sur la comp\u00e9tition et l'e-sport. D\u00e9finition d'une politique sur le modding. Les circuits conf\u00e9rences ind\u00e9pendantes et les collaborations. Le merchandising. Les micro-transaction/cash-shop. La gestion de succursale/sous-traitance/rachat. Les portages, les r\u00e9\u00e9ditions HD, le free2play, le ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne des Early Access, les Youtubers. (rappelons que dans GDT, le piratage \u00e9tait un Easter Egg)\n\nPar contre, vous avez le bonheur de g\u00e9rer les WC et leur saturation... C'est comme si SimCity offrait un b\u00e2timent \u00ab banque du sperme \u00bb et qu'en cas de p\u00e9nurie, les services municipaux cessaient de fonctionner. On croit r\u00eaver.\n\nSi les m\u00e9canismes naturels de la concurrence \u00e9taient fonctionnels, ce sont des titres qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 ignor\u00e9s. Soyez prudent d\u00e9veloppeurs, le d\u00e9lai avant d'\u00eatre rattrap\u00e9 par les normes de 2015 se r\u00e9duit.

I can't wait to see what the finished product is like.  \n\nPros:\nManaging teams is just complex enough to be fun without being overwhelming.\nBeing able to grow the building size, rather than moving as in other games allows for more \"organic\" growth of the business, you can look back and kind of trace your steps, which is pretty neat.\nManaging the hours the staff and cleaning crews work is pretty fun, making sure no time is wasted.\n\nCons:\n- At times employees get stuck, and it can be hard to locate them.\n- Employees can at times have too much difficulty finding restrooms (and other things effecting happiness.)  I found my buildings requiring far more restrooms than would make sense in the real world.\n- The room building leaves something to be desired, new rooms have to be made outside the existing walls, or must be made all the way across a room (rather than making a room from a square quarter of an existing room, you have to make a wall from the north wall all the way to the south wall, instead of north wall to middle of the west wall)  \n- Not yet much customization with office items, I suspect that is coming though, this is being written just 9 days after the EA release.\n\nDespite the cons, I promise you, this is an amazing game already.

In fact I think this game is quite good for the right audiance.\n\nIn fact part of me likes the game and its charm. Yet I always feel that games need negative reviews in order to give people a more balanced idea of what it is being offered here.\n\nBasically the best way I could describe the game is: What if you could build a software development factory using automotons that were fueled by coffee? and that has its appeal, it is up to you to make the best possible layout to give you the best possible results in *beep* Insert product #246 here *beep* and building your entire floorplan to make sure that your robots bump into other robots less often.\n\nNow because your workers are robots of course your products are also made robotically. *Beep* Making Videogame #34, inserting GUI, Inserting 3d models... *Beep* basically all software is made out of lego blocks so to speak you just attach different features onto a product and the game tells you how good it \"potentially\" is and even how \"innovative\" it is (because robot). You then craft the product by working on it until it is of sufficient quality. They will even hammer it out on a keyboard as if they really were robots (and I am not convinced they arn't)\n\nTHIS is what I think the game excels at. If this makes you want to get the game do so now!\n\nBut in terms of being a software tycoon it will not satisfy. The products feel like they don't even exist within the game universe and the game has an odd way of spoonfeeding you information that you should infer yourself (How innovative a product is) as well as not telling you upfront what information you would want to know (Who is buying your product). Thus after spending a long time on what might me your magnus opus your overall attitude towards it will probably be \"Ok, I guess it was made\".\n\nAs well because the people are all robots and software is made of legos the whole \"I am doing something creative and intellectual\" aspect is kind of lost. When a game is just a list of features with \"stats\" on how \"good\" and \"Innovative\" it makes it, it stops feeling like a game.\n\nDon't get the game for the wrong reasons, I hope this helped you get a bit more of an educated idea.", "timestamp_created": 1431274723, "timestamp_updated": 1431274723, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457804", "comment_count": "31", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15774499": {"recommendationid": "15774499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069032223", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495743589}, "language": "french", "review": "Bien que en acces anticip\u00e9 ce jeu montre de tr\u00e8s bonne chose.

Don't talk much on forums, don't review and I have never really tried to actively provide input and suggestions to the developers when it comes to early access games. This game changed all of that for me.\n\nFirst thought on your mind is most likely; \"But it is another Early Access game and too many past ones have burned to the ground\". You're right, by this point so many people have been ripped off over silly development stalls and a lack of promised content. You have a right to be and if that is a position that you can't be budged from read my review and just wait, keep an eye on the game's development, watch videos, and ask players the questions you want to know about it. The developer, username: Coredumping on steam, is extremely active and responsive on the forum which is where I will start my review I suppose.\n\nI haven't ultimately owned the game long but in about two and a half weeks (maybe less) I have put in over 50 hours XD this game is so addicting. With that said I have already talked with the developer on the forums on multiple occasions addressing bugs I had stumbled into and some small imediate suggestions I had. All of these conversations were wonderful, I felt \"heard\" (would it be feeling read in text forums? o.O) and I also felt like he seriously cared about what I had to say. He is very open with his project, almost all his current goals and development directions are listed on trello (https://trello.com/b/9I286Mhu/software-inc). This kind of transparency is nice as a player and supporter of his game and another reason for you to support it if this game interests you enough.\n\nNow the game.\nLike I said earlier this game is addicting or as my friend said, \"This game is f*cking coke!\" Be warned though, there is definitely a learning curve to running a successful long term game. I personally like this as it makes the game more rewarding to play but others may not. There is also a decent amount of content for early development, especially compared to other early access games. I would suggest watching a video for most the basic mechanics and game options but I will give you a rough overview. You get a personal character who starts a business. Hire employees, manage their salaries, educated them, and try to make the best selling software. You get to completely build and customize your Office (obviously within the limits of how he codes the construction mechanics). The building mechanics are a bit clunky and can be a trouble at times but there is a way to work around most of it's limitations with some experience at it. I am sure he will improve it as time goes but one thing for example is a second story (no matter how wide the dimensions of it's lower floor) can only have enough \"structural support\" to hang over one square messurement. Progress in the game feels pretty nice so far. One \"day\" is a month on the game calender and he has already stated he will have a time bar option to make one \"day\" be a week on the game calender with four weeks to a month. The game starts in 1980 unless you choose otherwise and as years pass new software and tools become available. Characters and Softwares have various details, traits and skills (characters only). The game is a bit limited on a variety of furniture/tools but stuff like that should be towards the end of alpha developement. I personally have also not come across any game-breaking bugs.\n\nModding: I am personally not a modder but this game as inspired me to learn a tiny bit to make some mods for this game when it drops. Right now modding is very limited to changing the values of certain mechanics and adding new companies, senarios and software. The future of modding for his game seems very appealing, he plans to have modding accessible in-game and very user-friendly. This is a huge plus in my mind as a supporter of the game because it shows that the developer understands that not only is the content he adds important but player driven content is also extremely important and he has a plan for that already.\n\nIf this review has interested you in the game even the slightest more I highly recommend watching a few videos and asking some questions on the forum.

And after a \"few\" hours of playing it, I don't have to think twice before recommending it to any fan of the genre, and even to those that aren't so familiar with it.\n\n[i]Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn.\n\n\nSteve Jobs[/i]\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Software Inc..\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nLet he who has never thought about developing some sort of software throw the first byte and I shall compute it.\nSoftware Inc. is a game that allows you, the player, to develop your own software, while competing against AI companies that can easily go bankrupt, or simply bought out (I'm looking at you Microsoft!). From choosing your company's name, to the year you wish you start, you'll have a wide range of options to customise your character, and surely even more in the future. You won't be able to start a gigantic company from the get-go, so you'll have to work hard and complete some side contracts while developing your company's first software. And after developing that first piece, you'll just find out that the critics tagged it as crapware.\nOnce you get the hang of it, you'll find out it's incredibly fun to develop your IPs, whether you choose to develop an AntiVirus IP, a Games IP, or even an Operating System IP, and just when you're about to release that latest piece of technology, your thoughts will be: \"Ok, just one more and I'll go to bed.\" Trust me, it won't be just one more.\nSure, the game isn't perfect. Even simple changes could make the game more enjoyable. But that's why it's Early Access, and that's why the developers are so active around the forums. Software Inc. is a true gem.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list][*] Extremely active development team, not only around the forums, but also providing some hotfixes;\n[*] Delightful graphics that despite not being a vital part for the genre, is always a plus;\n[*] Plenty of tutorials, pretty much one for each function, and they're all truly insightful;\n[*] Many options and improvements for each type of software;\n[*] Minimalist UI, containing everything the player will need;\n[*] A good amount of customization available to create the player's character, from colors to skills;\n[*] Enjoyable environment and sound effects.[/list]\n\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a \"Neutral\" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[list][*] Despite being pretty good, the 'Build Mode' needs some improvement, especially to allow the player to build L and T shaped corridors, [strike]as well as to have a \"bulk\" buy option[/strike], or even a copy/paste, since it can be pretty boring after a while to do the plan/buy the same things over and over again;\n[*] It feels like the staff loses too much time eating/drinking/going to the bathroom during the day, even if all those things are two steps away;\n[*] Could use some more objects, but I'm sure these will be added in the future;\n[*] Couple minor bugs, not gamebreaking, but could improve the game's quality if fixed.[/list]\n\nConsidering most of the \"Cons\" I had in mind were already mentioned by the developers as something they're planning to fix, this list will be somewhat short, and I'm sure it will be even shorter after a while. I will, however, still list some that I feel are in bad shape, despite being mentioned by the developers.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list][*] In dire need of some balancing overall, mostly around the profits, stocks market and reputation;\n[*] Staff are not only extremely demanding, but also incredibly well paid;\n[*] Needs a new/better notification system to alert the player of new technology and/or rival's releases.[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI'd give it a [b]8/10[/b], which could easily increase to a 9, and even a 10, with further updates and some more balancing.

They even nailed all the way down to details like being able to access a menu on your MFD to change the Spectator-camera on a monitor so you can change what people watching you play see.\n\nThe tutorials aren't complete so if you have no experience flying helicopters then hovering in manual mode might take you a bit of practice and research to figure out, the weapon systems kind of had me stumped as well but after a small amount of research I'm not proficient in the weapon and targeting systems.\n\nI'm trying to think of anything negative I could say and the only thing I can come up with is that I wish the graphics were a little more flashy than they are, the map is kind of small and doesn't really feel populated, but now I'm just being nitpicky just to provide a con because this really is an amazing game!\n\nIf you're a fan of fixed-wing or rotary-wing flight sims, or just enjoy flying in general then this game is absolutely worth your time and money!

It really feels like you're flying a plane. I typically don't go for first person flight sims because it's so darn difficult to play effectively using a traditional monitor setup. In VR though.. it's like you're sitting in the seat, and it's amazing. In 2 hours I've played through each of the tutorial missions and the first campaign mission. I skipped the manual flight tutorial as it was labelled \"under construction\", and I'd already been flying around with manual controls easily enough anyway.\n\nDifficulty wise it was a breeze. I've got thousands of hours flying planes and rockets in Kerbal Space Program, and dozens of those hours were spent building and flying VTOL craft like this. That experience transfered over reasonably well. It probably also helps that I've flown helicopters around in Arma 3, and actually own a Phantom 3 drone - all of these control at least somewhat similarly to the VTOL craft in this game. The only issue I've had so far is that the plane doesn't fly as I'd expect a bit after takeoff. Sometimes when flying manually with the engines tilted at 90 degrees the whole thing just goes all wonky around the time I'm hitting 100-200 meters, tilting every which way wildly. I've managed to regain control each time so far, but I'm not sure what's causing it. Probably pilot error, lol.\n\nRegardless, I totally recommend this game to anyone with a VR headset (I've got a Vive) and a love of flying. You might have to take your chair's armrests off though - the joystick isn't really positioned well to be able to hold it with them on (at least with my chair).

All my feedback/constructive criticism below should be considered with my strong reccomendation to buy and play what is an incredible VR experience, and hands down one of the best VR games out currently.\n\nFeedback/Suggestions:\n\n1) Allow for \"checkpoints\". Crashing or failing a mission and having to start over from the very beginning is frustrating as you spend a lot of time just flying in a straight line to a destination. Being able to jump back into the action from a certain point would be valuable.\n\n2) Graphics are good, but could be better.  Would love an \"ULTRA\" Setting. VR headsets require beefy hardware and allowing for pretty incredible visuals, so would love to see that stepped up a notch here. A good reference is \"Skycar\" - If you could combine gameplay from VTOL with graphics from Skycar = show-stopper. Also different weather effects would be awesome.\n\n3) Multiplayer - Nuff said. I'd probably quit my job to play this game 24/7 if this feature were enabled :)\n\n4) \"Feeling of speed\" - This is a tough one to describe and probably even tougher to implement, but one thing missing from the game is a sense of how fast you're going. You can see your speed/G-Forces on the display, but you don't really \"feel\" like you're moving all that fast, even when you're buzzing by buildings/mountains etc. There also isn't any discernable difference between sense of speed at low/high volocities/hovering etc. I'm sure there are some interesting ways to enhance this.\n\nOtherwise, keep crushing it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1513221394, "timestamp_updated": 1513221394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38283200": {"recommendationid": "38283200", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996889855", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511227589}, "language": "english", "review": "thank you for this game", "timestamp_created": 1513182301, "timestamp_updated": 1513182301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38276374": {"recommendationid": "38276374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993808402", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1513870109}, "language": "english", "review": "I like to push the buttons.", "timestamp_created": 1513158771, "timestamp_updated": 1513158771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38216147": {"recommendationid": "38216147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103479832", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512929117}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has the potential to be the greatest VR title on the market. \n\nVTOL VR doesn't attempt to hold your hand.

I have tried to get into the DCS series but always found I was lacking the hardware and time to get the full experience, but with this game all you need is the vive package. (Not saying that vr is cheaper than all the good flight sim hardware needed for DCS, but I feel that the vive is a much better investment because it can be used for other applications) Even though I have a pair of rudder pedals, I find that I don't need them and in fact using them takes away from my immersion. Being present in the cockpit and able to interact with it is amazing. All the cockpit systems are easy to understand and employ. The precision that the vive gives you is truly demonstrated with this title. Aerial Refueling, something I was never able to accomplish in DCS, only took me a couple minutes to achieve here and the same goes for carrier landings. Weapons feel great to use and the first time you shoot something down feels extremely rewarding. I cannot sing Paolo's praises enough, I have been following him ever since he was making mods for KSP and this game is his greatest accomplishment so far! I cannot wait to see what he has in store for this title!\n\nTLDR: If you have ever wanted to be a fighter jet pilot, or are into combat flight sims and have a VR headset, this game is a must buy!\n", "timestamp_created": 1512881967, "timestamp_updated": 1512881967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38147153": {"recommendationid": "38147153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176468569", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 417, "last_played": 1514585033}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an extremely good game.

The thing I dislike most about flight sims in VR is having to keybind everything to your HOTAS somehow. \n       - This game was designed for VR, unlike most other flight sims it requires a much less powerful graphics cards to render at 90 fps.\n        - Systems are not too difficult to learn, but also not too easy. hovering takes a while to get used to, but otherwise there would be no challenge. The developer has found a good balance betwee realism and fun.\n\nCons:\n       -  Joy stick does not seem to respond as I would expect it to, especially with yaw. I have a HOTAS that I would love to be able to use the movements feel much more precise and I can feel where my controls are without having to look at them, whereas with the controllers I sometimes find that my hands are in a different location in respect to my controls than I thought. \n\nOverall, this game is a blast. I feel like an actual pilot when playing, and at the same time I am watching my skills grow as I am becoming more intune with the aircraft controls and more knowledgable about the aircraft systems. Games like this are the reason I have been excited for VR, I have been waiting for a game like this for years. I can't wait to see it grow and add on more features.

You die, you start from beginning. They are usually fairly short missions, but this can get irritating.\n\nHowever, I anticipate all these problems to be solved by release.\n\nThe actual simulation aspect is heavily simplified, this is to keep it accessible for all players, not just simulation enthusiasts. This is a good thing even if you are a regular flight sim player, as if you end up getting shot down, you don't really want to go through a 30min pre flight procedure every time you die. There are still plenty of buttons to play around with however, so it doesn't feel too arcadey.\n\nThe aircraft handles exactly how I would imagine it would, and it is very easy to keep control as long as you make deliberate movements, even with flight assist off. It is a lot of fun to switch between conventional and VTOL flight in the middle of combat situations.\n\nSpeaking of which, combat is realistic. You dont have a health pool that drains into a game over, one missile hit and you are down. Gun damage seems to be a little weak against you, but I have not really stuck around in the middle of gunfire to see how long it takes to take you down. Your weapons are very powerful, and typically take down targets with no issue. It seems a little difficult to shake off missiles, even when deploying countermeasures, but I am not a combat pilot IRL, and there is no missile evasion tutorial yet so it is probably me doing something wrong.\n\nWhile the campaign and Free flight modes are a lot of fun, I would hope to see some generated dynamic missions that can play out for a number of rearms for replayability value.\n\nWhile flying around, especially on longer flights it does get a bit dull. There is a built in MP3 player in the aircraft, because why not, but some ambient radio would be nice.\n\nI expect to play a lot more of this, especially as it is still in development with regular new content.", "timestamp_created": 1506430221, "timestamp_updated": 1506430221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35211625": {"recommendationid": "35211625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007434807", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506373392}, "language": "english", "review": "This game looks tro be a great game but can not get controls to work  i have a oculus rift that may be the problem not sure  but will keep trying", "timestamp_created": 1506378272, "timestamp_updated": 1506378272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35176087": {"recommendationid": "35176087", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960683180", "num_games_owned": 529, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 112, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511342403}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished flying the tutorial as well as the first mission and had a fantastic time.

This is on the right track for sure. I've just played around with the flight model and the cockpit experience is really good. Graphics are currently good enough to get the feel of the game. Flying can be a mixed bag. I DO like it overall but things can go all crashy in a blink of an eye. Touch controls work well but I am not crazy about how yaw works. Same twist motion for those with that joystick option but with the touch free floating you find yourself putting in a lot of unwanted inputs and need to keep an eye on your centering/yaw motion box as they phiscal centering with a joystick is not there. Not really a knock on the game at all. Just a fact of life using the touch. Looking to see if I can remap that to the right stick. Well worth the price IMO. While I play a ton of sims with TrackIR and a few with the vibe and rift I do get that uneasy feeling now and again in other flight sims. That just does not happen in this game. At all. Well done. I hope this takes off and allows for different game modes. Easy to get into it and DCS every button does something and you need to do it in the right order level of play.

It's a new way of controlling an aircraft in a sim, without a doubt, but it doesn't take long to get comfortable with. It IS a slightly more challenging method, than a physical control-setup, but my initial reaction to it is that it's something you'll get normalized to rather quickly. It doesn't feel like a less precise or less capable way of controlling things, and over time it may even become a method that is preferred over a physical HOTAS (I have only just finished my first hour in the sim, but I like the method a lot already)\nThe only thing I noticed that was worse (It's not a big issue though), is that it is impossible to rest your hands or fingers with this method, so it will get a bit more fatiguing over time than with a physical HOTAS.\n\nVisually it's pleasing. The sky is really nice :) The ground is very simple.\n\nMid-air refuel was quite the experience. Very cool :)\n\nOverall my initial impression of this sim is that it is very capable.\nI hope it doesn't get bloated over time so framerates drop (I normally fly P3D in VR, which is HEAVY on my system and does cause less than optimal framerates)\n\nThe game felt self-explanatory most of the time, although I couldn't figure out how to apply brakes while taxiing or after landing (Only the park-brake)\n\nIt's not for arcade-pilots... you really need to be into simming. Thrust-control, for example, is brilliantly done, which may throw arcade-pilots off.\n\nAs it stands, the game is great. I recommend it.\nJEL", "timestamp_created": 1504108005, "timestamp_updated": 1504108005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34587485": {"recommendationid": "34587485", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076710147", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509734434}, "language": "english", "review": "I've never written a review until now.

This game has more content than most finished VR games out there.\n\nA must have if you are interested in flight sims and have a VR headset\n\nThis game does flight-simulators right. while it may not be as realistic as DCS. Sitting in the cockpit, flicking switches by yourself and being completely immersed in the game makes this one of the best flight simulator experiences i've had.\n\nThe controls are fairly intuitive, and if you have played flight simulators before you will most likely not even need the tutorials, the aircraft is much less complicated than what you find in DCS and BMS.\n\nThis would be an amazing start for people wanting to get into (combat-)flight sims. Because everything feels real and \"military\" while being simple enough to pick up in short time. Though the full-VR support might spoil you for other sims.\n\nI don't know how good the game is on the Rift, But the Vive controls very well", "timestamp_created": 1503250519, "timestamp_updated": 1503250519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34375722": {"recommendationid": "34375722", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999415109", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509511001}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been wanting to review this since I bought it, but figured I'd give it a few more hours of my time before coming to a final verdict.\n\nShort and sweet, this game has its flaws, but is well worth the seemingly absurd price. I'd pay more for it if it costed more, but I'm glad it doesn't. I've spent more money on much less entertainment.\n\nVTOL VR has a good balance of arcade and sim. As others mentioned, the flight model is simple enough for inexperienced players to pick up on without a lot of time investment, and complex enough for veteran flight sim players to feel comfortable in. There are definitely some areas that could use improvement, but overall, for the state it's in right now, considering it came out less than a month ago, it is excellent.\n\nIt has some performance issues. I'm running a 7700K at 4.2 with a 1080, and most of the missions that start you on the carrier (quick flight on hostile island, and campaign mission 4 in particular) generate some heavy frame drops, almost to a sickening point. Utilizing the spectator cam makes this much, much worse as I've found out tonight. Definitely going to need some major optimization down the road\n\nWith performance issues aside, this game is a blast, and probably the most fun I've had in VR since early Sairento and H3VR. The fact that it also puts you in the seat of a fighter aircraft is pretty sweet, too. Since you don't move, it's playable in my small room, where I can't play room-scale games; I typically have to move my entire setup downstairs into my living room to do that.\n\nThere is a plethora of weaponry to choose from, and each one has its own uses and downsides. The weapons systems seem very realistic, from what little I know of air combat systems, and are a blast to use when you figure out how they work. Using CCIP/CCRP with bombs is awesome, and head-tracking air-to-air missile locks on jets screaming over your cockpit is simply exhilarating. The developer is consistently pumping out new tutorials on weapon systems usage and most of it is pretty intuitive. The cockpit UI is simplified enough that you don't have to worry about 90% of the stuff a real pilot would, and you can just get right to the action (well, once you've figured out how to engage the APU, start the engines, unlock the brakes, swivel your engines, release the catapault hook, set the flaps....) and start blowing shit up.\n\nThe controls are VR-only. You cannot use a mouse/keyboard or any kind of HOTAS (as of its current state). This may sound whack at first, but you quickly get used to how the controllers respond to your input and it becomes as fluid as if you had an actual stick in your hand, especially if you have a chair with an armrest in the right spot that you can just balance the bottom of the controller on. Not sure if it's the same for the Rift, but the Vive wands are a very comfortable experience. There are also adjustment buttons on the stick and chair in-game to make sure you're in just the right position.\n\nOverall, it needs polish. But this is a very early stage of an early access title, being created by, as far as I know, one guy. You can tell the radio comms are all the same guy, which I'm assuming is the dev. But I'm also assuming these are placeholders that will be polished out later on. Same with some of the environment texturing and so-forth.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone with a VR system and an interest in modern aerial combat, or just piloting in general.

Really if there were a way to get out of the VTOL other than ejection, it feels like the very first ARMA/Operation Flashpoint but with no gear. I find it to be the perfect level of simulation with the ability to shut off flight help and or lose it from damage to your craft. This is a showcase level proof of concept if nothing else.

Estos modos son muy \u00fatiles para ir aprendiendo a manejar el avi\u00f3n.\n\n Los graficos no son los mejores del mundo, pero es algo que me ha dado exactamente igual, ya que la inmersion es completa y no te llama la atencion la calidad de los graficos mientras estas volando. \n\n El paisaje se hace un poco pobre mientras vuelas a poca altura, ya que es todo muy igual. \n\n De todas formas, de momento es uno de los juegos de VR que mas me esta gustando.\n\n  Aqui dejo un peque\u00f1o tutorial en castellano para ver los manejos basicos de avi\u00f3n.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G59U_OaSp0c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms941tMBSEE&index=2&list=PLkFrAp-nRnvVMwiAfgFTPJ4uWmEmyucIv", "timestamp_created": 1502402273, "timestamp_updated": 1504351987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34154130": {"recommendationid": "34154130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160510616", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502403177}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first review i have ever done, all i have to say is get this game.", "timestamp_created": 1502396069, "timestamp_updated": 1502396069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493222", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34152260": {"recommendationid": "34152260", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988208168", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505265366}, "language": "english", "review": "For a game that is still early - early access it is really fun, a really good mix of a flight sim and a flight shooter.

I was about to find the tanker and refuel.  I was then able to make a vertical landing as well as an arrestor cable landing to test functionality.

Lots of attention to detail.  Feels like Falcon 4.0 BMS but, in VR.  No additional HOTAS, rudder pedals, or controllers required other than Vive controllers.  Excellent tutorial.  Easy to learn and understand how to fly in first 10-20 minutes of gameplay. Took me about 1-3 hours to get good at completing missions. Highly recommend to flight sim enthusiasts.  If you are shocked by the experience IL2 in VR for WW2 you will enjoy the same experience from this flght simulator but, with the look and feel of modern combat.\n\nGameplay feels similar to Lunar Lander VR when flying in to pickup and drop off troops.  It takes a bit to master but, the heading, altitude, and hover autopilot features can help you stabalize the aircraft to help guide it in.\nCockpit flight experience is similar to how I felt when flying IL2 VR for first time. I was totally shocked.\n\n\n\n[u]Pros[/u]\n[list]\n    [*]Working MFDs, all buttons, panels, and switches work.\n    [*]Working radio to play music. Can even control volume and cycle music tracks during flight.\n[*]Working APU (Auxillary Power Unit) to charge battery and start engines.\n[*]Engines warm up then idle down after engine start.\n[*] Working RWR (Radar Warning Receiver)\n    [*]Air-to-Air Refueling  with tankers\n    [*]Working Cargo door to load and unload troops\n    [*]Working Helmet Visor (you can lift up and down to avoid sun glare)\n    [*]Adjustable seat and adjustable controls.\n    [*]HUD and MFDs have very useful options and information (nothing is fake or non-functional)\n    [*]HUD has working tint adjustment to avoid sun glare.\n    [*]Canopy has scratches and imperfections seen against sunlight.  (Similar to IL2 VR)\n    [*]Working Ejection handle between legs to punch out. \n    [*]Working Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) similar to what AH-64 pilots use for looking around with gun cam.  This can be toggled on and off and rests directly in front of your right eye.\n    [*]No nausea or motion sickness.  Very smooth frame rate.  \n[*] Awesome chaff, flare, and missle trail effects when in combat.  \n[*] Very fun campaign.\n[*]AI Traffic:  Refueler, Fighter Escorts, Enemy Aircraft \n [*]Free bobble head accessory on dashboard.  Other games charge extra for this.\n[/list]\n\n\n[u]Hope gets added later[/u]\n[list]\n    [*]Ability to target tanker and get speed. (I am able to read alititude of target but, not speed)  In Falcon 4.0 BMS there is a hard lock and soft lock.  Soft lock gives you altitude of target, Hard lock gives you altitude and speed. Would be nice to get speed to match during refueling.\n    [*]Would be nice to have passenger camera to verify everyone is aboard.  Side cameras work but, would just be cool to have an inside one.\n[*] Hopefully there will be a random campaign/mission generator. \n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1501796128, "timestamp_updated": 1502162040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34002112": {"recommendationid": "34002112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078713657", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2621, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 74, "last_played": 1513715951}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only played it for a couple of hours, but I can already tell you that this is one of, if not the, best VR experiences I've had.

The devs obviously know a fair bit about aircraft operations, there is no quick start. Battery power, APU needs to be fired up first, HUD turned on ect but then no 15 mins wait for NAV system to finish aligning or more complex systems that would take along time to learn\n\nThe flight modeling for fast forward flight feels fine and is not too challenging. VTOL is hard, I mean really hard to get the hang of.  This means many will love the challenge while some will find it very fustrating (maybe there is an auto hover function but I have not found it yet)  Personally I love the fact that I suck at it, it means I have to put some time into learning to fly the dam thing\n\nThe controls are well though out the grip button is used to lock hand to collective and/or stick is a very good idea.  I honestly think I would be flying alot better with my HOTAS but the trade off is I can use the systems with my hand without having to find my controller and let go of my HOTAS\n\nI recommend this game but for some it will be not hardcore enough, for others it will be frustrating if you have zero experience at this type of game perhapes.  The scenery is by far the weakest part of this game and I would very much like to see it improved over time.  It's deffently worth checking out if you have any intrest in flying though\n\nWill it replace DCS:world?

basic but by far there not bad, there seems to be duplicate fans ringside during the early fights but hey ho whos watching them?\n\nthe AI movements are fluid and very responsive to your actions with the controllers this forces you to switch tactics up and not constantly go for one part of the body,\n\nif he is guarding full front to the face, then a right or left hook is required to connect, viser versa stragits or jabs, there are multiple oportunitys to get some good hits in but you must outwit the AI and that is fun to say the least, as far as content goes its very much just bout after bout each fighter getting increasingly more difficult too defeat causing you to work harder.\n\nAnother little plus that i like is the fact that if you get a few hits in the right place the AIs faceial expression gives it away that he is rocked letting you know to get in and lay him out.\nall in all.\n\nAn amazing sports game that i am sure will only continue to improve, \nthis get the Lords

No matter which game I start my VR session playing, I always end up finishing with a few rounds of \u2018Thrill of the Fight\u2019.  I used to take boxing lessons and missed sparring/shadow boxing.  This game is a great tool for boxers who want something that lives in-between the two.  You don\u2019t have to worry about the potential injuries associated with sparring, and you get a more visceral experience than traditional shadow boxing.  After trying Knockout League and Drunkn Bar Fight, I think Thrill of the Fight is the best VR boxing experience currently available.  Knockout League segregates movements into slow, exaggerated steps that don\u2019t translate into a fluid sparring/shadow boxing experience.  Drunkn Bar Fight is just plain wonky, but in a funny way.  Both of those games seem cool for their target audience but Thrill of the Fight feels like the best VR game for actual boxers at the moment.   \n\nThrill of the Fight is just really well thought out and fine-tuned.   From the clever way the game captures the player\u2019s height to the injuries shown on your opponent\u2019s flesh in lieu of a cheesy damage bar, the game is just fluid.  There\u2019s no lame music or theatrics.   The emphasis is on the fight experience and the game really seems to push the limit of realism available with current VR technology.  Ian Fitz has been tweaking the game with regular beta updates and responding to user input.  What more can you ask for?\n\nIf you\u2019re a Vive owner, I\u2019d recommend taking any precautions necessary in order to avoid damaging your unit with sweat.

Better than being i the ring! (No black eyes or broken noses).\n\nI had a go on the heavy bag for 2mins, straight into a sparring match (which I won) and then into my first official match...\n\nRound 1 was fairly even, I had a slight upper hand until a sweet right hook caught my opponent off guard and I saw his eyes roll up into the back of his head.  Not one to miss an opportunity I laid it on thick, cross, cross, jab, upper cut and down he went.\n\nBack up on the count of 6 and looking decidedly determined he came back at me.  Regardless of my movement and shot selection (landed a few nice hooks) he was steady on his feet.\n\nAs round 1 ended (3mins) I was shattered, I looked around at the crowd and saw somebody I thought I recognised?  This person smiled and nodded, that was the incentive I needed!  Also luckily there is a 60sec rest period, I used 57 secs before we went back at it.\n\nRound 2 was decidedly more his than mine, I was slower, throwing less punches and he had me dazed a number of times with some well-timed counter and lunge punches.\n\nThen it happened again, that sweet right causing his eyes to roll back, I unleashed a flurry or hooks and put him down with an almighty uppercut.\n\nThis time he was up in 7 and I was a bit concerned he might have me as I was getting low on puff.  I opted to pick my punches more and worked out a nice combo to the midriff causing him to lower his guard and I put him down again!\n\nThis must be it I thought, 4, 5, 6, nothing then 7, he stirred and was up on his feet quickly.  I could see the red bruising in his left rib cage where I had been weakening his resolve.  His face badly battered and bruised, he was looking weak.\n\nAgain we go at it, trading blows, his counter attacks still as fresh as round one.  Then a lighting fast jab-cross combo rocked him back; his guard lowered and I jumped in hard laying punches like a madman, moving him around the ring like a puppet there was nothing he could do and he dropped for the final time.  \n\nThe ref stepped in and called it....TKO in my first fight within 2 rounds.\n\nAs the ref announced the winner my opponent was shockingly looking positive and arrogant.  Perhaps he really didn't know who had won?  \n\nThe fight was mine, the crowd cheers and clapped (in their wierd hand to wrist style) and I knew that I would need to improve on my technique considerably before my next fight.\n\n\nBest workout ever!!!! 10 stars and this is still in Early Access!\n\n MY 2pence\n==========\n-  Training, teach tempo and style etc.. Would be nice.\n-  I love the simulation style of it and would only play like this, but I can see the benefit of having a hit meter for younger and beginner players.\n- I hope the rings improve, bigger, brighter and better!  Can go for the title!???\n- Not looking forward to my first knock down, how will it make me feel?  Perhaps options on how this works...some might prefer all black, external view and then go.  Others might like to see the entire room spin?? (not me much lol)\n- Like the gloves and the shorts, a body might be good too?\n- Love to have sponsors, media involved etc...charge more I don't mind :-)\n\nBrilliant work, Bravo Devs!", "timestamp_created": 1512855284, "timestamp_updated": 1515522600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.627548", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38147680": {"recommendationid": "38147680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307049681", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514935529}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll fuck up Ugly Joe on the SPOT if i see his Bitch Ass around here..\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1512720052, "timestamp_updated": 1512720052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38114906": {"recommendationid": "38114906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297356599", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 86, "last_played": 1516398082}, "language": "english", "review": "From the limited time I've played TotF, I'm impressed with what's on offer.

If you could have an opponent with a ton of stamina and the ability to be a stinger and throw tons and tons of punches that would be awesome. Also, they don't utilize combos too well, like a simple 112 or a 123. It'd be cool to have an opponent throw out a 1234 or a 5634 every once in a while. \n\nConclusion: Awesome game and incredibly fun.

And I'm so freaking cheap it isn't funny.\n\nCome into this game knowing there's only like 5 fighters (I think. There may be more, I haven't even beat everyone yet). Don't expect there to be more. I'm not the developer, so who knows, there may be. What does matter is the fact that every fighter actually has a different feel. There could have just as easily been dozens of fighters with very slight differences, which is much lazier than what was done here and would appease anyone complaining about lack of content, but this developer decided on a quality product.\n\nThe punch force? Not perfect, but damn if it isn't still impressive that you can punch air and the game calculates something plausible, and it works pretty well. Improvements here would be awesome, but unreasonable to expect.\n\nThere are flaws of course. For starters, one of the first things I noticed is the fact that you don't really have a \"stance\". That said, these flaws are less \"the developer doesn't care\" and more \"these are the limitations with our current VR tech/dev budget/man hours\", and they are absolutely within reason and do not kill the experience.\n\nDon't go into this game thinking it's going to be a fun punching thing (like Punch-Out!!). Don't go in and expect this game to deliver the perfect fighting experience, THE definitive fighting experience for years to come (though it probably actually fits that description as of now). Go in expecting a fight simulation and a GREAT workout (seriously, my first time with this game beat my arms harder than actually punching a 100 lb bag repeatedly. This will EASILY not only replace, but kick the everloving s**t of of shadow boxing in your routine. At least, until you can honestly do 3x3 minutes rounds going all out with a minute break in between by yourself). This is a small game made by one dude or a small indie team or something, and it is impressive. Anyone who buys this game for $10 and decides that they haven't got their money's worth either came in with the wrong expectations or is just dumb. On top of that, the dev is very active still.

Full disclosure, it was MMA so that experience is more aligned with Muay Thai / American Kickboxing styles than classic boxing. While there are certainly differences between the styles, the 'feeling' of hitting someone in the face and emotions range felt during a match are probably pretty close. That being said I couldn't be happier to have something like this available. \n\nVR really opened the door to this level of immersion for sure, but all credit should go to the developer behind this. It's truly remarkable what he's accomplished. Getting the pacing and feeling of some of the nuances of the sport and actual act of fighting someone without actually having boxed himself is worth the price of admission alone. \n\nFor perspective, I tried Knockout League and had to shut it off after the first fight for one simple reason; It committed the same sin virtually every other VR or motion controlled fighting game has before it. [b]It did'nt take the user seriously[/b], watered down physics that have more to do with a rhythm game or timing game on guardrails than a fight. \n\nIs ToTF perfect, the only thing missing is the concussion and black eyes? Of course not, but IMO it's leaps beyond anything else mechanically and \"experience\" wise. I know that is a word that gets thrown around a lot, but it's well earned for this title. For  example, even the 1st opponent takes me back to exactly what it was like to lightly spar with a training partner. Not too hard, not too slow, focusing on technique and movement. \n\nPairing the current experience with a super responsive Dev, frequent updates that are almost always a love letter to the (active) community on the forums and you have a winner worth 3x the asking price. Personally, I can't wait to see where this game goes as we are treated to frequent and meaningful updates.\n\n[b]Additional context, or to address some potential purchaser preconceptions:[/b]\n\nIf you are looking into this as something to TEACH you to fight, I'll say this. It's not an instructional. HOWEVER. If you use some common sense, watch some instructional videos or books on the subject, you can ABSOLUTELY drill and refine technique and precision. This is valuable in a way that goes beyond pad or bag work as you can gauge actual distance and get used to 'picking apart' a defense. With the addition of the round system, it can also teach you good pacing. Just like real life, conserving your energy is a huge part of fight strategy. \n\nWhen I was actively training, I was unfortunate enough to be one of those people that felt bad for hitting someone too hard that I trained with. It's more common than you think, and with a game like this it allows you to get the 'feel' of things like (distance) timing and even evasion down without taking or doing any actual damage - except maybe to furniture or TVs if you don't strap in. \n\nThe big exceptions to what isn't going to build good real world habits are some intermediate level footwork stuff like cut and gate steps based on AI tracking and/or play area limitations. You can still make these movements of course, but you don't get the same angles you would IRL if you really make someone miss.

VR stands very well here. As this is still in beta I'll try a few suggestions here but as a reader keep in mind that the game is worth every cent. \n\nI do have a decent background with martial arts (but not with boxing). \nBtw rapid circular dodging with the headset is problematic (my headset fall down one time), no software solution here...\n\nSo, my TODO list for Santa Claus :\n- I'd like to have a way to know my hit speed and frequency, maybe as a kind of training challenge against the \"trainer\" \n- As already discussed this is far too easy to reach the cap strength. I lost two matches by the Blue Bomber until I understood that trying to knockdown him by a strong punch in the jaw was counterproductive.  So I'd like to have higher cap and possibly some much higher punishment when over exposing (which is what I tend to do to land a good punch)\n- I'd like to be able to \"work\" a body zone.

Mechanics are getting better and better with each update and the feel of boxing is pretty realistic. You can do jabs, uppercuts, hooks and straight punches (also body shots) and there actually is quite a nice amount strategy involved in using different attacks as well between different opponents. \n\nI like the dodging and defending mechanisms. Blocking straights, hooks and body shots really require you to actively switch the hand positions and even though the headset is kind of \"heavy\", using head movement to dodge really works nicely as well. I can't comment much on the movement and leg work since I have limited space so that is important part of real boxing strategy which I can't test really well. This game does require quite a big space fully enjoy it, but even almost stationary boxing still works ok.\n\nThere is a nice amount of variance between the opponent styles and their strategies also have been getting better with updates. Although maybe they are bit oo repetetive as after a while you might find some strategy which works kind of too well against them. But you can still add some challenge by just mixing your own game up a bit and not exploit the \"sure\" strategy. \n\nI didn't like having unblockable punches with one of the opponents. In the latest beta update his punches are now blockable and I find it much more enjoyable while still challenging.

I see where it is going, and it is the only game that I have seen in VR that is trying this, but anything that makes me rage quit I can't recommend. \n\nToo Easy: I plowed through everyone up to the blue bomber without ever being knocked down. The difficulty does not scale. The first opponents just turtle behind their gloves, and let you pound them, until they are unconscious. \n\nToo Hard: The blue bomber is a fucking beast. Even if I hit him twice as many times as I get hit, I can't hurt him. I have only managed to knock him down one time. The difficulty curve on this one goes from boring to unbeatable in one opponent.  \n\nBlocking is Broken: Are you supposed to be able to block with the gloves? I do it out of instinct, but every time, old blue goes right through the block. I would test it with the other fighters, but they don't throw punches. This means the only thing I have left for defense is to dodge. So now I'm flailing my head around like crazy, feeling like an idiot, trying to not get hit. \n\nFighter placement: This is probably my biggest complaint. I play on oculus, and I only have 180 sensors, so I have to be facing front in order for it to read my glove placement. It works on the startup when I step on the scale...it works when I spawn at the fight board... and then in the match, it spawns the fighter on my right, instead of right in front of me. so, I have to turn to my right to fight, but now my right sensor is blocked by my body. This causes my right hand to either not respond, or to just fly off into space at random periods. \n\nCrowding: If you watch actual boxers, they move in to attack, throw a few punches, and back out so they don't get hit. Old blue, and a few of the other guys move in, but they never move out. they just stay in the pocket, and either hit, or be hit. The problem is, I don't want to stay in there with them. I move back, and they follow. eventually I hit the wall, in reality. I have no way to circle around them to escape, so I'm just stuck there getting pounded on.\n", "timestamp_created": 1483933542, "timestamp_updated": 1483933542, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586303", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1483977928, "developer_response": "Thanks for being honest in your review. Feedback like yours helps direct my focus to issues causing people frustration and helps me improve the game. I would like to address a few things that might help your enjoyment.\n\nToo Easy: The AI is currently weak to stronger/faster players that are going all out. If you're fit enough to sustain a constant chain of punches you don't give the opponent room to breathe to throw their own punch, and stronger/faster players will cause staggering hits on any counter-punches the AI begins to throw. One reason you're finding the Blue Bomber to be more difficult is because he can't be staggered, so he's able to return punches back at you while you've got him locked down. I'll be addressing this in a few ways: First, I will be reworking how the damage and staggering system works to be more interesting, more realistic, and to give the AI a fighting chance to throw counter-punches when you lock them down. Second, I plan to add selectable \"difficulty\" levels which are more for the player to choose their level of fitness, which will change the amount of force required to do damage, get knockdowns, and score staggering hits.\n\nToo Hard, Blocking, and the Blue Bomber: In the current version of the game, the Blue Bomber cannot be blocked at all. In the next update (likely coming later this week), he will become blockable. His ability to punch through your block originates from the initial plan for the game to be more fanciful like Punch-Out, but player feedback has been to make the game less fanciful and more realistic. You'll notice the characters you fight in the arena all have some sort of exaggerated quirk - the Spider is very tall with long limbs, the Blue Bomber hits extremely hard, and Luis's punches are lightning fast - but since the game has taken a more realistic direction, the less realistic elements now feel out of place, and I'm in the middle of reworking those fighters. The Spider has already been toned down from his initial design (and now needs to be made more challenging to avoid the sudden spike in difficulty that you noted). The Blue Bomber is up next. The difficulty curve will also be smoothed out as more opponents are added to fill in the gaps in the line-up.\n\nFighter placement: When you first fire up the game and weigh-in, there's a settings menu with an option for 180\u00b0 sensor placement. This will keep the opponent in front of you at all times. Do you have that setting selected and find it's not working?\n\nCrowding: In the same way that you can step in and lock down the AI, some of the opponents might try to do the same to you. If you counter-punch and score a stagger, they will back off. There are some obvious problems here that I will be addressing when I revisit the damage system, such as the earlier enemies being not aggressive enough, so they step in but then don't actually throw many punches, or that the Blue Bomber can't be staggered, so you just have to deal with him until he backs off.\n\nAgain, I appreciate the feedback. I don't expect you to rate the game based on updates that don't exist yet, but I wanted to help you enjoy what's there now how you can, and let you know that I agree with the issues you have raised and am working on them. I hope to be able to earn your positive review in the future."}, "29125140": {"recommendationid": "29125140", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061481934", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502922944}, "language": "english", "review": "i hit my knee with my vive controller\n\n10/10 would hit knee again", "timestamp_created": 1483904860, "timestamp_updated": 1483904860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29096823": {"recommendationid": "29096823", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081991801", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507507823}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

It's early access and still needs some work to be truly great, but it's already fun. It is steadily getting updates and getting improved gameplay. \n\nThis game will give you a good workout, especially if you aproach it like real boxing and move around and throw some decent punches. While not a simulation you will be doing all the same movements as you would in real life (assuming you put effort into it) so it's like an intense shadow boxing session.

There are some complaints I but I think the dev is working on most of them. Things also mentioned by others, like the punch force cap, which dev has said will be raised.\n\nExtended: Using new Beta.\n\nThe game is getting better and better, it's now a much more authentic boxing experience, for the experienced boxers, let's not call it a sim, but it is a true boxing game now in my opinion. Power cap has been removed, opponents move more naturally and fight more dynamically. You can get flash KOs and one punch knockdowns. You can also be taken out very quickly yourself, so you have to think about what you're doing. \n\nThe game mechanics have been tightened up so it feel a lot more real now, and it's more challenging, although it might still be easy for some (very few) people. You now get blurry vision when damaged which convey the damage really well, and is a good reprentation of being wobbled. Still no rounds but that is coming, and then it will be even better.

Movement depends on your available space.\n- Innovative use of Vive controller mechanics by changing the grip you use. I was only skeptic for the first five seconds, and then I was sold.\n- Great for an inde game with probably a low budget.\n- At full price USD I only paid $10. I can already tell I'm going to be revisiting this often enough to make the dollars/hour spent very cheap.\n- Actually decent cardio for a game. There's a reason rounds are 3:00 in boxing.\n\nCons:\n- Training is school of hard knox.\n- Actual punching skills developed is probably not high.\n- AI ignores punches if it is in the process of swinging.\n- AI got right in my face. Not sure if that was intentional, or just the software not reading my position correctly, but given the very strategic nature of the dodge-punch-dodge mechanics, this made even the starting opponent a pain.\n- Game placed opponent between myself and my PC, which means I was constantly tripping over the headset cord.\n\nI used to do American boxing for sport, been in a few matches, got knocked out once with a concussion (it was an unofficial match with gloves and mouth guards, but no headgear - wear your headgear, kids, leave the \"no headgear\" to the professionals who can afford it). In the last year or so I've switched into other forms of boxing and fighting, but I've let my cardio slide due to injuries and day job volume.\n\nThis game punished me for it, and I like it. I can still hit a bag for a few rounds, but hitting the empty air is much more tiring. I wouldn't consider it a \"simulator,\" most VR games that attempt to give you a feel for something aren't quite advanced enough, but give it time, I'm sure. The feeling of connecting with a good punch just isn't there. A well-swung roundhouse when your opponent is wide open gets completely ignored if the game was expecting you to block or dodge his slow straight right. The AI registers it was hit by wincing, but continues through with it's action. I suppose otherwise, you could just roll your fists around like patty cake and win every match.\n\nThat being said, it's a lot of fun and will teach you some boxing fundamentals, I just wish there was more of a tutorial. If you dodge too early, your opponent will change direction and still hit you. Dodge too late, and obviously you still get hit. This is where it shines in the realm of \"actual boxing.\" It took me a few practice sessions to understand what it was doing.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention the AI getting in my face - again, this is a game, not a simulation, but in that type of situation, you would go for body shots or lock up and look for an opportunity to deliver quick jabs/hooks until my opponent backed off. AI does *not* care, and will throw almost impossible punches that should slip by you instead of nailing you in the face. If you're almost forehead-to-forehead with someone, and they throw a full-shoulder straight right, a slight dodge of the head and it will blow past your ear, over your shoulder, and leave them exposed for a counter-hook. Half-step back, bam. Not here. Admitting this is not a simulation, the game needs AI that recognizes appropriate distance based on height and head position, and react accordingly. I'm 6'0\", dev, if you read this and that helps. I did not cheat at the weigh-in (which records your height, apparently) by lowering or raising myself.\n\nAlso as I mentioned above as a con, the game decided my opponent would be in the direction of my PC. That meant the cord fell right next to my legs, which made dodging very difficult. I appreciate the fact that when I did successfully side-step, the AI followed.\n\nAll-in-all, I think the game successfully sets out to do what it intends to do - be a fun boxing game, not a sim, not a training tool. While those features would be very cool, for $10, I can't complain at all. I've spent a lot more than that on lessons, books, and gym time, and while this doesn't offer the same benefit - because it's a game and not a simulation - it has definite merit, and is a great workout.", "timestamp_created": 1471732088, "timestamp_updated": 1471732673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25026710": {"recommendationid": "25026710", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997989673", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509942830}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm sorry to say that I don't like this game but hopefully it will get better.

My favorite thing to do is to get on my knees during the \"weigh in\" process causing my opponents to be much shorter and easier to beat.\n\nWhat I don't like about this game.  For starters, for some reason all of the characters tend to stand too close to you often pushng me towards the edge of my playing area.  They need to learn to back off far enough to allow you to throw punches.  I hate that the characters are mute, making the VR experience very uncomfortable.  The physics and game dynamics feel very wrong.  I almost never feel like my punches make contact even when I've thrown a good right hook.  Since the game is so awkwardly silent, there should be added music in the background.  Anyway, I basically believe I'm getting my money's worth and seriously, get down as low as you can when you weigh in to make your opponents tiny.  You will get a workout but if you're like me you'll be angry after fighting a couple matches due to an unsatisfying experience.  I'm hoping this develops into a fun game but it isn't there yet.

The scale of the players is immensely accurate. \n\nGraphics:\nGraphics are one thing while gameplay is a whole different thing. ToTF has managed to settle truly in between these two things as the visuals are fine the way they are. The players have great details as well as the boxing ring.

You immediately raise your guard as you know this will be a fight! \nThis game allows you to do different types of punches such as Jabs, Deflections, Uppercuts and throw straight punches/lunges as well as a sophisticated dodge system which you can combine with Ducking, strafing around your opponent, raising your gloves to guard, but be careful, the side of your head can be open for the opponent to strike, so you really have to managed your blocking, which is great!\n\nThe enemy AI is a work in progress, but at its current state it is polished enough to be called, more than acceptable! They block, move slightly around the ring and adjust to your play space accordingly. Based on the fighter you face, they might have different abilities. Without spoiling the fights to anyone, think about agility, size, force and weight. \n\nOverall, this is a must buy game for anyone, whether they have played boxing before or not.

At the time it was pretty rudimentary and dull, there was only one opponent and felt like I was fighting a stationary log. \n\nDisappointed I put this away and came back and revisited it at update 3 and what a difference. Now at update 4 I'm in a position where I am comfortable to recommend this as a early release \"game\", not because it is the only boxing game, but because its actually fun to play. \n\nAs of update 4 everything has much more weight, like I'm connecting to something and that something is reacting to me, that been a forceful haymaker to the gob.\n\nOf course its far from perfect yet, still a little stiff, but its at a point where its satifsying enough to make it my go to high intensity boxing workout, I'm ducking and weaving and occassionally doing my best Kenshiros Hokut\u014d Hyakuretsu Ken (North Star Hundred Crack Fist) attack. After fighting one opponent I am totally out of breath, what a blast.\n\n\nIn fact its fun to just dance around the easiest opponent ugly joe, weaving and countering his punches like I am Muhammed Ali and be a Boss. Play like you want!\n\nThe game falls between arcade and simulation action,  I have an opportunity to parry attacks and free to punch from any angle, with a sense of physics to everything, Each opponents currently also has a specific moveset and while I'm not a professional I have some experience in martial arts and I can react fast enough to some attacks. There is some level of telegraphing as you'd hoped which is great.\n\nThe play format at the moment is just choose a opponent (who has a particular style) and then engaging in robust gentlemanly discussion until someone kisses the mat 3 times. There is no campaign or real progression system currently besides unlocking a new fighter as you beat the previous (up to 4 as at writing)\n\nThe sole developer also appears to be active and engages with users. Awesome. \n\nSo really liking the direction so far and intrigued by hints of bruises an such in future updates, who doesn't want to visually admire the handiwork of their jumping superman punch???\n", "timestamp_created": 1470636808, "timestamp_updated": 1470636808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24767787": {"recommendationid": "24767787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086785992", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487554843}, "language": "english", "review": "this game was fun, then they updated it and added a new boxer, \"the spider\" i thought to myself \"oh cool, lets go check him out\" only to find out that the \"physics\" (for lack of a better term, hit registration maybe?) had changed so that when i tried to block his punches the game would force my hand out of the way of his and he would hit me, i went back to training lesson to test out if it was just a glitch but no even the trainer was doing it so my new tactic was to stand uncomfortably close to them (as if they arent close enough already) and flail my fists into his face as fast i could, and it worked, overall it is a good game, they just need to change 2 things, 1. the distance the boxer is to you, i understand that there if the boxer is too far away then it would be too difficult to fight them but they are unnecessarily close, and if youre thinking \"why dont you just try moving backwards?\" that doesnt work, the opponent moves around depending on where you are relative to them, and it feels like they move a certain distance at a time rather than just close enough to not be out of range meaning that if you step just outside their boundaries they shift into your face then shift back, and 2. the new \"physics\" system doesnt work, i physically cannot block some of their swings and i sometimes found my glove getting stuck on certain parts of my opponent meaning i would swing only to not see my hand landing firmly between his eyes, look down and see it is stuck on his hand as if a fanfic writer suddenly took over the fight then left again to allow my opponent to swing at me, the first problem i mentioned was still a problem before the update but the second one emerged from the update, once these 2 problems are fixed i can fully reccommend this game to anyone with a vive but right now all i can say is only buy it if youre looking for some new experiences in vr rather than if youre looking for a fun vr game to play, i will update this review once i believe the product is worth youre money and if the problems are fixed or if any new problems emerge that can ruin it further.\n\n1st EDIT: after the update mentioned below i can say that the physics system is now almost perfect, i say almost because occasionally my hand gets stuck but then teleports to where its supposed to be and every now and then the opponents attacks hit me because im too close to my fists whilst blocking but the first problem is still there, overall i'd say its almost worth the money, the physics needs a small bit of tweaking and the ai need to back up a bit and then it will be good, and by that time more boxers would have been added so it will definitely be worth the money", "timestamp_created": 1470609097, "timestamp_updated": 1470686057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24760849": {"recommendationid": "24760849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105589895", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 1234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 23, "last_played": 1516369169}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76ee\u524d\u6765\u8bf4\u624b\u611f\u6700\u597d\u7684vr\u62f3\u51fb\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b26\u5408\u62f3\u51fb\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a", "timestamp_created": 1470581092, "timestamp_updated": 1470581092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24751132": {"recommendationid": "24751132", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982175938", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515130260}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely enjoy playing this early access release.

The added arms gives you advantage to block attacks, I like the new damage system being reduced when you partially block an attack, even using your arms. I was amazed how close to accurate your arms are at, though it needs some work according to the developer but I trust him based from my experience, it looks like it is heading to the right direction. Always remember to let the game calibrate your body to get proper proportions, also calibrate each time you switch the vive to another friend. Heavy punching opponents (There is a new guy who is like a heavy weight with heavy punches) are tougher to block, sometimes it requires 2 hands to block heavy shots and blocking using 1 arm/glove sometimes is not enough. Your arms and the opponents arms react like that of the game Fight Night series where it can tangle at some point but not to an extent and sill feels like arcade. The damage you can give now is based off the speed of your punch, it gets challenging and pushes your strength specially when you are already tired at some point. \nEarly releases feels more arcade, this one still is but with a bit of realism, punches do not fully go through their heads depending on the strength of punch, it can still go through their bodies but sometimes it stops at some point, your arms/gloves might not be where they are but they are just only inches off and I like the feel and most of the time it is on point. Some might not like it, but I guess because it feels different, for those who haven't tried the game yet and go straight to beta, you will still enjoy even with the new changes, they have their equal ups and downs, it is still the same game, you will sweat a lot and have lots of fun doing exercise, this is the best exercise you can get whether you have boxing skills or not. I have some boxing skills taught from my grandpa and if you have, you will enjoy this game more because there are many areas in this game that applies to the boxing discipline, this is the best VR boxing you get, of course you can always exploit the game and beat the guys easy, as they have their technical limitations, part of the fun in the game is somewhat up to you, how you react and move yourself in the playing field, boxers will try this game and apply like they shadow box on real opponent, casual players will just barage the opponent as many hits as they can, if you are a fan of Fight Night series then this game is the closes VR game to that and of real life boxing.\n\nRecommendations\n- Option to adjust the starting point of your arms (shoulder) It looks closer to my head. Or overall manual calibration.\n- Improve opponents reaction when doing sidestep, they look dumb when I keep on circling them.\n- Apply illegal blow warnings (referee warning, kinda) when hitting at the back of the multiple times when playes go behind them.\n- I don't think the body works well unless we have sensors to detect, leaning forward does not work in this game as your body just moves forward like a hanging slab attached to your neck.\n- Maybe tweak the damage system to add more damage when countering their punches and less when opponents expect to be attacked or when they are in defensive mode. In real boxing you tend to get hurt more on punches you don't expect.\n- Maybe try to play with special punches, a charge punch by holding a button to charge it.\n- Add movement to characters to dodge your attacks, duck, lean way and moving back to lure you to an attack or sidestep and move away when hurt.\n- Add player knocked down on floor, not following the downed players body because this can cause nausea, maybe just put a downed players body on the floor and add Taunt animation on the characters taunting the downed players body, this will be more challenging and will provoke the players.

With that said, what there is seems to be pretty good. Full disclosure: I used to do full contact fighting, sorta like MMA but before that became a specific thing, and used at different times boxing gloves and juijitsu gloves. Overall things feel pretty good. You hold the controllers in a way that makes sense for this context. The opponents are really easy, but it gives you a little workout since they block just about everything unless they're hitting or about to hit. \n\nThere isn't that much of a sense of actually making contact though, outside the sound. I dunno if it's the shading/lighting or what but it's hard to tell if I landed something (the lack of animation on impact has this effect as well). Body shots don't get any response unless they KO the guy, but the guys KO with the same animation as if you clocked him on the jaw. The characters aren't the most realistic looking, their physiques are kinda weirdly shapes, but it's good enough. I think the dev should look into the NVidia funhouse demo where you punch the little wackamole kind of things. They felt much more real to hit due to their physics and reactions. \n\nI would like to see things like hit counts, %'s, some kind of indication of whether I'm hitting hard or soft (just base this off velocity I guess?), and better detection of whether the guy is actually blocking my strikes. Basically I'd like that as the player becomes a better boxer all around he's rewarded. If I can throw 200+ fast jabs/round, and target them through his guard, that'd be nice to get rewarded for. The motivation would be there to become genuinely stronger/faster, so you can overcome the tougher opponents.

I can block, bob and weave, counter punch when the computer throws punches (uppercuts, cross, hooks), so it's a great alternative to shadowboxing because you can practice defense at the same time. The blocking stamina mechanic is a good compromise so people dont cheese the system. \n\nHowever, since it is an early access game it is low on content (only one practice opponent and one real opponent), but I am sure the developer will add more soon since he has been very receptive to feedback and quick with his updates since his demo.

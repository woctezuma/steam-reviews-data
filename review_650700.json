Back then the fandom is pretty small, now released on Steam probably bring more people to play this wonderful game.\n\nThe game started as a young woman named Madotsuki, who seemed couldn't get out from her room, the only choice she has is sleeping on the bed. From this Madotsuki will have a surreal adventure through many doors placed in the world which is called The Nexus. Madotsuki will find the power called \"effects\" which make her interaction in the dream more profitable, and can used for some NPCs if you curious what their reaction like. There are many events in the game that may surprise you, whether you did it accidentally or not.\n\nThere's no \"true\" goal in this game, no significant plot and no dialog you can find in the game. You can play it casually or wanted to collect all \"effects\" if you want.\n\nYume Nikki is not for everyone, but if you enjoy the aesthetic over surreal things around the bizzare world like Yume

Those two go pretty well together. Usually. Welp, let's dive into Yume Nikki.\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE: Right from the get-go, this is really what you want to be playing the game for. The atmosphere is what defines this game, and is possibly its only \"selling\" point. Yume Nikki is about a girl who lives in some dinky apartment with one room, a balcony, and a crappy game that gets old after 5 minutes. You've got a bed, though, so might as well sleep. And that's when you enter her dream. From there, very weird stuff happens, and when I say weird, I MEAN IT. This game is certainly not for the faint of heart, since it will make you feel incredibly anxious and sad. The imagery isn't what I would call top notch, but by god it's unique. You'll be seeing all sorts of things in this girl's dreams, scary and strange. Calling the music \"ambient\" would be an understatement, because it will make you feel downright isolated. If you're a fan of how Undertale made you feel, or maybe even those odd RPG maker horror games, then you'll certainly like the atmosphere of Yume Nikki. 3/3\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY: If you've played this game, then you'll probably argue \"but Kaiser (me), this game isn't supposed to be about the gameplay! Why are you including it in this review?\" Well, it is technically classed as a \"game\" in my library, and my official rating scale for games includes it, so here it is. I ain't giving any game a pass on this one. That being said, however, gameplay is obviously where this game doesn't really focus. The controls are simple, and the mechanics are easy to follow. Well, I say easy to follow, but the point of the game is that it ISN'T easy to understand, which in turn makes it work. You can interact with certain things, but most things in the game are oddly useless. This adds to the game's atmosphere, but does no favors for the gameplay. Once again, not a bad thing, but it's worth noting. The only real complaint I can come up with is that the game moves far too slowly, and unless you maybe find a bike, that walk will be your top speed. Also, f*** the maze. 1/3\n\nTHE PROGRESSION: One would think that a game with literally no goal would have no progression at all, right? WRONG. Despite being totally open ended, there is progression to be made in the game. Throughout the game, there are many effects to be had, each one changing the way you look and control. Some are useless, but others are very important to accessing certain areas. Somehow, the game's atmosphere carries the game so much that it really is the only thing that make's you want to keep playing. But you know what won't make you want to keep playing? The health bar. I usually try not to spoil anything, but screw it, I'll warn you: The health bar is completely useless. All the enemies kill you in one hit, so there's no need. The dev couldn't take it out, so there it is. But for some stupid reason, the game makes you think you need health by putting vending machines around the place. Why??? But regardless, the progression is rewarding and will make you keep wanting to explore more of this girl's dreams. 2.5/3\n\nTHE TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: Nothing to worry about on this front. The game runs smoothly, and there aren't any glitches (unless you're a speedrunner). I experienced a bit of stuttering, but that's probably just my computer. No crashes to report, and best of all, no game breaking bugs. 1/1\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 7.5/10\nYume Nikki may not have a stellar score on my rating scale, but I suppose it's because it's quite a niche game; an acquired taste, if you will. Not everyone will want to explore a dream for hours on end, some people have lives to get back to. But if you ask me, it's a game worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1516313684, "timestamp_updated": 1516313684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39446276": {"recommendationid": "39446276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074564565", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 222, "last_played": 1516303985}, "language": "english", "review": "Personally speaking here (I did play the game previously) for new people playing: it'll seem boring and/or dull. simply walking around for hours and possibly just finding 1 effect or some how getting into hell maze for the first time with no guide is awkward. Let alone finding enemies for the first time or the \"seizure warning not included\" events. Even with that in mind, theres something amazing about this game. Bizarre images, getting lost deep inside this dream world, and just trying to figure out simply \"why\" is what really makes Yume Nikki attractive.

I thought that the game was boring and honestly terrible. That was a few weeks before my father died. I went into a serious depression. I had self harm feelings and I was very lonley. I felt as if no one was there for me. Thats when I came back to this game... and I loved it. Everything about the game, the art, the music, the mechanics, everything just made me smile. A real smile, a smile that I had not seen for months, maybe a year. I finally understood the game. I played it for hours upon hours, probably more than 74. The lone atmosphere that this game brings to me never fails to make me smile. Yes the game is strange, differant and \"new\", but if you are suffering from mental illness then this game is for you. If you ever feel lonely. this games for you, if you ever felt like you were not yourself then this game is for you. Really, there is no point to the game. Just walk, explore, be free. There are powerups called effects that one may pick up which can help you access other places in the game and continue to get more powerups. This game takes patiance and to find all of the secrets, all the rooms, and all the effects takes time but if you enjoy the game, that time fades away like nothing youve ever played. that is yume niki's talent and I love it for this. When I heard it was coming to steam and the dev came out into the public once more, I was excited beyond belief. I have notices there is more lag in the steam version and occationally some slow down that wasnt there before but altogather it was nice port onto steam.\n\n\nTL;DR: This game is perfect for those who love a slower paced game. It is also for those who have things like depression. It's a game one has to take time to understand but it highly deserves praise.\n\n\nSorry for my crappy spelling mistakes, I am not a very good typer.", "timestamp_created": 1516294042, "timestamp_updated": 1516294197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39439877": {"recommendationid": "39439877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062825430", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1516292664}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This game was .:* incredibly influencial*:. in-between its original 2004 release and today!

You know, when times where simple and the internet wasn't as large as it is now. \n   Well now with that out of the way, I personally love Yume Nikki but, as other reviews say, the game might be for everyone. Basically, Yume Nikki is a game where you go around playing as this one chick named Madotsuki and explore her dreams. In these dreams you need to collect these called effects. These can be found in many different ways by simply interacting to an npc or by other special methods. The game has a ton of exploring in it and if you don't know what you are doing it can take pretty long to get all of the effects.

Yume nikki is a cult classic game made by kikiyam. i have not yet finished the steam version but i have completed the non steam version before so far there hasnt been a difference. yume nikki is really damn weird but its not something that i would call a horror game it only has some creepy and disturbing aspects but it also has some normal things in it. the main goal in the game is to just explore and find as much things as possible you could argue that the main goal is to get all of the effects which yes you need all of the effects to beat the game but beating the game isnt too necessary. and the game has a ton of secrets like uboa monoko  Kyukyu-kun and more. yume nikki also has a place called the nexus. The nexus has 12 doors that lead you to different places like the graffiti world for example. Alot of the time a world woud just have some weird creatures with a looping song in the backround and maybe 1 or 2 effects. This is one of my complaints but it is a very very minor complaint. but when you dig deeper into a world the more you would find . Its not obvious at first when you look for stuff usually its hidden somewhere. yume nikki also has parts inspired by mother the first one which is pretty cool yume nikke has tons of nods to spirited away earthbound zelda and more. and i almost forgot the amount of yume nikki fan games dont get me started on how much there are i havent played yume 2kki or .flow ( which are considered the best yume nikki fan games ) because of some technical difficulties which i hope i get to fix. overall yume nikki is one of my favourte games of all time i give yume nikki a 7/10 (: .

Most of the stuff doesn't make any sense on purpose, and you're wasting your time if you want to understand it, which makes me even more confused and I love it. A lot of the effects you get are pretty much pointless but they're pretty neat, and you need them all to beat the game. I reckon there should be achievements for getting the effects and also finding secrets, because there is lots of secrets. I've personally found the Eye Palm Effect and the Bicycle Effect the most useful. There's a remake of this coming out soon, and I absolutely can't wait (it better be worth it). Everything just works because it's just a dream, and dreams don't even need to make sense or be logical in any way. I like the small little feature where to save you sit on the desk and write in your dream diary, which is what the name of the game translates to. Some people think this was inspired by Undertale, either they are joking or being serious, either way no it's definitely not. This was made before Undertale, and also its nothing like Undertale seriously how in the fuck is it related to Undertale im seriously confused.\n\nProbably the best thing to do in this game is to explore, it's a journey of a sorts with no real end, since there is so many things to discover.

The game that birthed the surge in RPGMaker horror games, and increased the visibility of surreal indie games all over the internet. This game started the indie game revolution, as far as I'm concerned, and it directly inspired numerous famous and/or beloved titles, such as Undertale and LISA. Not even to mention the enormous amount of fangames created for it, many of them creative and special in their own right. I will always have a deep, loving place in my heart for Yume Nikki.\n\nPersonally, I think I prefer to play the original fan translation over this steam version. This one seems to have a number of immersion breaking bugs the original didn't (and, I mean, that can be a problem considering Yume Nikki might as well be called Atmosphere Immersion: The Game), and while it isn't exactly a flaw, it's very jarring to see some of the strange translations this version went with. I think they wanted to try and separate themselves from the fan translation as much as possible, but considering those translations are what the fanbase have known all the effects by and called them for 14 years, it's incredibly jarring to see them with different names, and some of the changes flat out don't work, like naming the Flute effect \"Whistle\" when it literally can't be anything but a flute. That may seem nitpick-y, and it probably is, but it just seems odd they would go so far out of their way to make every effect name different from the translations everyone has known them by for 14 years, to the point that some of the names can even be misleading on what the item actually is/does.\n\nAll that said, that doesn't make the steam version unplayable, of course, and the bugs can be patched out in the future. And regardless of whether you play this version or the fan translated classic, Yume Nikki is a game I'll always cherish and encourage others to check out. It's a very surreal, unsettling game, a cold, isolating game, and it will not be for everyone. Or even for most people. But it's an unforgettable experience that paved the way for many amazing games to come, and I hope this steam release helps more people finally give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1516176402, "timestamp_updated": 1516176532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39406602": {"recommendationid": "39406602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025320158", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 72, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 72, "last_played": 1516168228}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful game, but maybe don't play it if you've been having suicidal thoughts.", "timestamp_created": 1516168734, "timestamp_updated": 1516168734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39406264": {"recommendationid": "39406264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198186932547", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1516167023}, "language": "english", "review": "*****************************\nPeople, please, this game is old, it isn\u00b4t inspired by Undertale \nThe girl\u00b4s name isn\u00b4t \"Nikki\" is \"Madotsuki\" \nThis game is excellent, you have to give it a try, but please, don\u00b4t misunderstand things...

One good way to get into the game I recommend is searching up random events on YouTube in Yume Nikki. That would get you curious about the game in uncovering more.\n\nJumping into the game without knowing what to do would give you a pretty bad experience, especially the slow walking pace with the Bicycle Effect missable pretty easily. If you were to play this, make sure to look up on getting the Bicycle Effect before playing the rest of the game blind (if you're new).\n\nI would definitely recommend this game with the described experience.", "timestamp_created": 1516051329, "timestamp_updated": 1516051392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39375010": {"recommendationid": "39375010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016305280", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 144, "last_played": 1515978038}, "language": "english", "review": "A very dark and niche game that deserves all the praise it's recieved over the years its been out.

This was the game that inspired me to take on many other awesome indie titles such as IB, Dreaming Mary, Wadanohara and Middens, with elements of surrealism and/or horror to them. \n\nIf you really want to experience the game blind, here's my recommendation: Go into the fifth door, clockwise from the top of the nexus. Keep going west until you see a bicycle. Pick it up, then feel free to wander around. If you're really stuck or would like to see more of the game's secrets, consider searching for a guide on getting a lamp, a knife, and a stoplight (in that order). Those should get you the majority of Easter eggs in the game (and there are a LOT of them).\n\nUltimately, this is a game about exploration; the feeling that anything can happen in your dream. I'm incredibly hyped for the upcoming project, and fingers crossed that its a legit sequel.  \n\nAnd finally, if you want to know in advance the biggest spoiler in the entire game, hover your mouse over the black squares below.

Yume Nikki is a very special game to me and so many others, and it's a mysteries thats's kept us all captivated since its first version in 2004 (or its most recent one in 2008 to the present, depending on what angle you're coming from).\n\nI have to warn new comers to the game though: a lot of you are probably coming into this from Undertale, which is GREAT, but you genuinely cannot go into Yume Nikki thinking its going to be the same kind of game, or else you're going to be very disappointed. The sole connecting point between Yume Nikki and Undertale is that they're both inspired by Earthbound/Mother, and that's it. The point of Undertale is to showcase the power of kindness and give the player a sense of catharsis; Yume Nikki is a game meant to be experienced, meditated on, and theorized on. Yume Nikki is much closer to OFF in its bizarreness of the world, and played more like Journey, minus the set plot.\n\nIf you're a person who plays games solely to experience the story, it's probably going to be hard to get through Yume Nikki, a game with only bare-bone hints of a plot and no sense of direction. But I assure you, it's worth the time and wandering and exploration--if it wasn't, it wouldn't be on Steam now! Yume Nikki is a shining jewel in the RPG Maker games' history, and everyone who's played and loved it all these years are super excited you're here for the ride. c:", "timestamp_created": 1515961641, "timestamp_updated": 1515961641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39348314": {"recommendationid": "39348314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055205101", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 108, "last_played": 1515771836}, "language": "english", "review": "The best part about this game are the fucking idiots falling for the bait reviews.", "timestamp_created": 1515961292, "timestamp_updated": 1515961292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39347867": {"recommendationid": "39347867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094597254", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 1515866373}, "language": "spanish", "review": "KADOKAWA IS EVIL", "timestamp_created": 1515960040, "timestamp_updated": 1515960040, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.418027", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39347539": {"recommendationid": "39347539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107789041", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 24, "last_played": 1515966016}, "language": "english", "review": "So, so happy to see one f my fave games finally on Steam!

Now to the actual review.\n\n  Yume Nikki was one of the most popular rpgmaker games during the hype of that niche genre. Along with games such as IB, this game had a pretty good cult starting 14 years back. It is incredibly atmospheric and incredibly polished for the kind of game it was and quite frankly it also has some decent memories from back then involving scaring the shit out of one of my close friends at 3 A.M in the morning due to me screaming a bunch at a certain scene, you know who you are. \n   \n  This is a game that I can guarantee you will enjoy if you like a good atmosphere as well as exploring a really surreal world, this game is quite frankly perfect for what it is. Instant 10/10 and will 100% it again.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515949910, "timestamp_updated": 1515949910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000",

There are effects to collect from various objects and creatures, ranging from purely cosmetic ones to others required to find some of the game's secrets. There is an ending if you collect every effect in the game, but I doubt anyone could find them all without getting bored of the game first. The dream world is confusing to navigate due to its size, looping screens, and a lack of landmarks to know where you've been. This, combined with how obscure a lot of the requirements to get effects are, makes me wonder why top reviews recommend playing this game blind as this game practially requires a guide. Unfortunately, getting lost in Yume Nikki is common and doesn't reward the player enough to justify the long sections of running around the same areas looking for something new, making the game extremely boring to me. I don't recommend Yume Nikki, but its free so there's nothing stopping you from giving it a shot and seeing if you can tolerate it.\n\n[spoiler]I predicted the game's ending instantly by thinking \"Why would the game have a balcony if the entire game is spent in be-[b][i]oh no[/i][/b][/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1515914190, "timestamp_updated": 1515914190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39330902": {"recommendationid": "39330902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802291121", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 114, "last_played": 1515992191}, "language": "english", "review": "super interesting game, i love the graphics and all the effects are unique in their own way, madotsuki is adorable too which is a plus.", "timestamp_created": 1515913635, "timestamp_updated": 1515913635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39330623": {"recommendationid": "39330623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121167469", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1515862959}, "language": "english", "review": "i sware to god if you say its a undertale ripoff or what ever i just want to say that this came out long before undertale ok so just stop.", "timestamp_created": 1515912484, "timestamp_updated": 1515912484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604830", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39329640": {"recommendationid": "39329640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279159076", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1515907455}, "language": "english", "review": "ok, first this game is not for everyone, it does not hold hands, it does not have crazy action or dramatic scenes, simlpe put this game is an experience, an experience that even vetern players find new parts of. if you like RPG maker horror games (this game kickstarted it) , you'll probably love it. if you expect silent hill or resident evil, you be disappointed.  \n\nalso i played the original so be thankful setup is a thousand times easier (you have to download fonts and programs and ahggg)", "timestamp_created": 1515908799, "timestamp_updated": 1515908799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39329558": {"recommendationid": "39329558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178099970", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1515908860}, "language": "english", "review": "hmm if you will have to look some stuff up. i just wanna get that out the way. \n\nanyway this game is interesting its been on steam for a week yet has been\nlocal else where for a long while.this game will make you feel nervous yet\ni would'nt really say scared. this game is one of those types you are suppose \nto be in for the lore mostly.there is no flat out full story.to me it was spine\ntingling. the game is like a chore really. its not made to be fun really.\nit was made for a hidden story waiting to be unfolded.people make odd \ntheories and other but thats what made it fun for me going into this game.\ni always hade the same question\"whats that\". just confusion and wonder\nis half of this game.\n_______\nside notes  l -

As you explore different \"realms\" you gain new dream effects that can help guide you or are just there for fun; the game gets more interesting and intriguing as you dive deeper into dream worlds, the stuff you will see will make you question a lot of things.

It introduced me to surrealism and kicked my love for atmosphere from a subconscious enjoyment to a conscious and knowing adoration for experiencing things. Playing Yume Nikki isn't playing a game like you would another game; the \"game\" is more akin to some kind of program that lets you explore areas and soak up dark, surreal atmospheres and see lots of unique designs and areas. Most walking simulators only give you a hallway, but Yume Nikki is incredibly generous and gives you 12 doors. I won't say what lies beyond those doors or what you're going to encounter, but know this; if you're the kind of person who'll get into this game, you probably won't finish it as the same person who started it. Even if you're not some atmosphere/experience junkie like I am you can still have a comfy time exploring and seeing all of the various areas just playing the game. If you decide to give Yume Nikki a try, I hope you have a great time with it. Know that you should probably be a patient person who's fine with roaming and seeing for a change from action and fighting; if you want something with intense gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nYume Nikki isn't a horror game. Rather, it's a pretty uncomfortable game that you can, with time, learn to find comfortable. Don't go in expecting something that some YouTuber is going to scream about, go in expecting a strange, dark, isolated explorable museum of sorts, because that's honestly what you're going to get. Again, I hope you have as good of a time with this game as I've had with it, because to me it's one of the most legendary classics of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1515889320, "timestamp_updated": 1515889320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.735070", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39324299": {"recommendationid": "39324299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035206296", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515889053}, "language": "english", "review": ">it was all a dream\nwtf i hate yummy nikki now", "timestamp_created": 1515889073, "timestamp_updated": 1515889073, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.171588", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39324287": {"recommendationid": "39324287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130654128", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 772, "last_played": 1516126930}, "language": "turkish", "review": "This game manages to be scary without being scary.

the Nexus) but takes a lot of time, exploration, some problem-solving, and a bit of luck. There are a lot of events (mostly easter egg type things not necessary to completing the game) that happen randomly and/or under specific circumstances. The entire game is unsettling, but not too stressful because there's no way for you to get hurt/die or lose any progress like the effects you've collected. The worst that can happen is you get lost or stuck, but you can always wake up and start again. You can do everything at your own pace and intepret as you please.\n\nAbout Waifu Hunter's curator review: the game is NOT inspired by Undertale; Yume Nikki was originally released 2004 whereas Undertale came out 2015, so if anything, Undertale was inspired by Yume Nikki. The girl's name is Madotsuki, \"yume nikki\" is Japanese for \"dream diary\" The gender identity theory is a very loose theory about the meaning behind the game, but it's no more valid than any other theory.

It comes from a time before youtube and steam became popular, where it wasn't that easy to post a bunch of hints everywhere.  You even had to search it out and download it yourself.  It suffers from being compared to newer games which have adapted to the times.\n\nElaboration:\n\nThis is not a game for people who want action.  For people who want clarity.  And since it was released so many years ago, people are bound to compare it to younger stuff that they're familiar with.\n\nThere were some reviews saying that this game has \"bad graphics.\"  Sure.  There have been so many RPG Maker clones at this point that Yume Nikki doesn't really stand out visually.  While there is an enormous variety of visual content, someone just starting the game probably won't see enough of it to realize that.  \n\nYume Nikki was a pioneer because it was released just early enough before places like Steam really exploded.  You had to find it, download it yourself, and wander about with few places offering hints.  Gamefaqs was a lot bigger then, with little competition.  In those days it was much easier to get immersed in a game because you had so few people talking about it elsewhere, at least compared to now.\n\nBut for the most part, it's nonviolent.  Unfortunately, there's still violence in this game.  You can go on a horrible killing spree against creatures that won't do anything to you.  The ones that are \"hostile\" just teleport you someplace.  In that sense this game is probably appropriate for everyone.....  If it weren't for the horrific vibes and the blood and the surrealism.\n\nSure, I suppose I'm giving this a positive review out of nostalgia.  It's been so long that I've forgotten where the effects even are, so it's time for wanderin'.

Like LSD dream simulator, it was quite niche and unknown on release. Also in dream simulator a lot of the envioerment is interactive, running in to a wall or falling in a hole can take you to a whole different world and quite possibly a different dimension. yume nikki is no different. you open a door in this dream world thing, and you just go further in to the rabbit hole by interacting with bizaree life forms and finding different effects to use. my favorite aspect of it is how it captures a dream state or psychedlic state, what have you. it's unstable, random and absurd. that's what attracts me to this subject, whether it's movies like waking life or inecption or games like dream simulator and antichamber. however now that it's on steam I imagine a fanbase will grow (god forbid the fandom grow at the lengths of undertale smh.) but yes, it is a scenic game more about exploration rather then one fixed objective or mission, so if you like games with a steady objective or some form of combat, this one may not be for you.

Dialogue? None. Story? Not really. So, what's there to expect? Easy; an unsettling journey through the dreams of Madotsuki, an apparent isolated young girl who refuses to leave her apartment when in reality. There's many interpretations of this game, yet I think only you can come up with one, since everyone's bound to have a different experience. There's nothing about this game that I can say I dislike, it's such a unique experience that truly is the start of creepy and subliminal RPGs. (and no, it was NOT inspired by Undertale. Yes, Uboa looks like W.D. Gaster. But if you just do your research, you'll know that Yume Nikki came first. Yume Nikki was available to the public way before the Steam release. It was originally released in 2004) But anyway, I definitely recommend this game, which is so unique and special that it's definitely worth a try.

own investigations and a lot of sweet dreams about this game, but I'm no fanboy, not of this or of any other thing, I just love it and my personal record was beating it in about 46 minutes with no guide.\n\nNostalgia aside, this game is good for anyone that likes bizarre exploring, being thrown in a world where you can discover many things that could be related to the mind of the developer or the actual character you are playing as, that's because you really are exploring Madotsuki's (protagonist) dreams, endless worlds looping themselves and linking to each other in many ways, some of them are gate to one or even more different dreams, there are hidden events that could be seen as nightmares and many things to discover, this being said, it sounds like a master piece and it is a master piece and a cult game, so let's go to the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Simple controlling.\n-Awesome ambientation (soundtrack).\n-Colorful scenarios as well as deep and dark mixtures (Graphic ambientation).\n-Lots of secrets and exploration.\n-Lots of fan theories.\n\nCons:\n-No actual story (most of it is fan based theories).\n-No dialogs.\n-Not as newbie friendly as it looks like (must play with a guide).\n-Too cryptic at some points.\n-Harsh critics are not welcomed by fans (really guys, there are people that play a lot of games).\n-People thinking this game was inspired by Undertale (do your reserch guys, I think you can still find kikiyama's original game).\n\nSummary:\nEven if it's a master piece and has a design that goes far beyond masterful and complex, the game is not lacking on an interesting ambientation, but is lacking on welcoming the casual gamer, it fails on making itself interesting given that it doesn't have a motivation inside the game to keep looking around, your goal is only getting the effects and watching the ending, sounds boring, but it's not like that for some others, because looking for the effects is only the main game, but there are lots of things to explore, like the Madotsuki ghost, Uboa, the Toriningen picnic, and much much more hidden stuff that only the more curious and sometimes stubborn can find on their own and that's why I do recommend this game to the ones that are curious and want to explore a wonderful universe.", "timestamp_created": 1515818047, "timestamp_updated": 1515818047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

This is recommended for people with the patience and time to wander a surreal world freely, and ponder the imagery within.\n\nFor those not in the know, Yume Nikki (translated to English as \"Dream Diary\") is an atmospheric horror/exploration game revolving around the mysterious shut-in, Madotsuki. Since they refuse to leave their room for... whatever reason, players instead explore the expansive realm of Madotsuki's dreams. The dream world begins with huge, often abstract worlds with loose themes. But if you explore further, you can find the more interesting bits like sewers filled with strange artwork, a vast sea of pink water, and a monochrome wasteland filled to the brim with surreal creatures and objects.  There's even a world styled after old NES games. Scattered around these worlds are \"effects\", powers that change Madotsuki's appearance, and gives them some small ability to change the world around them. They're mostly a means to an end... rather, THE end.\n\nThe true goal of this game is... well, up to the player. The player decides how far they want to go, and in which direction. The beauty of it is how it emulates real dreaming: All of the game's worlds open up and sort of bleed into one another with no regard for continuity. And for all it's bizarre locales, not once will an NPC show up and explain what it's meant to be: again, the game places all the interpretation up to the player. As such, you'll find people discuss to no end what every bit of the game's content means to them personally. \n\nIt's not a \"2deep4u\" game and it's not trying to show off how much philosophy it knows.

There isn't much to spoil, and that is because the experience this game give you is not something that can be spoiled, unless it truly wasn't for you in the first place. You walk around aimlessly in very big rooms with seemingly random landmarks, and see what you find. That is the whole game. Maybe what you find is one of the twenty or so effects, powerups which are the only thing you have to kind of tell how much \"progress\" you've made through the game. You can google their location if you want, too. They are kind of important, but they're not the entire game, so spoiling that won't actually spoil the game. You can google the ending, too. I personally think it's better enjoyed when you get to it by yourself, but again it won't spoil the game. The game isn't about a story, or at least not in the way games usually are. So what is this game about? I said it already, it's about walking aimlessly through very big rooms and seeing what you find. No I'm not joking. Yes this is the entire game. That \"Walking Simulator\" tag is very serious, too. So what's the appeal in a game about just walking around aimlessly? Well, that's what I mean when I say this game is not for everyone. If you rather a game where you are... well, doing literally anything besides just walking around, then this is probably not the game for you. That's ok, you aren't missing out on much if you weren't going to enjoy the game anyway, some people like their games to have... well, gameplay. But for the few that stayed, this game is about to blow your hecking mind.... if you are into the thrill of exploring a mostly empty wasteland, that is.\nAs far as the atmosphere goes, this game does an excellent job of getting you \"in the mood\". The music, the level design, just about everything feels the way it was intended to. And thats a very specific choice of words there, because the way it was intended to feel is not necessarily the way you would want it to feel. \n\nThis game feels like a dream.\n\nReally, though. Let's play a game: when you are feeling sleepy tonight, turn the game on and start playing until you fall asleep. And then, the next morning, try and remember which parts of your memories were part of the game, and which you were dreaming. It's at it's most obvious there, something I discovered playing more nights than I should have as a child, then regretting it at school the next day. But even when you aren't about to pass out, this game legitimally feels like a dream. It's non-sensical, it's weird, it's funny and a bit disturbing. It seems to last forever when only a few minutes have passed, and before you noticed it you've been playing all night. It seems like it doesn't mean nothing and it's just a random cluster of things, but it also makes so much sense, that you might actually be onto something here. And people did, oh golly if they did, because it just leaves you with that feel that all this randomness is actually a facade for a deeper meaning. And the more you play it, the more you realize, it's just like a dream. I actually have troubles remembering all the time i spent on this game as a child, because all the memories I have are so blurred, and I'm almost 100% sure it's not because I played exclusively at night, when I should be sleeping. No no, because I've played now, although a significantly smaller amount of time, and it feels the same, even though I literally was playing last night. Or was it the night before? See, I can't tell, it's all just too blurred to tell accurately.\n\nNow, that might just be me, or maybe you dont get that feeling. Again, this isn't a game for everyone, and not everyone has the amount of time and willingness to go through this. If you don't particularly enjoy being asleep, this game is going to bore you to death, because, well, it's literally making you fall asleep, or at least it's giving you the feeling that you are. But if you are willing to go in, to get lost in literally nothing, to stare at your screen as it spews a bunch of colors and as your headphones make a bunch of noises and to find yourself having a blurred memory about it the next day, then this game, this game right here, is going to blow the everloving hell out of your mind.\n\n\n\nAnd it's hecking free.", "timestamp_created": 1515802380, "timestamp_updated": 1515802380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.868240", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39294276": {"recommendationid": "39294276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029249712", "num_games_owned": 1015, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 177, "last_played": 1515811959}, "language": "english", "review": "So I assume the sequel to this is actually on the way?

I played this game around 2-3 years ago and I loved it. This game is incredibly important, it is the first game I know of to use rpg maker game for something other than, well an rpg. It was a game that began (as far as I'm aware after brief research)  a generation of rpg maker horror games, such as Ib, The Witch's House, and Mad Father. showing that rpg maker could be used for more than rpgs (ironicly) it could be used to tell stories  and for horror. This game also spawned an absurd amount of fan games, some of the more notable ones are .flow and Yume 2kki.\n\nNow onto the game itself, the game follows the dreams of a girl named madotsuki, a girl who never leaves her room, for unknown reasons. The girl never speaks, but we learn so much about her through the show don't tell prinicple ( this game is the embodiment of that imo) we see her fears, her memories, places from her past, people or things improtant to her. all without any dialouge at all. Due to the nature of this game nothing is set in stone, so who you think Madotsuki is, is your conclusion to draw. Theres something relateable about walking through a dream, I'm certain that Madotsuki has fears the player can relate to. what those fears may be I won't say because 1. I don't remember much about this game besides the general ideas and how good it is and 2. I want you to find them yourself. \nWe all have reasons to fear going outside.\n\nthe gameplay is quite straight forward, you walk around and see the sights. The \"goal\" of the game is to find all the \"effects\", items that give madotsuki more actions. ( I would recomend finding the bike effect as soon as possible by looking up it's location as it allows you to move much faster, therfore allowing you to see more, more quickly.) Certain effects are required to go deeper into madotsuki's dream. and the deeper you go the more intresting it gets.

In a nutshell, it is an RPG Maker game with an emphasis on exploring weird places and collecting items. I will straight away admit that this is NOT a game for everyone. It's a game that rewards those with patience and persistence, not those seeking immediate gratification or a linear story.\n\nThe premise is that you're a girl simply called Madotsuki (\"windowed\") and you have the ability to traverse mysterious and bizarre dreamscapes. Along the way, you will encounter some dark imagery and hideous creatures. Your main goal is to collect 24 items called Effects, which changes Madotsuki's appearance and even grant her certain abilities. You may also explore more of the worlds to discover some interesting easter eggs.\n\nOne of the game's most notable traits is its lack of narrative. There is no dialogue to speak of and we don't know why Madotsuki sees the strange things in her dreams. Nearly everything we encounter is entirely up to player interpretation. All we can do is observe and discuss.\n\nThe game's cult status inspired more RPG Maker games with a similar premise and game mechanics, such as .flow and Yume 2kki (both of which I highly recommend if you love Yume Nikki). It also inspired indie developers Toby Fox (Undertale) and Dan Salvato (Doki Doki Literature Club!) due to its unique imagery and mysterious themes.\n\nI have written a full review of this game back in 2016. Follow this link if you're interested in reading: http://breakingcanon.com/yume-nikki/\n\nPersonally, I consider Yume Nikki to be a work of art. The game's themes of isolation, confusion and distress struck a chord within me, as they did with many others.

It's very unique for an rpgmaker game. Very experimental, and calming. Lots of nice music and interesting visuals, starring obvious influence from things like paracas art, the MOTHER games...\n\nDon't expect fighting and such like an rpgmaker rpg game would have. This is very much about exploration and the theories in your head you can create from your encounters around a strange world. It is NOT a typical rpg, but created on an engine originally intended for them. Not much for action except for outrunning certain enemies, but if you enjoy dreamlike environments it's worth a check out for being free. \n\nThe game revolves around Madotsuki, a girl who has become rather hermetic... She takes refuge in her dreams and in each door to these worlds, you can discover a certain power that can aid your journey to discovering new places. These powers can interact with some of the creatures you might find.\n\nVery happy to see this be on Steam and hope there's more exciting things to come!", "timestamp_created": 1515779451, "timestamp_updated": 1515779451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549180", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39286522": {"recommendationid": "39286522", "author": {"steamid": "76561198278764008", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 338, "last_played": 1515911572}, "language": "english", "review": "Yume Nikki (dream diary) is an odd experience.

thougth: \"it's a bit scary don't you think ?\"\nBut after some hours playing my conception changed. . . \nIt's a sad game.\nYou can interpret it with so many feels and found so many sad elements.\n\nIt's a game to look to the background (literally) and to go into dispear when you find a new element, Like a ziper's pants door with a malicious \"snake\" behind, where Madotsuki wake up without your agreement.\n\nIt's wonderfull to see how many games were inspired by Yume nikki and it's wonderfull see it being revived in Steam now.\nI hope it gains the sucess it deserves.\n\nThanks

The events that happen and the things you see in this game are so bizarre and often disjointed with the rest of the game that every area feels like something new.\nThere's a very particular feeling to this game. The music is entirely seamless loops, often around two seconds in length. You'll often find yourself walking around an area with no idea where you are in relation to the rest of the world, with the edges of the screen acting like some sort of obscuring fog. These design choices are odd, and mean that you really do need patience to enjoy this game - but you will definitely feel like you're walking endlessly in a dream, lost in the layers of doors that can lead you anywhere. As it's been put before, no other game has so closely recreated the feeling of being in a dream.\nThere's also a definite air of mystery about this game. Its creator never says a word about anything and there's no dialogue in this game whatsoever. Your mind will fill in all the gaps. Interestingly, the event that's broken this sensation most was this game's recent rerelease for Steam, and the announcement of a new project from the creator.\n\nI definitely recommend Yume Nikki.

Il gioco si pu\u00f2 completare in meno di due ore, ma dato che la sua caratteristica principale \u00e8 il disorientamento, le ore che dovrete dedicarci potrebbero aumentare esponenzialmente.\n\nIl gameplay di Yume Nikki consiste SOLO nell'esplorare il mondo dei sogni nei panni di Madotsuki, la protagonista del gioco.\nNon ci sono combattimenti, non ci sono dialoghi, non ci sono cutscene, non ci sono sequenze d'azione (mi viene in mente una sola eccezione ma \u00e8 abbastanza tralasciabile, mi obbligo ad evidenziarla solo per non essere corretto).\nSparsi per il mondo dei sogni, ci sono pi\u00f9 di 20 oggetti particolari che spingeranno il giocatore a visitare la maggior parte delle mappe per collezionarli, ognuno di questi oggetti potr\u00e0 essere \"equipaggiato\" da Madotsuki in modo da utilizzarne l'effetto attivo corrispondente.\nFaccio un esempio per collegarmi ad un altro punto: una volta trovata la Bicicletta, Madotsuki potr\u00e0 equipaggiarla dal menu degli effetti per muoversi pi\u00f9 velocemente, esattamente come in Pok\u00e9mon.\nMadotsuki pu\u00f2 utilizzare un solo effetto alla volta.\n\nTra tutti gli effetti ho citato proprio quello della Bicicletta per dire questo: spostarsi in Yume Nikki richiede molto tempo, Madotsuki \u00e8 lenta e alcune mappe sono immense, senza punti di riferimento \u00e8 facile errare per decine di minuti.\nLa Bicicletta \u00e8 un buon compromesso, e pur essendo un'esperienza da giocare per la prima volta senza sapere nulla a riguardo, conoscere da subito la locazione di questo effetto \u00e8 forse l'unica cosa per cui vi consiglio di guardare su Internet.\n\nIl gioco inizia con Madotsuki nella sua piccola camera da letto, provando ad uscire dalla porta lei scuoter\u00e0 la testa in segno di negazione, mentre \u00e8 possibile uscire sul balcone, vuoto.\nIl diario sulla scrivania permette di salvare la partita (da qui viene il nome del gioco).\nInteragendo con la televisione, il giocatore potr\u00e0 giocare al semplice arcade \"NASU\".\nPresto ci si render\u00e0 conto che l'unico altro oggetto della camera con cui poter interagire \u00e8 il letto, facendolo Madotsuki si infiler\u00e0 sotto le coperte: dopo una breve dissolvenza si ritrover\u00e0 sul balcone, questa volta con una musica minacciosa, a sottolineare che ora ci si trova nei sogni.\nLa differenza \u00e8 che ora la porta della camera si aprir\u00e0, consentendo l'accesso al Nexus, il centro del mondo dei sogni di Madotsuki.\nIl Nexus funge da hub che connette alcune delle mappe pi\u00f9 importanti del mondo dei sogni, da non scambiare per livelli, il mondo di Yume Nikki non \u00e8 per niente lineare: infatti entrando in una delle porte nel Nexus si potranno comunque raggiungere molte delle altre mappe connesse al Nexus, formando di fatto un loop.\n\nIl mondo dei sogni \u00e8 formato dai ricordi e dall'immaginazione della protagonista, esplorarlo \u00e8 l'unico modo che ha il giocatore per sapere di pi\u00f9 su Madotsuki, dato che il gioco \u00e8 privo di qualsiasi spiegazione o introduzione cinematica.\nYume Nikki \u00e8 il primo videogioco con questo tipo di storytelling, in cui viene raccontato il passato e il carattere di un personaggio senza utilizzare parole ma mostrandone i sogni e i pensieri, lasciando all'interpretazione del giocatore il resto.\nPur essendo un gioco relativamente breve, Yume Nikki \u00e8 riuscito a far parlare di s\u00e9 per pi\u00f9 di dieci anni per via dell'elevato numero di simbolismi e elementi apparentemente inspiegabili che i fan hanno utilizzato per teorizzare sul loro significato e sul passato di Madotsuki.\n\nIl design di Yume Nikki \u00e8 unico, i mondi e i personaggi al suo interno sono tanto caratterizzati quanto surreali, al punto che anche lo stile grafico varia in modo imprevedibile proprio come i sogni della protagonista: alcune sprite sembrano fatte su paint, altre pixel art, altre completamente astratte.\nInteragire con un personaggio gli far\u00e0 emettere un semplice rumore o animazione, altri condurranno Madotsuki in un altro luogo e altri le conferiranno un oggetto: reazioni semplici come queste permetteranno al giocatore di comprendere vagamente cosa rappresenta il personaggio in questione per la protagonista.\nPure le meccaniche di gameplay sono anticonvenzionali: passare da una mappa all'altra raramente avviene tramite una porta, ma ad esempio interagendo con un oggetto leggermente fuori posto.\nYume Nikki riesce a giustificare questo genere di meccaniche poco intuitive grazie al contesto dei sogni, chiedendo al giocatore di sviluppare curiosit\u00e0 e di pensare fuori dagli schemi.\n\nLe tracce della colonna sonora puntano tutto sull'effetto ambientale di sottofondo pi\u00f9 che su motivetti orecchiabili, sono generalmente composte da pochissime note ripetute all'infinito che creano un'atmosfera spettrale, surreale, disorientante, racchiudendo appieno lo stile del gioco.\nLa traccia \"Eyeball World\" \u00e8 assurda, la mappa in cui \u00e8 riprodotta mi turba a distanza di anni e la causa principale \u00e8 appunto la musica.\n\"Monochrome World\" \u00e8 la traccia pi\u00f9 semplice che io abbia sentito in un videogioco, formata letteralmente da tre suoni e rimane la mia preferita di tutta l'OST.\nNon ci sono tracce particolarmente memorabili data la natura \"di sottofondo\" di esse, forse quella che rompe di pi\u00f9 questa regola \u00e8 \"Saving Theme\", una fan favourite rifatta e remixata all'infinito.\nIn generale, l'OST rispecchia appieno la filosofia del gioco: confondere, disorientare e creare un'atmosfera surreale utilizzando elementi semplici.\n\nYume Nikki \u00e8 la dimostrazione che l'idea \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 importante dell'esecuzione.\nIl gioco \u00e8 semplice, anticonvenzionale, grezzo.\nEppure da quando \u00e8 stato rilasciato, Yume Nikki ha fatto sognare migliaia di giocatori in cerca di un'esperienza alternativa, con i suoi mondi grotteschi, personaggi strani e significati celati per i pi\u00f9 curiosi, anche se non sar\u00e0 mai un videogioco per tutti, non ha mai voluto esserlo.\nCon dispiacere, ho dovuto escludere da questa recensione moltissime sfumature e significati del gioco che ricadono nel soggettivo, anche se sono una grande fetta dell'esperienza: Yume Nikki \u00e8 un gioco evocativo, il suo scopo principale \u00e8 far riflettere e interpretare i suoi messaggi apparentemente insensati.\nLasciandosi dietro di s\u00e9 una scia infinita di fangame, Yume Nikki \u00e8 passato alla storia come il videogioco horror di nicchia pi\u00f9 influente di sempre.\n\n-Rikkukun", "timestamp_created": 1515761610, "timestamp_updated": 1515761610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645161",

Yume Nikki (Di\u00e1rio dos Sonhos) \u00e9 um jogo que foi criado no RPG Maker 2003, pelo desenvolvedor Kikiyama, a primeira coisa que eu posso dizer sobre Yume Nikki \u00e9 que ele \u00e9 um jogo estranho, muito estranho, toda a historia do jogo n\u00e3o passam de teorias, mas eu vou tentar no minimo explicar aqui o que eu acho que o jogo significa, baseado na minha experi\u00eancia com ele, em Yume Nikki voc\u00ea controla uma garotinha chamada Madotsuki. Madotsuki \u00e9 uma \"Hikikomori\" que \u00e9 uma pessoa isolada, que nunca sai de casa, isso fica claro no momento em que madotsuki se recusa a abrir a porta do seu quarto, o quarto dela \u00e9 bem simples, tem uma porta que leva a varanda, cujo o c\u00e9nario muda dependendo da hora do dia, uma televis\u00e3o, um video-game, onde voc\u00ea pode passar o tempo com um minigame simples, o di\u00e1rio, onde voc\u00ea salva o jogo, e a cama, que voc\u00ea usa pra entrar no mundo dos sonhos,e ai que \u00e9 o jogo de verdade. Yume Nikki pode ser definido como um \"simulador de sonhos\" quando voc\u00ea dorme voc\u00ea entra no mundo dos sonhos de Madotsuki, e ao sair pela porta do seu quarto se encontra em um lugar chamado Nexus, com v\u00e1rias outras portas que levam a sonhos diferentes, e dentro desses sonhos tem lugares que te levam pra mais sonhos e assim por diante, o objetivo principal do jogo \u00e9 coletar todos os \"efeitos\", s\u00e3o coisas que ao serem coletadas d\u00e3o habilidades diferentes pra Madotsuki ao serem escolhidos no menu, alguns deles s\u00e3o \u00fateis, como a bicicleta que voc\u00ea usa pra se locomover mais r\u00e1pido, outros s\u00e3o in\u00fateis e s\u00f3 servem para enfeite, mas pra chegar ao final, trate de pegar todos, certas a\u00e7\u00f5es suas podem influenciar o jogo acionando eventos especiais diferentes, que te levam para lugares incomuns e personagens diferentes, mas os sonhos de Madotsuki n\u00e3o s\u00e3o como qualquer outro sonho, s\u00e3o sonhos estranhos, e \u00e9 ai que entra a parte bizarra de Yume Nikki, em certas partes do jogo voc\u00ea pode encontrar coisas grotescas, assustadoras e esquisitas, nada que possa te deixar com muito medo, mas pode render um susto ou outro, o jogo em si n\u00e3o tem nenhum dialogo, e n\u00e3o conta historia, isso fica a seu criterio interpretar da maneira que voc\u00ea quiser, eu acho que n\u00e3o posso explicar mais do que isso do jogo sem dar spoiler, ent\u00e3o eu vou deixar essa parte por aqui. A minha teoria de Yume Nikki \u00e9 que os sonhos bizarros de Madotsuki s\u00e3o causados por experi\u00eancias traumaticas que ela j\u00e1 passou, e talvez esse seja o mesmo motivo pelo qual ela se recusa a sair de seu quarto, o tema \"acidente\" \u00e9 algo bem presente no jogo, e voc\u00ea vai perceber isso assim que jogar, tamb\u00e9m tem teorias de que ela possa ser l\u00e9sbica e tenha vergonha de admitir isso, por causa de uma npc no jogo que ela aparentemente acha bonita ou atrativa. Yume Nikki \u00e9 um jogo que eu conhe\u00e7o a muito tempo, e \u00e9 um jogo que me fez parar pra pensar em como nossos sonhos influ\u00eanciam em nossas vidas, sonhos s\u00e3o representa\u00e7\u00f5es do nosso subconsciente de eventos pelos quais n\u00f3s j\u00e1 passamos, e as vezes, eventos pelos quais ainda iremos passar, em um sonho tudo \u00e9 possivel, e com esfor\u00e7o, voc\u00ea pode controla-los, talvez isso explique a habilidade da Madotsuki poder usar os efeitos apenas no mundo dos sonhos na hora que ela quiser, e tamb\u00e9m o fato de ela poder acordar a hora que quiser, Yume Nikki vai te fazer refletir sobre v\u00e1rios pontos da sua vida, mas no final, a experi\u00eancia vai valer a pena. Yume Nikki \u00e9 um jogo diferente de tudo o que voc\u00ea jogou, e pra 2004, mesmo n\u00e3o tendo bons graficos nem nada disso, a sua proposta era bem a frente de seu tempo, claro que um jogo t\u00e3o interessante e diferente como esse n\u00e3o passou despercebido pelas pessoas, Yume Nikki serviu de insipira\u00e7\u00e3o para muitos outros jogos, sendo eles de RPG maker ou n\u00e3o, e tamb\u00e9m gerou muitos fangames incriveis a partir da proposta do jogo, como por exemplo Yume 2kki, e o meu favorito, .flow, tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o jogos que merecem sua aten\u00e7\u00e3o. Yume Nikki \u00e9 muito mais que um simples jogo de RPG maker, \u00e9 uma obra prima que vai te fazer refletir muito, vai te assustar em certos momentos, mas vai te dar uma experi\u00eancia sem igual, Yume Nikki n\u00e3o \u00e9 o que parece a primeira vista, e \u00e9 um jogo que representa muito mais, n\u00e3o apenas como jogo, mas em geral, Yume Nikki com certeza \u00e9 um jogo que merece sua aten\u00e7\u00e3o, por mais que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o goste muito de jogos de RPG maker, recomendo que d\u00ea uma chance pra Yume Nikki, voc\u00ea vai se surpreender com o que vai ver, e ele vai tomar um bom tempo seu, simplesmente n\u00e3o tem como descrever mais em uma simples review, apenas jogue, vale muito a sua aten\u00e7\u00e3o e o seu tempo.

Simple...los sue\u00f1os en s\u00ed, no los haces..si no se hacen depende de lo que hagas...\n\nSi quieres pasarte el juego es 100% obligatorio una gu\u00eda ya que tienes que encontrar 24 efectos y la mayoria estan extremadamente bien escondidos pero recomiendo que explores primero antes de hacerlo ya que si no conoces nada del tema se pone tenso..\n\n\n\n\nConoci Yume Nikki el a\u00f1o pasado he o\u00eddo hablar de el en 2015 pero no conocia el nombre.\n\n\n\nHonestamente es mi 4\u00ba juego favorito no solo porque me gusta el misterio y el RPG.Si no porque me siento identificado con Madotsuki y Yume Nikki ya que soy... Anti-Social,Aislado,Solitario,tengo pocos amigos y no les veo siempre (3 en general),a veces me siento que soy una perdida tiempo,soy un poco rechazado en la sociedad y todos los dias el 98% siempre estoy encerrado en mi cuarto y miles de personas mas sienten identificada igual por esto...\n\nSiempre juego Yume Nikki cuando no hay nadie en mi casa,yo en mi cuarto y a veces al lado mi perro acostado en mi cama mirandome\n\n\n\n\n\nsu musica es a veces un poco incomoda ya que es muy monotona pero es bsatante tranquila y estilo artistico \u00fanico.En fin...poco mas puedo decir muy recomendable si te gusta el misterio y el RPG,todo gracias a Steam y soy nuevo de esto del PCgaming y me encanta\n\n\n\nPerdonen por la biblia o haber contado un poco mi vida es que me emocion\u00e9 y por que puede que el fandom vuelva hacer activo\n\n\n\nPD: KIKIYAMA IS ALIVE 100% REAL NO FAKE + 1 LINK MEGA", "timestamp_created": 1515705053, "timestamp_updated": 1515713447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561594", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39265380": {"recommendationid": "39265380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018627727", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 255, "last_played": 1515713510}, "language": "english", "review": "timeless classic. manages to be spooky without a single cheap jumpscare.\n\nif you're a fan of highly atmospheric games and/or psychological horror, play it and play it /blind/.", "timestamp_created": 1515704225, "timestamp_updated": 1515704225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39265345": {"recommendationid": "39265345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026805484", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 14, "last_played": 1515702660}, "language": "english", "review": "Never thought I'd see this game on here!\n\n[i]Yume Nikki[/i] puts you in the shoes of Madotsuki, a shut-on who spends her days exploring her dreams.

Yume Nikki is an experience that deserves to be had. \nWhether you want to explore and find everything yourself, or you want to follow a guide online and do it that way, maybe a combination of both, Yume Nikki will give you experiences you won't forget. \nEven if you want to.\nThis game is mostly about speculation, finding your own meaning to the way the main character lives her life. The things she might have experienced, the thoughts she has. \nI can't really say anything without giving something away, so I'll just say, play it.

Una guia puede ayudarte, solo busca como llegar a los efectos, en texto sin imagenes o te perderas toda la sorpresa.\n\nPor otro lado, Yo siendo fan desde a\u00f1os de este juego tiendo a mostrarselo a todos mis amigos y... simplemente es un clasico...

There isn't much to say about the game as there isn't really a whole lot to do in the game. The art direction is really strong, and considering how intricate and open the game is you could probably explore the game world for hours and still miss something. You'll spend most of your play time wandering the bizarre worlds via the hub world doors. There you might find items that give you access to abilities and transformations, most of which are cosmetic or just detrimental to you. There isn't any aim, or any obvious aim at least, you're pretty much just left to explore at your own pace. This game is fantastic first time playing, you'll almost definitely get lost and maybe even bored at times, but the next big thing you stumble across always makes it worth it. To talk too much about what exactly it is you see and experience in the game would ruin it, as discovery is where the game succeeds best. This game isn't perfect by any means despite how much I might like it. Your character is REALLY slow making exploration tedious at times, especially when trying to find something new. The music is REALLY repetitive with most songs being about 6 seconds in length and just infinitely looping.

First, let me apologize for this essay of a review; I really don\u2019t know if I can properly express my feelings otherwise. Also, my hours on Steam are not accurate of my play time, as I played this game plenty off of Steam. With that out of the way, Yume Nikki is one of those games that I absolutely love the hell out of, but usually sounds like a bad game when I try to put it into words for people. Basically, Yume Nikki is a walking simulator where you wander in no particular direction to find some items, called effects. Most of these items are useless, and only change how your character looks. It's pretty easy to see why people can dislike this game; with no direction and no real goal, it can come off as boring and can make people question why they're even playing.\n\nSo why do I like this game so much?\n\nThe atmosphere of this game is what makes it so magical. Right away, it gives off a strange, eerie vibe, and as you play and explore more it can give off a more unsettling feeling and can sometimes become slightly disturbing. The soundtrack is almost entirely short repeating rhythms with no real melody, which really complements the atmosphere of the game. The vast openness of the world and freedom to explore tops it all off, sending you in no particular direction to explore. The world is large and the different areas within it are all unique. From the sewers, dark and creepy, to the snow world, bright and cheerful, each area has its own feeling. Exploring the world is fun and rewarding, just for the sake of seeing everything the game has to offer. Gathering all of the effects is the primary goal, sure, but experiencing and interacting with the other features hidden within the game was my favourite part. Walk into the first door on your left, the forest area, to see what I mean. There's also special objects or characters you can interact with that cause something to happen, often called \"events\" by fans. For example, the infamous [spoiler] Uboa event which you get by flicking on and off the Poniko's light switch [/spoiler].\nI'll admit I got lost and confused at some points, and had to look up maps. If you feel the same while playing, there's no shame in checking out a map online to try and check your bearings. You can find a list of all the areas and their maps [url=yumenikki.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Locations] on the wiki[/url]. I've heard that the Steam port isn't the best, with some glitches and crashes, but I didn\u2019t experience any so far. I\u2019ll update this review if I do.\n\nYume Nikki is probably one of my all-time favourite games because of everything I just said, but again it's definitely not for everybody. Some people end up not liking the atmosphere, some people can\u2019t get over the lack of a clear point to the game. But hey, it's a free game, takes up basically no drive space, and isn't demanding.

I say \"horror\" because its has a more unique take than typical genre standards. It is a little spooky though. But it relies mostly on you and your exploration of the dream world. Some places are unnerving, others are plesant, others i would rather not go back to, and some are even really relaxing. Atmosphere is a major contributer to the areas in the game. And yes this does have a pretty good soundtrack, even some of the fan remixes. The basic premise is you are a hikikomori (recluse) girl name Madotsuki and you explore her dreams in a dream world. Each world has a few items hidden around known as \"effects\" that do specific things like turn you into a frog, give you a bicycle, even just have longer hair. There are 24 in all. Some are important, most just to have fun with. Which sounds really boring but i promise exploring these worlds is the best part about this game. \n\nSpending time just roaming around into random parts of the dream world exploring is where this game shines. Each world has its own door, some areas can only be accessed by certain doors. Some are even connected to each other. There really isn't any dialogue throughout the game, mostly its up to you to interpret and explore these worlds. Almost like a create your own adventure book.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a wonderfull little gem. Its not a game for everyone, and its basically a walking simulator with atmosphere. Even if you don't like this game in the end, its one of those memorable and unique games worth playing that you can't really find anywhere else. Also play this game as blind as possible, a map might come in handy later but limit to only that. It could spoil some areas or moments along with the fun of just randomly stumbling onto areas and npc's.

While the lack of any dialogue makes even the smallest interaction with NPCs meaningful, it still allows the game to keep its sense of isolation, even within the company of other characters.

It all just seemed like a dream in itself. Considering this in the context of the game, it's quite ironic but...\n\n[b]Yume Nikki was released on Steam, at long last.[/b] \n\nConsidering I did a serious review for OneShot and I became a much better writer since then, I'm going to discuss this game at great lengths and tell you why you should play this. It's a truely amazing game.\n\n[h1]CrocoKid's Friendly Warning:[/h1]\n\n[b]SPOILERS. AHEAD. It is absolutely best to play Yume Nikki blind! Also, don't look up guides or walkthroughs![/b]\n\n[h1]The Story of Yume Nikki[/h1]\nStory? What story!? Hah! As if this game would ever make any sort of sense.\n\nActually, no, because if you look closer, Yume Nikki isn't just a 'weird and surreal exploration game'. Sure, it's full of many odd, surreal, and downright disturbing and scary setpieces, but if you take into consideration all the things the game is showing you, things begin to make a lot more sense. If you take the time to look at all the infinitesimal details in the game, the story reveals begins to slowly unravel itself. To me, Yume Nikki is a sort-of character study for our titular daydreamer, Madotsuki.\n\nMadotsuki is a seemingly normal young girl living in an apartment who refuses to leave her room. Notice though; If you were to try to leave the room, you'd learn that she refuses to leave her room. It SEEMS like a pointless detail, but it's all the more important. From this, we gather a few possiblities of why she's in her room, all alone.\n\n1. She could've been locked in there by her parents.\n2. She could be a hikikomori, a japanese term used for reclusive young adults who shut themselves away from society.\n3. The most boring option, she just doesn't want to leave her room.\n\nThis seemingly small detail opens up new possiblities, and opens up more questions. \"Why did her parents lock her in there?\" or \"What caused her to become a Hikikomori?\" Once you fall asleep, you begin to learn even more then you ever thought you'd learn about a seemingly normal girl. Madotsuki is perhaps one of the deepest characters ever, because if you think of all the details you see in the game, you come up with theories, and you begin to piece your own form of the very vague narrative of Yume Nikki.\n\nMost of the subtle narrative is shown through symbolism; There are definitely themes of death, murder, rape, pregnancy, isolation, loneliness, and sadness all throughout this game. Shitai-san, the man who got ran over by a car, Madotsuki seemingly and willingly stabbing possibly innocent NPCs throughout the game (but done by player choice), [spoiler] The infamous monster Uboa that might be seemingly implying that Madotsuki is possibly pregnant and possibly thinking of an abortion... [/spoiler]\n\nYou might find a child wearing a snow hat and a brown-ish red scarf in a world of blocks who is invisible. That is, until you try to use the Stoplight effect, and notice that the girl fully reveals herself. Could this be an implication that Madotsuki was very shy around new people? Think about it. This character (when revealed) not only slightly resembles Madotsuki, but only reveals itself with a special effect. Could this mean she wanted to hide away from other kids?\n\nYou may note while climbing a giant staircase that two men are falling from the sky for seemingly no reason. Again, think of the vague story. \"Is Madotsuki afraid of heights?\" \"Who are those two men?\" The game is chock full of subtle narrative, and if you take the time to really analyze what makes this plot so interesting, it begins to make a lot more sense.\n\nIn Madotsuki's 'dream world', you will find many different 'effects'. The 'goal' of the game is to find all 24 effects. These effects help you access new areas, trigger an event, or just be there to be silly. Once you've gathered all 24 effects and set them down in the Nexus, a room with 12 doors leading to different dream worlds, [spoiler] you can view the ending after waking up. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Madotsuki wakes up to find a staircase on her balcony for seemingly no reason. She eventually climbs up, and jumps off it, ending her life in a bloody splatter. The implications of this are quite strong. While we may not know what exactly made Madotsuki commit suicide at the end of the game, there's plenty of possible reasons. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] 1. She had explored all that her dreams had to offer, her 'escape', and jumped off because she was still locked in her room. [/spoiler]\n[spoiler] 2. She was depressed and wanted solace. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] When two monsters from her dreams appear next to the bloody splatter, this might also indicate something; Was Madotsuki dreaming within a dream? Did she jump off to wake up from the nightmare or did she truely die? [/spoiler]\n\nThe game never gives you any direct answers, and that's what makes it so brilliant. You have to decipher what the plot means to you on your own. You're given pieces to the puzzle, you just have to stick them in place.\n\n\n[h1] The Music [/h1]\nThe music of Yume Nikki is quite different from most games. It's very ambient, dark, and foreboding, while at times also being comforting and deceptively happy. Interestingly, most of the music consists of 6 - 10 second loops, but they seem to never get annoying as they seem to lack melody and at times doesn't even sound like music. It creates a very hypnotic and sleepy atmosphere. A lot of the music in the game I could very easily fall asleep to. Quite ironic, considering the game is about dreams.\n\nMy favorite song in the game is a tossup; I absolutely love the music that plays on The Docks, the Witch's Flight event, The Aztec Rave Monkey (it's a thing trust me), and I adore the simplistic and melancholy tunes that play when you save the game and when you finish the game.\n\n[h1] The Artstyle [/h1]\nMy personal favorite thing about the game is the incredibly nice artstyle. It feels very \"EarthBound-esque.\" Infact, on the subject of EarthBound, there's an area that is a homage to the first EarthBound game, MOTHER. The game's artstyle is consistent in it's quality. It stays 16-bit throughout most of the game, but at points the game gets a radically different artstyle and looks almost photo-realistic, which is interesting considering how unpredictable dreams in real life can be.\n\nI love Madotsuki's character design, too. She has a cute sweater, her eyes are always closed, and... d'aww.. She's just so cute!\n\n[h1] The Gameplay and Controls [/h1]\nIn Yume Nikki, the entire point of the game is to just explore Madotsuki's dream world. That's quite literally it, you're just there to explore aimlessly and see what kind of thing you'll find. The gameplay is certainly hypnotic and is especially interesting considering it was made in RPG Maker 2003, and yet it barely features any form of RPG elements.\n\n You press the Z/Enter key to interact with objects, trigger certain events, and other miscellanous things. You move with the Arrow keys, and you press the 1 key to do a special action. Pressing the 9 key wakes up Madotsuki, where you can save your game. Pressing 5 in the Nexus lets you drop the currently selected effect [spoiler] which allows you to see the ending once all 24 effects are dropped in the Nexus. [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nYume Nikki is a wonderous game. I think that it's one of the most interesting games to ever come out, and the fact that there is so much to see and do in the game is great fun in itself. There are some horror elements, and the game can make you very, very uncomfortable at points, and if you're not into that it might turn you off, but overall, the game is utterly fantastic.\n\n[h1]CrocoKid's Score[/h1]\n\n9.7/10", "timestamp_created": 1515622816, "timestamp_updated": 1515623406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509804", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39242269": {"recommendationid": "39242269", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280695193", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1515622810}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5443\uff0c\u539f\u4f86\u5922\u65e5\u8a18\u4e5f\u4e0a Steam \u4e86\u55ce?\n\u9577\u4e45\u4ee5\u4f86\u7684\u7c89\u7d72\u53ea\u80fd\u7d66\u597d\u8a55\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1515622814, "timestamp_updated": 1515622814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39242237": {"recommendationid": "39242237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182856921", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "last_played": 1516164034}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "This game has been my favorite one since i played it 5 years ago.

It can get a bit frustrating sometimes, but wandering aimlessely is quite a big part of Yume Nikki.\n\nAnd if you already played the game, and enjoy darker themes, I highly recommend that you play dotFLOW.

Yume Nikki feels like a window. It feels like something from a creepypasta, this odd pixelated game with its own stubborn sense of dream logic. It is indifferent towards you and how you feel about it. It's meditative, horrible, peaceful, heartbreaking. It'll give you a heart attack. It'll let you fly--sometimes on a broomstick, sometimes without one.\n\nThe game concerns a girl named Madotsuki. She never leaves her room. All she does is play a video game, write in her dream diary, and go to sleep to explore her own strange dreams.\n\nI can't remember the first time I played it. It was almost ten years ago, certainly. All I know is that the game immediately left an impression on me. Yume Nikki is difficult in many, many ways, and it's absolutely not for everyone. Too many of the game's dream worlds are unfocused, leaving you to wander aimlessly in search of effects.\n\nFrankly, I would recommend having a guide handy, if only to find the bicycle and the knife so you can deal more easily with the bizarre, occasionally long-winded level design.\n\nThat being said, the vastness and the bleakness of the levels have positive effects. There's a sense of being overwhelmed by these fantasies, stumbling from dream to dream, never quite knowing what the \"rules\" really are.\n\nThere's no wonder that this game has spawned an entire genre of \"Yume Nikki fangames\" that ape the style and sometimes take the gameplay in bold new directions. Also unsurprising is just how fiery the fanbase can be in their love of it. If Yume Nikki clicks with you, it clicks. And it's wonderful.\n\nEDIT: Originally, I had a warning here about how some technical issues this version of the game was running into. Most of those issues have been patched. The fact that Playism fixed these issues within a single day says a lot of good things about them, and about this Steam version of the game. Excellent job, guys. Back to the review...\n\nWhether or not you're interested in this version or another, I can't possibly recommend Yume Nikki more. It's a gorgeous little gem that has always deserved more exposure than it got, and I hope you enjoy it.\n\nAlso, a gameplay suggestion: there is an adorable blonde girl somewhere in the game. If you turn the lights off and on enough, she'll give you something special!\n\nAnd one more thing--this one a bit more serious. I, as somebody who has dealt with it in the past, find this game to be a great exploration of depression. That being said, certain events in this game may trigger people who have had much more serious bouts of depression or self-harm than me. If you're worried about that, I recommend doing a bit more research on the game before you bite into it.", "timestamp_created": 1515607518, "timestamp_updated": 1515776478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566295", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39236996": {"recommendationid": "39236996", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106559379", "num_games_owned": 436, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1515609380}, "language": "english", "review": "Long before the RPGMaker princesses shined in the indie scene for their amazing stories and breathtaking atmospheres,there was a pioneer who set the exception before the rules were even wrote down.\n\nBefore Aya,before Ellen,before Ib....there was Madotsuki.\n\nNow,after all these years,you can witness her delirium once again,on Steam,for free.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember the process: Go to bed,dream,wake up,repeat.\n\n\nDOORS ARE YOURS TO OPEN.

Its hard to describe what the game is other than an exploration of dreams - yet its so much more than that by itself. Will I have to do Segments? It might be necessary. Lets go with that. But first, lemme get this out of the way.\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Yume Nikki is an exploration game about a young girl with Social aversion wandering around her dreams. The story has the consistency of a cloud, requiring player speculation. Lovely music, Lovely environments. [b][u]PLAY ON JP LANGUAGE (WITH ENGLISH PATCH(?)) AS CURRENT 'OFFICIAL' ENG TRANSLATION BREAKS SEVERAL SFX/MUSIC FILE CUES[/u][/b]\n\nNow then.\n\n[b]Story & Goal:[/b] The Story follows a Hikikomori/Social outcast named Madotsuki. Who hangs out in her room and spends her time doing what every other shut-in does - [strike]Video games & Shitposting[/strike] [b][i]Sleeping.[/i][/b] When she sleeps, she dreams. And Madotsuki is nothing if not a very, [i]very[/i] vivid lucid dreamer. A circle of doors to open up whole new worlds to Madotsuki, and the dangers that may lie in each one.\n\nThe goal of the game is to find all the games 24 - or so - effects and drop them off in the hub for the ending. And the Story? Well, uh. [b]There isn't one.[/b] Not directly, anyway. There's a lot of interesting characters and worlds you meet, some with their names too. But it doesn't actually tell you anything about madotsuki. Maybe some hints, maybe some themes that reoccur. But nothing concrete. So its no surprise things are up in the air and speculation is a foundation for the fandom.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] YN is an RPGMaker game. More specifically, one without RPGMaker 'combat.' You know what means? If you guessed walking simulator, You're right! The main elements of YN is exploration. Go here, to go there, to go there. This is offset by charming midi music and lovely spritework on the environments you visit, and fun FX that you have to collect to win the game. Not to mention the people you meet. Which brings me to my next note.\n\n[b]Characters & Art:[/b] As I said before, nothing is actually explained to you besides basic game goal. And while you'll run into a lot of weird things as per dreams, there are a few stand-out characters. The Pianist Masada-Sensei. The sisters Monoe and Monoko, or the blonde island-dwelling Poniko who really doesn't like it when you touch her lightswitch. Maybe you'll get away with it once or twice, but dont press your luck. There's also of course the Toriningen. You'll know them when you see them, or more importantly when they see you.\n\nEach stage presents it own, bizarre environment. From strange, maze-like disco territories to black and white Monochrome deserts. Not to mention strange squeaky stair fellows and colorful electronica monkeys. If you've played LSD, you'll feel right at home with the stranger cast of odd characters that aren't 'prominent.' And the music feels right and appropriate to each stage.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/PwjOI6riH5s\nhttps://youtu.be/O1MRNeKeUp0\n(Save screen is also a good track, but I cant find one thats not an arrangement or doesnt have a spoiler art in the video. And yes, the ending does matter!)\n\n\n[b]OVERALL:[/b] Yume Nikki is a game about wandering, collection, and learning about odd environments. The story throws itself at you like a box of incorrectly-matching Puzzle pieces with a rogue chess piece thrown in, but if you're the type that decides you need to cut and glue the pieces together with your own imagination: It might be for you! And the Fandom is always active with bits of art portraying their own interests, or humorous animation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyesXcoFOfA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNhphyF74sA\n\nPersonally I hope YN showing up paves the way for other YN-esque games to show up.

Along the way, take in the wide variety of scenery and visuals, and try to find hidden areas and secret events that are hidden throughout the different worlds. Use all of this information to make theories on what kind of person Madotsuki is and what kind of life she lives in, since the game is played entirely without dialogue or commentary outside of \"you got an Effect\" prompts.\n\nIf you like exploration, surreal imagery, and making theories on your own, I absolutely recommend playing this game. It does not cost a thing to play, but honestly, I was ready to spend money on it just to show my appreciation to the developer.

Inside the dream world are 'effects', each changing Madotsuki's appearance and giving her special abilities such as increasing her speed or allowing her to attack dream denizens. All of these effects (except one) can be acquired in any order. Upon collecting all of the effects, an ending can be triggered. The last update was released over 10 years ago, making this Steam release as mysterious and surreal as the game itself.\n\nAs of writing there is uncertainty of the developer's involvement in this release, and it seems to be released to promote a new game set to be announced ~2 weeks from now. The game has had other licensed adaptations such as a novel and manga, of which both have had mixed reception by the English community (as far as I've seen). \n\nDespite the mystery surrounding the author (who is known to us only by alias), the game has accrued a decent cult following over the years. You have probably seen characters from this game elsewhere. Over 250 fan games have been created by those inspired and intrigued by this experience (myself included).  \nOther works have cited Yume Nikki as inspiration, such as Dreaming Sarah and Crypt Worlds. A common comparison is LSD: Dream Emulator, an older PlayStation game with a similar premise.\n\nIt is typically recommended to avoid walkthroughs and the wiki, and to explore the game thoroughly beforehand. It can take awhile to find every effect without outside assistance, and I myself followed a video walkthrough in learning how to complete the game. As such, I am mostly familiar only with content on the beaten path and have done minimal exploration outside of that. There are a lot of things to see in the dream world, I still come across things I have never seen before today. When showing the game to friends they typically explore for awhile before asking me to help guide them to the ending.\n\nThere are actually some good reasons to not approach the game completely blind. First of all, there is an effect that is relatively easy to obtain that increases Madotsuki's movement speed significantly. The catch is that the nexus, the first area accessed from Madotsuki's bedroom after sleeping, contains many doors leading to other areas of the dream world. You're supposed to pick one at random, but I will recommend the pink door at the bottom right to start with.\n\nAnother reason is that having the effects enhances exploration. There are some areas and events accessed/triggered by using certain effects. Given how vast the dream world is, it may be difficult to keep track of areas where an effect was needed to return to later.\n\nI would recommend exploring the game blind, then looking at a walkthrough or outside source to assist in finding the remaining effects. As ideal as it would be to complete the game completely blind, the dream world is vast and some effects can be difficult to find. The wiki is very comprehensive, and the effects page simply says where the effect is rather than detailed instructions. \n\nAn issue I have with the game are the near-empty looping maps. These areas aren't particularly interesting to explore, yet they usually have an effect somewhere in them. There is no in-game way of knowing where to go, and given the layout of these maps it is very possible to miss effects of areas you think you thoroughly explored. There is also a huge maze that I wouldn't blame anyone for looking up a map to.\n\nI really enjoy the sounds present in the game, but I do take issue with some of the background music loops. There are some areas where I will mute the game, such as the block world (nexus door left of green).\n\nApparently this release is of an older version. I believe all of the content is here, but it is missing some bug fixes. There is some missing music and at least one crash I have encountered. You could go download the latest version online, but maybe this release will be updated.\n\nAlso, the game is technically incomplete? No one is expecting any updates at this point (last update being over 10 years ago), but it is worth keeping in mind that this may not have been the envisioned final product. \n\nOverall, I recommend trying this out. It isn't perfect and is fairly dated, but is certainly worth experiencing.", "timestamp_created": 1515604543, "timestamp_updated": 1515616592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39235930": {"recommendationid": "39235930", "author": {"steamid": "76561197962508536", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "last_played": 1515994496}, "language": "english", "review": "I've owned this game through a free downloadable website called Madotsuki's Closet, it's been almost 14 years since my first playthrough of the game when I was only 5 years old. I've played now and then ever since, it is truely a facinating game  that bewilders many who play it. I personally believe that it is a masterpiece, but to be honest it's not for everyone in terms of gameplay. It's very atmospheric, a huge exploration game that is an underground cult classic. Some people who like objectives in games may not like this game as much, as the objectives in Yume Nikki are not clear unless you go to the Yume Nikki Wiki. But this is my opinion on the game, it is a masterpiece and I will keep playing this game for years to come.\n\nWARNING DON'T LOOK UP HOW TO PLAY OR LOOK AT GUIDES.\nYou'll ruin the experience of exploring Madotsuki's dreams!

I was aware of the game's existence and had been interested in it for a while but I couldn't be arsed to get it to work. Now, that issue is nonexistent. The game's originally in Japanese but the Steam version comes with an English patch built in, which also saves some time and hassle.\nAs for the game itself, it's a hit or miss. The gameplay is focused on exploring mysterious, cryptic worlds, finding \"effects\" in the meantime. These effects change your appearance and sometimes give you certain abilities. To beat the game, you have to find all 24.\nThe worlds are often quite confusing to navigate and it can take a long time to find something. Another issue is forgetting what leads where, as there's quite a bunch of places to go. If these things ever discourage you, just remember there's no shame in looking things up. There's a wiki that covers pretty much everything, and I'm sure there'll be some Steam guides on it as well now, if there aren't any already.\nThe soundtrack mostly consists of loops that last a few seconds. Though they can get a little repetitive over time they set the mood right. In my opinion it's fine the way it is, unless you get really lost you won't be hearing the same song for that long anyway.\nThe graphics are great, as long as you don't mind being able to count the pixels. The sprites aren't lazily thrown together, and every area has its own style which it sticks to.\nLastly, there's a handful of secrets hidden within this game, some harder to find than others. If you've (nearly) finished the game and feel like you've missed them, be sure to check those out before you finish.\nIf you enjoyed this game as much as I did and want more, there's a bunch of fangames out there which you could try out. My favorite is probably Yume 2kki, one organised and created by various users of 2ch. It has a lot of content and is being updated to this day, albeit with small additions at a time. I've spent over 45 hours playing it and nearly 100%ed it, so yeah.\nAnyway, I hope this review was helpful.

Probably one of the best, most surreal horror adventure games that exist, a game able to both disturb and amaze at some of the sights and encounters without relying on underhanded tactics to do so. It also leaves much room for experimentation with the different 'effects' found ingame, some a bit more... pronounced than others. To say it all feels like a dream, or even a nightmare, would be putting it lightly - this is one of the only games to actually play out like one.\n\nYume Nikki is absolutely more than worth your time to explore, even for just a little bit at a time. The game is also completely free to download and enjoy, so the only thing you need to spend is a bit of your time. I wholeheartedly recommend playing with headphones and in the dark to really immerse yourself with the experience. It's had a big cult following for all these years for a reason, and you absolutely owe it to yourself to give it a try.\n\nAlso, the flute player's music is 11/10.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwjOI6riH5s", "timestamp_created": 1515603552, "timestamp_updated": 1515603552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39235584": {"recommendationid": "39235584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079397980", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 124, "last_played": 1515872603}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has haunted me for 10 years.

It's like a walking simulator with great amounts of abstract and concrete imagery which let the player project their own feelings onto the game while also trying to decipher if maybe there's a greater meaning behind this piece, which feels like the greater \"goal\" of this game that otherwise has no clear objectives and doesn't give the player an explicit purpose. Because of this, I think it's better not to spoil anymore, this game is best played blind. However, I think it's best to play it while you have some time on your hands and can fully immerse yourself (like a weekend where you don't have a lot to do?).", "timestamp_created": 1515597344, "timestamp_updated": 1515857548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529412", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39233149": {"recommendationid": "39233149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240704270", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 458, "last_played": 1516271078}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Game, \nnever expected Yume Nikki in steam, but this is an old version of the game without few soundefects for example.\nAll in all this mitght be the chance for this game to become more and more popular...well this is my hope!", "timestamp_created": 1515596559, "timestamp_updated": 1515596559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39233088": {"recommendationid": "39233088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157347604", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "last_played": 1515772115}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Era 2011.

Me un\u00ed al foro hispano de Yume Nikki y me tir\u00e9 horas jugando.\nMe cre\u00e9 un canal de Youtube que giraba en torno a este juego y su misticismo.\nCon el tiempo he ido cambiando, quiz\u00e1 volvi\u00e9ndome m\u00e1s hura\u00f1o y cerrado. Y cuando\nno quedaba nada para animarme, siempre estaba Yume Nikki. Me recuerda que mi vida, \nen comparaci\u00f3n a la de Madotsuki, es m\u00e1s feliz. Ella es una ventana a dos subconscientes:\nel suyo y el nuestro. Parece que no, pero cuando lo terminas, sientes que te entiendes mejor,\na pesar de la tristeza que puede llegar a generar. Es cat\u00e1rtico.\n\nYume Nikki y su desarrollo tem\u00e1tico suponen mucho m\u00e1s que simple terror, o tensi\u00f3n. Suponen la introspecci\u00f3n del jugador.\n\nMi vida no es la misma que antes de conocerlo. Art\u00edsticamente est\u00e1 muy bien llevado, es\nopresivo, de oscuros rincones y descubrimientos miles. No te arruines esta obra mirando \npor Youtube y b\u00e1jatela. Es gratis, por desgracia. Este juego es de los que se merecen pagar\npor \u00e9l. \n\n\u00bfRecomiendo este juego? S\u00ed. Sin dudar. Siempre. Buen desarrollo tem\u00e1tico; algo corto mirando gu\u00eda pero de duraci\u00f3n variable sin hacerlo; directo al grano y con un lore que da para teorizar, y, aunque a veces frustrante y opresivo, cuando hallas un camino, sumamente gratificante. Una obra maestra experimental que mantiene la humildad de su motor. Ojal\u00e1 pudiese pagar el juego por la inmensa cantidad de horas que me ha dado. KIKIYAMA, pon t\u00fa el precio.

Creado en RPG Maker 2003 por un \u00fanico usuario, Kikiyama, el prop\u00f3sito de Yume Nikki es llevarnos a trav\u00e9s de un pasaje on\u00edrico del que no sabemos pr\u00e1cticamente nada. Bueno, m\u00e1s que llevarnos, nos suelta en mitad de lo desconocido y deja que seamos nosotros los que desentra\u00f1emos los enigmas que pueblan la mente de Madotsuki, una so\u00f1adora l\u00facida que permanece recluida en su apartamento y cuya \u00fanica ventana (de ah\u00ed su nombre) a un mundo m\u00e1s all\u00e1 del de unos pocos metros cuadrados reside en su capacidad para mantenerse consciente durante un sue\u00f1o.\n\nLo recomendable en un principio es no usar gu\u00eda. Es probable que termines necesit\u00e1ndola, pero de entrada, lo ideal es dejarse llevar por la inquietante atm\u00f3sfera, fruto de la naturaleza impredecible y abstracta del reino de los sue\u00f1os. Aunque la clave est\u00e1 en la exploraci\u00f3n y no hay ning\u00fan objetivo a simple vista, s\u00ed que es posible llegar al final del juego, para lo cual es imprescindible reunir todos los efectos que encontraremos dispersos por una gran diversidad de paisajes que oscilan entre lo bello y lo perturbador. Los efectos proporcionan objetos a Madotsuki e incluso cambian parcial o totalmente la forma de su cuerpo, d\u00e1ndole acceso a nuevas habilidades (de las cuales, la mayor\u00eda s\u00f3lo ser\u00e1n \u00fatiles en situaciones muy concretas, dicho sea de paso) cuando ella desee. \n\nAdem\u00e1s del apartado art\u00edstico, que es asombroso para un juego realizado con RPG Maker, Yume Nikki cuenta con otro punto fuerte: la m\u00fasica. Si bien los temas son muy cortos y el bucle se nota a legua, aumentan significativamente el efecto del aura on\u00edrica que envuelve este juego en su totalidad. Suficiente para ponerte los pelos de punta en m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n, incluso a sabiendas de que est\u00e1s en un sue\u00f1o y, por lo tanto, no puedes morir.\n\nEn resumen, Yume Nikki es un t\u00edtulo que lleva ya muchos a\u00f1os disponible para todo el mundo y que, por fin, ha dado el gran salto a Steam. Esto, junto al mensaje adjunto en la secci\u00f3n de noticias, puede hacernos pensar que el proyecto ha sido retomado y que Kikiyama a\u00fan no ha dicho su \u00faltima palabra al respecto. Sin embargo, la cuenta atr\u00e1s que podemos presenciar en el enlace adjunto no nos garantiza que no se trate \u00fanicamente de una nueva serie de mangas y merchandising, tal y como ocurri\u00f3 la \u00faltima vez que se dio este caso. S\u00f3lo podemos esperar y, mientras tanto, terminar de encari\u00f1arnos con Madotsuki y su bizarro mundo.", "timestamp_created": 1515594070, "timestamp_updated": 1515594070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39232214": {"recommendationid": "39232214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113848693", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 42, "last_played": 1516334787}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1]Hac\u00eda rato que no nos ve\u00edamos, \u00bfeh, Kikiyama? Nos has tenido en el abandono durante mucho tiempo...[/h1]\n\n[b]Yume Nikki[/b] acaba de llegar a Steam y yo, como terrible fan de mierda que soy, salgo corriendo cual perro baboso tras su trozo de carne. Claro que este cl\u00e1sico no merece explicaci\u00f3n, es toda una superpotencia de su g\u00e9nero y ha marcado un antes y un despu\u00e9s en este estilo de juegos nacido en base al glorioso RPG Maker, tanto es as\u00ed que inspir\u00f3 a tanta gente como pudo y recibi\u00f3 secuelas fanmade, sucesores espirituales y todo un legado que poca gente ser\u00e1 capaz de olvidar.\n\nContar la historia de [b]Yume Nikki[/b] es quiz\u00e1s lo m\u00e1s complicado de todo, puesto que su mera existencia tiene el \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de confundir y, posteriormente, dar lugar a diversas explicaciones y teor\u00edas con sus propias bases y contradicciones cada una. Hay una premisa com\u00fan que se comparte en cada una de las interpretaciones, pero es terriblemente b\u00e1sica: [strike]Madotsuki[/strike] desea no salir de su cuarto y encerrarse \u00fanicamente en sus sue\u00f1os, en donde explora t\u00e9tricos (Y abstractos) lugares en busca de unos poderes que recolectar. Utilizando eso como base, existe una infinidad de explicaciones, cada una m\u00e1s bizarra, sobre qu\u00e9 sucede y por qu\u00e9 sucede lo que dentro de su mente acontece. No entrar\u00e9 en detalles, lo mejor es que investigues por tu cuenta y decidas qu\u00e9 pensar.\nJugablemente este juego es bastante d\u00e9bil, apenas tiene alguna mec\u00e1nica por encima de lo que un t\u00edtulo hecho en RPG Maker de manera convencional puede ofrecer. Exploramos, recolectamos poderes y los utilizamos para \"avanzar\" entre sue\u00f1o y sue\u00f1o. Es terriblemente simple, pero no creo que haga falta m\u00e1s. Y otra cosa que no creo que haga falta es el manga oficial que se public\u00f3 hace unos a\u00f1os, pues arruina bastante el misterio y suelta explicaciones bastante torpes, creo que [b]Yume Nikki[/b] es una mejor experiencia como un videojuego, sin m\u00e1s.\n\nEn fin, juegazo. Es un cl\u00e1sico de esos capaces de reunir toda una comunidad en salas de chat enormes para debatir sobre su historia, sus personajes y todo lo que ello conlleva. No tengo tanto aguante como para poder esperar 15 d\u00edas para ver de qu\u00e9 se trata ese \"nuevo proyecto\".

It's up to you to decide whether to wait for a hotfix or go on playing it!\n\n\nA true and timeless classic, Yume Nikki sparked a cult fanbase that I happily have been a member of almost since it came out in 2004.\n\nExplore the bizarre dreams of Madotsuki, as you wander through landscapes that might drive you crazy, cheer you up, make you slightly disturbed and uncomfortable, and perhaps even witness events you shouldn't have expeRI\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042\u3042.\n\nThe creativity behind the game has inspired a very large amount (and more to come!) of fangames, with different aspects of Yume Nikki, and different interpretations behind the very long list of fan theories of what the original game is, and what the context means.\n\nThese themes include gore, horror, hallucinatory space trips, and the list goes on.\n\nWith no main objective in the game (aside from an achieveable ending screen), exploration and interaction is everything.\nGo everywhere, interact with everything, see it all, make your own meaning of the things you find.\n\nJust make sure you don't harass the wrong creatures, they will surely make you understand why.\n\n\nSit back, get comfortable, and get ready for a strange but intriguing journey.\n\n\n\nShould you find yourself enjoying the game but still hunger for more, I would recommend the following fangames:\n\n- Yume 2kki: The same game, but with a VAST amount of more things to do. \n(Installing the game requires a few technical solutions as the game is made by japanese people. Expect to be patient, and be ready to google errors a lot. I couldn't get it to work personally, but it's in the horizon)\n\n- .flow: Gory, disturbing, morbid, and a little sad.,. Excellent overall quality and pixel art.\n\n- LCDDEM: Bright and cheery, very atmospheric, absolutely incredible music, with a tragic background. Good amount of stuff to find!\n(The creator has for very curious and unknown reasons done everything he could to delete every trace of his game, citing \"he's trying to forget someone in his life\", but you can easily find it with google anyway)\n\n- Yuque: Short and nice, good atmosphere. Rich and detailed events to find.\n\nFleshchild: Very gory, disturbing. Strong focus on manslaughter.

It's been around a long time (14 years!) and remains my favorite game of all time.

Each world by itself is pretty large, and some seem even bigger because they infinitely loop. Quite a few flow into each other, and there are many more worlds than the 12 doors in the Nexus would have you believe. Each world also has plenty of events that can take place. I won't spoil any here, but events can range from one sprite changing to you being teleported somewhere else entirely.\n\nThere IS a definite ending to this game. However, there is only one hint in the game on how to get it, and I highly recommend not searching online for how to do it, or where any effects are for that matter. It'll ruin the experience.

Plus, it's made in RPG Maker 2003.\n\nYume Nikki is a game from 2004, and has grown in popularity ever since. Some even speculate it to be the \"grand-daddy of walking simulators\". While this itself is debatable, there is no question it inspired other games such as Ib, Ao Oni, Looming, and LISA (The First). \n\nIf you've never heard of this game before somehow, you're in for a treat- it's never too late to pick up and give it a try. In Yume Nikki you play as Madotsuki, a girl who refuses to leave your room. You instead explore the wild and wacky world of her dreams, jumping from world to world in a unique stream of consciousness. The entire game is like a massive maze with all kinds of crazy secrets to explore.\n\nIn no way is this a traditional RPG game. Instead of battling things you just.... walk around. That doesn't sound too thrilling or engaging, but it's the journey along the way that really makes it (as cliche as that sounds). You'll find a myriad of special effects you can equip to your character, strange alien type creatures that range from hostile to docile, events that range from a 1/64 chance in happening all the way up to a whopping 1/3600 chance. While the game can be rather inaccessible without the bicycle and speedglitch (the bicycle can be found in the 6th door clockwise, by the way), with some patience and lust for exploration it can really pay off.\n\nYume Nikki is a horror game, but it's not really about scares. It's more about the subtle atmosphere that surrounds the entire thing. The best way I've heard it described is a \"crushing, depressing loneliness\" that never lets up for a single second. There are some things that might make you laugh and some characters that might make you feel comfortable, but this aura of isolation and fear seems to linger on around every corner. Even in real life it lingers, as all you have to do in your room is play an extremely tiring sad game called \"NASU\" on your famicom.\n\nOverall, this game is massively inspirational to me, and I definitely 100% say you should give it a shot. It's not for everyone, but either way it's definitely an experience that hasn't yet been reproduced as well. I think overall Yume 2kki (the unofficial sequel by another set of developers) is a better game, but doesn't hold the same atmosphere. I also find it kind of depressing that kikiyama themself has disappeared and now everything is outsourced to \"YUME NIKKI PROJECT\" which we don't even know if it follows his intent or approval for what the game has become. Mangas have been made, merchandise is sprawling out, it's kind of getting out of control. Either way bottom line, play this game at least a little.

YOU WILL MISS OUT ON AN EXPERIENCE.\n\nSaying that, Yume Nikki is a interactive experience following a young woman's dreams. By sifting through her dreams, you may come to conclusions about the player character's life, or you may find yourself reflecting on events in your life.

I had no fcking idea what I was doing and had to use the Wikia. But then I actually started to appreciate the game for its depth and RNG factor. If there is someone out there that truly enjoys this game for what its worth without having to look online to find locations or spoilers, you have my utmost respect.\n\nThis is NOT an easy game to get into. But once you start playing it, you realise that there is so much to it. The events that occur randomly (fcking Uboa spawn already i cant be fcked to keep grinding that lightswitch) and the subtle horror aspect, exploring the psychology of a disturbed girl and interpreting her real life based off her dreams is all incredibly interesting. \n\nAnd holy shit that ending.\n\nThe music is fucking amazing. Most visual novels or high budget games arguably cannot hope to compare with this game's soundtrack. That's not to say it sounds good, in fact, sometimes it's quite the opposite. But it is so effective at setting an ambience, at manipulating the player's thought processes and inciting different feelings. \n\nArt is pixel art. Nothing aesthetically pleasing to look at but sometimes very effective in what it conveys. \n\nThe only real issue I had with the game is how goddamn useless the Puddle World is in comparison to the rest of the areas. Seriously it's an original location and it seems like the creator ran out of ideas but needed to make 12 doors to complete the circle.\n\nOverall, an incredible experience.

There is no dialogue, almost no \"plot\" of any sort, and no direction.\n\nThat being said, I've been a fan of this game for years, long before this official translation came out. Yume Nikki is disturbing, lonely, sad, unsettling, and scary all at the same time, and it captures the essence of dreams and nightmares perfectly. For me personally, even playing it spoiled, the experience is unforgettable.\n\nPlay it before the remake comes out. You can finish it in five hours, or even less if you look up a guide, so even if you don't like it you haven't invested too much time. It's not exactly psychological horror as the tag suggests, but it has always made me more uncomfortable than any horror game ever could. If you like it, there are hundreds of fangames out there (I recommend .flow, yume 2kki, and ME).\n\nSpoilery Content Warnings: [spoiler] Depression, onscreen suicide.

Its fandom was already running rampart, and ignoring their overexaggeration, I thought Undertale was some underwhelming and generic RPG with dull graphics. But... Not until I tried it myself. I thought I would not struggle. I thought I would not shed a single tear to a game. I thought I won't be impressed. I was all wrong... So wrong... Undertale is truly a great indie title, like nothing seen before. There needs to be more games like it.\nNow let's go to PROS and CONS, shall we?\n\nPROS:\n-Fighting is (mostly) optimal. There will be many parts where its focused on alternative ways of defeating your foe without killing it. It's what makes the game unique. It requires you to be creative and think freely in decision making.\n-RPG - RNG = Undertale; Fighting and dodging mechanics are fair and fun.\n-Although visuals look simplistic and pixelated, they are not as limited as seen. Prepare to see impressive stuff.\n-Interesting puzzles to solve. Even in fights, you have to figure out what is required to spare characters.\n-Quite entertaining humor. Sometimes well-thought out, sometimes just small comedy things that makes us smile.\n-Loveable characters whose biographies and backstories are scattered around the world.\n-Replayability and different endings.\n\n(Small) CONS:\n-Although the game bases on choices, some can feel really lack-luster. For example, killing some characters won't affect too much to the game. Killing or sparing everyone you encounter, however, makes big differences.\n-Hard-to-come-by choices. Some choices can't be uncovered without trial-and-error. Completely new players won't be able to take every tinniest detail in consideration that it will affect the fate of characters, and it can lead to fatal mistakes and unwanted choices. On brighter side, it adds up as a bonus to replayability.\n-Sparing random encounters are very unrewarding and difficult. It's much easier to slay them, as its only way to gain EXP and increase max HP, which will be extremely helpful when wanting to spare major characters by tanking their attacks.\n-Healing items have no limitations. Stacking on healing items will make fights easy, even better, when you can dodge majority of attacks. Even if you run out of healing items, the fights will be almost at end anyway.\n-Bad currency balance and shops. Most of objects in shops can be found for free by exploring, and the OP healing items are really cheap, while the amount of gold you earn is rather big. Then, there are places that ask for way too much gold. I get that it's supposed to be a joke, but its been done more than once, it's not necessary.\n-Useless items. Not counting the jokey ones, many items are just waste of gold and you can complete the game just fine without them. Some do have interesting concept (e.g. similar to in-battle stat buff items and berries from Pokemon), but, I never really seen a reason to buy and use them. Their upsides and downsides are all unbalanced. It's best to just stick to healing items.\n\nAlthough seem like CONS are much bigger than PROS, but that's because constructive PROS might spoil fun. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you try this game if you got money to spare, it can last +10 hours depending on how much you explore and/or replay, and it will turn your night into an unforgeable adventure. One more last thing: Don't let the game frighten you with its 4th wall breaking.

It's a horror exploration game that has you playing as a young girl named Madotsuki as she explores the various aspects of her dreams.\n\nThe gameplay is oddly soothing in its own unique way; you walk around these bizarre worlds looking for doorways that may lead to other worlds, which may lead to strange, creepy or interesting little events, or small collectibles known as \"Effects\", which in turn either help the player traverse the dreams in a much more efficient manner, change Madotsuki's appearance, or occasionally act as puzzle items to unlock more parts of the game. It really does sound simple, but the good part about this is that it's a simple premise that's mixed in with loads of content.\n\nThere's a plethora of branching paths that lead to all sorts of different areas, and with the exception of a particularly aggrivating maze area, they're all pretty fun to explore and interact with. It might seem overwhelming at first, seeing as though the game starts you off with twelve main worlds to explore, but it becomes quickly apparent that the game is extremely non-linear - and with the exception of a handfull of areas, much of the game can be accessed right from the start, meaning that the player can find shortcuts and quicker routes between areas to potentially find their way towards new locations and new effects.\n\nIt's certainly rather slow-paced and not exactly action-packed, but there's a certain hypnotic quality to the game that almost throws the player in a zen-like state of horror psychadellia that is simply unique to this game. The atmosphere is rich, despite its dated graphics, and the game does a good job of conveying the feeling of an actual dream. A lot of the time, one might see something that doesn't make much sense on the surface, but has rather heavy amounts of subtext. Much like in nightmares, the truly scary part of your dream comes suddenly, or without much warning - and indeed, the nightmarish parts can be rather jarring, though not in the cheesy jumpscare sort of way. There's plenty of build-up that creates suspense, and the result is something that feels almost just as inscidious as it is scary, in that the enemies and failtstates in this game pose only to halt or slow down your exploration. Thankfully, its never too hard to get back to where you were, though it makes certain enemies a bit more frightening, and other ones down-right terrifying due to how drawn-out their attacks can be.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, as to be expected from a game made by one person in the early days of RPG Maker. As mentioned before, the graphics can be seen as dated by many, and the exploration can be hampered just a bit from the lack of diagonal movement. Of course, if you can get past these, then I highly recommend you check it out. It's free, it's packed with content - and if you finish the game wanting more, there's quite a few high-quality fangames made in the same vein as this one. It's easily one of the most influencial indie games from the mid-2000s, seeing references and homages in many modern indie games to this day, notably Undertale and LISA. If you enjoy slow-paced, unique horror games or unsettlingly surreal worlds and visuals, give it a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1520488234, "timestamp_updated": 1520488234, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40642441": {"recommendationid": "40642441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355305925", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 432, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518532219}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Sempre Tera um Lugar Especial No Meu Cora\u00e7\u00e3o :3", "timestamp_created": 1520469401, "timestamp_updated": 1520469401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40622955": {"recommendationid": "40622955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310575050", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1520949683}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, this game is very psychological and well made, for a 2000 game, it is perfect!", "timestamp_created": 1520399258, "timestamp_updated": 1520399258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40611762": {"recommendationid": "40611762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194287873", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519510160}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, get a guide, you'll go insane without a guide.", "timestamp_created": 1520357232, "timestamp_updated": 1520357232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40611344": {"recommendationid": "40611344", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082909362", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520269632}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend using the wiki as a guide for your first playthrough.

There we go. A 2004 artsy game made on RPG Maker. Somewhat of a crawling hit. Or is that called a sleeper hit? It's a weird creepy game about weird dreams that our main heroine is having. No dialogues, pretty much, you mostly explore, feeling lonely despite very weird NPCs around. Strange locations. You can barely interact. Made by some person or team who goes under a alias used only for this game, thus who knows em. Ending developing this at around 0.10 version, probably due to getting game into just right amount of finishness while being weird enough.\n\nPersonally, I've found about this game in, I think, 2010? By browsing TV Tropes. Or maybe in later years. It got my attention and I had quite a fun researching various events in the game. Watching footage, reading info. And reading the fan theories. Niccccce.\n\nAnd now that game got on Steam in 2018 I got an excuse to actually play it.\n\nAnd well.\n\nIt's boring.\n\nYeaaaaaaaaaaaa. Slowly walking around in a lot of empty spaces that loop around. Trying to find some things. Not much to do. I guess I could speed up by finding bicycle effect somewhere but heck, if I have to use walkthrough then I am better off with YouTube footage, once again.\n\nReally though.

Cave Story did once it started hitting consoles).\n\nYume Nikki may be a game created in RPG Maker, but don't be fooled, it is no RPG, in fact, it is very barebones compared to most games in general. Not that this is a bad thing, but for those who may be used to having set objectives and story-driven gameplay, I guarantee you'll dismiss Yume Nikki right off the bat as some sort of walking simulator. Truth be told, there is a lot of walking (or cycling as you'll quickly find out) to be done, because the maps in this game are incredibly large. You're bound to get lost pretty quickly!\n\nYume Nikki is a game about exploring the dreams of a young girl, and it's incredibly bizarre. A lot of the areas and NPC's remind me of Earthbound/Mother, to tell you the truth. Scattered throughout the worlds are various \"effects\" which can grant practical or purely visual powers, such as a knife (which can kill NPC's, albeit temporarily) or the ability to turn your hair blond. Finding out the practical uses of effects adds a small level of depth to the game, although a majority of effects are there just for show.\n\nWhile effects are certainly interesting, the main theme of the game is simply going places and seeing the sights. You can use a guide, sure, but that ruins the excitement when you finally do encounter something new.

The game was released in 2004 created with RPG Tsukuru 2K3, the goal of the game is to explore Madotsuki's dream world to find 24 items called effects.\nIn the dream world, there exists a main hub called The Nexus, in The Nexus there are 12 doors leading to various lands.\nThese include Block World, Graffiti World, Dark World, Puddle World, Number World, Shield Folk World, Forest World,\nSnow World, Candle World, Mural World, Eyeball World, and one of my favorites, Neon World. Each of these worlds are interconnected and have hidden paths and NPC's leading to even stranger worlds called deeper locations. There are too many to count, but the main ones you will be exploring include The Docks, Dense Forest, Guillotine Room, Famicom World, The Wilderness, The Mall, Ghost World, Underground World, The Sewers, and my personal favorite, The White Desert. There are actually more than just those, I would say at least double that, but there are so many easter eggs and places to explore it's all just too much to explain here, as well as an insane maze that can take you to these places called The Red Maze. You really gotta play this game to get the full experience, it's a one of a kind game that is just incredible on it's own and I assure you, you won't be dissapointed, just be aware that the entire game is based around exploration and innovation, so don't go about it like any normal game...

Yume lhe entrega um universo de possibilidades, [spoiler]principalmente na maneira em como voc\u00ea conquista os 24 efeitos atrav\u00e9s das 12 portas do Nexus,[/spoiler] e \"sidequests\" (podemos dizer) bastante variada, com mist\u00e9rios e/ou coisas perturbadoras.

Dream Diary) but there are some enemies that can try to stop You from doing so... called \"Toriningen\" (\"Bird people\" in Japanese) which are crazily hard to avoid because they are \"sooo goddamn unpredictable\" in their movements. Sometimes You can be lucky and they won't bother You at all (depending on if they are in the normal state or the lunatic state) other times they can pretty much punish You hard...! by forcing You to reset Your progress in coming very far (by pinching Your cheek on number 9) which means waking up in Your room and have to do it over.\n\nMY OPINION OF THIS GAME\n------------------------------\nI really admire the style of this game, and the music... is okay... to a certain point when it gets rather \"ANNOYING\" because the soundtrack plays over and over and over... and i have to say... I like the concept, to go and find these effects that pretty much is anything... a frog, hat n'scarf and some other things... \nwhich gives You abilities in other worlds (because there are 12 doors in this game that leads You to different worlds) Now I've just listed out what one ability can do (the frog one) and I have only found 8 out this effects...and I'm guessing there are about 24 effects... or something similar like that...\n\nThe reason to why I'm writing about this game without even finishing it is because soon there will be a 3D reboot of this game and I'm looking forward to that one. This game is phenomenal!! Original ideas and mental gymnastics are required to make out what all this is.\n\nit is also very fucking confusing, because these worlds have... stuff...? (not sure what to call it) that You can interact with... and I wonder what the point is...!

Ya que llego la versi\u00f3n de Steam estoy feliz de probarlo, Gracias KADOKAWA. As\u00ed que empecemos con mi primer an\u00e1lisis largo:\n\nEste juego muy cr\u00edptico. (en palabras cortas) durante las primeras horas muchas veces no entender\u00e1s lo que est\u00e1s haciendo o a donde debes ir, pero en los sue\u00f1os en donde se haya un significado adem\u00e1s del propio argumento del que se necesita de nuestra interpretaci\u00f3n para ver alg\u00fan sentido, Ese ser\u00eda su mayor fuerte y lo que le dio su estado de culto en 2004. La exploraci\u00f3n es curiosa, ya que te invita a la b\u00fasqueda de informaci\u00f3n en este mundo, varias veces los descubrimientos ser\u00e1n extra\u00f1os o hasta algo bizarros dejando con ganas de experimentar con los efectos; algunos efectos pueden interactuar con el entorno o con otros efectos. D\u00e1ndonos la opci\u00f3n de re-explorar mundos que ya hab\u00edamos empezado. Plantando la duda de que nos hemos perdido. Esta ha sido mi primera hora de juego ya que me he quedado atascado en un punto en el que no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 hacer y este ser\u00eda un peque\u00f1o problema, Yume Nikki no te deja del todo en claro que efectos o elementos del entorno son interactuables para seguir sintiendo progreso. Ya que me estoy viendo en la situaci\u00f3n de probar todos los efectos con cualquier cosa extra que vea y eso en un mundo de los sue\u00f1os\u2026 Te hace desear que sea m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil identificarlos. De momento esto ser\u00e1 lo que he podido juagar. Sin duda las casi 4 horas me han dejado sorprendido. Esa sensaci\u00f3n de que cada paso que avanzas es tuyo.

and yes, the arrows work fine, its only in the game), making it only posible to move left or right while automaticly moving up. the other bottons for the menu, interacting, cancel, pinching your cheek

served as inspiration for other games later.\n\nEven though there sure are people that truly belive this \"It's an Undertale ripoff\" thing, don't be fooled by trolls that help feeding this. [b]Yume Nikki was originally released in 2004[/b] as a free game you could find around. The release date on Steam is just when it was released on this platform, making it easier to find by the general public.\n\nYume Nikki is a game about travelling through dream worlds, sometimes nightmare-like, while you can find \"effects\" that let you transform into something, helping you progress, or simply are aesthetic. It's your duty to find out what can work where.\nThis game is not to be rushed, in fact most times you will get lost and you'll be tempted to check out a guide. I would recommend you to do that just if you need a few more effects and you are going nuts looking for them. Some aren't obvious at all, so if you see something suspicious go try to interact with it. It can be an interesting experience if you take it easy, so [u]if you are an impatient person looking for action or horror, this game isn't for you[/u].\nAlso, if you like mystery games on which you can come up with your own theories, you'll like it since there is plenty of symbolism and unanswered questions.\n\nStill it's not a game for everyone but it deserves a try.", "timestamp_created": 1518549523, "timestamp_updated": 1518549523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40043338": {"recommendationid": "40043338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328885510", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518522914}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e45\u4ee5\u4f86\u90fd\u5f88\u559c\u6b61\u5922\u65e5\u8a18\uff0c\u672c\u9ad4\u548c\u5404\u5f0f\u5404\u6a23\u7684\u6d3e\u751f\u90fd\u73a9\u4e86\u500b\u904d\uff0c\u770b\u5230steam\u6709\u5c31\u8d95\u5feb\u904e\u4f86\u8a55\u8ad6\u63a8\u85a6\uff01\n\n\u9084\u8a18\u5f97\u548c\u7a97\u5b50\u4e00\u8d77\u5ea6\u904e\u7684\u90a3\u6bb5\u6642\u5149\uff0c\u6c38\u9060\u4e0d\u60f3\u8d70\u5230\u76e1\u982d\u7684\u90a3\u7a2e\u5fc3\u60c5\uff0c\u90fd\u662f\u6211\u975e\u5e38\u7f8e\u5999\u73cd\u8cb4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u56de\u61b6\u3002\u3002\u3002\n\n\u5f37\u70c8\u63a8\u85a6\u5927\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u73a9\u73a9\u9019\u500b\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u4f60\u6703\u611b\u4e0a\u9019\u500b\u904a\u6232\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5207\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1518522939, "timestamp_updated": 1518522939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40039352": {"recommendationid": "40039352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049430211", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518505973}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u5c3c\u739b\u538b\u6291\u554a\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1518506010, "timestamp_updated": 1518506010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502569", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40037570": {"recommendationid": "40037570", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090027104", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518495871}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo extremamente interessante para quem gosta de refletir e pensar, ele literalmente \u00e9 meio cansativo se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o \u00e9 de correr atr\u00e1s de procurar as coisas, jogue e se empenhe para ter uma experi\u00eancia \u00fanica.", "timestamp_created": 1518496118, "timestamp_updated": 1518496118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40037056": {"recommendationid": "40037056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196808233", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 58, "last_played": 1521597727}, "language": "english", "review": "User Plash Six Four has mental issues for liking this", "timestamp_created": 1518493473, "timestamp_updated": 1518493473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40034721": {"recommendationid": "40034721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198445721509", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518480855}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why I like this game so much, not that I shouldn't.

This was originally released in 2002, and is one of the first \"walking simulators\" to exist, as well as being one of the first indie games to gain a large following, if not the first. I'm amazed it's been put on steam after all these years since the creator of the game has not said a public word since the Tohoku earthquake in 2011.\n\nThe concept of this game is simple, you are a NEET who dreams. You walk around in said dreams. If you've ever heard of LSD: Dream Emulator for the PS1, this game has a very similar concept.\n\nI don't want to spoil anything, I think this game is best played blind, but I think what makes this game so compelling after all these years is how the feeling it generates simply cannot be replicated. While you can eventually learn how to explore the world better, there's an element of randomness to exploring. The same entrances can take you to different places, so you'll never know quite where you're going. Events are likely going to play out differently with each trip to the Dream World. Events are extremely random yet somehow make sense, different events can be pieced together to come to your own conclusions regarding what is going on inside the main character's head. This game can be extremely comforting one moment and extremely disturbing the next. It's a difficult feeling to put into words.\n\nIt's not for everyone as the game has vast stretches of nothingness, but I think if you like different experiences in gaming this game is worth a shot, it's not something I've ever seen able to be replicated elsewhere, despite multiple attempts.\n\nThis game technically never got past version 0.10 (there's still a ton of content despite that), so I'm looking forward to what this Dream Diary game has to offer.\n\nBefore you comment on my playtime, I've played the game to completion already years ago, just not on steam (yes, there is an ending, but don't worry about completing the game.

This game is very different than most because there isn't a huge ending goal although you can see an \"ending\" of sorts if you gather all of these items called \"effects\" and place them in a room in a dream world you can enter with many doors leading to other parts of the dream world.  The effects are useful however so it is recommended that you keep them on you until you have found all 24 of them because some effects are needed to find others.  They can do something as little as change your appearance to make you move much more quickly.  This game went on to inspire other games such as Undertale although if you are looking for an action game then this game may not be for you.

It's as much an experiment in just seeing what can be done with the engine as a story-telling method as anything else. It has no narrative, almost no dialogue, but miles of story delivered purely through exploration. I first encountered Yume Nikki while researching unusual RPG Maker projects for a game of my own, and like a lot of people I found the project's mystique intoxicating.\n\nYou control sleepy-eyed shut in Madotsuki, who's unwillingness to leave her home means that she must turn to lucid dreaming to pass the long days and nights. In her dreams, she can wander a vast number of intermittently connected, diverse fantasy worlds, collecting different \"effects,\" which are kind of like transformations she can dream herself into.\n\nAnd... well, that's about it, honestly. There's no real combat to speak of, a few puzzles to discover, but the vast majority of your experience with the game will be spent walking from place to place, taking in the sights. Themes begin to emerge. Recurring images start to become apparent. And *then* the fun begins. Your mind makes connections. You wonder, theorize, make guesses at the importance of different sights and sounds.\n\nYume Nikki is a game that inspired an entire generation of 2D styled adventure games through its approach to gameplay and storytelling, and as confusing as it might be at times, it decidedly deserves your attention for at least an hour or two. \n\nIt might surprise you to see just what you've been playing that took its cues from Yume Nikki.", "timestamp_created": 1517987110, "timestamp_updated": 1517987110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.568965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39902488": {"recommendationid": "39902488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337259963", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519897007}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u5e74\u540e\u5c45\u7136\u767b\u9646steam\u4e86\n\u5f88\u5f00\u5fc3\n", "timestamp_created": 1517983953, "timestamp_updated": 1517983953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526140", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39901937": {"recommendationid": "39901937", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066580090", "num_games_owned": 291, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517980649}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7cbe\u795e\u6c61\u67d3\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u53d7\u4e0d\u4e86\u7684\u4e0d\u8981\u5c1d\u8bd5", "timestamp_created": 1517980708, "timestamp_updated": 1517980708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572087", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39899120": {"recommendationid": "39899120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198290166558", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 1521733937}, "language": "spanish", "review": "WOW,es confuso al principio pero es una experiencia unica", "timestamp_created": 1517965540, "timestamp_updated": 1517965593, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39898379": {"recommendationid": "39898379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007679713", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519960734}, "language": "italian", "review": "i\u0342\u0368\u036d\u0303\u034a\u0311\u0311\u0319\u0355\u033b\u031fl\u0301\u030a\u035b\u0311\u0308\u035f\u0320\u0347\u033b\u0326\u0331\u0330 \u0366\u035b\u035b\u0313\u0303\u0330\u032d\u032b\u031f\u0330\u0324\u031ed\u0342\u0320\u032c\u032d\u034e\u032di\u0334\u035a\u0332\u032b\u0316\u0331\u0324a\u0356\u031e\u031dr\u0363\u0324\u0333\u0353i\u0326o\u0363\u0303\u0307\u031b \u0301\u0301\u0312\u0328\u0332\u0349\u031cd\u0301\u0352\u036c\u036e\u0340\u0356\u0324\u0333\u0333\u0316e\u030f\u036c\u0304\u0363\u0337\u034e\u033b\u0317\u0354\u0320\u0347i\u0344\u035b\u0343\u0322\u032a\u0325\u0326\u0345\u034e \u0369\u0307\u0322\u0320\u0326\u032bs\u031a\u033eo\u033f\u034c\u0368\u0306\u033d\u035b\u0308g\u0303\u0318n\u0304\u0302\u0310\u036b\u036d\u033d\u035c\u0331\u032d\u0355\u031c\u033bi\u0369\u034b\u0310\u030a\u036d\u0307\u0307\u0323\u0349\u0332\u031f\u0356\u035a", "timestamp_created": 1517961693, "timestamp_updated": 1517961693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39898077": {"recommendationid": "39898077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062904736", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518029020}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely incredible game.

The game is not new and is very simplistic in the control scheme. As with many older RPG Maker games, you navigate in WASD directions upon invisible tiles and you interact with objects. There are definitely more complex controls possible; but since Yume Nikki is not an RPG combat game, that is mostly all you have, besides the little video game on the TV.\n\nFurther, people are randomly throwing out [i]Undertale[/i]; but, as just said above, Yume Nikki is from 2004. Undertale literally took details [i]from[/i] Yume Nikki during its own development and crafted a pretty different experience.\n\nSecondly, this game is not normal by any means. If you are expecting a \"sensible\" story, progression, action, or many other typical values to video games, then you will probably not find many of them. The game is heavily focused on being surreal, being confusing as hell, and, well... that's about it.\n\nWith those two points out of the way, I will say that I actually never played Yume Nikki until recently. I had heard of it for many years but never went out of my way to play it. Not quite sure why. So the moment it popped up on Steam, I figured \"Hey, you don't really have an excuse to avoid it now.\"\n\nThe game literally focuses on the main character going to sleep and waking up in a dream (or rather nightmare) world. There is a main hub with a bunch of doors and each one leads to a different sub-world with some specific theme around it. You might notice, upon exploring, that [spoiler]a bunch of the sub-worlds are also interconnected through a bunch of bizarre pathways[/spoiler]. The rough idea is to simply explore these areas, see what is around there, and interact with objects or other beings that exist.\n\nCertain objects or beings will give you an \"Effect\" when you interact with them. These will sometimes change your looks and also allow certain actions when using them. Sometimes the actions are just cosmetic, while other times they might cause reactions in specific areas.\n\nThere are technically enemies in the game, but there is no way for you to reach a game over, so do not worry too much on that and focus more on exploring the weirdness that you encounter.\n\nAlbeit a spoiler, I will just state for newcomers that there is indeed an [spoiler]ending to the game[/spoiler], which you can reach by [spoiler]obtaining all of the Effects (24, not including the \"Tutorial\" one), and leaving them as the egg objects in the dream world hub and waking up to see what is different[/spoiler].\n\nWhat I highly suggest to most people who are not familiar with the game is to simply go through [i]all[/i] of the doors in the main hub, explore the areas for a bit and try to see if you find different pathways around, and then consider whether you would want to keep manually exploring. If you are still interested in navigating yourself, then sure, do so, but do not get frustrated and simply drop out. If you hit a point where you get tired of it, you can pull open a guide and look into the Effects and whatever else you can look for in the game.\n\nI spent about 3 hours myself going around and found 11 Effects before I turned to a guide to determine more information. Unless you extremely enjoy the idea of moving tile-by-tile, interacting with every single object in multiple ways, and returning to areas over and over to keep trying new interactions, then you will not likely find everything in the game on your own. I'm sure some people have, but as said above, they probably [i]really[/i] enjoyed the large amount of time navigating and testing around, which I doubt many people do.\n\nThe game is pretty absurd and a lot of the world is up to interpretation for its weirdness and what is behind it. However, depending upon other games that you have played and what you encounter in Yume Nikki, you can probably notice some things that it inspired. I can definitely tell the connections between Yume Nikki and the indie games of [i]LISA[/i], for instance. (I actually highly recommend [i]LISA: The Painful[/i] to a [i]slightly[/i] broader audience. It is dark and can be very gross and weird, but I was surprised at how much I liked it.)\n\nIn any case, Yume Nikki was an enjoyable experience for me.", "timestamp_created": 1517888681, "timestamp_updated": 1517889561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39880044": {"recommendationid": "39880044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140642551", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517888576}, "language": "english", "review": "I just didn't really \"get\" it to be honest.

It's literally a ton of copy-pasted trees that look like they were pulled from the front page of RPG maker or whatever. And it's infinitely looping. Very clearly looks like an amateur loaded up RPG maker randomly put a bunch of trees everywhere and then hit the \"loop\" check box. There is a significant amount of content in this \"game\" that wastes the users time like this. They could have made the world slightly smaller and more compact, and there still would have been a ton of cool things to explore. I just don't see why they chose to dampen the experience when there is so much cool stuff to see.\n\nWhatever the reason, it doesn't seem to hurt its reception . . . A lot of rave for this game seems to be nostalgic (it came out in 2004), and newcomers like I might not understand what it meant to people in the time that it came out.\n\nOne other minor annoyance I had is the inability to move diagonally, which makes navigating a few tunnels to be extremely irritating and \"gamey.\"\n\nIf you're like me and want to experience everything this game has to offer, good luck. I'm not going to take the time to wander aimlessly through a lot of repetition. Even if you locate all of the Effects (the only clear goal in the game), you still won't have seen a few things. The best way may be to, after an initial blind run-around, just \"spoil\" the rest and read up on what others have found. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIjw8ys2K0M]Or, before you do that, watch someone else wander around cluelessly, so you don't have to waste any effort.[/url]\n\nThere are a lot of novel, art ideas and symbolism that are very much worthy of analysis and discussion. The anonymity and possible death of the creator elevates all of it to an even higher plane, as if we are actually exploring the dreams of a real person.\n\nThis game is an amazing work of art that is challenging at times to fully experience.", "timestamp_created": 1517690132, "timestamp_updated": 1521575559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39823665": {"recommendationid": "39823665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064965118", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517684899}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not one for exploring in games but BOY can I say that this is a good game.

You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect\u2019s ability\n3: Cancel an effect\u2019s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1517432866, "timestamp_updated": 1518200394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 75, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39754183": {"recommendationid": "39754183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091862396", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517428030}, "language": "english", "review": "By Waifu Hunter\tJanuary 12\n\u201cHeavily inspired by Undertale, this new indie RPG takes you into the mind of Nikki, as she wanders her dreams to come to terms with her gender identity.

I'd tried to get into it prior to the steam release at least twice, but if you know this game you know that it's extremely difficult to penetrate. People will tell you to play this game blind -- don't. By all means, get as far as you can without guidance, but i'd imagine that it would be extremely difficult and tedious to get all of the effects by just wandering around. Certain areas (like the infinite wilderness) can be exceedingly obtuse when it comes to progressing or seeing the full extent of the location. Think of it as like using a tour guide on your trip through the game: although the focus is exploration, there's no harm in being directed towards what to explore. Going in blind would probably mean missing out on tons of secret events (FACE, Uboa, Mars) that really make the game as special as it is.\n\nThis game is absolutely not for everyone. If you like things like: psychological horror, surrealist art, games without objectives, games with complex interlocking worlds, or any of the numerous games which have stated Yume Nikki as a direct influence (Doki Doki Literature Club, LISA, Undertale, OFF, .flow, etc.), then you should really consider playing this game. It's a japanese game from 2004 basically released on 2channel without any fanfare that went on to become one of the most influential indie games of all time. \n\nThe creator, Kikiyama, stopped updating the game years ago, and many on the net assumed that they had died because of the complete lack of any information on them. Nobody knows their age, whether they've worked on any other games, or even their gender. They released the game, updated it a few times, and left before it got successful. With the announcement of YUME NIKKI -DREAM DIARY-, Kikiyama has returned to direct another game and we finally know that they're alive after a literal decade of radio silence. Needless to say, this is absolutely monumental for fans of the franchise, and even if the new game sucks, it's still crazy to think that the series has been reignited after it had already been collectively decided that Kikiyama would probably never return to the internet to even update their website, let alone create a new entry in the Yume Nikki series.\n\nThis is one of very few games that I think left a lasting impact on me. There isn't even any dialogue in this thing, but it's so unique and evocative and confusing that I can't even believe that something like it exists as perfectly as it does. I'd recommend to at least give it an extended try regardless of whether you think you'll like it or not; spend a while in each of the starting rooms, read the wiki a bit, and just make an attempt to get into it.

Por alguna raz\u00f3n no puedes salir de este apartamento, ya que cada vez que lo intentas; Madotsuki solo se negar\u00e1 a salir. Pero he aqu\u00ed el detalle, si te vas a dormir, entraras en una dimensi\u00f3n distinta a la realidad, al principio todo se ver\u00e1 igual, aun estar\u00e1s en tu cuarto, pero esta vez podr\u00e1s salir, y te toparas con una gran sala en la cual hay distintas puertas, y cada puerta lleva a un extra\u00f1o lugar, cada uno m\u00e1s raro que el anterior.\n\n[h1]JUGABILIDAD[/h1]\nLa jugabilidad en Yume Nikki es muy sencilla, solo te mueves, recoges \u201cefectos\u201d y realizas una acci\u00f3n; Los efectos son distintos cambios en las caracter\u00edsticas de Madotsuki los cuales te permitir\u00e1n realizar ciertas cosas a medida que exploras el extra\u00f1o mundo de los sue\u00f1os, desde simplemente tener el cabello m\u00e1s largo hasta cambiar de forma enteramente. Puedes obtener un total de 24 efectos en todo el juego los cuales te ayudar\u00e1n a descubrir mas cosas o entrar a otros lugares.\n\n[b]EL FACTOR MUNDO ABIERTO[/b]\nEsta es la gran fortaleza de Yume Nikki pero al mismo tiempo puede ser algo que actue en su desventaja. Detr\u00e1s de cada puerta hay un mundo distinto por explorar, y a pesar de las cosas que puedes ver en dichos mundos como personajes extra\u00f1os, o fondos alucinantes, e incluso en algunos casos perturbadores y aterradores, en algunos de estos mundos pasa que se siente tan abierto que terminas perdi\u00e9ndote, esto es bueno pero a la vez malo, ya que se da un espacio grande en el cual tienes que buscar algo muy peque\u00f1o (Generalmente efectos) y si por ejemplo continuas caminando en una direcci\u00f3n eventualmente volver\u00e1s al punto inicial, ya que puedes seguir caminando indefinidamente, sin embargo el mundo se repite, al ser tan abierto pasan 2 cosas, la primera es que debido a que el campo visual es algo limitado no sabes a donde ir, y la segunda es que para poder orientarte te limitas a contar tus pasos o el tiempo que lleves caminando en X direcci\u00f3n para luego tomar Y Direcci\u00f3n, lo cual puede volver la exploraci\u00f3n bastante aburrida, sobre todo que en algunos mundos no pasa absolutamente nada, es un gran espacio sin nada que hacer, salvo por alg\u00fan pasaje secreto o alg\u00fan personaje que te encuentres que te teletransporte a otro sitio, la idea es buscar y encontrar, sin embargo no tienes ning\u00fan tipo de gu\u00eda. Algunos efectos te ayudan en ciertas zonas, ya sea para poder ver mejor o simplemente ir mas r\u00e1pido, pero nunca sabr\u00e1s donde est\u00e1 cada cosa a menos de que vayas explorando y \u201ca lo que salga\u201d o que busques una gu\u00eda en Linea para que sepas que tienes que hacer. Y hablando de eso \u00faltimo, \u00bfCu\u00e1l es el objetivo de este juego para empezar?, es un juego de exploraci\u00f3n y no parece tener ningun objetivo en particular.\n\n[h1]CONCLUS\u00cdON[/h1]\nYume Nikki es un juego en el que tienes que perderte y eventualmente sabr\u00e1s que hacer, a pesar de lo cr\u00edptico que pueda llegar a ser, ya que no sabes que hacer, como hacerlo, donde hacerlo y por que, simplemente estas a la deriba, aunque... el juego si tiene un final.\n\n[h1]VEREDICTO[/h1]\n[b]0/0 - \u00bf?.[/b] Ya se lo que est\u00e1n pensando al ver ese n\u00famero [b]\"\u00bfEst\u00e1s Diciendo que es malo?\"[/b] Y tal vez los que defiendan este \u201cjuego\u201d a capa y espada [b]\u201c\u00bfCOMO TE ATREVES A INSULTAR A YUME NIKKI, EL MEJOR JUEGO DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS?

Yume Nikki es un juego bastante cr\u00edptico, y hasta inentendible en ocasiones, tiene aspectos muy buenos como el construir muy buenas atmosferas de desolaci\u00f3n soledad o incluso terror, sin embargo, es un juego en el que definitivamente no sabes que est\u00e1s haciendo, solo lo haces.\nYume Nikki es un juego muy raro, no es recomendable para cualquiera, en el sentido de que no cualquiera lo entiende (Entre esos yo, en parte por lo menos), aunque tengo que admitirlo... puede llegar a ser muy interesante si te gustan las cosas fuera de lo com\u00fan.\n\nEste \"Juego\" es simplemente muy extra\u00f1o.", "timestamp_created": 1517201438, "timestamp_updated": 1520340290, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.401376", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39698975": {"recommendationid": "39698975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198320595579", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517131311}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud06c\uc73c \uc774 \uac13\uac9c\uc774 \uc2a4\ud300\uc5d0 \ub098\uc624\ub2e4\ub2c8...\n\uacf5\ub7b5 \uc5c6\uc774 \uae68\uc138\uc694. \uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc774 \ubcf4\ub294 \uacf5\ub7b5\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub9c8\ub3c4\uce20\ud0a4\ub294 100\ubc88 \ub118\uac8c \uc9c0\uc625\uc5d0 \uac14\uc744 \uac81\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1517200799, "timestamp_updated": 1517200799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39696764": {"recommendationid": "39696764", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271399198", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519317947}, "language": "french", "review": "C'est toujours aussi bon d'y rejouer apr\u00e8s toutes ces ann\u00e9es...

Rest assured, Rest assured, drawing your own map to keep track of how the various different places in the game link to each other is highly encouraged.\n\nBut perhaps this lack of \"proper\" gameplay is exactly what makes Yume Nikki shine even today, 14 years after its original release - the game is proverbially timeless.

A rollercoaster of emotions, created by Key, the masters of their craft, who have incorporated their experiences and new ideas, gained over a long process of writing stories that tightly grip the hearts of their readers time and time again.\n\nThe Little Busters have set out on an important mission: To make new friends and have as much fun as they possibly can while they're still young. Their leader Kyousuke never runs out of ideas as they transform their everyday lives in memories of happiness with their silly antics. \nBeginning with an energetic narrative of youth and friendship, the story then becomes more serious as our protagonist, Naoe Riki, discovers love and is faced with harsh trials of life that may hit anyone, at any time. This is where the friendship of the Little Busters truly shines, as they come together to help their members endure the pain and deal with their problems and eventually become stronger.\n\nLittle Busters is my favorite game.

It is a game that I have been wanting to play for years now, as I am a big fan of Key\u2019s previous works, having seen all of their respective anime adaptations. Clannad is my all-time favorite work of fiction across any medium, so I had very high expectations going into this game.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]Great characterization.[/b] As with Key\u2019s previous works, the game is built around its characters. The whole goal is to build up these characters so much so that the player becomes attached to them and really gets to know them. This is an aspect that Key has always been good at and Little Busters! is no exception. The character routes expand on each character in-depth, usually by exploring said character\u2019s past, giving the player insight into why each character acts the way they do. During that process, these characters are really brought to life.\n\n[b]Fantastic soundtrack.[/b] The Clannad Original Soundtrack is my all-time favorite soundtrack, so knowing that the Little Busters! soundtrack shares some of the same composers, I had similar expectations. These expectations were met for the most part. There are several standout tracks in the soundtrack, with only a few on the weaker side. \u201cBOYS DON\u2019T CRY\u201d is a great example of one of the better tracks from the game and might be my favorite, although it is hard to choose.\n\nIt is not just the excellent background music that makes this soundtrack so good. The opening theme is just as good, with the English localization even including karaoke on-screen when it plays, just as one would find on a lot of today\u2019s fansubbed anime. The different ending themes were of varying quality, but none of them were bad. The main insert song, titled \u201cFaraway\u201d, is easily the best vocal track in the game though. I would be lying if I said I did not shed a tear or two when that one started playing during the Refrain route. Overall though, the Little Busters! Original Soundtrack is just another great work to come out of Key Sounds Label.\n\n[b]The Refrain Route.[/b] I had a great time going through most of the character routes, but all of them pale in comparison to the game\u2019s true ending, the Refrain route. Sure, the character routes are supposed to invoke some sort of emotional response, but I did not shed a single tear until I got to the Refrain route. This is coming from someone who rarely feels any emotion for fictional characters, let alone shed a tear for one. I can count the number of times this has happened on one hand, Little Busters! now included. It is just that good. The emotional payoff in the Refrain route is easily worth the 60 or so hours it took to get to that point. This all just further cements my opinion that Jun Maeda is the best writer in the industry.\n\n[b]Busterpedia.[/b] The Busterpedia is a great addition for the English version, especially for those that may not know a lot about Japanese culture. It is basically an in-game dictionary, highlighting certain words, phrases, or names that the player may not know. Clicking on the highlighted word, phrase, or name brings up its definition. It can also can be accessed at anytime from the main menu or the in-game menu. I consider myself at least somewhat knowledgeable about Japanese culture, but there was still several terms and names that I was not familiar with, so the Busterpedia was rather helpful in that regard. The definitions range from simple words that are rather well-known, like Tatami, up to terms like Ogura Hyakunin Isshu, the name of a Japanese poetry anthology published in the 12th century.\n\n[b]The variety of mini-games.[/b] Despite Little Busters! being a visual novel, there are plenty of mini-games included that span a variety of genres. First, there is the battle system. This aspect of the game basically has the player collecting items to increase his/her stats and up his/her position on the battle rankings leaderboard throughout the course of the game. There is also the batting practice mini-game, which is a bit more involved compared to the battle system. This one has the player moving left and right then pressing space when the perfect pitch is lined up. Playing this mini-game builds stats for each character participating in the practice, which helps in both the battle system and the actual baseball game played during the common route.\n\nEven more involved than the baseball mini-game is the dungeon crawler present in Saya\u2019s route, which can be accessed after clearing Refrain. It is a full-blown dungeon crawler implemented right into a visual novel, with trap rooms and a shooting gallery mini-game when enemies appear. There are a few others as well, but these three are the standout ones. These mini-games do not hinder the experience at all and can be disabled by the player if he/she does not want to bother with them. They just serve as some additional fun to have while playing through the main game. I personally had a lot of fun tracking down the different achievements that can be earned by participating in these mini-games.\n\n[b]Wealth of content.[/b] Steam says I have logged over 150 hours in this game and, while some of that time may have been spent idling, I would not be surprised if my actual playtime came in at around 80 hours. It took over a month of on-and-off playing to finish the game. There is simply that much content present in Little Busters!. The common route is very long, with each character route taking a reasonable amount of time to clear as well. The true ending, the Refrain route, is also of decent length. Adding in all of the extra content, such as the bonus routes and mini-games, and you are left with quite the package.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]Some rushed character routes.[/b] I did mention previously that each character route takes considerable time to clear, but that does not mean each is well-paced. There were a few character routes that felt rushed towards the end. It was as if the one writing the route was suddenly out of time and had to crank out an ending as quickly as possible. This was very noticeable with Kud\u2019s route, my least favorite in the game because of just how jarring the sudden shift in pacing was towards the end of the route. Without spoiling, I will just say that the last 15% or so of that route became quit the mess, a very different feeling compared to the rest of the route. This was not the case with all the routes though, just a few. It is quite the shame actually, as a couple of these rushed routes started off great, only to lose their appeal as the pacing increased.\n\n[b]Typos and grammar issues.[/b] The game is made up of over one million words, so I expected the occasional typo or two. They were not all that common, not enough to really bother me, but it should be noted regardless. I noticed that the majority of these typos appeared during the Ecstasy routes, the three routes unlocked after completing Refrain. Perhaps it is because the Ecstasy content was never translated prior to this release, whereas the translation of the base game has been out for years and served as the foundation for this English Edition, allowing for any typos to be ironed out.\n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1]\nWith each release, Key continues to set the standard for what a good visual novel should strive to be. The game met my high expectations and it is the first visual novel to have impacted me on such an emotional level, enough so that I had to fight back tears. From its great characterization to its fun mini-games, Little Busters! does just about everything right, with only a few rushed character routes bringing down the experience. Highly recommended for visual novel fans and those that enjoy impactful stories.\n\nFull review: https://cublikefoot.com/2017/12/16/little-busters-english-edition-actual-game-review/", "timestamp_created": 1513473520, "timestamp_updated": 1513473520, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38329364": {"recommendationid": "38329364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103217124", "num_games_owned": 1736, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513353248}, "language": "english", "review": "Plenty of other reviews give this game ample praise.\n\nPeople who are still on the fence should note that the minigames might not be as fluid or easy as one might expect.\n\nYours truly, for example, utterly fails at the baseball segments.

Lots of muscles.\n\nLittle Busters is two tons of fun, and is arguably some of the best entertainment I've had reading a VN. It has minigames and choices sprinkled throughout, and plenty of shenanigans/jokes to keep you entertained. The pacing overall is pretty good, and there were very few times when I felt like things were dragging on. This is crucial because of LB's staggering length of nearly 1.5 million words (almost double the length of the Bible) and over 90 hours of content, making it one of the longest visual novels ever written.\n\nLB isn't all fun and games though. Later on it will hit you with tragic stories and heavy character drama. While it's not as potent as Clannad (one of Key's most famous VNs) in that regard, don't be surprised if at the end of a character route you're in tears.\n\nThat brings me to Little Busters' other strength: investment in characters. The male supporting cast of Kyousuke, Masato and Kengo is outstanding, which is a rarity in non-otome visual novels. They all have depth and complexity in their character, even the silly comic relief Masato (one of my favorite comic relief characters ever). For me, the female characters ranged from very good to mediocre, but these three guys stole the show. I'll definitely remember them long after I've moved on to other stories.\n\nThe character routes are a bit of a mixed bag for me. Some of them I loved, others I only thought were ok. However, when Little Busters lands a hit, it really knocks it out of the park. And that's why you should play it.", "timestamp_created": 1512056245, "timestamp_updated": 1512056856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758434", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37950487": {"recommendationid": "37950487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025485763", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 3090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512829416}, "language": "english", "review": "The Steam release marks the 4th time that I'm reading Little Busters, and it's still making me laugh and cry.\nProbably the visual novel that had the greatest impact on me, and definitely the one that I like best.

Something you wanted so badly, that you would move heaven and earth to have it, even if your wish could only give a fleeting moment of happiness? \n\nThere are times in life where despite still being not too old, I yearn anyway for those blissful days of bygone youth, where you felt nothing could stop you and your friends from taking on the world. Those innocent playful days felt endless... But time never stops, childhood innocence is never for granted, and the oftentimes crueler hardships that come with this reality are ready at a moments notice to overtake us all whether or not we're ready to deal with them.\n\nThis VN captures those youthful days as it follows the lives of a small group of friends who call themselves the Little Busters, a group made just to enjoy those days while they last. They spend their days playing baseball, causing a ruckus, and maybe even solving some problems along the way. Always cheerfully pushing forward with song and smile. Always looking to enjoy the moment and help others enjoy the moment too when they really need a helping hand.\n\nIt's a beautiful story about friends and how we mature and grow stronger to face those issues that life will just hurl at us. Each character develops and matures from where they start out to the point where you just feel proud for them when they do overcome their hardships. Some characters even surprise you in how they handle their lot life has drawn for them. Things get deeply emotional and heartrending at times with the plights of some characters, and the game can easily veer off into the melodramatic at times for some people's tastes. But I think the game has so much more stronger moments than these weaker moments.\n\nIn terms of the quality, this is a labor of love from the translators. The folks at Fruitbat Factory did the original fan translation and have now finally their hard work is officially approved. I can only imagine the elation they have over this, and I would think this would be the dream of any fan who is passionate enough to do something like a fan translation. They deserve it though, as the VN is as perfect as it can be. Absolutely no complaints about the system. It does its job.\n\n[h1]I have read a fair amount of visual novels, and I still have many more to go, but this has easily become one of my favorites thus far and perhaps will always be so. I highly recommend it for any VN fan for its beautiful story, music, and characters... and after finishing this I don't think I'll be forgetting about the Little Busters any time soon. After all, life may constantly move forward, but the Little Busters are eternal.[/h1]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1205104567", "timestamp_created": 1511757021,

the EX version but this is not the EX version unfortunately or fortunately depending to who you are.\ni can't go to exact details of the story without spoiling so you gotta play the game yourself to find out\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nnow you might be thinking \"huh? but this is a visual novel so that means it doesn't have any gameplay, why bother rating it?\" and the anwser to that question is that there's minigames in this visual novel ranging from playing baseball to a RNG fighting sim to a dungeon crawler with a shooting gallery game, there's plenty of stuff in this game to distract you from actually reading it so have fun and oh yeah this is a visual novel so expect reading alot\n\nCharacters and Soundtrack: 9/10\nsimply wonderful, there's not much to say to be honest both the soundtrack and characters are amazing you'll get attached to both quite easily tho if there's one thing i want to say about the characters is that they can get annoying if you dont enjoy their character

The kind of reading where you smile even when there aren't any jokes.\n-9 routes and all of them worth reading.\n-Memorable characters, I like even the male dormitory head who has I think about 6 lines of dialogue.\n-Great art.\n-Good music.\n-A big cat.\n-Friendship.\n-Battles.\n\nNow there are few things I'm not a fan of:\n\n-Baseball minigame gets repetitive fast(all minigames can be skipped).\n-Game was made originally in a 4:3 aspect ratio and this edition is 16:9. It doesn't affect much most of the time, but CG scenes will be cut and you need to press \"space bar\" and use the scroll wheel of your mouse to zoom out to see the whole picture. It should've been included an option to play in the original aspect ratio.\n-Some CGs were changed slightly from the first released version of Little Busters. I don't know if they changed it in the Perfect Edition but even if they did I find it annoying.\n\nAlso, I don't care but it doesn't have any 18+ scenes and it's highly doubtful it will have a patch, the Perfect Edition of LB! from Japan doesn't have it, too.\n\nTo sum it up, I think Little Busters! is the best VN you can find on steam right now.", "timestamp_created": 1511408852, "timestamp_updated": 1511408852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36917759": {"recommendationid": "36917759", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986569355", "num_games_owned": 606, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511408525}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm glad that VisualArts/Key is finally releasing their visual novels in English now.\nI know Clannad was by Sekai Project (I backed their Kickstarter) but I guess in a way that was a catalyst for VisualArts/Key to release their games in English for the western world.\n\nLike most of VisualArts/Key visual novels, this one is also a wonderful masterpiece.\nIt is quite lengthy (like most of Key/VisualArts' visual novels), but in a way that's a good thing -- it'll keep you busy for a good while.\n\nThe game has 1280 by 720 (HD) art assets which is very good for a visual novel that is over 10 years old.\n\nI myself have quite a lot still to go through, but that's all part of the experience of visual novels. :)", "timestamp_created": 1511408222, "timestamp_updated": 1511408222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36899652": {"recommendationid": "36899652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025367627", "num_games_owned": 443, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512475950}, "language": "english", "review": "Manly tears.", "timestamp_created": 1511403674, "timestamp_updated": 1511403674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36896303": {"recommendationid": "36896303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012945070", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512094370}, "language": "english", "review": "During the past several years I've read plenty of VNs, however this gem was hidden from my sight for too long.

I originally played through a lot of this with an old fan translation, but the new official translation, along with 3 new routes and all the bonus content is well worth revisiting. I'd probably rate this alongside my favorite VN's...The story is great, especially once everything is explained in refrain and all truth comes to light. Even before the thrilling concluding arc there are so many moments, of happiness, grief, all done so well and conveyed magnificently.\n\nOnce you've figured out the secret of the world, all the [spoiler]supernatural happenings[/spoiler] begin to make sense, and you can look at the story in an entirely new light... Which also explains why [spoiler]Rin begins to become more active with the routes as you continue, and why more things appear over time. All of the characters were picked based on their unfinished last wishes, and it conveys beautifully through the plot while helping to better drive Riki and Rin to their purpose of becoming strong together. All in order to face that horrible world that they must face together.[/spoiler]\n\nThis, similar to Clannad, has tons of options. When you think interactivity in a visual novel, Little Busters should probably be the first thing that comes to mind. Not only do all the options completely change course and make or break your route, (there's so many different bad ends for each heroine... Lots of them are interesting to read, and again... Once you find the secret of the world, they make more sense) but there's tons of fun little mini games as well. You may turn on/off each minigame as you wish, and they won't hinder story progression [spoiler]however, once you get to saya route, if you can't successfully do the shooting minigame(and have it turned on), you may be in for a pickle, as you'll have to keep replaying over and over until you complete it.[/spoiler] It isn't just there to pad the story length and make it longer, though. For example, in [spoiler]Batting Practice, you'll increase the stats of your characters as you play ball, allowing you to complete some more story fights/get ready for the big game. Lots of bonus text behind these things, and the battle rankings can be outright hilarious.[/spoiler]\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and this (as far as I know) is key's longest visual novel. I'm not absolutely sure if perfect edition is over clannad in word length, but EX was by 4000 words, and this is EX with modified/new content(removed 18+ however). The visuals are great, and the voice acting is superb. The three new routes included from EX are all great fun to play, and one [spoiler]even takes place after the incident, which is an interesting perspective.[/spoiler]\n\nIf you have any interest in visual novels at all, this one will be the most bang for your buck, and the minigames are all fun as well [spoiler]though the dungeon crawler is a bit repetitive, Luckily on the final playthrough the route, it's much simplified... and hilarious if I might add.[/spoiler] So equally, if you're a visual novel veteran, or looking to get started into visual novels, this is a grand choice and should definitely make your list. [spoiler]To top it all off, it's one of those games where all routes are canon. Gotta love the dedication for those.[/spoiler]  This is the second novel to receive a 10/10 from me, the first being the muv-luv trilogy.

For example, there are some grammatical errors that occasionally pop up along with at least one untranslated japanese line I've found in Sasami's route (It wasn't because I accidentally switched the language to Japanese, which is also an excellent feature available in this version of the game.)

I read Little Busters! when the fan translation came out several years back and it's safe to say it's my favorite visual novel of all time. It isn't without its flaws; for one, there were a couple of character routes that were either a bit confusing or maybe not the greatest, but this is limited to those particular character routes. The common route, the main story, and the routes written by Yuuto Tonokawa and Jun Maeda were all extremely good and memorable. The main storyline especially is one of the best I've ever read in a visual novel, and the main cast especially is an absolute blast and very memorable. The heroines are a bit more of a mixed bag; some of them really stand out and had a strong presence, while others... not so much. But even the ones I'm not huge on are, at worst, just not very great. There's nothing there that's offensively bad, and far more often than not what is there is extremely good.\n\nThis release adds three character routes (Sasami, Kanata, and Saya) that were not present in the original fan translation. These routes are locked behind the main story as far as I can tell; you can't complete them until the main story is complete, and there is no option for returning players to specify that they have already completed the story. While this is kind of understandable, I think it would have been nice to include some way to unlock it for people who have already read the fan translation. As far as the quality of the routes, I can't comment since I haven't read them yet, but based on the writers responsible for each route, I expect two of them to be pretty high quality and the remaining one could go either way.\n\nAll of the other features you'd expect from a VN are, for the most part, present. There's a mouseover encyclopedia for Japanese terms that English readers may be unfamiliar with, which is a welcome and common-sense addition in my opinion. There is also the option to switch everything to Japanese text, which (although kind of strange in an English release) would be perfectly fine except that there's a mouse shortcut to toggle this that's relatively easy to trigger on accident (click LMB and RMB at the same time). Volume settings for BGM, character voices, individual character voices, and sound effects are all there, which is good because the defaults seemed really strange to me; sound effects and male characters were extremely quiet while the BGM and certain female characters were all very loud. Other than that, this release is supposedly also compatible with touchscreens. I can't comment on that, but it does look like the settings are there, so if you like to play on a tablet or something, it seems you can do that.\n\nOverall, this is a great release. There are minor things here or there that stick out to me, but nothing really earth-shattering. If you have even the slightest interest in this kind of visual novel or if you're a fan of any of Key's other works, definitely pick this up right away. If you played the original fan translated version, I'd recommend grabbing it for the extra character routes; I believe there is an unlocked save file for you in the \"guides\" section on the Steam Community if you really don't want to do a full replay (I'm just going to do a full replay, though). Either way, this is a definite buy for me.\n\nEdit:\nWhen I wrote this review, the last time I had read Little Busters! had been in 2013 or so. Now that I'm almost finished with it again (I've completed all the main routes again as well as two of the added routes; I still haven't read Saya's), I want to say that I liked Chika Shirokiri's routes a lot better now than I did the first time I read them. It's also worth saying that the additional route that he (she?) wrote (which is great on its own and feels like a full, complete route) adds a sort of resolution that was kind of lacking in one of the original routes and made what I thought was already a good scenario even better.\n\nAs for the additional route written by Tonokawa, it was nice and very cute but rather short and lacking in the impact that his other routes had. It's not bad by any means, but it definitely feels more like a fandisc route. A little disappointing, but it was fun so I can't complain.\n\nSaya's route was all right. A lot of fun but I personally wasn't huge on the way it played out.", "timestamp_created": 1509848884, "timestamp_updated": 1513546709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36283765": {"recommendationid": "36283765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036133786", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511730303}, "language": "english", "review": "Best VN Key has made.

much that if you had the chance to erase that memory to live it again for the first time you would do it? That's Little Busters! for me. It helped me grow as a person, and for that I am grateful.\n\nI first played the VN in Winter 2012 when the anime was airing, and I've been in love ever since. I won't write too many details because the best way of experiencing the game is by playing it. The characters have amazing development, the OST is perfect (as per usual from Key), the common route is a great slice of life. Don't spoil yourself, if you want to look recomended route orders go for it, but that's about how much you should look. Try to get to them on your own with no walkthroughs, it enriches the experience.\n\nIf this is your first VN, don't be afraid of the lenght of the game. Play it on your own pace and when you least expect it you will be playing it all day, and when you're not playing it you will be eagerly awaiting for the next opportunity.\n\nI don't know how to write a review, but this game brought me so much that I feel like I have to try at least. If this is the small push you need to buy Little Busters! I hope this helps you make your mind. If at least one person decides to play because of my small text, then I'm already happy.", "timestamp_created": 1509761360, "timestamp_updated": 1509761602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40,

contain both a great deal of hillarious comedy and heartbreaking drama? How about a memorable cast of characters who are all well-developed and are just fun to spend time with? Perhaps some quirky minigames where \"battles\" are fought with whatever random objects happen to be at hand? Or perhaps a story revolving around themes such as friendship, growing up, and facing up to painful circumstances? If so, then Little Busters is the game you want to play.\n\nOriginally this game came out in 2007, had an \"expanded\" version released a year later, three seasons of an anime adaptation in 2012-2014, and likely more. But only now, 10 years after the original release, has this game finally recieved an official English release. To say that this was a highly anticipated release for me would be an understatement: Little Busters is one of my favorite VN's ever alongside the likes of Steins;Gate, Umineko, and its \"elder sibling\" Clannad that was made by the same developers back in 2004. Anyone who has already played Clannad on Steam, or is otherwise familiar with the works of Key/Visual Arts, has a pretty good idea of what to expect from this. And yet Little Busters, in my opinion, is an improvement upon its infamous predecessor.\n\nA major reason why I think this is in no small part due to the cast. At the start, you are one of five childhood friends: Naoe Riki (you), Natsume Kyousuke, Inohara Masato, Miyazawa Kengo, and Natsume Rin. Now in high school and thinking about the unfortunate fact that adulthood will likely split them up, the Little Busters decide to have another fun adventure before that day arrives. As that adventure plays out, the group recieves new members and gets involved in all sorts of whacky shenanigans and hillarious conversations. Every major character (of which I count 13) is very well-developed and has a large amount of screentime. Characters that initially seem stereotypical or one-dimensional (such as the idiot friend Masato, the moe blob Kudryavka, and the hardass rules enforcer Kanata) end up revealing far more depth than first impressions would suggest, particularly when you get involved in their individual storylines. Lastly, one of the big plus points is that regardless of what story path you pursue, the other main cast members remain part of the plot, rather than just disappearing as they tended to do in Clannad and many other VN's.\n\nThe storyline for Little Busters is large, with no less than nine different character storylines to play through. There are a huge number of dialogue choices to make which can decide everything from what route you will pursue, what minor (potentially missable) scenes you will find, or what crazy battles you may end up getting involved with. It actually gets a little complex, as you will need to play the original six storylines (Komari, Rin 1, Kurugaya, Haruka, Kudryavka, and Mio) before being able to dig into the heavy drama and soul-crushing heartbreak that follows (Rin 2 and Refrain). Even after that is done, you still have even more to look for, with the unlocking of the three \"extra\" routes (Saya, Sasami, Kanata) as well as alternate endings for ones you have finished already. In other words... this game is massively packed with content, with something in the order of 100+ hours of gameplay to be had. There's probably plenty of stuff in this game I don't even know about. But despite its length, unlike many other VN's this is one I don't get bored playing. There's just too much fun (and drama) going on keeping me interested... and losing track of time in the process. XD\n\nOk, if it wasn't obvious at the start or throughout the course of this review, i'll just go ahead and spell it out as unambiguously as possible: I love this game. I was waiting for more than three years for it to get an English release, made a point of backing Clannad's Kickstarter with the opinion that if it succeeded then Little Busters might eventually get released too, and patiently waiting until, finally, the day finally arrived. At the present moment, I haven't played through the entirety of this release yet, but based on what I have seen so far (15 hours in at time of writing) this has been a quality port of a game I can't get enough of. Now I'm going to stop writing this so I can get back to the game. ^_^\n\n[b]Mission...

The deciding factor seperating VNs from normal novels or text adventures. I'm sure other reviews stressed this part already, so just know that LB! has one of THE BEST soundtrack in recorded history.\n\n2) Story. There are some some flaws here and there if you nit-pick, but overall it is an amazing experience. I won't go much into it as I could ramble on without knowing what I spoiled.\n\n3)Art....At this moment you should be waving your wallet at steam yelling \"TAKE MY MONEY\" but okay, I'll say something about the art as well. Some call me biased and denounce my art tastes, but you gotta believe me, Itaru Hinoue and Na-Ga 's styles go so well with how Key stories go, especially Hinoue. I wasn't exactly appreciative of CLANNAD's art style at the start (which was the first time I came into contact with Hinoue's art), but combined with the story, it's on a whole other level, same goes for LB. Key's VNs would be so different without these two brilliant artists. (I know Hinoue left but I think Na-Ga's up for the job)\n\nSo are you convinced? Join in for a life-changing (Probably.

The heroine routes aren't bad, but they aren't exactly impressive either.\n\nAll in all, considering the low price compared to Clannad, I highly recommend picking this one up immediately.\n\nEdit #1: It seems the CG is actually in the original 4:3 form, but only shows a 16:9 crop of the image.

Acknowledged as one of the best visual novels of all time, and ten years later here it is. The three Ecstasy routes have been translated and made accessible for the first time, and just Little Busters as a whole is being made accessible to anyone. This game is the pinnacle of Maeda Jun's work no doubt. The pinnacle of Key, and the visual novel medium as a whole. Little Busters is an experience like no other, and now it has finally made it to today where there is an official English version based on the translation patch from years ago. No longer just a game that a very select few love and discuss the impacts of, but one that the rest of the world will be able to see, and hopefully discover for themselves too. No longer does the best visual novel of all time have to be obscure and hidden away, whilst I know that something like Key and Little Busters only attracts a select few for reasons such as being able to be immensely engaged in lengthy games that challenge philosophy and psychological viewpoints no matter your age or background, merely from a human standpoint. Something that only Maeda himself can and could master. I sincerely hope more people, people who maybe have never even played a visual novel, give it a chance and let themselves be immersed into one of the most life-changing experiences from a true masterpiece. \nI cannot encourage you enough, no matter your opinion or where you stand on the idea of VNs or Japanese games and media. Try Little Busters. Little Busters changed my life, impacted the way I was wired and how I process my own thoughts. Not only me, the other fans will agree, Little Busters will have your sub-conscious processing all sorts of ideas without you even realising. For you to piece it all together at the end and conclude how you too view not just the ideas conveyed in the game, but how you even live as a human in this world. The characters, whilst fictional, are written in a way where their relationships and feelings are intertwined with each other and feels real. Especially the original five, the warmth of their closely-knit childhood friendship is written beautifully and will engage you through a surreal experience like no other. When things become serious and you slowly make realisations throughout the game, you will cry like you never have before.\nThen there is the soundtrack. Maeda Jun, Orito Shinji, PMMK and more. True geniuses of composing. The soundtrack of Little Busters will blow you away, lift you up, hit you hard on the floor and make you bawl, and put you at peace. Even the menu music, \"Born into This World\" (Umareochiru Sekai), is incredibly beautiful. Every detail of the whole game is wonderful and intricately placed and built together to create the masterpiece that is Little Busters.\nI cannot recommend Little Busters enough, no matter who you are, please try Little Busters!", "timestamp_created": 1509563949, "timestamp_updated": 1509615361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36198986": {"recommendationid": "36198986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126734406", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512251678}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u4eca\u307e\u3067\uff30\uff33\uff30\u306a\u3069\u3044\u308d\u3044\u308d\u306a\u5a92\u4f53\u3067\u767a\u58f2\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u30ea\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\n\u6700\u9ad8\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306a\u306e\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3055\u308c\u305f\u3053\u3068\u306e\u306a\u3044\u65b9\u306f\u305c\u3072\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u305f\u3044\n\u3075\u3045\uff01\u30ea\u30c8\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u6700\u9ad8\uff01\n\n\u304a\u307e\u74b0\u304b\u3082\u77e5\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u306a\u305c\u304b\u97f3\u58f0\u304c\u4e00\u5207\u6d41\u308c\u307e\u305b\u3093\n\u4eca\u4e00\u5ea6\u8a2d\u5b9a\u7b49\u898b\u76f4\u3057\u3066\u307f\u307e\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1509561690, "timestamp_updated": 1509561690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36198975": {"recommendationid": "36198975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026319210", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512513910}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me start by saying that this novel is very near and dear to me.

one I have read up to date. Back then, when I first read the fantranslation, this game helped me push through a hard time in my life and I will never forget this amazing experience. Now I am really happy to have an official release of this and the routes, that werent in the fantranslation back then.\n\nAlright now to give you some overall imput on what this game gives you:\n- an amazing story, that can change your life for the better\n- it's packed with an amazing mix of drama and comedy\n- it has fun little mini-games, that can be turn off when they first appear (the only downside is, that you cant turn them on/off after you have first chosen)\n\nMy recommendation is to not look up any guides or anything for this and just try to answer honestly at first. If this doesnt get you into any route, then I recommend just going for the girl, that hit you most first and progress on just like that. I feel like that's the best choice to experience this VN for the first time.\n\nHope this helped some of you out to decide to buy this game or how to progress in it. I could write a lot more here, but I feel like it would get spoilerish then and that's something, I dont want.

Little Busters changed me, it set my life on a course I never would've expected and allowed me to meet so many fantastic people, it shaped who I am as a person, and became part of who I am. I'll always remember one day I was in Tokyo wearing my Little Busters jumper and a salaryman excitedly shook my hand and did the muscle dance with me. This is a work which affects people on a deep and personal level. This is not an objective review, it's just the musings of one of those people it impacted. I'm writing this review based on the old fan translation of the game.\n\nLittle Busters sets up with a very humble presentation. A bunch of childhood friends in high school do a bunch of wacky stuff together to pass their time, a clique full of such unique energy that the rest of the student body can't possibly ignore them, many drawn to them and wanting to join in. The game is full of silly minigames that will keep you coming back and complement the story nicely; I've spent many hours chilling out with the batting practice, it's the perfect stress relief. It's hilarious and heartwarming watching their circle grow and the scale of the shenanigans increase, it takes me back to an idyllic representation of youth, where I could just laugh with my friends every day without a care.\n\nBut please, don't mistake Little Busters for a comedy series. Little Busters is a story about youth, and the process of growing up, and it doesn't shy away from the harsh realities that come with that process. It's about finding one's own identity, clashing with the identites of others, and finding a way to live. Each character in the story feels very much a real person, and they all have their own crises to deal with in their process of growing up. The writing is beautiful, and you'll find yourself hitting the screenshot button every other minute. It's positive representation of mental health issues and it's atypically feminine male lead is particularly praiseworthy.\n\nBut that's not all, Little Busters is filled with intrigue thanks to an overarching mystery that gradually presents itself throughout the various character routes, culminating in the most incredible final route of any visual novel I've read. And then there's the EX routes which are available in English for the very first time!\n\nIf you open the game and you find the characters and dialogue very annoying, maybe Little Busters isn't for you. But if you find it charming and funny, stick with it, because you're only going to fall deeper and deeper in love with all the cast. Little Busters is one of my favourite works of fiction ever, and if even just a few new people come to experience it through this release, then I'd be very happy.\n\nIf you love beautifully written stories featuring a wide cast of immensely lovable characters, then I hope you'll give this wonderful visual novel a chance.\n\nThere's also a secret ending about the school getting taken over by muscle mania, that's a thing.", "timestamp_created": 1509527743, "timestamp_updated": 1509716410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 238, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.907583", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36186454": {"recommendationid": "36186454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076528273", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510384074}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this stands ups with some of the other better pieces of fiction ever written.

it worked. Hopefully that gets fixed soon and the game will still work if you have surround sound on...\n\nOther than that, this is without a doubt the best visual novel I've ever played. \nKey and Jun Maeda are truly geniuses when it comes to manipulating the emotions of the player.\n\nAt first glance, the game might seem a bit cliche with the basic scenario of the protagonist being a normal guy meeting a bunch of girls and helping them out, but the core of this story is so much more than that. \nThe characters and their interactions are absurdly fun and draw you in like no other.\n\nIt's a LONG game, but it's worth it for sure.\n\nThat's the game content itself, but now that I've played this version a bit I can talk about the port.\n\nHonestly, I'm not a fan of this HD version. The game is better off being 4:3 instead of 16:9.\nAll the CGs are zoomed in on to get them widescreen, and in order to see the whole image you have to hide the text box and scroll back with the mouse wheel.\n\nIn addition to that, there's a bunch of options missing from the game menus and keyboard shortcuts that it doesn't tell you about. Things like 'A' for auto mode and 'Q' for going back to the last choice.\nThe manual tells you about the shortcuts, but you can't remap them in-game.\n\nThe original game engine used the same menus and layout as Clannad, which is also on Steam, and I think that version worked better.\nThis port caters too much to touch screens for my liking, and switching the aspect ratio was a mistake in my opinion.\n\nBad port aside, this is still my favorite visual novel, and if you're the type of person who can fall in love with fun and quirky characters and get immersed in a lengthy story that drags you through an emotional roller coaster, then this game is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1509521537, "timestamp_updated": 1513016080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633513", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39305280": {"recommendationid": "39305280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198288570456", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 259, "last_played": 1515908014}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u4f60\u8ddf\u8c93\u6709\u4ec7\u55ce\uff01\u8c93\u8b93\u4f60\u60f3\u8d77\u4ec0\u9ebc\u4e0d\u597d\u7684\u56de\u61b6\u55ce\uff01\u7406\u6a39\u6211\u8a0e\u53ad\u4f60\uff01\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1515841034, "timestamp_updated": 1515841034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39299771": {"recommendationid": "39299771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357314542", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1258, "last_played": 1516199131}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u5fc3\u304c\u7652\u3084\u3055\u308c\u308b\u795e\u30b2\u30fc\u306a\u306e\u3067\u30a6\u30a9\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8\u306b\u8cb7\u3048\u308b\u5206\u306e\u91d1\u304c\u4f59\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u306a\u3089\u8cb7\u3046\u3079\u304d", "timestamp_created": 1515821844, "timestamp_updated": 1515821844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39276951": {"recommendationid": "39276951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126850489", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 5062, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511373772}, "language": "english", "review": "I think it is impossible to discuss the value of Little Busters! without focusing on how it achieves to be a successful emotional ride. Did I cry or was I moved? Yeah, I did, something like seven years ago when I first read it. This time around, after the Steam release, I found myself much less impressed by some portions of drama which, admittedly, oftentimes feel just thrown around for the sake of exasperating the melodrama. Also, the plot is mostly goofy and juvenile, some nice spins are given here and there, while the prose does its job it is largely mediocre, and if you won\u2019t find the humour and the chemistry between the characters compelling you\u2019re in for a tour de force rather than a pleasant tale about friendships.\n\nHowever, the thing about the power of Little Busters! is how being aware of all of its shortcomings doesn\u2019t affect my appreciation of the work Visual Art\u2019s did here, at all. Maybe Little Busters! wouldn\u2019t work magnificently as a story, but it sure is impressive as a visual novel: whilst many similar works would limit themselves to introduce characters and let you focus on a fixated path following which one interested you the most, Little Busters! add far more branch and choices, sometimes seemingly pointless, to let the player experience a bountiful of side contents, comedic or lore-related vignettes, and secrets hidden all over the place that just ask to be found. There\u2019s also the gameplay, in the form of several quick mini-games which range from baseball practice to a fighting tournament, from hunting down mysterious creatures (which give a pretty hilarious insight on the character of Kyousuke) to serving in a cafeteria. And the impressive thing is how all of these are plot related, not because how the gameplay fits into the story but how because how much they reciprocally influence each other. I can\u2019t emphasize enough how I adore the way this novel build around its theme by slightly changing, after each playthrough, some minor bits of it to give a more concrete idea of the characters changing and developing after major events, and the more obvious way to notice this would be, in fact, to check the protagonists\u2019 stats at the beginning of each tournament.\n\nAs the story is in its surface state, I wouldn\u2019t think much of it beside it being a heart-warming bildungsroman focused on friendship, but the care put into its every detail, from the immense content hidden in it to the game direction heavily helping the narrative with a pretty fitting musical score and spot-on CG events, raised it to being of my favourite product of its medium.", "timestamp_created": 1515750434, "timestamp_updated": 1515750434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39250871": {"recommendationid": "39250871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259742498", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4606, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4116, "last_played": 1516230635}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost 30 hours in and not even close to finishing the thing yet, probably not even a third.\nSo far, best part was mysterious and cool upperclassmen girl losing a fight to a cute little girl playing with her dogs (not even atacking) by wearing 3D glasses and fainting from the shock of looking at said little girl.\nFew minutes after, they had a rematch and the upperclassmen girl used a machine gun this time around.\n10/10, would recommend.\n\nEdit: 70 hours in and still got a looooooot to go through.", "timestamp_created": 1515659672, "timestamp_updated": 1516085162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39227562": {"recommendationid": "39227562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068244384", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1935, "last_played": 1515962794}, "language": "english", "review": "Send help", "timestamp_created": 1515578030, "timestamp_updated": 1515578030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39225309": {"recommendationid": "39225309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043785358", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1152, "last_played": 1515651728}, "language": "english", "review": "i can never read this for the first time again", "timestamp_created": 1515567865, "timestamp_updated": 1515567865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581749", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39182014": {"recommendationid": "39182014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107421824", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7910, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1675, "last_played": 1516220495}, "language": "english", "review": "2 months / +60 hours / 0 regrets / \u221e feels", "timestamp_created": 1515420207, "timestamp_updated": 1515420207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39133051": {"recommendationid": "39133051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043124881", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7559, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1209, "last_played": 1515642608}, "language": "english", "review": "Minigames added a lot more fun to the game.

And while it's not quite what I hoped for, in the end I can say that it deserves its reputation.\n\nLittle Busters is focused on a group of characters who form a baseball team. It consists of five childhood friends and a growing number of additional female members (who make up most of the heroines). A large part of the game (one of the best parts, actually) is devoted to their interaction with each other, whether they're just talking with each other, practice for the upcoming baseball match or just fooling around. The game does a good job in representing every main character and make them sympathetic, before things get real. Some may become annoying, but I ended up even caring about the ones I didn't think much of at first.\n\nAfter all that come the character routes and... that's where the biggest problem with this VN is. While they vary a lot, most of them are pretty underwhelming, especially after Clannad, which has pretty strong character routes, and aside from two (one of them only in hindsight), none of them really left me satisfied by the end. While none of them are outright bad or uninteresting, they ended up pretty disappointing.\n\nHowever, it's still worth it to go through all of them, as at the end waits Refrain, the main part (aside from the common route) of the VN. In typical Key manner, it takes the characters you've come to love and puts them through the wringer, tests their newfound strength and reveals a tragedy that turns everything upside down. While the character routes aren't that good, Refrain is a great conclusion that pays off everything.\n\nThis version of Little Busters contains three additional routes, that originally appeared in Little Busters EX, and are unlocked after finishing Refrain (and really shouldn't be read before it, either way). While they're not amazing either, I found they're of a more consistent quality than the main routes and all of them are quite enjoyable. One is a continuation of one of character routes (and really improves on it), another is pretty much the predecessor of Angel Beats and the other one is particularly interesting if you like cats (but probably not so much if you hate them). None of them are necessary, but all of them are nice and worthwhile additions.\n\nA surprisingly large, but not really important, part are the minigames. None of them are necessary to progress, LB is a pure visual novel in that regard, but success can unlock additional scenes. And they're generally quite fun, but the baseball practice in particular can be quite time-consuming and monotonous when you start the game over all the time (which you really should do after finishing a route, as the common route constantly changes).\n\nThe art is really good, much better than in Clannad (and not just because of an additional artist). The adjustement to widescreen is a bit odd, though, as the CGs are still in the old format and merely zoomed in to fit the screen. It's not a big deal, though, as they still show everything important and can be zoomed out to see the full artwork.\n\nThe music, while good, is somewhat underwhelming, especially after Clannad's more consistent soundtrack. However, it grew on me with time, there's still lots of good stuff and the most important tracks are real standout pieces. The voice acting, however, is great. All voices fit well to their characters and hit all necessary emotional ranges. Only real flaw is that the protagonist is only partially voiced, not unusual for VNs, but still rather disappointing.\n\nDespite underwhelming character routes, Little Buster is a great visual novel with a strong beginning and end, carried by a cast of sympathetic characters. Recommended for fans of VNs (although those are probably already aware of it) and people interested in the medium.", "timestamp_created": 1516365365, "timestamp_updated": 1516365365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39438976": {"recommendationid": "39438976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387696119", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2972, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2365, "last_played": 1516372571}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u679c\u7136Little Busters!\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u8aaa\n\u7406\u6a39\u96d6\u7136\u662f\u500b\u7537\u751f\u4f46\u6a23\u8c8c\u76f8\u7576\u53ef\u611b\n\u52d5\u756b\u7248\u672c\u7684Little Busters!\u7684\u8072\u512a\u5c31\u6700\u559c\u6b61\u807d\u4e86~", "timestamp_created": 1516290727, "timestamp_updated": 1516290727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39432075": {"recommendationid": "39432075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067807858", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515375578}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Ya lo habia jugado en la  versi\u00f3n espa\u00f1ol, antes de que lo pusieran en Steam, yo compro todo lo de Key ya que me gusta todo lo que ellos sacan, tanto anime, sound track y novelas visuales, seguire comprando todos sus productos que est\u00e9n a mi alcance.\n\nExcelente Novela Visual ;D\nLa recomiendo enormemente.", "timestamp_created": 1516266619, "timestamp_updated": 1516266619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39597043": {"recommendationid": "39597043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334112794", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 64, "last_played": 1516853996}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] Do you know the secret to this world? [/h1]\n\nMade by the same people who brought you Angel Beats! and CLANNAD, Little Busters! is one of the most impactful visual novels I have ever had the privilege of reading. With its gripping storytelling and emotional plotlines, this is a visual novel that I highly encourage anyone to read. Originally I thought this was another comedic slice of life VN, however, I have never been proven more wrong in my life. Little Busters! will take you on a wild journey, where you will experience many emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and grief. In the end, you will walk away knowing that you have experienced one of the greatest stories ever written. \n\nOne of my favourite parts about Little Busters! is the soundtrack. Personally, I care a lot about a game's soundtrack and Little Busters! has some of the best OSTs I have ever heard. The soundtracks do an amazing job of setting the mood in scenes. This is especially apparent during the emotional scenes, where the soundtrack plays a very important role in allowing the reader to fully immerse themselves into the experience. A good soundtrack can make the difference between a good VN, and a great VN. \n\nLittle Busters! has a cast of very memorable characters. All the characters in Little Busters! are well-written, and on the surface they may appear a certain way, but as one reads further into the VN, they will discover all the layers and depth that is behind said character. I enjoyed how Little Busters! made all the character relationships very intricate and detailed. There is so much to discover about the characters, their backstories, and where they come from. The more time I spent reading this VN and interacting with the characters, the more intimate I felt with all them. Little Busters! does an exceptional job of creating bonds between the reader, and its cast, where everything comes into play for the final route known as Refrain. \n\nThe story is masterfully crafted, and very layered. I expected nothing less from Key, who is remarkable at storytelling. In short, it is about a young boy known as Riki Naoe. As a child, Riki suffered from depression, but was saved by a group of four kids who called themselves \"The Little Busters.\" Now in high school, they all attend the same school and the story tells of Riki's adventures with the Little Busters, as well as his high school life. Containing over eighty hours of playtime, I am astonished by how lengthy this game was and it only adds to my already immense respect for it. From witty jokes, to extremely heavy and serious scenes, Little Busters! has it all. The story is very detailed, and there is a lot to take in. \n\nI will never forget my time with Little Busters! It is without a doubt one of my favourite visual novels I have read, and I hope it will be the same for you. Little Busters! left a mark on me, and it taught me many valuable lessons. It contains many themes, some of which one could even relate to. I will always hold Little Busters in high regard because of the experience I had, as well as the unbreakable bonds I have forged with its characters. If I could erase my memory to experience something for the first time again, it would have to be this visual novel. \n\nI usually don't post reviews, but I made an exception for this one. If you read all the way to the end, I thank you for your time and hope you decide to take on the unforgettable journey that is Little Busters!", "timestamp_created": 1516854935, "timestamp_updated": 1516854935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39548203": {"recommendationid": "39548203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057709250", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515207777}, "language": "english", "review": "I played it a little it's pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1516675961, "timestamp_updated": 1516675961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

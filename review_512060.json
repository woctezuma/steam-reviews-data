The homeland of the wonderful and giving leaders, who will soon unite the world, saving everyone from the \"horrible\" westerners and their capitalist agendas.\n\nBut in all honesty, this game is an amazing parody of the game \"Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~\". You play as (your name here) as you venture to North Korea, where you meet your two pen pals while you were in Vietnam. But surprise (not really), they're actually two anime girls! Eunji, the tsundere on her period and Jeong, the cheerful and flirty one. You choose from different locations in North Korea where you're accompanied by one of the two girls, who then help explain the locations to you. From what I know, there are three different endings on which you can achieve. Happy huntings fellas!\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is decent. It's certainly not the worst, but there's nothing really interesting about the music either (besides the names). I would personally wait for the soundtrack to go on sale before buying it. The CGs, on the other hand, are beautiful. On their Kickstarter page, they stated that they worked with the same people responsible for the original sprites for Huniepop. Their backgrounds are also amazing. \n\nThe story and dialogue are full of fourth wall breaks and jokes about the game itself, along with North Korea. The developer knew this game was a joke itself (the concept) and has taken it upon themselves to exploit that, making the game both funny and unique. The facts in the game are interesting, and I've learned a few new things about North Korea that I never know before. \n\nFactoring in the game\u2019s price and quality, I\u2019d give it an 8.4/10. Its concept allows for a funny and interesting game, educating the player about certain locations in the (crazed) country of North Korea. It includes beautiful art, and for being 10 dollars, can offer multiple hours of gameplay (depending on how fast you read). I would recommend this to a friend.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515289764, "timestamp_updated": 1515289764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39128194": {"recommendationid": "39128194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046428428", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515169318}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0435 - \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u0412\u0430\u0439\u0444\u0443", "timestamp_created": 1515266159, "timestamp_updated": 1515266159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39114392": {"recommendationid": "39114392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088180978", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11541, "last_played": 1516367914}, "language": "english", "review": "This is literally the best game i have ever played in my entire life.

On the other hand, the whole story plays in a rather difficult country.\n\n[b] [h1] If you have a problem with dark humor or dislike political incorrect jokes this game is definitely not for you. But if you are a person who can make jokes about the former German Nazi regime and starving kids in Africa you will definitely enjoy this too.[/h1][/b]\n\n[url=http://imgur.com/gallery/Gd8CW] If you agree with whats being said there, I wouldn't recommend this game to you!\n [/url]\n\nThe story begins with you arriving in North Korea. In your mind, you think that you'll get picked up by two dudes who will go drinking with you in the evening. In reality, you get picked up by 2 military police officers and have to stay with them at their \"home\". Not the vacation you had in mind but you still have a great time every day taking one of them out to, as they call it \"dates\". You get to see some parts of North Korea and you get to know the utter hate towards Japan and South Korea, those two girls have. As somebody who comes from America, the technology seems utterly old. At one time you are not even sure if you are in Nort Korea or in the old Soviet Union. This difference in culture and technology is a great platform for some good jokes. Not to forget the classic Dating Sim jokes, which are present in almost every dating sim.\n\n\n\nI'm an insanely fast reader and finished this game in roughly 3~ hours. I've only finished one ending and read up on the other 3 since I dislike multiple endings. If you are a slow reader who wants to finish every ending it will take you about 6 - 8 hours at max. I wouldn't say that those 10 Bucks are worth it. \nBuy it when it's on sale for like 5-6 then I would definitely recommend it.\nIt's nothing which you absolutely have to play so wait till it's on sale!

from DEVGRU-P, but they certainly delivered what I was expecting. Two beautiful girls, a tour of Best Korea, and some of the greatest comedy experiences I've seen in ages. If you like the sort of humour the steam page has, then you will love the style the VN has. Stay! Stay! DPRK is amazing at what it does, and a unique experience that can't be replicated.\n\nMy breakdown:\n\nPROS:\n+Comedy. Some of the funniest satire I've seen, coupled with a great protagonist and an amazing setting, it really makes it an amazingly fun read.\n+Character Arcs. Considering I came into this expecting nothing, the characters were rather believable in their own way, and their development was really well done considering one route takes about 6 hours, and that isn't a lot of time to work with when you are trying to deliver a primarily satirical script.\n+Unique. Never even considered a VN like this could have existed. Definitely an experience.\n+CGs/Sprites. Great art, but there really isn't enough of it to score it higher.\n\nCONS:\n-Limited Replayability. Only 4 possible routes (Eunji, Jeong, Neutral and Bad), which can be done in about 12 hours if you take out all the repeat text.\n-No Voice Acting. I've been spoiled by a lot of other VNs, so hearing silence when someone is meant to be speaking is kind of immersion breaking.\n-Limited Sprites. One of the few repeating characters doesn't even have a sprite, which kind of kills some of the power the final few scenes have.\n-Unneccessary Character. The writers added a largely pointless character, with a sprite, who appears in like, two scenes normally. Not only was she pointless and obtrusive to the story, but the money used on her sprite could have been used for the aforementioned spriteless character.\n\n-Scores-\nStory: 5\nCharacters: 7\nArt: 6\nMusic: 5\nEnjoyment: 8\n\nOverall: 6/10\n\ntl;dr, read through the steam page.

It really bugs me that \"lol he jerks off to cartoons\" is the default reaction, I think it shows how elevated we are to be able to use our imaginations and get off from otherworldly scenarios instead of inane pizza guy or \"there must be some way you let me pass the exam\" nonsense.\nI alone have probably logged 500 hours on dating sims alone and that's not even counting hentai. What's amazing is that the first dating sim I ever played was only 3mb but gave me the most erotic day of my life, it was the fact that you really felt you earned the sex and were directly engaged with the women instead of just a passive observer that did it for me. You really do need walkthroughs to get the good endings though, after I anally raped the female security guard with a taser to get the passcode to save my crush and I'm anticipating a hot night of \"my hero!\" sex the two younger sisters, your teacher and a couple of random skanks run up all pregnant and shit and ask if you're going to marry them and the older sister gets mad and runs away. Turns out you needed to wear a condom, already jerked off 6 times already but was more than willing to give it another playthrough.\nSo worth it, you do actually get to have sex with your true love but she cries and just lies there, but in the good ending she's a total nymph and you both orgasm many times before collapsing in each others arms and feel at peace with the world. Sort of night where you wake up to Claire De Lune.\nThen there's Bible Black, holy fuck do you need a walkthrough to get the good endings there, one minor dialogue choice can fuck you over. Some of the bad endings are fucking hot though, like when you don't save the school and you get to see them get fucked by 80 guys before she pulls open her loose holes and says \"wanna give it a go honey\" and when you do she stabs you with poison. Or when your classmate ends up passed out in the hospital cause you misused black magic, and after you pull back the sheet and find her naked you jack off all over her body and just leave instead of wiping up she seduces you on the roof, then jams a cutip down your cock and fucks you till you die.\nBest game is True Love story though, it's an rpg where you level up stats like sports to get the athletic girl, art to get the arty girl etc, and actually take them out on dates and force yourself too make up your mind. there's no enemas or tentacles or any of that good stuff, . You really take hours to develop a relationship with a girl and agonize over whether your actions will impress her and you start to blush whenever you have a random encounter with her and when you do make love it feels like the culmination of something beautiful. It's the closest approximation of how a real romantic and sexual relationship develops I have ever seen in a dating sim. Don't worry, I haven't given up on real women, right now twitch streamer Gamecatt is the closest I have seen to an IRL dating sim \"final boss\" and if I do end up meeting and charming her into a relationship, I will have 10+ years of NASA grade sim training to thank.", "timestamp_created": 1511437156, "timestamp_updated": 1511437156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5,

(Many presses have made major reports and life interviews on North Korea matters) Stretching too far for the meme only spoils the story, brings it a more imagenary state of NK we \"expect\" to see. Would be better to set environment as reality and add jokes on them, because what really triggers one to laugh is the ridiculous reality in North Korea, not the meme.\n\nNevertheless, as someone rarely touched any Galgame, I recommend this game for interesting political satire and WAIFUS.  \n\n[i]P.S.

I won't spoil the story, mind you, but the whole game is amazing, it is just that you don't get a sense of satisfaction of your ending, it feels like the story will be continued in another game or the devs didn't thought it out well on how it should end.

Eunji is the best tsundere I had the pleasure with in years if not ever! This game has a very rare if not crazy premise but that only adds to both the comedy and it being interesting. What leads me to the more serious aspects of the game: As funny this game might be, it's also pretty accurate on both the history and political stuff presented ingame.

And I've found some seriously good writing, appropriately creepy totalitarian undertones and pretty impactful ending that made the whole story much more than just a distasteful joke many people make it out to be. \n\nWhile not a serious piece of political critique (or a serious romance when we look at that part of the equation), \u201cStay! Stay! DPRK\u201d both manages to keep you entertained and smuggles a decent amount of information and insight into the reality of North Korea. While not dark enough to truly portray it and not without some factual mistakes, it\u2019s actually decently researched and the storytelling is solid enough that it never feels like just an empty joke, exploiting the controversies it unavoidably creates by the sheer virtue of its setting. \n\nAlso, without the 18+ patch (wasn\u2019t interested in it really) even the fanservice seemed mild and rare enough to not make the game feel like an offensive excuse for Hentai scenes, and really those NSFW moments made a tiny fraction of the content presented. It also directly parodied \u201cGo! Go! Nippon\u201d with some of those scenes and they worked more as meta-jokes than actual fanservice for me. While the story is short, both girls were developed just well enough to not feel like empty silhouettes with boobs attaches \u2013 I actually liked them quite a lot by the end of the story and cared about what was going to happen to them. Authors of the game joke about it working as porn, but I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s the case, or at least it\u2019s far from being its main focus.\n\nEven the production qualities had me positively surprised for a $10 VN, with the sprites, backgrounds and event-related illustrations being of a very nice quality (even if the very small cast of characters made it rather easy to achieve). Music didn\u2019t catch my attention very much, but also never got in the way. In summary, [b]I think this VN is worthy of recommendation, if you\u2019re OK with some dark humor and don\u2019t get offended by the topic itself. The optional 18+ patch gives you choice of how you want to experience it and the base content itself is surprisingly solid. If you approach it with open mind, it can provide you 6-7 hours of very decent entertainment, more or less worth the asking price and definitely worth it when bought on sale.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1503444988, "timestamp_updated": 1504525874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34225486": {"recommendationid": "34225486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053563332", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502748415}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly this was probably the best $11 i spent", "timestamp_created": 1502669278, "timestamp_updated": 1502676433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34206657": {"recommendationid": "34206657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044492109", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503381927}, "language": "english", "review": "changed my name to Kim Jong Un.

Stay! DPRK is a humoristic anime-styled visual novel. While not very long - it took me 3 hours to complete - the game is pretty decent for what it is; a \"Go! Go! Nippon!\" parody. A good one at that. Why is it a \"Go! Go! Nippon!\" Parody? Because the entire game is pretty much the same thing, only that instead of Japan (Nippon) you are in North Korea (True Korea!). \n\nThe basic Plotline is the same thing as in \"Go! Go! Nippon!\". You are an American US Marine in the \"Waterdog\" unit (which in real life specializes on water treatment) and you know some penpal friends in the DPRK. Upon arriving there, you realize that your 2 male friends are not male, but 2 female soldiers in the Korean People's Army. \n\nAs I guess characters tend to be in visual novels, the protagonist is the most blatant, unrelatable and naive character you've ever seen, and the game utilizes this for it's humor and some stereotype-jokes. However, the game doesn't take itself too seriously overall, and 4th wall breaking is a constant thing through the Protagonist's thoughts and almost every character's knowledge of the meta level and the 4th wall. \n\nBesides the humorous storytelling, the inside jokes that an unaware reader might skip, and the hilariously cliche-fueled perspective of North Korea, the game also allows you to actually date the 2 main girls/waifus, Jeong and Eunji. While that doesn't influence the story too much - the story that only really comes into play in the last 15 minutes anyway - it is still a nice aspect that is fun on one hand, as well as another cliche on the huge pile of stereotypes this game reinforces.\n\nGame also features some CGs of the girls besides the normal dialogue artwork, fap potential still limited however.\n\nOverall good game.", "timestamp_created": 1500051650, "timestamp_updated": 1500051650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459259", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33471787": {"recommendationid": "33471787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055055887", "num_games_owned": 801, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499754429}, "language": "english", "review": "It was good", "timestamp_created": 1499835628, "timestamp_updated": 1499835628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33457066": {"recommendationid": "33457066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140570732", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514468155}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is very funny!but I think most people would like to see the 18+ scene,but not me, because I'll keep recording it!", "timestamp_created": 1499782998, "timestamp_updated": 1499782998, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33427419": {"recommendationid": "33427419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273464899", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499681726}, "language": "english", "review": "Not Enough Gunny 1/10", "timestamp_created": 1499682447, "timestamp_updated": 1499682447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573944", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33424971": {"recommendationid": "33424971", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992636376", "num_games_owned": 410, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499635302}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]\u00abMake Waifus great again!\u00bb[/i]\n- Big Man Tyrone, actual General Secretary of the Korean Worker's Party\n\nAfter playing [i]Panzermadels[/i], DEVGRU-P's previous Visual Novel, I kept my expectations quite low for this one. The former game just seemed too rushed, low-budget and not very rewarding at the end of the day.\n\nTurns out I was wrong on this one!\n\n[b]Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea![/b] is actually a pretty decent Visual Novel, and a polished one at that. It has a very decent UI, detailed widescreen backgrounds, gorgeous CGs and sprites. Even the music is on-par with some of the professional VNs from Japan, with the catchy main menu theme sticking out. Speaking of that one, why are the lyrics in JAPANESE INVADER PIG-DOG LANGUAGE?\n\nApart from that expect a standard visual novel with two girl routes. If you already played visual novels before, you know the deal. Focus on one girl, make decisions in favor of her and make her your waifu. Or don't choose any of the two girls like the indecisive wuss you are.\n\nWhat really makes this game unique is the setting though. No other video game comes into mind where you're able to daytrip North Korea, especially not if we consider the current news headlines regarding the bizarre East-Asian dictatorship.\n\nThe game puts you in the shoes of [i][insert your name][/i], an American veteran of the Afghanistan war who's about to visit his two penpals in North Korea. Well, turns out that his penpals [i]Joeng[/i] and [i]Eunji[/i] are in fact two busty sisters just waiting to put the protagonist in a harem situation and to show him around the country.\n\nWhile the story is clearly a black comedy with a grain of seriousness, you can definitely sense that the developers or at least the script writers took some effort by studying real-life North Korea. If you already read about stories from travelers who undertook trips to North Korea, you may recognise many details. In fact you may even learn a new thing or two about one of the world's most isolated countries.\n\nTo see all of the endings and CGs you'll need about 6 hours.

Stay! DPRK!\" is a well written, self -aware comedy/adult VN set in one of the most enigmatic and unconventional settings in the world. While it is not perfect, and a bit light on the \"adult content\" for my taste, the characters are well written, the dialogue is funny, and the setting is unique.\n\nYou will need to suspend your disbelief pretty heavily going into this game. You play as a US marine who is visiting North Korea on vacation to meet up with penpals he met online. All of this is completely ridiculous and impossible, but hey, that's what we're doing, so just go with it. Upon arrival at the airport you discover your two penpals you assumed were male, are actually 2 beautiful sisters. You'll spend your weeklong vacation with the two of them, navigating both North Korean culture, and the girls' personalities.\n\nThis is a VN, not a true \"game\" so you'll be spending most of your time reading. That being said, there are a few choices to be made and (I've only played through once) I think there are multiple endings, so I believe your choices do effect the final outcome. I'll have to do a second playthrough to be sure. One critisism is that one of the main characters as a plot point has terrible english, and speaks (text speaks, there is no voice acting) with a heavy accent in the first scene. Then, she magically speaks perfect (mostly) english throughout the rest of the story, even though the other characters continue to reference her \"terrible english\". It kinda breaks the immersion, and I wish they'd have kept the accent through the whole story. [spoiler] Also, the ending I ended up with got VERY dark, VERY fast, and ended pretty abruptly. Maybe there are more endings, but that kind of didn't fit with the rest of the game, and didn't leave me feeling satisfied with the end. Still, I enjoyed the ride.[/spoiler]\n\nGiven that it's a VN, I won't say much else about the story so I don't ruin anything for anyone. Besides, we both know why you're really here. There is a free (bonus points for being free!) patch availible from the developer that adds the nude scenes back into the game that steam made them take out. That being said, in my entire playthrough, I only saw 2 nude scenes, and none involving actual sex. Maybe it's possible to get more with different endings, but be warned, there may not be as much \"adult content\" as you might be expecting.\n\nIf you've read this far, you're obviously someone who's interested, and likely someone who's played VNs before. If that's the case I would say buy the game. It's funny, It's entertaining, and there is replayability. I may update this review after my second playthrough, just to confirm that there are multiple endings, and if they include more \"adult content\", but even without that, I'd still say it's worth a playthrough if you're a fan of the genre.\n\n*UPDATE* 9-1-2017\nI have replayed the game a few times and can confirm there are multiple endings. [spoiler] Two of them are basically the same, and the other two (including the one I got in my original playthrough are \"bad\" endings. I would say the endings are the weakest point of the game. The ride was fun, but all endings left me feeling disapointed. Also while there is technically sex, it just consists of a nude pic, and textual implications. Nothing more.

Not that he is complaining. During his stay in [strike]North Korea[/strike] the one [b]True Korea[/b], his female friends, acting like tour guides, accompany him to see various sights and cities of [strike]a totalitarian hell-hole with crushing poverty and human rights violations[/strike] the greatest country on Earth.\n\nIf you are reading this, then you probably already know that this is a parody/comedy game. Specifically, it is a parody of the visual novel [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/251870/Go_Go_Nippon_My_First_Trip_to_Japan/]Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~[/url][/i] (2011), one of the more well-known, though some might say infamous, visual novel offerings available on Steam.\n\nHaving previously played and very much enjoyed DEVGRU-P's hilarious parody game [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/379980/Panzermadels_Tank_Dating_Simulator/]Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator[/url][/i] (2016), I looked forward to seeing what they would come up with in [i]Stay! Stay! Democratic People's Republic of Korea![/i] Suffice it to say that I was not disappointed. Everything that made [i]Panzermadels[/i] a great parody game is improved upon in this release.\n\nTo start off, the art in this game is very well done. I initially went into this expecting sub-par art since it is a parody game, but my expectations were exceeded. Indeed, everything from the character designs, backgrounds, and CGs are beautifully done as would be expected of any professional visual novel. The music is also a nice treat as it adds to the experience of the game.\n\nHowever, the main reason anyone is going to be playing this game is for the writing and humor. This is where the game truly excels. From beginning to end, there is almost non-stop laughs at the various types of humor in the game. Many points in the game lampoon [i]Go! Go! Nippon![/i] and otaku-pandering from the contrived premise to fascination over minor things. Perhaps one of my favorite jokes is the overly-elaborate description the protagonist offers of a \"plain and ordinary\" toilet, parodying a scene in [i]Go! Go! Nippon![/i] where a character is amazed over a Japanese toilet. But besides the direct parodies, there is also a lot of satire in the game of North Korean life such as the cult of personality surrounding the \"Glorious Leader\" and various other things North Korea has been involved in over the years. There are also various self-referential jokes such as making fun of visual novels in general and some hilarious fourth-wall jokes. Really, there is so much humor you really just have to play and experience it for yourself.\n\nBecause this is a parody game, there is not really much of a story going on. There is a twist that happens much later on and there is a bit of a plot near the end, but it does not really amount to much. Overall, there are four separate endings you can achieve in this game depending on what choices you make during play.\n\nIn my review of [i]Panzermadels[/i], one of my gripes was with the poor interface. However, I was happy to see that DEVGRU-P really stepped up their game in this regard and really polished the interface. You have the option to skip text that has already been read and more than enough save slots.\n\nIn addition to the content available in the game, there is also an adult patch made available just recently, and I played the version with it. It adds some nudity to a few scenes that previously had none. It does not really add or subtract anything from the game unless you really enjoy seeing anime-style nudity.\n\nIf there are any criticisms I have of this game, it would be that, despite the amount of laughs I got, some of the jokes did not always work. For example, Eunji is written as a parody of the tsundere archetype character and this is referenced multiple times. It was funny at first, but after a while it started feeling a little tired.

Hell, some of the backgrounds are even wallpaper-worthy, I'd say. Considering they were working with less than the average price of a used car, I'd say they did a good job.\n\nCharacters, save for one person you meet towards the end, are fairly predictable. Not to say the story they tell isn't interesting, but as previous reviews have mentioned, your two choices are fairly archetypal. \n\nSo what type of story do they tell? Surely you're curious how North Korea is portrayed in this piece of media. Satire is heavily employed, but for those who can't interpret that, there's also plenty of reminders that this is indeed North Korea, and therefore not a good place to live or visit. You aren't getting the wrong idea just because anime girls are on the screen and in uniform. I figured out fairly early why I was there, but didn't fully piece it together until the end. Despite its predictability, the going from tourist destination to tourist destination with the girls was fun! Be sure to stop by the Pueblo for a great photo of our sailors giving their detainers the respect they deserve.\n\nOverall, I'm bad at numbers, so I'd just say it's a quirky game that made me laugh out loud at the lighthearted parts and yell at my own mistakes towards the end.

It\u2019s not the best visual novel of its type out there, but it\u2019s definitely far from the worst. The humor and surprisingly unsettling insight into True Best North Korea made this game much more intriguing and entertaining than I would have thought at a first glance.\n\nAltogether though, both girls are somewhat lacking in depth. While more aspects are hinted at least a little bit in places, most of the time the game plays it completely straight with the characters. You\u2019ll largely know what they\u2019re like within the first five minutes of the game just from cliches and tropes alone. That doesn\u2019t make them uninteresting, mind you, just somewhat predictable.\n\nEven with that said, the humor and cute interactions are generally entertaining enough to keep the game from being dull. Couple that with the above sections regarding Korea itself, as well as some nice art, and you've really got something. While I\u2019m not about to take to forums and start declaring who I think is Best Girl, I did enjoy my time with both options.\n\nAmidst all the humor and romantic interludes, there was a genuine sense of unease that affected both the protagonist and the player.

Just once or twice is enough, guys. Any more and it ceases to be funny. Especially if it's the same joke. Yeah, we get it, you guys had a low art budget. I also feel like we should have gotten a good deal more content for the $10 price. 6 hours just doesn't cut it. Also, the ending felt a bit rushed and contrived.

The dynamic between the protagonist and the two sisters works well and aided in drawing me into the story.  I ended up playing this game to the end, and found myself caring the the characters. It wasnt just another case of me going through the flow of beating another video game.  Well done.\n\nFirst Impression Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bh5PVlbrg44\n\nI recorded about 40 minutes worth of gameplay, but then decided to finish playing the game off camera.  I'm glad I did, as the story became more interesting and I developed an attachment to the characters.  All in all, this has a good amount of humor, relates to current events in the world, and even has a heart warming ending (at least mine was).\n\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\n-Good writing\n-Good grammer and mastery of English language\n-Fun plot/storyline\n-Multiple endings\n-Great artstyle\n-Good soundtrack\n-Enjoyed it's relability to todays events\n\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\n-$10 feels a bit steep\n-Please don't make the F1 key window the game, most recording software use F1 to begin recording.\n-On my 3rd day in the game, a lot of dialogue seemed like it was meant for the 2nd day.

If you've played Panzermadels, you know what you're in for. It's  unique, numerous fourth wall moments, and a silly script. It's always a good thing to see a developer having fun with their projects, Stay! Stay! is no different. This outing is a step ahead Panzermadels in animation quality, characters, and story. \n\nWhile certainly on a budget, Stay! Stay! gives you two girls ( Jeong and Eunji ) to pal around Pyongyang with for a week, most days consist of choosing where to take a girl on a date, the story progresses via routes taken like most VNs. Both girls carry classic anime girl tropes, but they both have great personalities, so much so it's worth a replay. I found Eunji to be my favorite. \n\nCGs are far better this time around, I'm hoping for a patch in the future, but it's fun without. I also like how the story concluded, it was certainly an ending I was expecting of DEVGRU-P; however it felt far more refined from Panzermadels. Don't get me wrong, I love both games, but Stay! Stay! is superior in every way. \n\nNot much to say outside of buy it if you know what you're going in for. It's lighthearted, silly, and offers a fun little insight in a place we don't know much about; and with cameos from the Gunny, I'm glad they're keeping that tradition alive.

The physics are very believeable and after just a few test games to get used to the feel, I find it utterly convincing. \n\nI played table tennis for my school many, many years ago, but haven't really tried since - mostly due to a lack of space TBH. I was amazed to find that my muscles still remembered how to play after 30+ years, and almost everything that works in reality works in the game. Spin is spot-on as far as I can tell. Only downside is not having a physical table to smash when you're annoyed with a bad shot - I found that out the hard way and have the head wound to prove it.\n\nAI seems pretty decent too. The Amateur level is great for beginners. I can generally beat the Semi-Pro most times. The Pro level wipes the floor with me - I can barely score a point! And there's two more levels after that. I'm sure I'll get better, but it's nice to have a challenging AI. There's a lot of people playing online apparently, but given that I'm actually pretty rubbish, I'll leave them to it until I can hold my own a little better.\n\nOne of the best things is that the Vive controller weighs about the same as a paddle, which really aids the immersion unlike many other VR games. Also makes for a pretty good work-out. After 20 games or so, I'm really building up a sweat! The big plus to that is that I don't have to share my Vive, 'cause no-one wants my cold sweat on their forehead. \n\nOnly real negative is the music, which is not bad per se, just gets very repetative very quickly, but easy to turn it off.

As soon as the opponent hits... your motion of swinging the paddle should be 15% through, when the ball is over the net 60%... and as soon as the ball hits your side of the table, have your paddle swinging right in position at 100%.. Doing this is the best tip I've found. Do it faster and at a forward down angle and you can reflect some super fast curve balls just barely over the net. SO MUCH FUN!\n\nHOLD THE TOP OF THE CONTROLLER with your pointer finger spread along the bottom of the donut thing.. This helps much more for me than holding like a bat or whatever at the bottom.)\n\nAdd me and let's play. Let me know if you have any tips as well!\n\nGo ahead and buy it, then continue reading... First off, you wouldn't think just a simple ping pong game could change your life but, this gives me something to do, AND ENJOY... everyday after a hard days work standing on my feet...\n\nThe learning curve is absolutely perfect. Every match you start to hone your skill bettter and better. Every degree, angle, direction you swing... every speed, return, serve.... It's all so pleasantly detailed.\n\nIf you're looking for an inexpensive game to play over and over and over... that isn't all out balls to the wall taxing like Space Pirate or Racket NX or whatever... This is it. PURE PING PONG...\n\nYou can literally play 3 hours without getting tired. I like to goof off a couple rounds on Semi-Pro to try and see what kind of curve balls and super serves I can pull off... Most likely I lose those matches like 3-11... Then I'll play with what I think is 'safe'... and I'll get like 9-11...\n\nIt's hard for me to play perfect games cuz I like to goof off. It's just so Damn Fun! But I think I've won like 8 out of 100 games. I've played for ~29 hours and really learned a lot.\n\nI'm putting my PRO TIP at the top of this so it helps people. I promise I'm going to play more competitively and serious. I want to start a league. Some people with 300+ hours are awesome to play with. They wipe the floor with me, but I still win a few.\n\nMy next goal is to finally beat Professional Level. Being able to replay is stellar! Very surreal being able to wtch yourself, behind yourself.. Another tip is to 'push' through the ball like your hitting a punching bag.. this puts a lot of spin on it and helps you with your front hand hits. Get good at back hand and front hand hits and you can actually keep the ball on the table for like 100 back-and-forth hits.\n\nThe update has brought many new customizable options.. YET there are alos a couple bugs here and there. Sometimes it hits on the table but I don't get the point. Sometimes I miss the return but swear I should have hit it.\n\nCarrot is an amazing and passionate developer.  He showed me how to download beta and wants us to have a great game.\n\nBUY IT NOW.

Deceptive in the fact that they cannot begin to capture the immersive experience. This game is a perfect example of this... You look at the screenshot and get the impression the game is very mediocre. I bought it, put my headset on, WOW. For the price, this is a very well put together game. The visuals are very appealing, not only that, the game dynamics are phenomenal. I got exactly what I was after, a fun and entertaining workout. This is almost as close to the real game as you're going to get - kudos to the devs. I'm far from a pro table tennis player and could be wrong, but I've played a few games and this just felt right. My only gripe is that you must hold the Oculus touch controller a bit weirdly to get the bat at the right angle. Maybe a setting to angle the bat would be good so that it fits \"naturally\" in your hand. Not that a touch controller will ever feel like a bat.

It also messes up the service order.\n\nSuggestions:\n- More spin action! Feels like I'm playing with a recreational paddle even with Spin setting at max!\n- When AI chops the ball, it has little if no back-spin and it's misleading. \n- AI after Professional Level does unrealistic super-chops. You don't see this in real life. Either top-spin offensive matches or real chop defensive play with back-spin.\n- More environments, please! I'm really getting tired of the same studio room.\n- Different avatars?

This is honestly the closest thing you will get to playing ping pong without playing ping pong.\n\n10/10 like skyrim but with ping pong -ign", "timestamp_created": 1491582367, "timestamp_updated": 1491582367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30994002": {"recommendationid": "30994002", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968506862", "num_games_owned": 790, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1514372986}, "language": "english", "review": "So good your table tennis skills will directly translate into the game and vice versa - fantastic smooth gameplay", "timestamp_created": 1491558466, "timestamp_updated": 1491558466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30992791": {"recommendationid": "30992791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198319098929", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1513774071}, "language": "english", "review": "I had the most realistic experience with it: I balanced the ball on the paddle and as it rolled on it, the vibration of the controller followed the ball!

Also I reckon the need to avoid getting hit by the ball in real table tennis? I.e. an overshot ball need to miss the opponent as well as the table in order to count as a point for the opponent. This could get abused though.\n- More polish in both game and menus. The ultimate would be a \"multiplayer arena\" with multiple tables, where you can play and get up the ranks (physically by moving up tables!), or just watch and cheer on others playing. Also maybe Oculus avatar support?\n-More players! Maybe this game needs better promotion.

I haven\u00b4t played this one much, but I believe I have to write a review because it\u00b4s one of the best VR experiences I have had with the HTC Vive. I played a lot of table tennis before so I knew exactly what to expect and to my surprise, this feels like you were actually playing Table Tennis in real life. The controls feels exactly like a Paddle, it\u00b4s really amazing. I started to play with an amateur AI and he did made some stupid mistakes, but if you start to play well, the AI starts to play better. After a while, I played with a Pro and whoaw, it\u00b4s the third level in the list of 6 in how hard it is, and let me tell you, it\u00b4s hard but so good. He did effects and I\u00b4m almost sure I manage to do some effects too but you really have to work hard to do it well, because it\u00b4s very realistic (it\u00b4s been ages since I played). But depending on how you hit the ball and how hard, the balls reacts like a real ball, it\u00b4s really, REALLY realistic.\n\nAnd the feel of the ball, oh, let me tell you about it. I started to play with the paddle and the ball trying to do some equilibrium and I felt the control vibrate every time I touched the ball, like a real paddle!!! I don\u00b4t know about the oculus controls but people say they feel great. Well, the Vive controls feel exactly like if you had a paddle in your hand, you just use it EXACTLY like a paddle. And what\u00b4s best, you can adjust the position of the table, to the sides, to front or back, to higher or lower, wherever you like, until it\u00b4s in the best position. I don\u00b4t have much space in my room, like 1,50 x 1,50 if much, I believe lower than that, but as you can move the table, you can adjust very small spaces to play and move without concerning you will hit something.\n\nAs other reviewer said, buy it only if you like Table tennis, because is that, table Tennis. I haven\u00b4t played more because I have back problems so I got a backache the next day, but I just didn\u00b4t want to stop, is that good. The mini games are great also, mini games like hit a target with a ball is thrown to you, hit a particular place of the table, hit balls that come from diferente positions and heights. Multiplayer? I don\u00b4t know, I didn\u00b4t use it so no idea, and you don\u00b4t need it, there are levels for the complete beginner to the pros, I didn\u00b4t try the hardest because the pro (that as I said was the third one in level of 6 levels)kick my ass everytime.", "timestamp_created": 1484269757, "timestamp_updated": 1484269757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29214572": {"recommendationid": "29214572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993613698", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484961847}, "language": "english", "review": "love this game so far and plan to play this regularly.  i have probably 20 games between Steam and Oculus Home and this is in my top 3!  phenomenally realistic ping pong experience", "timestamp_created": 1484269424, "timestamp_updated": 1484269424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29213924": {"recommendationid": "29213924", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986584601", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3306, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510322050}, "language": "german", "review": "My first review ever!

My personal killer app for VR! \n\nThe physics are excellent, and the gameplay makes excellent use of 180 degree roomscale setups. I'm playing this with a 2-sensor Oculus Rift setup with 2m x 1.5m play area, which is the minimum recommended area. This is my favorite VR title so far because the gameplay is fun and seems to have a high skill ceiling. Fortunately, lots of VR awkwardness is mitigated thanks simply to the fact that it's table tennis. You don't really have to worry about getting tied in knots, losing trackig due to rotation, or locomotion.\n\nCouple of notes that might help:\n\n1) If you're using an Oculus Rift, you may start the game with the floor at eye-level. You can fix this by repositioning the table, but you can also just run SteamVR setup, which should configure your height correctly.\n\n2) You might need to reposition the table so the edge of the table would be touching your virtual thighs. By default, the table edge seems to be at the front-edge of your play area. That means if you reach in to swing at a ball, you might put your hand through your computer monitor or something. I think serious players stand back quite a bit, but at least on lower difficulty levels, the AI hits short balls often, so you'll often find yourself needing to make swings that are right over the table.\n\n3) You'll want to configure your physical-to-virtual control mapping and it's not totally obvious how to do this. Go into settings and then look down at your paddle hand, and you will see that you can adjust paddle position. Wish more games did this!\n\n4) It actually took me a little while to figure out that you need to squeeze the trigger of your non-paddle hand to spawn a ball so you can serve. I sat in front of the table staring at my AI opponent for longer than I'd like to admit.\n\nLooking forward to the additional environments!", "timestamp_created": 1483665431, "timestamp_updated": 1483665431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29048226": {"recommendationid": "29048226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137781496", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491438843}, "language": "german", "review": "was ich noch erw\u00e4hnenswert finde... da man den tisch nach belieben ausrichten kann, geht es auch ganz komfortabel im sitzen (ausreichend platz links und rechts vorausgesetzt) :) auf jeden fall mein lieblings-vrgame!", "timestamp_created": 1483662107, "timestamp_updated": 1483662107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29038223": {"recommendationid": "29038223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003843067", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483817487}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably the most fun I've had with the Oculus since I got it.

If you don't, this game may not be for you.[/list]\n\nBefore buying this game, I tried VR Sports Challenge from the Touch pre-order bonus. This was fun for 1-2 hours, but never felt like real sports. My expectation when buying Eleven Table Tennis: just another tech demo with unintuitive controls and assists that make every shot magically hit the target. \n\nBut, what a pleasant surprise: The controller is just a paddle! The buttons have no function. [b]The only control is to swing your paddle against the ball[/b]. There are no assists. This is pure physics, the real thing. To make such a direct, raw control scheme is brave because it requires perfect tracking and perfect physics. And to my tremendous delight, both are spot-on. The tracking shows how marvelous the Oculus Touch tracking works (judging from reports of other players, the Vive tracking works equally well). The physics can only be credited to the fantastic work of the developers. Ball and paddle physics are nearly perfect. All kind of spins work as expected. If there are differences to the real world, they are subtle enough to only be noticed by very experienced players.\n\nAs a sport, [b]Table tennis is a perfect fit[/b] to the current generation VR headsets. It requires little room and is played front-facing with minimal movement on the spot. The paddle has comparable size and weight to the motion controller. The ball is small and light enough to make the controller haptics feel realistic. While the player moves his whole body, all movement culminates in the force applied to the paddle and therefore it is adequate to only track the hands.\n\nAs a result, [b] this game skips the uncanny valley and goes directly to holodeck.[/b] After finding the right settings (which is a bit troublesome, see below), the game feels just like playing real table tennis. As someone who likes playing in real life, I can immediately use the play style I already know. And I notice making the same errors.\n\n[u]Single Player mode[/u]\n\nThe setting is a stylish apartment with the ping pong table in the middle. In the left hand you see the Oculus Touch model, in the right hand the paddle. You have no body or arms. The opponent is shown the same way, plus a (somewhat scary) mask for the head that conveys which way he is looking. Each game is basically one set (11 points). The basic rules are enforced by the game.\n\nIn Singleplayer mode, you play against a surprisingly good and natural AI of several difficuly levels. On the higher levels, the AI starts to apply spin and play faster balls.\n\nAdditionally there are a few Practice Minigames. For example, in one you must return balls to specific corridors. This game mode as a lot of potential to turn it into a more useful training tool, but feels quite limited at the moment.\n\n[u]Multi Player mode[/u]\n\nIn Multiplayer mode, you can play against a (Steam) friend or random player.\n\nA critical point here is the connection quality, especially the ping. In most cases, this worked surprisingly well for me. If the connection is good, there is no noticable difference to the Singleplayer mode. If it is bad, the ball \"jumps\" a bit after the opponent hits, making it harder to react. While the game does everything it can to smooth that out, above a certain lag threshold, the game becomes unplayable.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no ranking system yet. Still, to be able to play table tennis against players from all over the world as if in the same room is magical and tremendously fun. The game has voice chat activated by default. Laughing together on funny balls or praising nice shots makes the experience even better (of course not all player use their microphone or speak the same language).\n\n[u]Settings[/u]\n\nThe most important setting I had to change was the paddle position. For Oculus Touch, the default position is unfortunately tilted. I adjusted it so that when keeping my hand vertically the paddle is also vertically, like a continuation of my hand. The Rift's nose gap is very useful here to AR-like see your own hand and the paddle at the same time.\n\nAlso there are some settings related to the paddle. I imagine it to be like the choice of the physical rubber properties of the paddle. You can experminent and adjust those to your liking.\n\n[u]Wish list for the developers[/u]\n\nThe raw gameplay is in place and extremly fun. But I think there is a lot of potential to make this game even better. If the developers are reading this, here are my top three wishes:\n\n[olist][*] Better Match making: Introduce rankings (visible or hidden). It is no fun for either side if the gap in play strength is big. Also check the connection quality and do not match players if it is too bad.\n[*] Simplify the settings and provide better default values. Oculus Touch paddle position is tilted, use the correct rotation as default. Instead of sliders give some beginner friendly choices for paddles. Hide the sliders in advanced settings.\n[*] Bring the game to Oculus Home to reach more Oculus players (Cross-play with Steam!).[/olist]\n\n[u]Conclusion[/u]\n\nTable tennis is a uniquely suited sports for VR. Eleven Table Tennis provides an incredibly realistic simulation of an olympic sports making it arguably the first true \"eSports\". The Multi Player mode on top of the raw, but near-perfect gameplay provides endless replayability.", "timestamp_created": 1483027480, "timestamp_updated": 1483027764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.762665", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28790661": {"recommendationid": "28790661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013325781", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482969478}, "language": "french", "review": "Un exelent jeux de Ping Pong (peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame le meilleur que je connaisse).\n\nSimple, pratique et surtout r\u00e9aliste, Table Tennis VR n'est absolument pas \u00e0 prendre \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re !\nVous retrouverez tr\u00e8s rapidement votre niveaux dans cette version VR du Ping Pong.\n\nMalgr\u00e9s les soucis Multijoueurs, tout le reste est presque parfait.\n\nMini jeux, difficult\u00e9 de l'IA modifiable pour s'adapter \u00e0 votre niveau de jeux.\n\nTout y est ! enfin presque tout ^^", "timestamp_created": 1483019101, "timestamp_updated": 1483019101, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28785219": {"recommendationid": "28785219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047354987", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1514553618}, "language": "english", "review": "this game actually made me sweat XD", "timestamp_created": 1483007200, "timestamp_updated": 1483007200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28785142": {"recommendationid": "28785142", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133217269", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511714114}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing, the best VR game in my opinion, I love physics they're very real and accurate.

I was able to start playing this game immediatly and start making all the same errors I do in real life. Everything feels right, down to the spin and power on the ball. \n\nThe AI levels are pretty good, though the jump from amature to semi pro feels too steep, and the legendary AI is not screwing around, which is great.\n\nI'm not too happy with the audio on the ball bounces and contact, but this could be improved in the future. There was also no feedback on the touch controllers, not sure if this applies to vive, but either way it could really use a very gentle buzz depending on the type of contact with the ball so you can start having some slight physical feedback.\n\nI played only one multiplayer match, but it was too laggy to really play well. The problem here is the game seems to force correct the balls position through the latency, so you can expect the ball to warp around a lot, making play almost impossible. This may not be the case with a better connection though, I saw no ping indicators so I had no way of judging whether that one game was an outlier or not.\n\nI also found out how sturd the touch controllers were.

I am absolutely blown away by how fun and realistic this is.  I don't really think it could be much better.  I have over 40 games for my Vive and even though it's such a simple concept, this is my favorite.  I have played A LOT of table tennis over the years, and actually competed in some pretty big competitions at an Ivy League school with players from around the world, and this game is SPOT ON!  Just wow.  I want to share a few improvements/suggestions only because I'm such a big fan, that I want the options to continue to evolve (please!).  Do not take these as too critical, as my overall rating on this game is 10/10, A+++.  \n\n1.  There seems to be an issue during \"waves\" mini-game, that the ball is mistakenly shot into the net or off the table and there is no way to retrieve the ball.  It's easy to abandon that game and start a new one, but a bit annoying, and maybe fixable?  It would be frustrating if this happened during a record-breaking run!  \n\n2.  I'd love to see high-scores for the mini-games, even if just local scores.  Most of us are very competitive and want to have high scores to beat or compete with others in our household.\n\n3.  Add another vote to the \"locked\" table height, using the floor calibration to determine and set.  As many of us are sticklers for consistency, it would be nice to know the height is the same every time.\n\n4.  Any way to have a multiplayer lobby?  Maybe even a self-rating of sorts that could indicate which level you've beaten within the game to separate players?\n\n***5.  And most importantly (unless I missed a setting), can you add a setting of matches to 21 points?  Especially for multiplayer?  And even consider adding a Best of 3, Best of 5 option?  Prior to 2001, games to 21 were the normal, and some of us still like to casually play that way, even if it's not the International standard any longer.  \n\nAgain, KUDOS!

I would bet that playing this game is getting me good a real life ping pong. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1478866293, "timestamp_updated": 1478866293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26525049": {"recommendationid": "26525049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185320091", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511560366}, "language": "english", "review": "brilliant game,...........but.......can't hear the ball to good and the buzzer noise is too loud, great game though", "timestamp_created": 1478810842, "timestamp_updated": 1478810842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26503541": {"recommendationid": "26503541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019354241", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512340541}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy entretenido a mi me a gustado", "timestamp_created": 1478701131, "timestamp_updated": 1478799132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497718", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26496391": {"recommendationid": "26496391", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961666077", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487552512}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't believe how accurate the paddle and ball physics are in this game.

The in-game physics is incredibly accurate to the extent that it makes me forget that I'm playing it in VR. The developers have been working really hard on it, regularly tweaking the physics and adding new features, listening to and communicating with us constantly via social media, and even consulted professional table tennis players to improve the physics.\n\nBefore the latest improvements were added, my other favorite was Paddle Up. But after the devs had added the recent improvements, Eleven Table Tennis VR has now become the only table tennis game that I can recommend confidently with my eyes closed and label it as a 'must-have' if mind-blowing realism and accurate physics are what you are after. \n\nThis is the first game I launch when I first start up my Vive everyday, even though I've played it for more than 5 hours already. Several gameplay features have been added recently, and numerous bugs have been fixed. The devs have also informed me that they are already working on adding more environments. Multiplayer (with voice, of course) had little to no lag, and I've played with several other players online without any problem whatsoever. \n\nThe only thing I dislike a little about the game at the moment is the default environment, which looks a bit gloomy for my taste. Hopefully some different ones will be available soon.\n\nIn conclusion, if you have even a passing interest in table tennis and own a Vive but still haven't bought this game, you have absolutely no idea what you are missing out on. Do yourself a favor and get the game. Also, check out the 'Replay' feature that has been added recently and thank me later! \n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, Eleven: Table Tennis VR easily earns a 9.5 from me!

Perhaps I just need time to adjust to the new physics. Though I'd still recommend the game, it feels like it's taken a step back.\nWhile the increase in difficulty is welcome (even Legendary was cake before), and the introduction of the announcer is nice, there are many new detractors:\n   -The new supposed emphasis on spin seems to have been overdone with respect to back spin while at the same time nearly eliminating the effects of side spin (it's almost impossible to curve the ball like I used to--and can in reality--with a sideways backhand). Back spin is now so strong that the computer opponent often sends serves that appear to travel (and arc) in slow motion (very strange) and die when they hit my side of the table.\n   -The ball seems heavier now in a way that feels unrealistic. More shots end up in the net, yet still if I try to put any real power behind a hit the ball almost invariably ends up going too far. The computer opponent now has no trouble blasting the ball, though (which is nice).\n   -I've had several occasions where I'll return a ball and it'll disappear mid-air above the net, pause a second, reappear seemingly stationary against the computer opponent's paddle and then get fired back at me as if the computer returned it without any of that ever happening.\n   -Were the spawn points in Waves always such highly reflective red chrome? Because Waves was always such a short experience I didn't play it much before. With this update having Infinite Waves, though, I'd like to play it more, but the spawn globes are terribly distracting (a softer matte color and smaller spawning spheres would improve this). Also, the globes are often very high above the table. Like, Magic Johnson reaching up over his head high. Seems a little ridiclulous (and doesn't make for good practice since in-game shots will pretty much never come from those locations).\n   -Sometimes on serves, the loss-of-point buzzer will sound the moment my paddle hits the ball even though the serve goes through cleanly and within the rules/bounds. This also happens to the computer opponent (though less frequently).\n   -Lastly, in spite of having a beefy system (i7-6700k, 32GB RAM, GTX1070, SSD), I'm getting much more sporatic graphical stuttering than in previous versions (this comes in the form of minute pauses, particularly just after the ball leaves a paddle).", "timestamp_created": 1474660949, "timestamp_updated": 1474661011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504673", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25649350": {"recommendationid": "25649350", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968422987", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501317149}, "language": "english", "review": "Puhhh...this is a hard review to write. I got lucky and got a free promotion key of the developers from Reddit. I really appreciate the courage of the developers to get their game out and I understand that making a game is hard work but... \nI just cannot recomment that game over Paddle Up. If you have a Vive you only need one Ping Pong game and this is not it. You can bash me all you want but I want that people get the best VR Ping Pong experience for their money.\nUPDATE: This does not mean that this is a bad game. Just that I don't recommend it over another, basically same, slightly more polished (in my opinion) game.\n\nPros:\nThe enemy animation is quite awesome (although it gets kind of annoying if he only shows bad sportsmanship)\nUPDATE: The bad sportsmanship has become much much rarer.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe position setting of the paddle is pretty nice and something I would like to see in more games like this. Without profiles though it is hard to show this game to a friend without messing up the own  ''perfect position'' setup.\n\nUPDATE: \nThe physics --> see former con\n\nUPDATE:\nReplay view is frikkn awesome!\n\nCons: \nThe sound of racket and ball! Really? That's how you think Ping Pong sounds like? It's beyond bad and unforgivable for a VR game that strives for immersion.\nUPDATE: Even now the paddle and ball sound are.... just not realistic and absolutely immersion breaking. I play paddle up after playing real ping pong -> yep...about right. I play this after I play real ping pong -> nope... I notice that the developers put a lot of effort into getting sound samples but maybe a right sound sample is not everything. Rehall, volume...I cannot point the finger on a specific problem but it just sounds wrong. \n\nEven though I am way, waaay beyond recommended specs the ball draws 5 times a duplicate of itself as a trail....breaks immersion immediately...again.\nUPDATE: Still an issue (tried it with and without all possibile reprojection and 1x 1.3x and 2x super sampling combinations.). The ball carries a trail of around 5 previous ball frames. I dont know if thats because the play enviroment is very dark and thats the problem but this is also quite imersion breaking and no problem at all in paddle up. \n\nSomething is off with the physics. I consider myself a quite good and experienced player in real life. In Paddle Up it feels like when I hold the bat in the wrong angle, my ball drifts off (as it should). Here it feels as if I play in auto aim mode. I can hit one fast ball after the other (even in weird angles) and the spin of the ball in the air is so strong that it always lands on the table. I KNOW it wouldn't in real life. Feels nice to play at the speed on an olympian player though I guess...\nUPDATE: I dont know if the physics have been further updated but it feels better now (maybe i've gotten used to it). I am far less able to ''wii sport'' a ball and just quickly pull up the paddle and the spin will always take it back to the table. \n\nThe enviroment is just depressing. Jeez, get out of your parents basement already.\nUPDATE: Still super depressing and dark. Also I realize that my parents comment is quite snarky so .... sorry for that. But please please implement those other enviroments soon for your players :). Am I allowed to critizise the creepy, not at all jolly, donny darko mask, too, while we're at it.....?\n\nIn my 40 min of play I had 5 times of clipping of the ball through something (racket, table). In Paddle Up: Never.\nUPDATE: This did not happen once now so scretch that\n\nFinal verdict: You only need one Ping Pong VR game. Get the better one!\nUPDATE: A review is always a biased opinion.

The ball bounces and would stay on the table, and the AI returns it, but it still counts as a negative point for me.

A smaller scale problem is that the AI seems to clip and randomly get a point even though the ball never came to my side.

The game puts you in front of the table, you pick up the bat and ball, and you are playing. It seems quite close to the real thing. The main drawback is the controller feels different to a table tennis bat handle, but it passes for one quite well, especially if you go into the options and angle the bat to your preference. \n\nAt the time of review, the game is still in early access. As such, I think the AI needs a bit more development. The computer opponent seems to find it impossible to counter shots close to the edge of the table, but has no problem with ones close to the net. Who wins is determined by whether you ace your own serves or fail to return the AI's. The computer opponent is almost infallible in its ability to keep the ball on the table, even on the easiest difficulty setting. Of course, multiplayer adds the element of spontaneity missing from single player mode, but I lost patience waiting for a human opponent after only a few seconds because there's nothing else to do while waiting. You can't even throw ping-pong balls out of the open window. Trailing wires and lack of space made moving quickly to the left and right a bit risky for me and so I spent the whole game rooted to the spot.\n\nI have to say, this is a really good use of VR and I think this has the makings of a great game.

The game settings allows you to adjust the table position, height and the racket angle (I prefer to set in the middle with the HTC Vive controller) - which are all important for the gameplay. The first 30 minutes I could not manage to play an agressive game, but had to play safe with blocks, backspin and counter-loops. Drop shots positioned on the short left and right on the table felt very real, and I really got to put my table tennis experience and reactions to use, last millisecond wrist turns to save the ball was very true to life. Being able to change colour of the table was nice, the graphics are much nicer then any other table tennis game out there. Another reviewer had a nice tip to press Shift when starting the game and select Beautiful graphics.\n\nAfter some time I also got the hang of the drives and managed to play a more agressive game on both forehand and backhand by using actual table tennis techniques (but a bit slowed down from real life). It took some time before owning the legendary 1-player opponent, but I managed at last and worked up a good sweat. This game feels like the real thing! \n\nA couple of things can be improved. For example when serving an ace, no point is given but I have to serve again. Spin don't seem to have very much effect on the game. It would be nice to be able to adjust the amount of backspin in a serve or stroke according to speed of movement and point where the ball hits the racket, but maybe the players just need to get some more expensive rubbers or glue up the racket before the game :) Also the training robot could have a forhand / backhand & letter practice mode.\n\nLooking forward to following this game and to finding any other players in the multiplayer section!

I noticed when I took a ball and bounced it on a paddle and let it slowly lose energy until it sits on the bat. There's a small noticable jump from bouncing to resting on the bat. There's also a lack of being able to front/back/side spin the ball which I really hope is added.\n\nI'm being picky though and being that this is in VR it's these details that are suddenly more obvious than on a 2d monitor.\n\nOne thing: I'd love to see a 'free practice' mode where the serving rules are less strict as it took a little while to understand why we kept getting fouls when serving (you have to hit the ball forward on to your side first straight away, don't bounce it on the table first before hitting over the net).

[/i]\n\nPing Pong Waves VR is a really true testament to Ping Pong in real life! The Physics in this game are so much better than other Ping Pong Games avaiable on the Vive. So far as of [i] 7/24/16 [/i] there are only two game modes, Waves and Single Matches. I will also go in depth in the Graphics of the game and in depth in the Game Modes!\n\n[h1] Waves [/h1]\n\nWaves is a arcadish type game mode that challenges you to hit balls the computer throws at you. This sounds really cool in theory, and it kind of is! However this mode only last for about 1 minute and then it's over.\n\n[h1] Here are some tips to make this game mode better: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Make additional levels\n    [*]Make an Endless Wave Mode\n    [*]Make a mode where both hands act as paddles so both have to hit incoming balls\n[/list]\n\n[h1] Single Matches [/h1]\n\nSingle Matches in this game are really what shines in Ping Pong Waves VR. There is lots of Opponent AI difficulties as well! From Ametuer to Legendary this mode will cater to veteran Ping Pong players as well as beginners. This game mode stays true to official Ping Pong rules and is really addicting. I was going to suggest what would make this game mode better but this mode is already good!\n\n[h1] Graphics/Looks of the game [/h1]\n\nThe Graphics/Looks of the game is still what reminds me this game is still in early development. Don't get me wrong it doesn't look bad but it still looks like it's a placeholder or something along those lines. The look is very realistic where you are placed in what looks like a Apartment and it's feels really cool to be playing Ping Pong in a place you wouldn't ever play in. there are some weird Graphical Things I will mention now.\n\n[list]\n    [*]The Ping Pong Buckets Ping Pong Balls are shadeless and look kind of weird.\n    [*]Most of the TableTop Colors are really bright and can't see any detail on the table with the Black option.\n    [*]The overall lighting feels very plasticy and basic.\n[/list]\n\nOverall Ping Pong Waves VR is a very promising title and one I will keep coming back to! I would definitely reccomend people who like Ping Pong or people who haven't ever played a Match in their life! However now I want to give some things I would love to see get implemented into the game in the future!\n\n[list]\n    [*]A One hand serve option.\n    [*]More modes. (Tourney Mode, Practice, Multiplayer, ect.)\n    [*]More enviroments. (The Moon, A Rooftop, An Office Building, ect.)\n    [*]More realistic lighting.\n    [*]Make the net on the table Physics based.\n    [*]Make the enviroments interactible, so you can hit objects and it interacts.\n[/list]\n\nThat's all I could think of.

But it is not that far off. After an adjustment period, this feels like playing ping pong. \n\nCONS:\n-Really hard top spin is making the ball go farther down in the air than it should. Makes a lot of your all-out slam shots hit the net until you adjust for the crazy amount of top spin. Could this be fixed with some sort of cap on the spin? Good luck fixing it. haha\n\n-Most shots just don't feel like they're going high/far enough, overall. I'm not sure what would cause that, but an experienced ping pong player will easily notice. \n\n-No multiplayer. IMO, adding this (along with a ranking system eventually) could be interesting, because people who don't have a ping pong table could compete in a game that is truly not that far off from an IRL ping pong game.\n\nPROS:\n-Shitloads of fun. I have a ping pong table in my basement, but rarely have people to play against. This is a great alternative (I'm worried about it affect my IRL ping pong game. I feel I will be able to kinda switch my brain back easily, but this is yet to be seen. Will update after I play some actual ping poing!)\n\n-Spin feels pretty damn great. I was pleasantly surprised that for most of my shots, even with complex slice/ cuts with diagonal back spin, the ball acts accordingly. The harder your shot, though, the less accurate it tends to be. Some spins can become very exagerrated because of a really hard cut. \n\nI know there are fewer pros, but I implore you to look at the weight of the pros. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is possibly jonesin for some ping pong.\n\nPS:\nstoked for multiplayer. I think it would dramatically increase the gameplay quality, along with a ranking system to feel that legitimate improvement.\n\nPPS:\nIf you usually place your index finger on the backhand-side of your paddle, DO THIS in Pong Waves VR. It will greatly help your insticts. This being said, I feel the paddle should be very slightly lowered in the grip. Compare x)the location of your finger being on the back of a real paddle with y) the percieved location of your index finger on the back of the in-game paddle.

Highly recommand!\n\nAfter the main description at the first line which I know most of you guys may only read, I'll comment some details.\n\nThis game do have the convincing experience makes me truely think i'm playing the real ping pong. But here's some suggestion for you the dear developers :\n\nFirst, no spin ball, no spin ball, no spin ball. In ping pong games, spin is not only make ball tto change the moving path and speed, it make lots of attacking movementt possible, like the fast attack top spin. As a trained semi-pro ping pong player, I feel that with out top spin, most of the right powerful loop will be impossible in this game. With out topspin, the right loop will be too slow to go through the net or to high to catch the table. Chop is the most impotant defend weapon for tennis grip, while loop is the most impotant counter-attack weapon. Abandon the spin makes tennis grip impossible to play, which is the most comfortable grip way for using HTC Controllor;\n\n\nSecond, no let in the game. Which means no reserve for the net serve.\n\nThird, I know it is almost impossible to make the mass touch feeling for smash on Vive. But after fix the spin ball, can we have the custom paddle? In this systerm, we can custom the out look, most impotantly the rubber. Different rubber has different effect on spin, the stroke speed and so on.

Naturally, my biggest concern for this game was how accurate the physics would be. I was hesitant to purchase this game when I read through the negative reviews, partly written by allegedly skilled real life table tennis players. In contrast, there are plenty of positive reviews claiming that the physics was spot-on. My first guess was that those were written by casual players, and this proved to be partly true when I finally played the game myself.\n\nThe first couple of minutes are mind-blowing, the feeling of presence is very strong. This feeling lasts until you unconsciously try to spin the ball in situations you would normally do in real life: it doesn't work, the paddle isn't very sticky at all. This is by no means immersion-breaking but a subtle reminder that you're still playing a game. Aside from the spin, there are some other aspects that don't feel 100% right like the force applied to the ball relative to your swing, affecting the trajectory.\n\nBut this is some next-level nitpicking and I'm sure many players out there won't even notice.

My favorite games of all time for PC (in no particular order and off the top of my head)  are Diablo 2, Witcher 3, Skyrim, Heroes of Might and Magic, Might and Magic, BF2,and  Mass Effect (all of them). I mention this to give you some insight into the type of gamer I am to give you some perspective on my reviews. At the time of this review, I am a 30 year old white-male. I don't intend the 'white-male' part to change; but who knows. I have been playing table tennis since I was 5. Onto the review for Pong Waves.\n\nPrior to the most recent update, I would not recommend. The backhand, my primary weapon, was not even remotely close to realistic. With this most recent update, this game is MUCH closer and I can recommend with some warning -- it is not perfect. It will frustrate you when you mentally know you've hit a solid shot, but it doesn't respond that way. With this most recent update, I would say that 80% of my shots feel realistic. That is good enough for now, for me to enjoy myself and have a spirited game against the AI, or in 'Wave' Mode.\n\nAI: The first two difficulties are a cake-walk. The last one, is beastly. I haven't beaten the best setting yet -- \"World Class\", I think. You can easily exploit the first two settings with serves that they will never return. That is a bummer. Once you get to the most difficult setting, it is like you can't get anything past it. This isn't a bad thing per se, but I would like to see some better balancing on the AI\n\nWave Mode: Although this is OK, it needs some more content. It is currently setup in a manner where you get 'x' number of balls and you get 100 pts for each that you land on the other side of the table. That's it. I think they need to add an endless mode with a 'strike system'. Three, five, and seven (hard, medium, easy -- respectively?) maybe? Then add a leaderboard. Maybe a progressively more difficult endless mode? Starts of super easy, then progressively gets ridiculous -- sudden death style. \n\nAdditional modes: Should be an \"accuracy mode\". Maybe there are rings you have to hit the ball through? Or targets, or something. \n\nDifferent Environments: Self explanatory\n\nRPG Elements to add: Add different paddles with different stats that can be unlocked as you level up. Maybe you get stat points as you level up and can augment the following player stats: Power, Accuracy, Spin, others? Maybe add some accessories that you can win in tournaments to augment your stats. Very simple RPG elements would put this game over the top.\n\nPlaying Against Real Players: Add this feature with the above RPG features and create classes of tournaments: Bronze for players level 1-5, silver for players 6-10, gold for 11-15, etc. That would be a good time. \n\nOut of 5, I would give this a 3 right now, with the potential to be a solid 5 if they implement some elements that increase replayability, immersion, and engagement.

Serving.  The serve mechanics are extremely awkward with the ball attached to the same controller as the paddle.  This makes it very difficult to serve.  The ball should be in the other hand so you can have the paddle in any position and orientation you choose at the time the ball launches.\n\n2. Multiple balls on the table.  if a ball goes in the net, it is not removed before the next ball starts into play.  This can get very distracting.  Hearing multiple ball bounces makes it more difficult to guage speed and timing.\n\n3. Spin.  I am very surprised that there are positive reviews that comment on how great the spin mechanics are.  I would be surprised if spin is accounted for at all.  I am a very experienced ping pong player and I was never able to impart any spin on the ball.  Quite the opposite, it seemed to me as if the balls motion was very dumb, only using the orientation of the paddle to determine a reflection angle.  This meant every top spin shot went straight down into the table, every backspin shot popped straight up and attempts to slice side spin were fruitless.\n\nIf you are just interested in a very basic demo and you are a novice player who just likes to pop the ball up a little onto the other side of the table, this game will work fine for you.

So its better than real ping pong.

I have a hunch that the spin is less than in real life but I could be wrong. Top priority should be multiplayer. I only care about local multiplayer but I'm sure most people will want internet multiplayer. Other possible purely optional enhancements could be options to allow games that go up to 21 points instead of just 10, adjust degree of ball spin.\n\nThis is my favorite vive game. All of the graphics and fancy acting, etc, sometimes the most fun games are the simplest. IMO this is what smaller vive developers should be concentrating on.

Physics are predictable and work well as to not get in the way of being immersive. I think that Pong Waves VR qualifies as a competent simulation in addition to a great and fun game.

It feels really awesome having that feeling back.The table scale is big enough to do that unlike other vr pingpong game with smaller table.\n\nIt really feels like playing the real game, but still need to practice to feel it at the fullest. Still having difficulties for doing a Smash and a forehand, probably because of the headset limitation in field of view. I hope there will be a specific practice mode for practicing specific move that I want to improve by making the opponent pass the ball exactly the way so I can do a smash or a forehand, or any other move that I want to practice.\n\n-edit-\n\nTurns out I need to adjust how I wear the headset so the view would cover the lower right quadrant of the table, now I can follow the ball even if it flies to far right.

The closeness to real life table tennis is extremely good and very surreal standing in my tiny office playing on a full sized table tennis table. \n\nPhysics are very good although takes some getting used to when trying to apply the same shots you would in real life. I'd suggest leaving the bat speed and spin at default until your used to not actually holding your bat, then definitely tweak to your liking/real life bat (I had to reduce the ball speed and increase the spin to match my real life bat).\n\nAs I play traditional grip, I had some difficulties getting used to holding the vive controller in the same way I would a paddle, and actually got very frustrated that I couldn't do the same forehand shots as I would in real life, thinking this was the games fault. Once I readjusted the settings as mentioned above it became significantly easier and is just a matter of getting used to the virtual paddle. Would love to see support for vive trackers that you could attach to a paddle for even better simulation!\n\nUI wise, very simple but not a fan of the bright primary colours, would prefer a more polished/clean look. Some graphical settings including AA and Super Sampling which is nice. Probably doesn't need many more considering the nature of the game.\n\nIntuitiveness of the control scheme is very nice and like the fact you can adjust the table position, height and rotation to fit within your chaperone bounds, as well as being able to rotate the paddle to your liking.\n\nThe maps are nice, although the desert map seems not so well optimised compared to the studio (can't say about the other 4 or so since I haven't played them yet). Maybe some customisation options in the future and even a tournament style map?\n\nThe mini games are fun although could do with the same tweak settings that the \"return practice\" game does, would also like to see a go and restart button so you're not thrown straight in unprepared and so you're not booted back to the menu  after a few seconds when you suck as much as I do (the initial settings are too fast! :P)\n\nWhat's also really nice is the fact the game shows a third person \"table view\" on your monitor so other people can watch you play!\n\nOverall, well worth the money and can see my self playing this a hell of a lot when I can't get to a table as it's the next best thing!", "timestamp_created": 1515066970, "timestamp_updated": 1515067311, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39038451": {"recommendationid": "39038451", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991093207", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "last_played": 1515469567}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fantastic.

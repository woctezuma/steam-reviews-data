"The creators intentionally ruined this extremely easy yet fun game by throwing in a hopelessly difficult final level full of pixel perfect gameplay where every mistake or unlucky moment sends you back to the beginning of whatever overly long section you're at & the most recent save point is in a different level.\n\nI've never played such a hard or infuriating level in any other game ever. Including the Master Extra levels from Super Monkey Ball 2. N+ never got this hard or this infuriating. I've never experienced such a horrible difficulty spike. Not even in a Guitar Hero or Rock Band game.\n\nThe skills involved in this level have very little to do with the rest of the game &, even though everyone despises this level, the creators refuse to fix it even though people who loved the game up to this point have uninstalled it & never played it again.\n\nThey ruined the game on purpose just because they could &, depending on whether or not it was as bad in the 3DS version, they may have waited until the end to do it in the hopes that people wouldn't be able to refund. I think I'm done with these developers. I never should have given them a second chance.\n\nI can't play this game anymore knowing it leads to a controller smashing final level that I'd only be willing to finish if I had an extremely self destructive personality & enough money to just keep buying controllers. Mario Maker kazio levels literally designed to be frustrating are not this bad.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, I forgot an earlier level has an incredibly tedious stealth section just so the creepy devs can have every female character (the main character's underage, by the way) forcibly stripped, forced into outfits so tiny they resemble nudity, & locked in prison cells & the whole thing is played for laughs & fap material. Mostly fap material.\n\nThe whole thing happens because the game ignores the fact that some of these characters are supposed to be able to fight.

Art is subjective, but I found the portraits of Shantae that appear while she talks to be nice to look at as well as amusing.\nThe writing is good, I find it impressive that they've managed to keep up with continuity since their first game. Everything fits together and you get a feel for who the characters are and why they are the way they are. Humor is also well done, as certain parts made me break out laughing. \n\nIf there were one thing that I would critique negatively, it would be some of the level design towards the end. They throw you into these segments where you either get through in one go or die to insta-kill spikes.

C'est passer plus de temps \u00e0 mater le design ol\u00e9 ol\u00e9 de tous les personnages f\u00e9minins plut\u00f4t que de lire leurs dialogues. Et pour un premier contact avec la s\u00e9rie de la gentille g\u00e9nie (devenu humaine suite \u00e0 la perte de ses pouvoirs dans cet \u00e9pisode), j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris de voir que m\u00eame les femmes plus \u00e2g\u00e9es sont bien entretenues ! Merci chers devs de prendre soin de vos milfs !\n\nJe dois avouer qu'au d\u00e9part le gameplay ne me plaisait pas du tout. \u00c0 part sauter et fouetter les ennemis avec sa chevelure en tortillant son petit cul, on ne pouvait rien faire d'autres. Mais metroidvania oblige, quelques am\u00e9liorations de son personnage son \u00e9parpill\u00e9es sur notre chemin au cours de l'aventure et rendront le gameplay tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able et maniable. Et bon point pour toi Shantae, c'est que ce large panel qui \u00e9toffera les possibilit\u00e9s se ma\u00eetrisera ais\u00e9ment parce que le jeu est assez ben foutu pour nous apprendre \u00e0 utiliser l'am\u00e9lioration acquise, puis de la combiner avec une ancienne, etc.\n\nJe dois \u00e9videmment parler de l'humour du jeu. S\u00fbrement ce qui m'a vraiment fait appr\u00e9cier le titre. Tous les personnages sont b\u00eates et font de l'auto d\u00e9rision. Ils n'h\u00e9sitent pas \u00e0 dire des conneries, vous prendre pour un con et \u00e0 raconter leur vie alors qu'on s'en fout royalement. J'ai par exemple beaucoup aim\u00e9 le Squid Baron lorsqu'il parle de ses vacances de r\u00eave et qu'il veut voir des jolies filles en petite tenue sur la plage du d\u00e9sert. Il y a quand m\u00eame quelques moments s\u00e9rieux bien s\u00fbr, sinon la qu\u00eate pour an\u00e9antir le m\u00e9chant pirate ne rimera \u00e0 rien. Je trouve quand m\u00eame dommage que les personnages ne sont pas du tout attachant, ils sont dr\u00f4les, en forme (pour les nanas ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)) et... c'est tout.\n\nChose assez relou par contre m\u00eame si tout est color\u00e9 et que l'aventure nous emm\u00e8ne sur des \u00eeles fort vari\u00e9es avec ennemis et ambiance diff\u00e9rente, c'est qu'au fil de l'histoire il faudra trouver des objets de qu\u00eate pour avancer. Des qu\u00eates plut\u00f4t simple ma foi, mais la o\u00f9 c'est chiant c'est qu'il faut souvent (pour ne pas dire tout le temps) se taper plein d'aller retour d'une \u00eele \u00e0 l'autre et croyez moi que c'est p\u00e9nible surtout quand on doit chercher dans tous les coins et revenir 20 fois sur ses pas quand on loupe quelque chose. Heureusement qu'il existe un objet pour revenir instantan\u00e9ment au d\u00e9but de l'\u00eele, mais je pensais jamais \u00e0 l'acheter et je perdais inutilement mon temps. Ce n'est pas vraiment \u00e0 classer dans les \"points n\u00e9gatifs\" du jeu, mais \u00e7a reste \u00e0 souligner.\n\nJ'ai vu que beaucoup de gens parlaient de la facilit\u00e9. Oui c'est facile quand on joue juste comme \u00e7a sans se prendre la t\u00eate. Moi qui veut les succ\u00e8s sur steam, j'ai gal\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques passages lorsqu'il faut par exemple battre tous les boss sans se faire toucher ou m\u00eame terminer le jeu en speedrun.

The gameplay was surprisingly more interactive then in riskys revenge. Going from transformations to pirate weapons in my opinion made the game feel more enjoyable. With transformations you have to sit there and wait to transform into a very specific creature to do a very specific job, and then u revert back to ur human form when the deed is done. With the pirate weapons you can do more then just hang on walls or swim in the sea. You have ur boots to speedrun through the level. Pistol for long range attacks. Hat for gliding across areas or avoiding grounded enemies. (Scimitar wasn't too interactive imo since I only used it to break blocks and that's it.) The difference between pirate weapons and transformations is that you are always using pirate weapons on the fly all the time, where as transformations were just there to get past a certain obstacle and that's it. You could even combo ur weapons like speeding up with the boots and using that momentum to fly across the level with ur hat while keeping ur self in the air by boosting urself with the cannon. With all this in mind it made the gameplay very creative and fun to mess around with. \n\nThere r times when the game makes huge jumps in difficulty without warning. For example, Tan Line Island was meh in difficulty only being the third island but the one right after is insane compared to Tan Line. \n\nOverall I gave the game a 8.5/10 and would recommend this game to anyone looking to play a metroidvania style game.", "timestamp_created": 1505706633, "timestamp_updated": 1505706633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34994750": {"recommendationid": "34994750", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337735017", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499854123}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bamm!!", "timestamp_created": 1505562208, "timestamp_updated": 1505562208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34986777": {"recommendationid": "34986777", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130083268", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515623217}, "language": "english", "review": "sHE make pPEE peeeeE EXTra lARGe", "timestamp_created": 1505532959, "timestamp_updated": 1505532959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465298", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34979016": {"recommendationid": "34979016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031383772", "num_games_owned": 703, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505600581}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.

Shantae has some incredibly catchy tunes. Each island (seven-ish of them) has at least 2 completely different tracks, and most of them are extremely well done. I first learned who Jake Kaufmann was after I heard the amazing Shovel Knight soundtrack, and his work is just as good in this game. Where Shovelknight sounded more 8-bit, nintendo-y, this game has a bit more 16-bit era (sonic-ish?)  sounding tunes. Really great stuff.\n\n<Art>\nThe art is colourful and cheerful, even in the desolate regions of the game. The main character, and many other supporting characters are basically made to be \"waifu\" material. It lays the suggestive themes on thick, and is unapologetic about it. Curvy/busty females are plentiful, and the game has fun with it. Whatever the \"first\" game did, this one has more, and again, I'm fine with that. Not every game needs super serious/realistic characters all the time. I don't think a single character in this game isn't some sort of caricature (stupid, goofy, scary, sexy, playful, etc) of something.\n\n<Gameplay>\nAnother improvement on the first game, but don't expect a deep/complex game here. The game does enough to differentiate the gameplay, with different enemies/obstacles for each island to keep it playable. The level design is fairly plain, and overall the difficulty is relatively low. The boss fights bring the most spice to the games, but each one is \"megaman\"ish where they have 2-3 attacks/patterns that you'll learn, figure out their weakness, and exploit it. Pretty standard stuff, and it's done well. It's good, not great.\n\nThe difficulty spikes from 2-3/10 to 8/10 at the end with some challenging, precise platforming. I would've appreciated some of that challenge throughout the game, as the game has a lot going for it. The devs are fairly competent, and I think they have it in them to make this game go to the next level, and have created a good IP. I think what's lacking for this franchise to be great is to expand a little on the level design, add some items/rpg elements maybe... something. It's an enjoyable experience with alternate endings etc, but for me it stands as a \"Good\" game, not particularly a \"Great\" one... perhaps by design, as the game is ported from the Nintendo arcade? (3ds? wii-u?.. one of those), so perhaps they were trying to keep the game more \"digestible\". Comparing this game to something like Shovel Knight (this game is a bit more \"open\", but it's not exactly a metroid-vania), you'll know exactly what I mean by \"simple levels\".\n\n<overall>\nSo ya, if you want a campy, fun platformer that isn't too too long, this is worth getting. Great music, \"fanservice\" artwork, and good platforming overall -- just not quite in the same echelon as shovel knight, and now, Hollow knight (different styles of games, but fair to compare overall quality to).\nIt really is an intellectual property that I think has a lot of promise.

And it was such a blast! It's like all my complaints about previous entries were listened to! With that being said, I'll jump into list of pros and cons!\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*] Very good powers' progression. All of the powers feel useful even late in the gameplay, and none of them feel superfluous, like spider in HGH.\n  [*] Great stage design - it compliments how the powers work, and there are a lot of very cleverly hidden secrets to find!\n  [*] The length is much better than the other Shantae games - it took me about 10 hours this time to get 100% run without guides. It's much better than previous entries which were completed in about 6.\n  [*] Graphic is very good - it's much better version of pixel art than presented in Risky's Revenge. And characters' pictures are also very good, almost on HGH level!\n  [*] Cast of characters that take part in the story are fun, diverse, and great looking.\n  [*] Sound design is ok - soundtrack does it's job. I think it's on similar level to the other Shantae games.\n  [*] This time they attempted to do something different with the bosses - they aren't always just meat bags to beat. Sometimes they require something more, which is what I wanted from them in my previous reviews. Plus, they are challenging when attempting \"don't get hit\" achievements! Definitely best bosses in the series.\n  [*] It is the most challenging game from the series when attempting a speedrun - it's not \"impossibly hard\", but it was the most interesting challenge posed by a Shantae game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n  [*] This is basically the only one bad side for me - I missed some more interesting story. It's very barebones. And while characters are colorful, well designed and fun, story itself is very basic and forgettable. I think it was the only factor missing to make the game truly special.\n[/list]\n\nThis game is a very good pseudo-metroidvania (there is split to stages similar to HGH). One of the better ones I've played! This is definitely the best entry in the series and the one I would recommend to newcomers - to see Shantae at it's best! I don't think story is important enough to make missing parts from Risky's Revenge a big deal. With that being said, my final number score is [b]9/10[/b]. The game is amazing, very well designed, I had a lot of fun with it and length was just ok for this genre. It missed some special factor to make it higher though, something memoriable, like a better story. Still, it's one of the better games I've played this year, and one of the better metroidvanias overall! If you want to play Shantae, I think this is the entry to check out!\n\nOn a final unrelated to score note, I think this game sets perfect ground for some sort of Risky's Spinoff - I'm not that much fan of her character, but the moveset established in this game is almost perfect, so it would be nice to have a continuation or expansion of it with another game where Risky as anti-heroine goes to hunt for some treasures akin to Wario... I think it would make a better game than making tons of transformations where only half of them is truly useful, like in Half-Genie Hero.", "timestamp_created": 1500469589, "timestamp_updated": 1500470166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33651050": {"recommendationid": "33651050", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995458843", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500402887}, "language": "italian", "review": "Questo titolo \u00e8 metroidvania a tema comico, con una particolare caratterizzazione dei personaggi femminili dalle curve ben vistose ed una colonna sonora veramente spettacolare.

The pros certainly outweigh the cons here.\n\nPros:\n\n- The graphics are incredible; wonderfully detailed environments and characters, fluid animations, and many parallax scrolling layers. In addition, character portraits in cutscenes are well drawn.\n- THE SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING!!\n- Gameplay is fast and fluid; the pirate equipment is a blast to use, while keeping things moving.\n- In-game currency is plentiful, allowing you to stock up on items which can help you. However, you don't feel like Gems are being dumped on you.\n- Dungeons will test your abilities, but they aren't too overwhelming. They strike a good balance between Metroid-type exploration, and Zelda-esque combat and puzzle solving.\n- The bosses are huge and daunting, but fun and well designed, putting your pirate gear to good use in their strategies.\n- Encourages replayability with Heart Squids, Cacklebats, and Pirate Mode (starting the game again with all of the pirate equipment - a speedrun mode of sorts).\n- Don't like backtracking? Pirate Flares can eliminate most of it, and they don't require too many Gems to buy.\n- Lots of secrets and hidden stuff.\n- Funny and memorable dialogue and character interactions. Shantae is known for having lots of humor, and this is no exception.\n- The game puts the pirate gear to good use in the boss fights and they are required to beat the game so they don't feel underutilized.\n- Like mentioned before, the game absolutely encourages exploration and it's fun exploring and finding secrets in the world, like walls you can break through.\n- Over the course of the story, quite a few characters get a big dose of character development.\n- With things like puzzles, you actively have to figure out the solution, testing your smarts and problem solving skills instead of the game pointing out what to do.\n- Platforming is decently challenging, putting your skills to the test, and this is complimented by buttery smooth controls. I always felt like falling into a bottomless pit was my fault, not the game's.\n\nCons:\n\n- Some areas, like the first part of Mud Bog Island, go wayyy overboard with their enemy count.\n- There are a few random difficulty spikes like the aformentioned Mud Bog Island and the Pirate Master's Palace (although the latter is the final level; it's supposed to be hard).\n- The game puts items and gear you find to good use. However, a few items, such as the Bubble Shield, still manage to feel underutilized.", "timestamp_created": 1499221398, "timestamp_updated": 1509918521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33255555": {"recommendationid": "33255555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056938896", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485585098}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the first and only Shantae game I've played as of yet, and I can just sum it up by saying it's an incredibly solid metroidvania.

But the game is worth the try.\n\nI'm overall neutral about this, And I'm very two-sided to give it a positive or negative response. \nBut I decided to give it a positive view as my opinion differs from the others.\n\nIt's however worth pointing out the next things before you buy:\n\nPro's:\n- Great animations, I've really enjoying them, especially Shantae herself.\n- Great Soundtrack. They're really fitting to them, some of them are arabic, and sometimes it fits even Castlevania.\n- Every character has pretty much their own full body render art during dialogues.\n- It has their humor, mostly classic humor. \n- Fanservice. That's pretty much the game's main point. There are busty ladies with bra's and bikini's everywhere. Now combine it with the full body renders and you've an anime visual novel in a platformer game. \nHowever, I'm not a visual novel fan, When I'm playing a game I prefer the gameplay over the artwork, and honestly I think it would have been fine enough for me if it were just head pictures. I can't take my time to look at their bodies if they might have something important to tell. Maybe appealing for other people. just not for me.\n\nCons:\n- The controls are ... weird, I guess you'll get used to it, but it's weird for me when everything is assigned to a different button. An example: Attack, talk and confirm has 3 seperate buttons, while it would have been more user-friendly if they mixed it into one. This also takes away a bit of the combat flow.\n- Difficulity spikes, The game feels too easy at the start. but later on the game turns out to becomes harsh. (The final area is a huge twist compared to the overall game.)\n- Fullscreen seems a bit buggy sometimes when using alt-f4. \n- Lack of animations, sounds a little ironic as I also said that they've great animations. But sometimes I've noticed that it looks like only halfway done. Causing a bit of a quality break. It sometimes feels like there could have been some extra animations here and there: The idle animations looks the same every time despite their artworks shows different expressions, it's a bit odd to me as the standard idle animation doesn't really fit with the situation sometimes. \nAnd sometimes when I expected to see an unique animated cutscene by an event, the screen goes black instead. It's a little bit easily done in that term and that's a bit disappointing. Because the animations does look good and I could have certainely see that potential.\n\nMy own opinion: \nI think this game differs too much from what I'm used to with Metroidvania's. And there have been parts that I don't find logical to happen. I do have played the game untill the end though, including the secret ending as I was pretty close to that. But in all honestly, there has been parts that rather takes me away from replaying it. The game didn't really fit my style, but that doesn't make it a bad game. It also has their good sides, as there were several music, animations, mechanics and upgrades that I've enjoyed.\n\nOverall, I've been really trying to love the game, but it didn't really fit at my end.\nThe real question is where your interests are at, because for me, it's really hard to tell to which audience this game is really meant.\n- If you want to play the game for the difficulity and 'Metroidvania' level design, Then I find the game is on the easy side. Despite the insane difficulity ramp at the end. It does have the Metroidvania feelings though, but I find it done rather simple.\n- If you want to play the game for the art design, go ahead.

However, I would state that both versions play basically the same.\nStory: Shantae has been stripped bare of her magic and Scuttle Town is now under the iron treads of Ammo Baron. On the other side of the sea, a terrible evil threatens to rise back up to send Sequin Land to a lifetime of darkness and death. Only through a team-up with Shantae's archnemesis Risky Boots can they both save Sequin Land from this evil. As a game plot, it's basic and slightly cliche'd, but it's still good enough to keep on playing. 8.5/10\nControls: Unlike most other games, where you use WASD to control your character, Shantae actually uses the arrow keys and ZXCASD, which could confuse users more used to WASD. Overall, it would be preferable to use a controller, though unlike its older brother, Super Meat Boy, it's playable with just the keyboard. 8/10\nGraphics: As a whole, the pixel art style cannot get any more better than this in sheer quality. And while there are some peeople who may be bothered by how anime-like Shantae and her friends appear, it's still all good and gives people some eye candy. And don't worry, He-Man is there to balance out the waifu scale. 9.5/10\nSound: Both Music and general sound effects are here. Music-wise, Jake Kaufman does amazing job as the composer. (11/10) Sound-wise, we do get to hear how Shantae and Risky sound through their occasional spoken line, though most of the sound is through fighting. The sounds do lend themselves pretty well to their designated objects, though certain sounds don't satisfy the feeling we all have. (7.5/10) Overall: 9/10\nOverall and other mentions: This game is THE definitive Metroidvania platformer, where you have to collect new power-ups to go into different areas where you couldn't go before, and go out of your way to get 100% or rush the game to complete it under a designated period of time to get a payday, if you will. This game gets a 9/10, since a lot of the less good elements do get drowned out by the best of quality entertainment. To end it, this game is most certainly NOT for kids, grandma and soccer mums everywhere.

A rough challenge? A great cast and story? Enjoyable gameplay with solid controls? Well with Shantae and the Pirate's Curse you'll get at least 2 out of three.\n\nThe greatest asset this game has it's it's cast and story, even if this is your first Shantae game (it was for me). The only 2 characters that were glossed over durin the game are actually new to this title: the blond-haired duo of Twitch and Vinegar (you never even get their names). The rest of the cast, from enemies to allies, all have their own quirks, personalities, and even worries, ranging from finding a husband, turning orphanages into cannons, and dealing with post-boss syndrome. You know, normal video game problems. The story follows our title character joining forces with the previous titles' main baddie, the pirate Risky Boots, to stop the return of her old master from the grave. As with any good rivalry, plenty of bickering and comraderie awaits.\n\nGameplay is as resposive as you'd want out of an action-platformer. Shantae can use her hair and a variety of sub-weapons to deal with foes. As she clears the game's dungeons (called Dens of Evil) she'll find Risky's missing equipment, each helping her either fight enemies or explore more areas (often both). The game really opens up once you collect all five, as 3 of them (Hat, Boots, and Cannon) can be used in conjuction to speed through areas and past enemies, and it's at this point that the level design really begins to shine as WayForward obviously designed with this in mind. In fact, the game plays equally well, albeit sufficiently different, between Normal and Pirate Modes (NG and NG+ respectfully).\n\nThe one area the game will lack during an normal playthrough is challange, as collecting all the power-ups, Heart Squids (for extra health), and healing items mean that you're never at any real risk of dying outside of a couple boss fights. You could easily by circumvent this by skipping all these things, but it'd been nice for there to simply be a mode where the difficulty is set by the game and not the player.\n\nOverall this is easily one of the most replayable games I've played in years. Pirate Mode is such a pleasant way to play after a Normal game, and the cast and music will always bring a smile to my heart. There's a reason it's a fan-favorite in the series.\n\nPS: If you're interested in getting into speedrunning, then this game also makes a great introductory game if you're new and has a nice Discord community as well.\n\n\nScore: 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1498093753, "timestamp_updated": 1498093753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596273",

This game shocked me with how good it was.\nI DEFINATLY reccommend you play it!\nBUT!\nThis is not a game to start Shantae with! The mechanics are different and it's not a good idea of what the series is.\nBeyond that, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse takes place directly after the events of Shantae: Risky's Revenge. If you haven't played Risky's Revenge first, then you should because it will cause some confusting moments in Pirate Curse.\n\nPros:\n\n- Amazing Graphics\n- You constantly feel interested in the game. There's never a moment where you feel bored or want to take a break.\n- Just like all Shantae games, there is backtracking, but the other thing about Shantae games (excluding Half-Genie Hero)      \n   is that the backtracking never makes you feel sick of the areas. With the new pirate gear you obtain during your time in \n   the game, after virtually every world there is things to do in all the previous ones.\n- There are a ton of collectables\n- The game is NOT linear. This game encourages exploration and has the best use of collectable hunting I've seen in my \n   years of gaming. You have to go off your path and utillize your arsinal in creative ways to find hidden passages in walls \n   or hidden rooms to find them. You don't even have to find said collectables and that really helps them feel like goodies \n   rather than chores like many recent games do.\n-  This game gives you NOTHING on a sliver platter. Sometimes I feel I'll be hunting for a secret or a collectable just to find \n    a key in the chest I found. The puzzles aren't simply laid out in front of you, they require dedication and smarts. This \n    really protects the game from being too easy and definatly ups the enjoyment levels.\n-  Amazing character development. The story is great, all the characters have lovable personalities, you just remember \n    them all and very few are just one-offs.\n-  The game also brings some of the trademark Shantae humor to the table which is always greeted with a warm \n    welcome.\n-  Fantastic soundtrack!\n-  Just straight fun platforming\n-  You actually use your items to fight bosses. You don't know how many games render items useless by not doing this!\n-  Gems weren't jsut coming at you in heaps.\n-  Platforming wasn't too easy.\n-  REALLY good final boss fight!\n\nCons:\n\n- Items that you had to purchase and upgrade in RR amd HGH were turned into one-time use items.\n- Some items like the Monster Milks and the Bubble Shield I felt were useless.\n\n\nJust buy this game and Risky's Revenge at the same time and you'll have a good few weeks.", "timestamp_created": 1497771144, "timestamp_updated": 1497771144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32526227": {"recommendationid": "32526227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090123913", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491777954}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a big fan of the Shantae games, and I think this one is just as great  as all the others.", "timestamp_created": 1497759519, "timestamp_updated": 1497759590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475885", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32516578": {"recommendationid": "32516578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091787231", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497728023}, "language": "english", "review": "My first Steam game with all achievements unlocked. \n\nI did not expect to like this game so much, in fact I hated it in the first 2-3 hours.

But let's be real here, the gameplay changes with the pirate gear taking the place of the old transformations is what makes this game special and a total beast, they're so practical and fun to mess around with and each of them are used well troughout the game not to mention unlike the new half-genie hero, this game has a rather good difficulty curve. another great thing about Pirate's curse is how ever changing it feels and I'm not just talking about the beautiful levels, im talking about all the different \"mini games\" you have to do, if you want to call them that. in one stage you have to sneak around guards undeteced and in the next you're carrying Rottytops around which leaves you helpless, there were others too but my memorys a little lazy right now.\nHonestly the only real issue with the game is that the backtracking is still a bit irritating but other than that I feel like this game is on the same leauge as the likes of some of the best 2D indie platformers like Shovel knight and Freedom planet, an extremely fun experience from start to finish.

I'm a bit on the older side and I remember when 2D platfomers were in their heyday. To me, 2D platformers are the essence of video gaming. After all, Mario saved the whole industry on his own back in the day. This game takes me back to those glorious times. There are so few games now that hold my attention for very long, but I simply could not put this game down. I even went for the 100% achievement, where usually I just want to complete the story and nothing else.\n\nThe visuals in this game are beautiful, from the sprite work to the full 2D character drawings. Environments are varied and well designed and the enemies are cute too. Wayforward has some of my favorite character design in their original IPs, and I love the designs in this game.\n\nThere are small bits of voice acting here and there, but they sound really great. The music is catchy, although occasionally repetitive, but that is to be expected in this genre of game.\n\nControls are tight and work well. I personally finished it using a Steam Controller and I liked it very much.\n\nThe gameplay itself is truly excellent. It is [i]slightly[/i] on the hard side but I'm pretty used to that kind of thing from my childhood. If you really want to 100% the game, it will take a bit of work and occasional frustration. I was actually slightly disappointed by the final boss. I found him surprisingly easy to beat, especially with bubble shields and auto-potions equipped. If I had known he would be so easy, I would have probably tried to beat him without any items.\n\nOverall, this game is quite a gem and you should absolutely buy it. Wayforward is a great company that makes great games that are better than many AAA titles, but with 1/10th of the staff and budget.

For the most part, it's been an enjoyable ride, but the game has a fatal flaw.  That is the final dungeon.  I find myself totally unable to get past the first spike room as the switch timing and all the spikes makes it nearly impossible for all but the most skilled players to pass with any degree of success.\n\nThe massive spike in difficulty that comes with the final dungeon totally ruins my enjoyment of the game and makes me feel cheated that I ever bought it.  Due to the difficulty of the dungeon, I will likely never complete the game and it will remain unfinished.  I feel like I wasted my money with this title.\n\nThe final dungeon has a difficulty so great that it feels like it belongs in a different game.  Had I known it would be as difficult as it was, I never would've made the purchase, which is a shame since I enjoyed Half Genie Hero.\n\nOn the other hand, it does seem like Wayforward Technologies learned their lesson in this regard as the follow up title had less of a difficulty spike with its final level.  When designing games, there should be a more even increase in the level of difficulty as you progress through the game.  For the most part, this is the case with Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.  However this lesson is forgotten with the final level.  I find the level almost totally impassable, which makes me both frustrated and incredibly angry,\n\nI would ask for a refund, but the game is functional and works on my P.C.

Keep that in mind while you read this review.\n\nIf you like Metroidvania-type games, you should definitely play Shantae and the Pirate's Curse (henceforth PC). While it doesn't have the slick HD graphics of Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero, it has far more exploration and item hunting that HGH does. If go into PC understanding that this is a port of a 240p game from severely underpowered handheld hardware, you'll be just fine. Wayforward has redrawn the portrait art and menues as those would have looked horrid on any modern PC monitor.\n\nGraphically, PC, like all Shantae games is a colorfull 3D side-scroller with lots of cute girl characters and art. Look for screen shots to get a better idea, but don't go in expecting DOAX or Senran Kagura.\n\nAnyway, rather than a tradition Metroidvania structure where all areas are interconnected, this game has one \"hub\" island and another 4 (5?) islands which you travel to via a scrolling menu. I would have prefered interconnected worlds, but the menu makes sense with the game's ship/pirate theme.\n\nMost Shantae games see the main character using her genie powers to transform into various animals which grant powers such as block crushing, wall climbing, swimming, and the like. In this game, Shantae instead gets her powere from Pirate Gear like a hat that lets you float/fly, a pistol that allows, long distance hits, etc.  Like most fans of the series, I feel like the Pirate Gear results in better, more seamless gameplay than Shante's genie transformations.\n\nThe game has a very fair difficulty. You may die here and there, but you should learn from you mistakes and be able to movbe on quickly. The exception is one sequence near the end of the game. I won't well you what it is, but you will know it when you get there.  \n\nThis isn't a long game. Most players should be able to finish in 10 hours or less at 100%.\n\nIf you like colorful, mid-difficulty exploration games with cute girls and light story, PC is probably for you. if you're looking for a Dark Souls-level challenge, a 100+ hour game, deep story, or are triggered by cute, somtimes scantily-clad anime-style girls, you might be best served to look elsewhere for you gaming needs. \n\nHighly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1493089699, "timestamp_updated": 1493089699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31344653": {"recommendationid": "31344653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025134353", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492574041}, "language": "english", "review": "8.5/10.\n\nThis is a very fun game, with charismatic characters, good art direction, good level design, classical gameplay with some twists that make it original, fresh and very replayable, with a consistent diffiiculty, it never feels too hard or too easy.\n\nThe pixel art, in my opinion, could be better, but that problem seems fixed in the new Half Genie-Hero game, looking to get that one anytime soon.

And by brief I mean that that game was too short. Shantae, her hair and endearing cast of characters come at you strong in this game making for a fun platforming adventure.  This time you have a new unseen but ever present foe in the Pirate King, whose presence is felt in the different locations you travel to and as a big bad baddie after revealing himself.\n\nI would say this game features platforming at it's best with every stage being slightly more challenging than the last. Even though you don't sport magical transforming genie powers in this game you still have a number of accessories that help you along the way in the guise of Risky Boots' old pirate gear. Another big change being she's now part of your quest traveling entourage shipping you off to each new destination in Sequin Land.\n\nThe graphics, while very reminiscent of the previous game have an updated look and feel making it familiar yet fresh. The in game UI has improved so that it's less cluttered with usable items separated from the questing ones. Some of Shantae's side moves, like her backdash and recovery jump are added as purchased moves but overall felt less necessary than before. The one roundhouse kick move I all but forgot about most of the time as your primary weapons and accessories are more than adequate for dispatching foes.\n\nThe platforming though is where this game shines. There's some areas near the end where you'll have to think a lot about how you're going to traverse the area, especially the last stage on your way to defeat the Pirate King. Level design was challenging without being punishing. Bosses had patterns that were easy to figure out but also utilized any new item you picked up in the dungeons well. I would say this game was maybe twice as long as Risky's Revenge and definitely worth your time if you're into Metroidvania type games even if you're not it's just a lot of fun playing.",

I was interested in the game before I tried it out and the game exceeded my expectations. On the surface, it's a cutesy anime-inspired looking game with more fan service than I would have liked and with a lot of humor and fourth-wall breaking. It may seem like a game to not take seriously, but the gameplay is Metroidvania-esque with hard platforming, items, puzzles, hidden objects, secrets, difficult but interesting bosses, etc. It holds up with hard platforming games like that on the NES or SNES, but it's also modern. The controls are fluent and very responsive and movement it sastisfying. Attacks are mostly hair-whipping but you can unlock a powerful kick and when you get items like the cannon, the scimitar, and the boots then you can use them as weapons as well and even do so combos. You go to different islands which each have a boss where you get an item after. Each island gets increasingly difficult. Spiderweb Island is kinda annoying because of the zombies that come out of the ground. The ghosts are BS because they will randomly appear within damage distance to you and you won't see them coming, often times knocking you back off of platforms, and they can be hard to line up hits against. Mudbog Island is the most annoying for me because every other steps an enemy suddenly appears when you're close enough to get damge from them. These weird tar globs pop up from the ground, strange gloop monsters poke from the ceiling so when you try to jump over the tar globs, the ceiling gloop guys slap your face. Then the slime ghouls that bounce around are just stupidly irritating. It's not a hard level, just one where you get sick of it quick. Some bosses feel almost impossible until you figure out what you need to do and what item you need to use. The Squid Baron gave me a real run for my patience and I died many times until I figured out how to weaken him and how to dodge his patterns. The dragon boss was weird because I wasn't sure if I was doing anything right or if I was hitting him and suddenly I won, but I'm probably alone on that one.\nThere are places that seem excessive to me, and perhaps not for the better. In Spider Web Island, you have to carry someone through a forest and you have to dodge enemies and obstacles because you can't attack and one hit kills you. And this part feels like it goes on forever. Everytime you think that was the last section and you relax your muscles, wiping the sweat from your brow, there's more. Also, the final level going through the palace was impossibly hard and incredibly tedious, adding so much more stages than I feel they should have and not enough checkpoints. I would get to a part in a stage where I thought there was a checkpoint, then I make a small mistake and I'm all the way at the beginning, forced to face the last deathly impossible challenge. I actually had to do a jump shortcut to skip the palace in order to save my sanity (this is the video that helped me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2oO17qvy34&t=13s ) Maybe you'll have a lot more patience than me. And the final boss took a longer time than I expected too. Everytime I thought I was close, I was far from it, and then he'd change things up and you'd have to defeat this stage of him. But once that final cutscene started, my heart soared to the heavens and I screamed in passion, \"YESSSSS!!!!\" It felt good. The rewards were worth the challenges. It looks like a game that will be average, but instead is tough and looks at your outstretched hand and says \"I ain't taking your hand you little baby.\" It kicks your butt, it gives you false security, it then let's you know just how bad you are.

game is WAYYYYY too much fun.  As a fan of mostly shooters, it was fun to go to another gametype, and [b] oh boi did I choose a great game [/b]. \n\nSo, I guess I need to break it down like this then. \n\nSTORY: I really do like the flow of this story, it starts you off from what I belive is Risky's Revenge. However, the story is so flowing that not only do you not need to play the other games, but you'll feel like you have played the other games even though you didn't. [i] It actually feels like an adventure, go figure[/i] xD 9.5/10\n\nGAMEPLAY: I can't really talk about this game play too much without spoiling a 10 year old game (it's totally not 10 years old lol). Starting out, it feels like a typical platformer with a standard melee, fair stuff. But [i] ohhhhhhhhhhh boi[/i]. When you get dem \"upgrades\", boi oh boi, that's when this game gets REAL GOOD. JESUS. Not only does it get more fun with \"upgrades\", it does get challenging as you progress. 10/10\n\nMUSIC: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUoYI0cXIUw] Bruh,[/url] it is the best game music I've heard in a while. It can be funky as fuckle when you are in an easy going part, and then [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGW1aF5cAyg&index=3&list=RDhImbUtLJT04] ominous and spooky [/url] when need be. It is a FANTASTIC soundtrack and I want to kiss Jake Kaufman for making doing so well (... well maybe not kiss, but you get the point; I'm very appreciative of his work).  15/10 I don't give a fuck.\n\nMinor Gripes: Some things are a little cryptic while other times they stright up tell you what to do with an item. Items can be hidden in the weirdest of places (I'm lookin' at you, Scuttle Bat #20. :V) Really, my only complaint.\n\nOverall: If you can get this in a humble bundle or if you get this- JUST GET THIS. PLEASE. IT HAS FULL XBOX CONTROLLER  SUPPORT AND IS JUST A GREAT GAME. PLEASE. \n\nThis game has changed my outlook on life. That's how good it was. I [i]was [/i] suicidal. Now, I'm going to make a life of myself just because I played a game. \n.... that sounded way better in my head- anyways, Please do get this game.

Una vez m\u00e1s es un juego de plataformas en 2D (side-scrolling) pero que ahora agrega mec\u00e1nicas de los juegos de Metroid (Metroidvania/Igavania) por lo que es mucho m\u00e1s extenso que Risky's Revenge. A pesar de eso sigue siendo un poco corto y algo f\u00e1cil porque el juego apenas ofrece reto, ya que los niveles a pesar de estar bien dise\u00f1ados son peque\u00f1os y no hay mucho que explorar. Los acertijos de los laberintos son muy f\u00e1ciles (por no decir muy obvios) y los jefes de nivel tampoco son la excepci\u00f3n, no obstante, sigue siendo muy divertido y satisfactorio.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente me decepciona porque si lo comparamos con la versi\u00f3n de 3DS (original) los sprites y escenarios est\u00e1n demasiado pixelados y no tiene soporte de filtrados como bilinear o trilinear como m\u00ednimo y es que algunos gr\u00e1ficos se distorsionan bastante haciendo que la versi\u00f3n de 3DS sea muy superior visualmente.\n\nLa m\u00fasica es excelente pues es de Jake Kaufman quien ha trabajado anteriormente en juegos como Shovel Knight, Mighty Switch Force y la serie de Shantae propiamente. El dise\u00f1o de personajes es muy original y esta vez fue el equipo de Inti Creates (Mega Man Zero y Azure Striker Gunvolt) el que se encarg\u00f3 del arte.\n\nEn el apartado t\u00e9cnico no me puedo quejar de nada porque el juego no tiene bugs o al menos yo no tuve dificultades, soporta mando para aquellas personas que no est\u00e1n acostumbradas al teclado (yo jugu\u00e9 con los dos) y no parece tener problemas de rendimiento o compatibilidad.\n\nEn conclusi\u00f3n Shantae and the Pirate's Curse es un juego muy entretenido pero que es un poco corto y algo f\u00e1cil, no obstante, tiene a su favor una historia muy divertida, personajes carism\u00e1ticos, buena m\u00fasica y en general un buen dise\u00f1o.\n\nCalificaci\u00f3n:\n\n4 de 5", "timestamp_created": 1487918103, "timestamp_updated": 1487922374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30121978": {"recommendationid": "30121978", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037482292", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486743383}, "language": "english", "review": "A solid 2D side scrolling action platformer which contains all the important ingredients for a great experience.\nNamely:\n\n1) Quirky and interesting characters\n2) Simple yet good controls\n3) Lots of secrets & hidden areas\n4) Extremely lax clothing rules\n\nWhile not particularly challenging (unless you're achievement hunting), the host of interesting characters and the silly interactions keep the game light-hearted and fun.

The first few levels were very boring, your character starts with only a basic melee attack and single jump and that's it, average level design, and extremely boring enemies. Only allowing the player to save at specific points is also annoying.\n\nIn windowed mode, the game only allows two very small resolutions (uninstalled the game before I thought to check the exact numbers for this review) which is strange. The game has a fullscreen mode which gives more resolution options, but I had serious performance issues.

It was worth it.\n\nStory is very wall-breaking just to advance the plot... but hey, it all kind of works in its own charming and quirky way.\nGraphics is based from its 3ds port, sound is OK. Controls are terrible on default. After configuring to WASD and JKL... its playable reminiscent of those old flash games.\n\nGameplay is smooth and fun...until the last level. This difficulty curve is insane but doable. If you hate trying to make it through a corridor perfectly over and over again... look up a cheat/exploit to skip it.

But the overwhelmingly positive score is misleading. \n\nThe game is far from perfect.\n\nThe game possessed a number of frustrating bits/design flaws, that really spoiled the engagement.\n\n1) I will start of with the worst: In order to get the true ending (which you definitely should strive for) you need to find all cacklebats (type of secret). Problem is, sometimes they are so well hidden that is seems almost impossible to find them without luck. For example, in one area you have to hit a wall while charging, and the cacklebat drops from the sky. There are no markings on the wall whatsoever and it you can't hear or see the cacklebat. How am I suppose to know that will happen?\n\n2) Enemies appear when they are off screen for 2 seconds. Why? Why can't they appear again once I leave the area? Some enemies work that way, but others don't for some reason.\n\n3) Enemies appearing at the same spot you're at. You're just trying to jump from one branch to the other and a ghost appears right in front of you, giving you no time to react. This isn't a huge problem, but it's just unnecessary design.\n\n4) They don't always introduce new mechanics in the best way (apart from gear). There are some platforms that you can shoot and they will do something. Uhm, since when does this happen? There is nothing indicating that something should happen if you hit them.\n\n5) Backtracking. Remember the small rock in the corner that prevented you from going in that direction? Well now that you have the gear, 2 hours later, you can and must go there. You don't remember because you took a break for a day? Tough luck. Some characters do point you to the island you need to go, but this problem could've been tackled much better.\n\n6) Bog island first 3 screens :P\n\nThe positives outweigh the negatives, and some type of frustration is good to have if it makes you get good at the game. But these are mainly design flaws that take away from the experience which makes it a good platformer, but not very very good one.", "timestamp_created": 1486832746, "timestamp_updated": 1486832746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29849822": {"recommendationid": "29849822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012363945", "num_games_owned": 1750, "num_reviews": 219, "playtime_forever": 1129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486826960}, "language": "english", "review": "Even better than it's predecessor Risky's Revenge.  \n\nThis game series just keeps getting better for each installment that comes and is very recommended for people who likes their platformers to have interesting characters and story. \n\nBe advised though, this game has a pretty hard end game so unlike it's predecessor this one is for a bit more mature audiences as the end game is quite hard platforming.

The main game is easy for platformer players, apart from the last level, but there are lots of extremely difficult achievements.\n\nThe gameplay is polished. By time spent, there is as much combat as platforming. There are dozens of enemy types, and traveling to your destination normally means killing three or four of them over and over while moving from left to right. The odd fetch quest and minigame are thrown in too, including one very memorable sequence in which you carry a manipulative undead woman through screens of one-hit-KO hazards. The bosses are huge, and generally involve a simple puzzle, which reveals a small hitbox. Defeating them without being hit (except for the first one) is phenomenally difficult. I found the game unchallenging, but fun. Risky's affects give Shantae several abilities which meaningfully empower the player's movement through physical space, so you start to feel superhuman by the end. The final level is bereft of enemies, and doubles down on tight platforming. I began playing games on the SNES in the early 1990s, and this was my bread and butter. I loved the last bit of this game. I just wish it had gone on a little longer.\n\nThe plot is a MacGuffin. Shantae teams up with her old nemesis, the malevolent purple pirate, Risky Boots. Her ability upgrades are not genie powers, but Risky's piratical affects, which have been stolen and hidden around a bizarre archipelago. It has genuinely sweet moments, but it's mostly a network of gags. Games in this genre are frequently weighed down by mountains of stultifying lore, so it's a relief that Shantae gives you the bare minimum and lets you play. Worldbuilding and atmosphere are instead provided by the music, gorgeous art assets, and pleasing animation.\n\nThe music is full of bangers. I don't think there are any bad tracks. For a platformer, you mostly want upbeat, high-tempo music to keep you motivated and give you momentum, so the songs are fitting. I have found myself humming them while driving or working.\n\nThis game was mostly made by men, and it mostly stars half-naked women with body types which straight men usually find appealing. Men in this game are caricatures, and their extremely diverse bodies are not sexualised (with the possible exception of a cyclops, whose undress is played for laughs, and who receives no sexual attention). A couple of animations (and the entire spritesheet of Risky Boots) aside, the sexualisation exists mostly in the art which accompanies dialogue scenes. I found that I was never entirely comfortable with this part of the game. For what it's worth, the strongest suggestion of sexual interest or romance is between Shantae and another female character, and it is written very innocently.\n\nI also don't feel great about the co-option of Arabic folk religious tradition in the Western trope of the 'genie', although that battle was probably lost shortly before my birth, with the publication of the Arabian Nights in 1706. Thankfully, the trope is not very intrusive here, although Shantae's hometown resembles a pop cultural imagining of Arabia, circa 1200. I'm white, and not best placed to say how harmful this depiction is.\n\nI had fun running around in this world, and I intend to pick up the next instalment.", "timestamp_created": 1486404786, "timestamp_updated": 1486404786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29718479": {"recommendationid": "29718479", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977567326", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486300675}, "language": "english", "review": "Unplayable 5-h-1-t.

[b] Half Genie hero (HGH) [/b] is fun, but it can't reach the heights of greatness that [b] Pirate's Curse [/b] did.\nThis is probably the last really great Shantae game, wrapping up the story of the first three games perfectly.  \n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\n-The pirate moves fit perfectly into gameplay in a way that the transformation moves never could (and still don't in HGH).  The move away from the Metroid/Vania style I was weary of at first, but in this case it just makes the game all that more enjoyable.  Where Risky's Revenge saw Shantae traveling back and forth over only a small handful of areas, Pirate's Curse is structured more like a level based game, with mini worlds to explore.  The gameplay and flow is sooo much better for it.  Unfortunately they took this approach way too far in HGH and we were left with a linear level based game ALA DuckTales remastered.  Pirates curse was the perfect mix of both styles.  Pure platforming bliss.\n[b] Risky's Boots / 10 [/b]\n\n[h1] VISUALS [/h1]\n-Just absolutely beautiful and pitch perfect. Gorgeous hand drawn/painted backdrops with plenty of animated elements immerse you in the locals of Sequen Land and beyond. Bright and eye popping pixel art in the foreground is used for characters.  The sprites are pixle perfect and the animations are fantastic, best in series by far.  We can't forget the beautiful character portraits shown during speech, drawn by the team at Inti Creates this time.  They are teh best they have ever been, and likely ever will be now that HGH has changed the art style so drastically.\n[b] Rotty's tank topp / 10 [/b]\n\n[h1] MUSIC [/h1]\n-The best it's ever been in the series, still infused with those chip sounds that got lost in HGH.  Remixes of old favorites as well as new additions make the soundtrack really hit the spot. You'll be belly dancing along the entire adventure!\n[b] Bolo's Bandana / 10 [/b]\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\n- Just perfect.  If you've played the first two games you won't be disappointed.  It has just the right amount of callbacks to make long time Shantae fans grab hold of it right from the get go.  It really is the most well crafted story of all 4 shantae games.  The characters are used to their full potential and you really get attached to them like you never have before even in Risky's Revenge.  \n-I just can't praise the story enough, it's the best part of the whole package. Especially when you consider the fact that Wayforward elected to alienate long time fans with HGH by doing a soft reboot to try and draw in new fans.  It's really nice to see a proper Shantae story to wrap up the original trilogy.  While HGH does still fit into the chronology as the fourth game, it pales in comparison to Pirate's Curse in this regard.\n[b] Sky's Cowlick/ 10 [/b]\n\n[h1] TLDR / Overall [/h1]\nPirates Curse is the greatest Shantae game of all time, and it looks to stay that way if the games progress in the direction HGH is taking them.  One last fantastic adventure with Shantae and friends.  If you're even a little bit of a fan of the series, you MUST play this game.\n[b] Shantae's belly / 10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1485754823, "timestamp_updated": 1485755422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29575544": {"recommendationid": "29575544", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291079726", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 756, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485731775}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u597d\u68d2\uff01\u771f\u7684\u63a8\u8350\n\u64cd\u4f5c\u611f\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u914d\u97f3\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u90fd\u505a\u5f97\u5f88\u68d2.\n\u4e0d\u5355\u5355\u662f\u6a2a\u7248\u76f4\u7ebf\u8d70\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u8fd8\u5f97\u56de\u57ce\u91cc\u505a\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u800c\u4e14\u6bcf\u6b21\u83b7\u5f97\u9053\u5177\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u8def\u7ebf\u5f04\u5f97\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u8282\u594f\u611f\u4e5f\u5f88\u597d.\n\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u5973\u4e3b\u592a\u53ef\u7231\u4e86\uff0c\u914d\u97f3\u4e5f\u914d\u7684\u5f88\u597d,\u603b\u4e4b\u6211\u8fd912\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u591a\u90fd\u73a9\u7684\u5f88\u5f00\u5fc3\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1485732475, "timestamp_updated": 1485732475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29575459": {"recommendationid": "29575459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029349772", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513340580}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is one of the best platformers ive played in a long while, even on par with Shovel Knight.

This is a great feature to add to a platformer because it gives you a sense of speed that is sometimes lost nowadays in modern day platformers.\n\nThere are a couple of small problems I have with the game. There is A LOT of fan service. My favorite example which makes me laugh a lot is there is a level where you get captured by people who think you are the queen. They dress your character (Shantae) in prison Leia type clothing. If thats not hilarious blatant fan service right there you have to unlock 3 other gates. Each of them contain a captured FEMALE dressed in the same outfit. Even though they are supposed to be no where near that area. They all have their own poorly written excuses to why they are there but we all know its for the weebs to get their ding dong goin.

This time you'll be pairing up with Risky on your quest to defeat a common enemy, this is where the fun starts. Unlike every other Shantae title that revolves around her dances to get around, this one you'll be using [spoiler]Risky's pirate gear,[/spoiler] earned as the story progresses. Each piece of gear has its use and since they act more as moves you'll never go without using one; but more importantly they allow you to speedrun the living hell out of the game which is really fun if you are into that.\n\n[h1]Playthrough[/h1]\nThe playthrough is about 7-8 hours if you go in blind and take your time to do everything. The story is enjoyable, the dialogue is funny and clever as ever, the levels have awesome art direction and simple yet fun layouts, and the drawn sprites really pop out making it a rather enjoyable playthrough. The game sadly lacks on the boss department, bosses aren't really challenging and I can't say I had fun with them, I just felt neutral.\n\n[h1]Completion[/h1]\nThe 100% in game is rather easy, since it's a metroidvania type of game you'll do some back and forth but nothing too extreme. The game has two collectibles: Squid Hearts, that are used to improve your health, and the Cacklebats, [spoiler]which are needed to get the true ending of the game.[/spoiler] Thankfully this doesn't feel like a chore and for me it happened naturally, since I always search every quarner of the levels as I play this type of game. I've seen a handful of people crying about the last level and the boss, but it isn't all that challenging (more about him on Achievements). After you finish the game once you'll unlock Pirate Mode, which allows you to play with all the gear from the beginning, and this is where speedrunning makes an appearance...\n\n[h1]Steam Achievements[/h1]\n[b]Summary: Speed and Precision[/b]\nTo obtain all of the game's achievements it's where I believe the biggest portion of fun actually exists, they provide some challenge to a rather easy game so for me it's a welcoming gift. If you don't like speedruns this isn't the completion you should be hunting down. One of the Achievements is to finish the game with any percentage in less than two hours and the other one finish the game 100% in three hours. A lot of people struggle with these, but they are doable if you use a Youtube speedrun as a guide. Personally I achieved the 100% in 1:18 of in game time, but it actually took me about 5 hours. \nThe other challenging ones will have you defeating each boss without getting hit, something rather simple to do, only the final boss can be of trouble. Personally I had issues with the final boss due to not being able to dodge his [spoiler]cannonball[/spoiler] attack, but after many failed attempts I took my time to see their pattern and I found a way to easily dodge them. Since that was the only challenge in that fight, it quickly became easy to achieve. The only other two achievements that may provide a headache for some is to clear the [spoiler]\"Run Run Rottypops\"[/spoiler] portion in [spoiler]Spiderweb Island[/spoiler] without getting hit, that one is just a matter of patience. And the other one is to finish the game with all the Heart Squids but without using them, so basically finish the game with your starter health, if you do this in Pirate Mode it should be \"easy\". All of the other achievements will come naturally and/or are simple to get but missable like \"Fool me once...\".\n\n[h1]Steam Badge[/h1]\nHaving leveled it up to max I can safely say the Steam Badge for this game, it's not worth getting, the emojis you'll get are \"meh\" (if you get any, all I got where 4 Shantae Smile and 1 Shantae Relax) and the same goes for the Backgrounds. You can go to my profile where I'm using the rarest one, if you like it and want a shot at it then sure have a go at the badge.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nShantae and The Pirates Curse was a fun game that I genuinely had fun playing and completing. While I would recommend [b]anyone[/b] to play it, I wouldn't recommend it to Achievement Whores like myself.\n\nThis game gets:\n8/10 and my Dark Seal of Approval\n5/10 Achievement Whore Score (More means easier)", "timestamp_created": 1485373062, "timestamp_updated": 1485374460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29482679": {"recommendationid": "29482679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002205586", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 749, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485200192}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a challenging and fun plateforming game, closer to Castlevania or Metroid than any recent Castlevania or Metroid game in the past few years was.[/b]\n\nI played and completed Half-Genie Hero before The Pirate's Curse and I remember feeling somewhat disappointed by how easy Half-Genie Hero was. When I bought The Pirate's Curse, I expected a similar experience. Boy wasn't I surprised.\n\nMuch like Half-Genie Hero and other Shantae games, The Pirate's Curse focuses a lot on a few set of levels which you can re-explore in pure Metroidvania fashion in order to find new hidden collectibles thanks to the new abilities you regularly acquire. Unlike Half-Genie Hero, The Pirate's Curse is a genuinely difficult plateformer that will test, frustrate and reward you all at once.\n\nSome of it is somewhat unfair (off-screen enemies? really guys?) but most of it is a fair assessment of your abilities and how you decide to use them, while further upgrading said abilities will make revisiting levels that previously appeared as challenging much easier and thus much more pleasant.\n\nThe music is once again amazing, the humour is ever present and enjoyable, and the visuals are just what you'd expect from what was originally a 3DS eShop title while still remaining pleasing to the eye. The only gripe I have is with how poorly the UI was designed, but once again, this is a 3DS eShop port that had to suffer some sacrifices. \n\nAll in all, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a legit plateformer that will put your patience and skills to the test and feel immensely rewarding when you complete it.

It's very reminiscent of Aladdin on the SNES visually, while it plays like Megaman X with a dash of Super Metroid.\n\n\n\nThe graphics are fun, bright, and gorgeous pixel art that recalls the 16-bit era of gaming which the soundtrack matches perfectly.  Dialogue is witty, story is fun, and the game takes place over many different locales.  The \"stage select\" is very reminiscent of Megaman which is suiting because the game controls similarly as well.  The changes of scenery are nice and help keep the game fun between zones.  The pacing at which the game gives out new mechanics that allow you to advance is pretty well done for the length of the game as well, and there are a variatey of items that are paired in fun/funny ways with the new abilities.  A great example is that you get the ability to \"double jump\" from a cannon that you shoot below you.\n\nThe boss fights are not too challenging, but make up for it by being fun, patterned bosses, often with multiple phases.  The game has a good 8 hours of play time the first play through if you take your time to explore all the nooks and crannies.  Time can easily extend past that with a game+ mode and speed running.  The game controls very smoothly and in manner that allows you to improve over time.\n\nI only have a few gripes which some may not agree with on account of preference:\n-i prefer more exploratory Metroidvanias--this is not that type of game.  while there is a little bit of revisiting old zones, the game is failry straightforward in how it progresses.  i also felt this was a shame because of how many zones there were and how different they were--it would've been nice to spend more time in them.\n-the bosses are a tad easy.  i personally don't mind this if the boss fights are engaging (and they are!), but some people might be bothered with this.  the game makes up for this a little bit with multiple achievements being tied to fighting bosses without being hit or in unique ways.\n-i felt the characters took up too much room on the screen.  it wasn't terrible, but it could've been a little better as well as the game was built around how much realestate there was available on-screen.  this keeps you from being able to play and react more strategically to your environment.  so while the character sprite wasn't quite Sonic-level of taking up screen space, it wasn't exactly Super Mario World either.\n-the dialogue character art is a little too \"sexy\".  to the point where i could see some parents keeping this game away from their kids.  i get that it's supposed to be anime-ish, but i found it distracting at best and uncomfortable at worst.\n\n\nAnyway, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is one of the better offerings in the Metroidvania space, and is well worth the money.

I liked it even better than Shantae's newest installment, Shantae: Half-Genie hero, even though that one is also a pretty solid platformer and Pirate's Curse doesn't feature it's fancy HD graphics (would be a very nice optional texture pack though... I wish it were possible. ;D)... I felt it just had a little more depth to it, with it's neat dungeons, light-hearted dialogues, excellent platforming mechanics and hillarious take on humor. It even nails the perfect difficulty, with some challenging parts, but without ever being unfair. \n\nI could go on and on, but I promisd not to bore you. So, let me just tell you this.

jamas, pero cumplen su funcion y en juegos como estos lo que interesa mas que nada es el gameplay.\n+El  gameplay y los controles son cumplidores, nada del otro mundo, pero en general es fluido, los controles responden bien y rara vez una muerte es por culpa de ellos.\n\nLo malo:\n-Cuestionable desiciones en el dise\u00f1o de ciertos niveles, el mapa de la isla de las almas perdidas y el ultimo nivel en especial, el de las almas perdidas porque tiende a sentirse muy \"cheap\" el posicionamiento de algunos enemigos \"ocultos\", usualmente estos juegos tienden a darte una pista de peligro, pero aqui esta pista se confunde con el entorno y es realmente dificil saber si hay peligro o no, rompe por completo la fluidez de la experiencia... Y el ultimo nivel es exponencialmente mas dificl que el resto del juego, es como pasar de jugar el primer nivel de super mario uno de los ultimos niveles de super meat boy en menos de 30 segundos, esa curva de dificualtad aparece de la nada. Comprendo que los ultimos niveles deben ponerte a prueba de ahi la satisfaccion de ganar el juego, pero dios, si es dificil el ultimo nivel, probablemente soy solo yo, pero es algo que talvez a alguien mas le pueda afectar a la hora de jugar, por eso lo menciono.\n\nSobre todo, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse es un juego decente con sus fallas, lo recomiendo a personas que realmente adoren los metroivanias y no les moleste jugar uno que al inicio parece casual, pero al final termina siendo super meat boy.\nEs un 7 de 10 en mi libro, bueno, pero nada extraordinario.", "timestamp_created": 1485220306, "timestamp_updated": 1485220306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29445141": {"recommendationid": "29445141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011841547", "num_games_owned": 1104, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485187280}, "language": "english", "review": "A great platformer with Zelda dungeon elements thrown in.

Oh no. \n\nWhile it is a straightforward game, Shantae is a world full of lively creatures to meet and pummel complete with their own animated pixel art and animation. Really it's a joy for the eyes at all times. Which is good as you'll be running back and forth between the various islands again and again, getting whooped along the way. But this isn't a bad thing, the difficulty is a steady increase, enemy monsters drop gems you can use to upgrade your weaponry and grab items for tough fights, and a rocking soundtrack keeps your blood pumping from one end to the other.\n\nWhile what Shantae does has been done before, it still stands on its own two legs very well because the elements it does use are polished. There are things to find, places to explore, and you'll be engaged from beginning to end. So if you are looking for a game that takes standard Metroidvania concepts and pushes a little further, that's not Shantae. But Shantae is still a good game and thus is worth a full recommendation.

Based on the preview images, the sexualization of the characters made me suspicious the game was using that to lure in gamers to compensate for poor quality. And, while there is a lot of sexualization (take that for what you will), this ended up being one of the best platformers I've played in years. Definite must play for anyone that enjoys the classic Metroid and Castlevania games. To start off with the sort-of negatives, there really isn't any character development at all for the most part. By the end, I could hardly remember any of the characters names or anything about them. I found the story also pretty forgettable (at least to someone who's new to the series, like me). The end of the game left me feeling indifferent towards the characters and the world because of that. \n\nThat said, this game managed to keep me hooked all the way until the end despite the above. The art design for the characters, enemies, and world is great and takes me back to my Sega Genesis days as a kid. The characters, while pretty two-dimensional, do remain charming when they do speak. But, the real reason to play this game is for the platforming. And the platforming is really, really good with a controller. The controls are tight and responsive and the game introduces new platforming mechanics at a regular interval that keeps the game fresh and encourages the player to revisit previous levels. You start off feeling like the game is pretty slow. But, by the end, you'll (literally) be flying through the levels at crazy speeds. \n\nThe platforming mechanics in this game are just so much fun I never ended up caring about the neglected story or character development or how much of a BS difficulty spike the last level was (seriously, it's like something out of Super Meat Boy).

The visuals are bright and colorful even in darker areas of the game while the music is fast and bouncy. Together they create a great atmosphere for a great game.\n-Fanservice can be good or bad depending on your taste.\n\nCons: \n-The game is cheap, meaning it will place enemies in places you need to step or land on to move forward, forcing you to take damage. This will set up an environment that, unless you\u2019re super careful, you will jump on a hidden monster which takes a large chunk of health.\n-The in game economy is terrible. You need to grind if you want to have both the upgrades and items such as potions. Going for a 100% run I barely made enough money for all the upgrades. \n-Third game in the series. Characters interact and have history with each other. It\u2019s not hard to follow but you are jumping into an ongoing story. \n-Fanservice can be good or bad depending on your taste.\n\nGeneral Thoughts: \n\tShantae is a good game with small flaws. You will be immediately greeted with astounding visuals and sounds which will be followed by tight game play and with all of them working together you will be sucked in, that is until you hit a few of it\u2019s flaws. The game places cheap opponents in positions that will hit you even if you are careful, taking away large chunks of your life. Requiring you to memorize enemy positions in areas if you wanna move between them without taking massive damage. Thankfully, it\u2019s not hard to overcome these issues, but it is frustrating dealing with them in an otherwise good game. The game\u2019s story is good enough for what it presents and the addition of character models will either pull you in or put you off as they involved a good amount of fanservice from the main character and the supporting cast.

If you want an fun platforming game that isn't mario, then I would highly recommend \"Shantae and the Pirate's Curse\".\n\n8.6/10", "timestamp_created": 1484369116, "timestamp_updated": 1484369116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29239454": {"recommendationid": "29239454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025544300", "num_games_owned": 950, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 2628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484870541}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know how i never knew about this game. It's a great platformer with a decent story. The aesthetics were great and each level had a different atmosphere. You knew going into the 4th island mod bog was going to be tough just going through the first screen. The animation is awesome everywhere; Even down to the smallest of enemies. The enemies were balanced pretty well, with the exception of the wolves doing 1 1/2 hears of damage. They were annoying, but had relatively low health compared to other enemies in the area. Two of the bosses didn't seem to be balanced very well though. The dragon (dagron) was quite random with it's pattern and sometimes just went way too fast while the other unbalanced boss the ice slug (I'm not looking up the name) was extremely easy and slow.\n\nIn my first couple play throughs, i had a tough time finding out what i was supposed to do (i'm not much for trying everything to complete a puzzle), but after that first time it was a breeze the other play throughs. It especially got fun when you unlock pirate mode (new game with all weapons from the start). Dashing through the easy levels and finding shortcuts in the early levels was very fun and i think I'm going to help make a guide for the 100% and any% speed runs.\n\nAnd lastly the achievements were challenging. 100% speed run, 2 heart challenge, never get hit... All challenging, but doable when you learn the game enough.

Conheci por acaso, pesquisando sobre algumas alternativas de games \u201cmetroidvania\u201d e me surpreendi com o game.\n\nOs di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o muito bem escritos , os personagens possuem personalidade bem definidas e o humor do game \u00e9 \u201cspot on\u201d. Gargalhei demais em algumas cenas e tamb\u00e9m gostei muito da arte dos personagens.( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\nO Game possui gr\u00e1ficos bem bonitos em pixel art , os sprites possuem muitos frames e s\u00e3o muito bem feitos. \n\nAlgo que curti muito no game , \u00e9 que a cada fase que voc\u00ea passa (ilhas no game) , voc\u00ea recupera algum objeto de Risky e o utiliza ao seu favor , e durante o gameplay \u00e9 comum voc\u00ea encontrar ba\u00fas e \u201cHeart Squids\u201d (4 Heart Squids expandem sua vida m\u00e1xima em um cora\u00e7\u00e3o) em locais inalcan\u00e7\u00e1veis , e conforme voc\u00ea progride voc\u00ea pode voltar nesses locais com a habilidade para alcan\u00e7ar os itens.\n\nEsses objetos acabam dando um ritmo interessante no game pois o tempo todo voc\u00ea est\u00e1 aprendendo e usando sua nova habilidade para progredir na fase. E as fases s\u00e3o muito bem projetadas para explorar todas suas habilidades novas e antigas. O tempo todo voc\u00ea precisa usar suas habilidades e isso torna a experi\u00eancia bem natural. Uma curva de aprendizado muito interessante.\n\nA jogabilidade \u00e9 muito precisa e responsiva , como todo game de plataforma deve ser [strike](todo game deve ser na verdade\u2026)[/strike]  N\u00e3o \u00e9 um game f\u00e1cil , os inimigos come\u00e7am a ficar bem desafiadores.\n\n\u00c9 importante explorar ao m\u00e1ximo todas as fases , mas n\u00e3o se preocupe , na tela de sele\u00e7\u00e3o de fases (ilhas) voc\u00ea tem a indica\u00e7\u00e3o de quantos \u201ccacklebat\u201d voc\u00ea precisa coletar e quantos Heart squids voc\u00ea coletou.\n\nNa \u00e9poca que escrevi esse review , joguei na plataforma 3ds , por\u00e9m , tive a oportunidade (via humble bunndle) de adiquirir quase de gra\u00e7a , a vers\u00e3o para steam.  Com a pr\u00e1tica e com um controle melhor , tive uma experi\u00eancia mais agradavel ainda , al\u00e9m de agora conseguir obter achievments. Por\u00e9m , o game usava a segunda tela do 3DS para o inventario e mapa e isso \u00e9 um ponto forte da vers\u00e3o do 3DS , por\u00e9m , essa vers\u00e3o est\u00e1 incr\u00edvel tamb\u00e9m.\n\nMinha \u00fanica queixa com essa vers\u00e3o , \u00e9 que os gr\u00e1ficos durante os di\u00e1logos ficam pixelizados , mesmo em tela cheia ou em modo janela , algo que n\u00e3o me atrapalhou mas esperava mais.\n\n\"\u00c9 um game simples , mas ainda sim \u00e9 uma experi\u00eancia bem s\u00f3lida.

The attention to detail is insane.\n-Difficulty curve: Every island/dungeon is a little harder than the previous, with the exception of the frostbite dungeon.\n-Challenging and plentiful puzzles. I actually had to look up the solutions to a few of them.\n-Story was the better one of the series so far IMO.\n-Jake Kaufman does it again with the soundtrack. Absolutely amazing, there are more tracks I like in this soundtrack than HGH.\n\nCons:\nI'd really have to nittpick to find fault with this game. The only thing I can think of right off the bat is this: The lack of transformations means also a lack of upgrades to find, which the game conpensates for by replacing heart containers with heart squids which you have to find multiple of in order to expand your maximum health. There's plenty of stuff out there to find, just very little variety in what you find.\n\nAll in all, if you like these sorts of metroidvania open-world platformers, you won't regret Pirates Curse in the slightest. I only regret beating the game 100% because now the adventure is over and I have to hope a future Shantae game can match what Pirate's Curse has achieved.", "timestamp_created": 1483580764, "timestamp_updated": 1483582072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29009137": {"recommendationid": "29009137", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999957571", "num_games_owned": 726, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483327965}, "language": "english", "review": "The best of the three Shantae games on steam at the moment.

When you reach the last dungeon it's pretty much 50-50 on whether you're going to destroy your controller or just swear a lot. It's incredible that such an otherwise competent game could have such a bad final dungeon.\n\nOutside of that, the only critique is that Wayforward tend to flub their boss battles a good bit. They often rely on mechanics that you don't really have to use anywhere else, so sometimes it takes a while to get any idea how you're actually meant to hurt the boss, and it's usually easy to end up getting juggled or stunlocked. But, despite that, the boss battles are usually relatively short, and tend to manage not to detract from the game itself because of that, you're unlikely to get stuck at them, because you're probably not going to be hurting for consumables that'll let you just brute force them.\n\nI certainly don't regret getting the game.\n\nThough there was a moment during the aforementioned final dungeon where

I play many PC games with controllers and I rarely, if ever have any problems with controller lag, this game is just awful with it. It makes many of the platforming elements very difficult to play. \n\nI am sure many people enjoy this game, but I had to ask myself if I'd ever buy any of their other  games in the franchise and the answer is \"No\", ad as a result, I can't really recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1482902694, "timestamp_updated": 1482902694, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.326672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28738663": {"recommendationid": "28738663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049888002", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482376979}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game", "timestamp_created": 1482899207, "timestamp_updated": 1482899207, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28728341": {"recommendationid": "28728341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029124608", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 641, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482873501}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible!

this game rightfully deserves every bit of praise it gets. I could elaborate further, but in short, this game is a must-have for anyone who enjoys Metroidvania games and any fan who loves Shantae.\n\nThis is one of those instances where the sequel to a game improves upon every aspect. The story is in my opinion the best story of all Shantae games, involving you to team up with your arch nemesis to defeat an even darker power. You\u2019ll still find the same funny light-hearted dialogue combined with music by legend Jake Kaufman the series is known for. Gameplay is smooth and very fair with an excellent balance of combat, exploration, and puzzles.\n\nI\u2019ve clocked in a little over 6 hours for my first playthrough with 100% completion. Playing the game in the New Game+ option is also very satisfying, because it gives you all your movement abilities to start with, letting you breeze through many segements. I have a few more game hours due to getting the speedrun achievements which aren\u2019t very difficult and I urge others to give it a try. I also own this game on the 3DS and I can pop this game in any day and still have a great time. Even with the release of Half Genie Hero, which I've already completed, I still put Pirate's Curse as the #1 Shantae game out there, but it is extremely close. There is still content to come for Half Genie Hero so this opinion could change at any time.", "timestamp_created": 1482260162, "timestamp_updated": 1482269372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28481982": {"recommendationid": "28481982", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972377817", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482219009}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is broken and has been since I bought it like a year ago.

choice for those that enjoy the \"Metroidvania\" or Old School Platforming games. Being the third Shantae game in the series, I feel this is one of the best! The Artwork is very smooth and superb. The Pixel Art gameplay is also very crisp and has a nice cutesy look to it. This is very much a game I would recommend for any players, even those new to the series. I would still recommend trying to play the other two Shantae games first if possible though. Shantae: Risky's Revenge - Director's Cut is available here, http://store.steampowered.com/app/277890 on Steam. There are a few small things that may turn some people away though. The game is fairly short and even more so for those that are great platformers. There is also not much content to te game aside from the story but the game does allow for \"different endings\" for the completionists out there as well as speed-runners.

Viele M\u00e4ngel des Vorg\u00e4ngers, wie die kurze Spieldauer, der lasche Schwierigkeitsgrad und die grobpixelige Grafik wurden gerade geb\u00fcgelt. Und mit dem Wechsel von der Magie zur Piraten-Ausr\u00fcstung wird obendrein ein neuer Spielflair aufgebaut, der die Serie frisch h\u00e4lt. Das Spiel geh\u00f6rt freilich immer noch zur Kategorie der Action-Plattformer im Metroidvania-Stil, auch wenn dieses mal ein st\u00e4rkerer Fokus auf den Action-Plattforming-Aspekt gelegt wird. Leider gibt es einige Punktabz\u00fcge in der B-Note. Die Hintergrundgrafiken sind nicht mehr so liebevoll gestaltet wie im Vorg\u00e4nger und der sprunghafte Anstieg des Schwierigkeitsgrades im finalen Dungeon ist mehr als irritierend.

This isn't a challenge thing though, as if you save and suicide, you respawn with full health. It just adds more tedium to the game. \n\nThere are only 5 different upgrades to get and none of them feel unique. You get a weak long distance attack (never really worth using), a glide, which is very dull and adds very little bar sections that actually require the use, a pair of boots which allow you to do an equivalent of the Shine Spark from Super Metroid, except you need an even bigger run up and you just run forward, not fly up as well. A down attack, adds very little as the hair whip still can be more effective and only serves to kill a few enemies designed specifically to die to them and lastly a triple jump, which occurs very late in the game and only serves to make you go back and get all the items you saw in plain sight in previous levels.\n\nThe biggest problem however is that the game seems designed entirely around these items, rather than the world and the items being designed in tandem. \n\nI can't recommend this game.

Full-screen action, very fluid moves, excellent retro music, nice 2-D high-res still graphics. Compared to the PC version of the former Shantae game, it's a great leap forward technically speaking.\n\nIt's a classic gameplay, but perfectly crafted. Perfectly. It's more jumps-oriented than beat-em-up, it requires some precision more than fast reflexes, but that's very pleasing. \n\nIt's not \"just an idie game\": the studio here is a veteran of MetroVania games and worked on big console licences too: they fukken know their job. We don't have so many games of this kind on PC, so just buy it.\n\nThe gameplay is a little demanding: all controls respond very fast and smoothly, but you need to be precise in all. Over time, training takes place and you really enjoy it, but it seems odd at the beginning for a PC player.\n\n\nCONS: you need an xbox controller, and can't reassign keys, although you could in the former game. Since it was developped for a portable console, most GFX are upscaled even though it remains very good overall. Too bad they did not redraw the main protagonists in higher resolution (will be made in next episode). Also, 19 \u20ac is a little expensive, but you can get way cheaper keys.\n\nExcellent fan service too. Dialogs and story are funny. A bit lenghty at the beginning, but then action takes place.

And the result is amazing.\n\n[u][b]GAMEPLAY: 8,5[/b][/u]\n[list]\n[*]Gameplay easy and immediate, like old times;\n[*]Various objects that you will enjoy to use;\n[*]Funny story and very hilarious;\n[*]Save Points well distribuited;\n[*]Good exploration mechanics, which makes you want to complete it in every single part.\n[/list]\n[u][b]GRAPHIC: 8[/b][/u]\n[list]\n[*]Amazing animations;\n[*]Very good level design;\n[*]Smooth and polished graphic;\n[*]Sexy characters' design, but never vulgar.\n[/list]\n[u][b]MUSIC, SOUNDS, EFFECTS: 8[/b][/u]\n[list]\n[*]Enjoyable soundtracks;\n[*]Well made sound effects.\n[/list]\n[u][b]LONGEVITY: 7.5[/b][/u]\n[list]\n[*]Probably the only big weak point, 10 hours to complete it and lesser time if you want to try the Pirate Mode (a.k.a. New Story+).\n[/list]\nSo this is my opinion for what I consider a little gem in the steam store. I loved Shantae in every part and I'm sure I'll buy the sequel scheduled in 2017. Actually you can find Shantae and Pirate's Curse at \u20ac19.99, an acceptable price in my humble opinion. For achivements hunters, there is nothing impossible in this game, so you can feel free to play and master it. \n\nHave fun!!", "timestamp_created": 1472455419, "timestamp_updated": 1472455704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581653", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25219129": {"recommendationid": "25219129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107762915", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 709, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472432726}, "language": "spanish", "review": "This is one of the best metroidvania games I have played, and has awesome pixel art and great OST.

Although I did find that it was rather easy, and it seemed shorter/more compartmentalized than the previous one. Rather than having an 'open' map to explore, you're given seperate worlds, which I guess makes it seem smaller, even if it's about the same size. Still gives for a good length playthrough though.\n\nThe story is a good continuation, and there's lots of humour to be found in it. The art is very good, keeping in style.

I was expecting a cute little pixel game with a bit of that classic \"Nintendo Difficulty\" that I loved to be frustrated by in my childhood. This game was a joy to play through, even when I kept dying to the god damn spikes. A lot of people will tell ya that this game is very short and they'd be right considering that if you don't bother with exploration you blow through this like Huricane Katrina through New Orleans. However, much like an old NES or SNES game you'll wanna take your time and find all the little secrets. This game has a handful of collectables, one type of which adds several more phases to the final boss (who might I add was justified to the hype Risky built up). This game offers challenge that Metroidvania fans will appreciate, a wonderful soundtrack, downright adorable characters, and an impressive art style in both pixel and digital. I have yet to play through the previous games (The first game is impossible to find for less than three-hundred fuggin dollars (USD)) but the second game is available on Steam right now so I might pick it up when it goes on sale. Though, I doubt that the second game is as good as this one. WayForward is an impressive developer, taking up bigger jobs to fund their own series is admirable, and you can tell they put in the love and effort the games deserve. I cannot wait for the next game in the series, while diverging from a pixel animated art style to a full on digital, it still looks impressive. 20$ is asking just a bit too much however, as this game has nothing more to give after completing the game 100% (aside from the achievements for my fellow achievement freaks). Do give this game a try though, WayForward deserves more praise than they get, you won't regret putting time into this game.\n\nRottytops best girl", "timestamp_created": 1469124578, "timestamp_updated": 1469124742, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24424838": {"recommendationid": "24424838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309320128", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475641417}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u5173\u6211\u5c31\u6b7b\u4e86\u4e0d\u4e0b\u5341\u6b21\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1469020146, "timestamp_updated": 1469020146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24420531": {"recommendationid": "24420531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202154811", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500181729}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae is such a fun game series.", "timestamp_created": 1468996117, "timestamp_updated": 1468996117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24409107": {"recommendationid": "24409107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198859785", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449070407}, "language": "english", "review": "Mediocre, mudane, run-of-the-mill, uninspiring sidescroller that's heavily pixelated...

I would call most of the game easier than the classics in the genre, but I would not hold that against it.    That said I found a few specific levels to be difficulty spikes and found them frustrating against the challenge level of the rest of the game.\n\nAs the third game in the series I do not recommend it as an introduction to the series;  Risky's Revenge is a better starting point.  Pirate's Curse doesn't really try to introduce any of the returning characters to you, which would make the story beats fly over a player new to the series' head, including that our heroine *had* magic abilities that she somehow *lost* before this game begain, and her history with series antagonist, Risky Boots.\n\nSome folks might be turned off by the fan service.  There is a high number of female characters wearing outfits that show off clevage or belly buttons if not both, and there's an entire sequence poking fun at the \"slave Leia\" outfit.   To me the game came off as self aware about it as opposed to creepy or skeevy, but other folks may feel different.  I did find it refreshing to play a game where not just the heroine is female, but so are most of the significant cast members.  This is something I enjoy about the series overall.\n\nWayforward overall does good work, and Pirate's Curse is certainly another example of that.

This time with the help from IntiCreates ( makers of Megaman zero, ZX , 9/10) , wayforward was able to show us what Shantae was really capable of. The first Shantae game well being the first one and being on the gameboy color had some issues , most of them caused by the console itself, it also didn't know what it wanted to be. The second game Risky's Revenge which you can also get on steam while improved upon a lot of things in the first game still had some design choices that made the game feel unfinished (the map , only 3 dungeons one being a gauntlet etc...) . \n\nWith background out of the way lets look at this game.\n\nPros:\n1: The music is amazing. Its energetic and memorable. Same guy who worked on shovel knight also a great game.\n2:The controls are tight if you die its your fault and not because of some input delays.\n3: The weapons you get are really useful and welcomed addition to the game. In previous games you had to hold buttons certain amount of time to dance and then transform  just to use the power you needed. However this time all you have to do is to just press the correct button and BOOM. It kinda reminds me of Symphony Of the Night in that regard.\n4:The bosses are really fun and challanging and the best part is you can beat all of them withouth getting hit. Its actually not that hard. \n5: There are lots of dungeons (and 2 of them are secret bonus) and these are pretty fun. \n6:The writing is hilarious.\nCons:\n1: You can't (to my knowledge ) assign the buttons on your controller. You can do it for the keyboard but not the controller.\n\n..........And thats it , I can't really find major problems with this game.\n\nI recommend Shantae and The Pirate's Curse to anyone who enjoys 2d platformer/metroidvania type of games.", "timestamp_created": 1467274987, "timestamp_updated": 1467850113, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23940453": {"recommendationid": "23940453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040549915", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468085083}, "language": "english", "review": "With a final playtime of 8 hours and 15 minutes, 100%ing the game after looking up a guide for the handful of collectibles I missed, SatPC is a little on the short side, but the overwhelming majority of those 8 hours are filled with an exceptionally solid platformer with an irresitibly bouncy soundtrack, enjoyable visuals and several absolutely top-tier waifus.\n\nThe difficulty is fairly nicely balanced and rises at a reasonable rate, save for when it skyrockets in the final two levels and sends the death count soaring.

In addition, the Pirate Master has started using Dark Magic to turn Risky's Tinkerbats into Cacklebats - horrifying mutated creatures which Shantae must defeat in order to cut off his source of Dark Magic. Honestly, I think the plot here is actually much better than in the previous game. Whereas the plot in Risky's Revenge is at times quite thin, in this game it doesn't feel thin at all - there always seems to be something going on and it's in general much easier to follow.\n\nGameplay-wise It's a Metroidvania-platformer like its predecessor, but the areas you explore have been expanded quite a bit. Rather than just Scuttle Town and the nearby areas, you have a multitude of different islands to explore, from the tropical Saliva Island to the zombie-infested Spiderweb Island and the icy Frostbite Island, which gives it much more variety with regards to the areas you explore and visit. Compared to the first game, Scuttle Town and the surrounding areas have also been shrunk massively, though in all honesty this is more to the game's overall benefit, since it cuts out a lot of the needless traipsing back and forth that the first game had. The multiple islands also help to mitigate the Metroidvania forgetting-where-you're-up-to problem by giving you much more of a sense of progression as you unlock the islands and defeat the Cacklebats found there. The number of undiscovered Cacklebats and Heart Squids, which you use to increase the size of your life bar, are also shown above each island in the hub screen, making the completion aspect of the game much more accessible too. Because of the way in which it's been redesigned it's also much easier to find your way around Scuttle Town since all the buildings are now clearly labelled, so you no longer have to guess which door contains what.\n\nThe base gameplay and graphics are very similar to that of Risky's Revenge, with a few notable differences. In this instalment Shantae is by default able to whip her hair back and forth much faster than before, and as a result from the get-go the action is much less rigid and more snappy and satisfying. The fact that they've also added Castlevania-style knockback is both a blessing and a curse, since it allows the action to flow a bit more, but on occasion can be quite irritating. Unfortunately, due to Shantae having lost her genie powers, her Dancing mechanic is missing, but fortunately this is replaced with a new mechanic in the form of pirate equipment that can be found throughout the levels, for instance a pistol that allows you to hit far-off switches and serves as a weak ranged attack, a hat which lets you glide over long distances, and a scimitar which lets you do a ground-pound attack. These new mechanics complement the Metroidvania gameplay much like the Dances did in the previous game, and arguably even do a better job, since there's much more of them and they allow for a lot more variety in the platforming puzzles than the Dances did. Not only that, but WayForward have also, it seems, managed to add a couple of new spins on the platforming too, with gameplay drastically changing in a couple of sections of the game as you play. One section has you running through the woods, unable to attack, and another is a Wind Waker-eqsue stealth section in which you're stripped of all your items and have to try and sneak out of the area - if you're detected by the guards they will march you back to the start. These serve as interesting, fun little breaks from the Metroidvania gameplay and keep the game interesting in a way that doesn't disturb the flow of the plot in any serious way. \n\nA drastic change from the previous game is the items system, which has been almost completely overhauled. Most of the Magic from Risky's Revenge is gone and the mana system has been replaced with time-limited, single-use items. You're no longer able to hot-switch between different items in quite the same way as in Risky's Revenge but what you can do is use multiple items at the same time - a feature which the previous game lacked. The overall range of items available is also wider and you no longer need to find Magic Jam to buy anything. There's some offensive items, attack buffs, \"Fighter's Moves\" - extra maneuvers you can perform in combat, some of which can come in particularly handy, and a massive, very variable and on occasion slightly humourous range of healing items (including the new Auto-Potion which activates as soon as you run out of health - believe me they will save your bacon on many an occasion). I found myself not using quite as many items in this game as in Risky's Revenge, but honestly there's nothing wrong with the new system. It's different, but it doesn't really detract from the experience at all and is just as fun to use as the old system.\n\nA lot of the characters from Risky's Revenge also reappear in Pirate's Curse as do some new characters, major and minor, ranging from a new Baron to a walking He-Man parody, and they're all just as funny and interesting as they were before, perhaps even more so. You get to see a lot more of the other characters than in Risky's Revenge and you'll learn more about them as you progress through the game - and you'll be glad to know that the fantastic writing also makes a return, and in greater and even more humourous amounts. Sometimes it'll have you on the edge of your seat, other times every other line will have you giggling, heck, even SIGNS and some item descriptions contain their fair share of weird and wacky humour! All that and somehow you never really lose track of the plot. Suffice to say, this game's writing is top notch.\n\nA fair amount of the sountrack is made up of remixed tracks from Risky's Revenge but most of them are original, and whereas its predecessor's soundtrack was pretty good, Pirate's Curse ramps that description up to \"freaking fantastic\". Every single track is even more riveting than in the previous installment, and the soundtrack in general seems to have much more \"thump\" to it than before. As a result it perfectly complements the action-rich gameplay and awesomely-written characters, and not only that, but whilst it does sound modern and upbeat some of the songs seem to remind slightly of its 16-bit forefathers - if you listen to them in the right way they sound a bit like remixes of songs from the days of the SNES era. I really kind of regret that I can't fit more songs from this game's soundtrack into this video, it really is that much of joy to listen to.\n\nAnother thing which this game has which Risky's Revenge doesn't is voice acting for some of Shantae's lines, provided by none other than Cristina Vee, who also played such high-profile roles as Homura Akemi from Madoka Magica and Compa from Hyperdimension Neptunia. Whilst at times her voice acting can be a teeny bit grating it certainly helps to build up Shantae's character a little more by putting more of a voice in her mouth, and Christina Vee's performance is pretty good. That said, it is a bit of a shame that WayForward didn't choose to go big and fully voice-act it, because that would have been downright awesome.\n\nAll in all, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is not just a great sequel to a great game, but also a truly fantastic game in its own right. The music is wonderful, the dialogue is stellar, the gameplay is smooth and enjoyable, the 16-bit graphics once again give it a fair amount of charm, and for what it's worth I can say that, even on its own, this is one of the best platformers I've ever played and certainly one of my all time favourites.", "timestamp_created": 1467221787, "timestamp_updated": 1494593812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23909255": {"recommendationid": "23909255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050157026", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495772649}, "language": "english", "review": "Stylistic, charming, and damn good looking.

I'll start with, an odd point : the controls. The first time I have controlled shantae, something was odd, I felt like I couldn't control the caracter properly and I always took hits that I would have normally dodged. I felt this for, like 1 hour then the controls were perfect for me. So that's why I first thought that the controls were bad and I almost gave up, but in the end, it's just that you really need your time to adapt yourself I think (or maybe I was just stup). So the controls aren't bad. After that let's talk about the difficulty and the levels : It's very well done. In the middle of each island, you will obtain a new equipment item which grant you a new movement skill that will help you to move forward, and the level disign is perfectly done to use these item and make each equipments usefull. Also, the game is pretty difficult, some passages will make you die a lot but if you really can't do it, you can use items to help you (Do not always use items or the game will be way too easy, you can almost rush a boss without worring about your hp because you will kill him faster that he will kill you). \n\n[b] Art : [/b] The whole thing is well executed, the design and the backgrounds are beautiful and they fit very well to the universe of shantae, no bad point here, it's gorgeous. Also, you can obtein CGs in the game and that's cool.\n\n[b] Musics and sounds : [/b] Well, the music are good and they fit very well to the art and the universe of the story but I am pretty sure I wont remember any of those song, it's not bad, but it's forgettable.\n\n[b] Story : [/b] The universe is really cool, and the characters as well, they are funny and they are some comic elements. The story of your journey itself is kinda.... boring, you will clearly not play that game for his story,\n\n[b] Glitch and issues : [/b] I had a pretty small issue but it's worth to mention. The speed of the game depend of your fps, it's nothing serious you will say since it's a retro style game and there is no way to have fps drop on this BUT the issue is somewhere else, there isn't a 60fps cap, so if you have a screen which can show more than 60 fps, your game will speed up ! I have a 144Hz monitor so the game ran at 144 fps and it was like playing with a x2 fast forward option, so if your monitor have more than 60Hz then you will have to cap your fps yourself. Nothing serious, just have to remember to change the fps cap before launching the game.\n\n[b] Summary : [/b]\n\nPros :\n- Good gameplay and well dosed difficulty (the first level is for baby but the last one is very hard)\n- Well executed art and level designs\n- Can be speedruned\n- Support the french language\n\nCons : \n- The little fps issue I had\n- Maybe a little short, it took me 7H and half to beat the game for the first time, there is a new game+ but it's more a speedrun mode because it's the same thing but you will have every gear unlocked from the start.\n\n80/100 It's worth your money and your time, it's very fun yet perfectible on some points", "timestamp_created": 1467125062, "timestamp_updated": 1467125094, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23879854": {"recommendationid": "23879854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117268329", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467076950}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, before you look at me like I'm a retard.

It's the game play , the gameplay is garbage.\n\n1) Movement. The movement controls in shanate keyboard or controller. Is bad. Input feels delayed and moreover the movement in general is clunky and doesnt have much control. There are some areas where I clearly landed on certain platforms only to fall right through them. You have to be ludicriously prescise in some parts. You dont have much control compared to game that are like idk 10 years older.\n\n2) Combat: At my point of the game I got a melee attack and a Max ranked pistol. There is no reason to use the melee other than it's multihit properties. But it only works if the enemies are at the exact same level (height). If for example you are at a level below and an enemy is blocking your way at a level higher then you, well guess what your fucked. \n\nShanate also has vital moves that you can learn that are locked by a GEM wall. So you baiscally have to farm gems in order to achieve all the good moves in the game. Even at that there is still no way to hit enemies above or below you. And the majority of the levels (at least what I have played) are mostly vertical. So yea you ar a cuck to bad design. With a move set that does not translate into the level design at all. I have to wonder, what the fuck are you thinking Wayfoward, and why the fuck do people like your game.\n\nEnemies are hit sponges (at least 70% of them) you have to wail on them for 6 mins to kill one. And then of course the inventory system oh boy.\n\nIf you have an inventory system in this kind of game it's simply a cop out for shit design. Thats all im saying. If you like good quality platformers, like Castlavania, Metroid, Cory n The house, Mario, ETC.

As per usual, the new abilities you unlock as the story progresses go hand in hand with increasingly challenging foes and level design. Although some backtracking will at times break the linearity, the game follows a stable pattern of unlocking new areas one after another, each of which will feature some sort of maze-like dungeon where you'll earn a new skill and fight a boss.\n\nAlthough the difficulty increases with each new area, it remains relatively easy on the whole, meaning you'll probably clear this ten-hour adventure without much frustration (only the final dungeon has a few brutal screens). If you've done a good job of amassing health upgrades, the boss fights are pretty straightforward and a wise use of the healing/shielding/offensive items will help keep you alive. None of them are hugely challenging, although the achievements for defeating them without taking damage are another story.\n\nWith the gameplay relying on rather classic action platformer mechanics and only posing a moderate challenge, its true highlights lie elsewhere. The cartoonish design is just delightful, most notably in the dialogue scenes where the character art is all kinds of cute. The writing is tons of fun, with heaps of absurd comedy, mild innuendo and occasionally breaking the fourth wall, all the same ingredients that had already made the previous episode so refreshing. Last but not least, Jake Kaufman's soundtrack is absolutely lovely, with a bunch of energetic, catchy tunes that will stay with you long after you've quit the game.\n\ntldr Recommended as f", "timestamp_created": 1462517674, "timestamp_updated": 1462517701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.644111", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22820103": {"recommendationid": "22820103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085926417", "num_games_owned": 430, "num_reviews": 194, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463346017}, "language": "english", "review": "Its like Aladdin for the Sega Genesis, but with waifus!", "timestamp_created": 1462499523, "timestamp_updated": 1462499523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494606", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22807831": {"recommendationid": "22807831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001347458", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462441538}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games i've played in years, amazing gameplay, funny dialogues and story, it might be a bit expensive for $20 but considering i got a total of 20 hours out of it for 2 runs i would say it is fine", "timestamp_created": 1462441933, "timestamp_updated": 1462441933, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543210", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22805667": {"recommendationid": "22805667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053843750", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 257, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482431786}, "language": "english", "review": "Stupid like Mario but for men who like to stare at a woman's breasts.

I am sad because I have finished it, and I weep for there are no more worlds to conquer.\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse is a rock-solid middling-to-hard Metroidvania platformer. A Metroidvania (or IGAvania, or exploration platformer) is an open world game that provides you with a huge environment to explore. As you travel through this world you gain strength, power, and -- most importantly -- special abilities that let you overcome obstacles you couldn't before.\n\nThe game opens with Scuttle Town being sold off by its childish mayor to the Ammo Baron, who plans to turn it into a military base. Shantae, the town's Guardian Genie, manages to defeat him, only to be arrested for attacking the town's lawful owner. While extricating herself from the situation, Shantae runs into one of her old enemies, a Tinkerbat, who's been possessed by dark magic. Shantae's nemesis, Risky Boots, warns her that the dark magic heralds the potential return of the Pirate Master -- the near-godlike entity responsible for the disappearance of most of geniekind. Shantae and Risky are forced to put aside their enmity to team up against the greater evil.\n\nThat's the storyline. The game itself is largely linear; Shantae and Risky arrive on a new island, encounter a series of comic mishaps, and in the course of exploration Shantae discovers the entrance to a \"Den of Evil\" (dungeon). Each dungeon contains enemies, puzzles, a boss fight, and one piece of Risky's missing pirate equipment -- these last items grant Shantae increased mobility, giving her a downstab, multi-jump, etc. Defeating each boss also unlocks the next island.\n\nIn true Metroidvania fashion, it's completely impossible to obtain everything just heading straight through the game. There are tons of hidden items and secret exits that can't be reached unless you come back to earlier areas with equipment from later ones; some of it is skippable, some of it isn't.\n\nThe first Shantae game was a decent length, with five dungeons and a large overworld, but the second game was pathetically short, with only two actual dungeons and a very short completion time, and since the second one has a PC release and the first doesn't, people assume it's characteristic.\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse again has five full dungeons, as well as a few overworld areas that are large and convoluted enough to serve as dungeons themselves. In addition to the usual heart containers, Shantae can collect \"Dark Magic\" from specific, well-hidden enemies; the vast majority are hidden in fair, guessable locations. (ROT-13 Spoiler: Fbzr Pnpxyrongf nccrne jura lbh penfu vagb fcrpvsvp jnyyf.)\n\nCombat works well; Shantae has a lot of options, especially in the late game, and I rarely found myself blaming the controls. Aside from one boss (and anyone who's played knows exactly which one) fights are mostly about knowing what's coming and developing tactics to beat it, not raw dexterity or luck.\n\nThe platforming starts easy but takes the kid gloves off somewhere around the fourth island. While the later levels are full of one-hit-kill traps, you can nearly always see them coming -- and, in an innovation I'd like to see more of, one-hit-kills and falling off the screen don't mean game over. You just take damage and respawn at the start of the room, Zelda style. I haven't seen this in platform games before.\n\nOne pet peeve I have in platform games that let you explore in every direction is how it's often hard to tell whether falling off the screen means dying or just going to a new area. In Shantae, pits that will kill you are always marked with skull-and-crossbones symbols. No guesswork. I like it.\n\nI refrained from using a guide until the last \"clean up\" sweep for missing hearts and magic, and got easily about 12 hours of gameplay. Since some of this time was spent searching and/or being stumped by puzzles, using a guide all the way through would probably cut this to 7-8 hours, respectable for a Metroidvania.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n* Longest entry in the series\n* Well-designed dungeons\n* Characters are engaging\n* Jokes are actually funny\n* Good difficulty curve, decently challenging by the end\n* Configurable keyboard and gamepad controls\n\nTHE BAD:\n* Iffy replayability\n* One deeply unfair boss fight\n* No clues about certain collectibles\n* Graphics a little pixelated for a modern game\n\n(And yes, I know what the other thing people associate Shantae games with is. I enjoy it -- I'm human -- but I don't think it either improves or detracts from the quality of the game. Unless you've got some kind of hangup about women in bathing suits, almost all of this game is fine for kids -- the running gag in \"Run Run Rottytops!\" is a little over the line, but it'll probably just go right over most kids' heads.)", "timestamp_created": 1460849419, "timestamp_updated": 1460849908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22442144": {"recommendationid": "22442144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197978902089", "num_games_owned": 7063, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461711815}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite possibly the most casual yet fun game to play when you just want to sit back and not think too much.

this way of organizing the world, making the player move back and forth between islands, is why shantae and the pirate's curse is considered a member of the metroidvania group of games.\n\nthe collectibles mentioned in the previous paragraph are divided into two categories: 1. dark magic, in the form of tinkerbats that have now mutated thanks to it and that you will need to defeat to seal said magic inside your lamp, and 2. squid hearts, which can then be melted in groups of four and transformed into extra health by the \"squidsmith\". \n\nthe aforementioned scuttle town, where the game begins and the town of which shantae is the guardian genie, will serve as a hub, to which she will often return, either to perform some necessary action (often in the form of interactions with npcs) or to acquire items and upgrades.\n\nin each of the remaining five islands shantae will find a den of evil, a place from where the master pirate is obtaining the dark magic that is allowing him to grow stronger; these dens of evil bear a strong resemblance to the dungeons in the legend of zelda series: in each one of them you will find a new ability, which will allow you to explore previously inaccessible areas (both inside and outside the dungeon) and that will be used in some way to defeat the boss of the dungeon in question.\n\nspeaking of bosses, they are fairly easy to deal with: this game as a whole is not maddeningly difficult, but i wouldn't say it's easy either, so it comes as a surprise that the bosses fall so easily, at least if you choose to use the arsenal at your disposition. they pretty much will never be a problem, unless you are trying to get the no-hit achievements, but even then they won't be a huge headache. i don't see it as a big problem, but to some it might be disappointing.\n\nshantae's main weapon throughout this adventure is her signature hair whipping, but pistols and a scimitar will be added to her arsenal as the game progresses; other weapons, which on the previous game used the (now gone, for story reasons) magic meter (like the pike balls) became consumable itens. controls are very tight and responsible, a pretty important thing in this kind of game (well, an important thing in any kind of game, but especially in games that ask for precision like this one).\n\nthe game's tone is very lighthearted and humorous, with a good selection of charismatic and excentric character, as well as some fairly funny moments; the anime-influenced art style, while obviously not as good as one that's purely anime, is nice too.\n\nthere are a few problems here and there: you can't check if you already got all of the collectibles in an island without returning to risky's boat (being able to access this info on the menu would have been very useful, as it can be hard to keep track of it) and a (considerably long) insta-fail stealth section, which is not a big deal once you beat it, but will probably get on your nerves the first time. additionally, it can be somewhat difficult to know what to do next in some points (funnily enough, i didn't really have any problems with this, but i can see some people hitting a wall that will keep them from progressing, which can be very frustrating, especially when this wall comes from the game not giving you much information), although i think this is massively improved over risky's revenge.\n\nthese complaints, however, are small when compared to the game's achievements, and i think it's fair to say shantae and the pirate's curse is a very good videogame that deserves to be played by anyone with an interest in the genre, especially considering how cheap it is.", "timestamp_created": 1460675904, "timestamp_updated": 1463800621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543210", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22416520": {"recommendationid": "22416520", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969385956", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482592754}, "language": "english", "review": "While [i]\"Shantae and the Pirate's Curse\"[/i] is a lot like [i]\"Shantae: Risky Boots' revenge\"[/i] in some ways it's also unlike it in a lot of ways as well. It's ultimately still a platformer and a skill-attaining game that opens up more areas, but instead of an overworld you are given stage select screens. And instead of magic you have pirate items.\n\nThe first impression I had when I started playing was that the game was confirming the magic is no longer a thing due to the events of the last game (Risky Boots' Revenge). Honestly Shantae's transformations were a big part of what I found to be entrancing about the previous game. The fact that it was gone for good left me feelign liek there was a little hole in the heart of the game that wouldn't [i]quite[/i] be filled by the new skills. And really they didn't fill that hole but they were still decent game mechanics.\n\nShantae's friends played a more active role in this game than they did in the previous game which I totally approved of. In \"Shantae: Risky Boots' Revenge\" Rottytops, Bolo, Skye, and Uncle Mimic were ultimately just there to exist - they did nothing and were as forgetable as any town NPC save for the fact that they had unique appearances. In Shantae and the Pirate's Curse they actually take part as plot devices throughout the story. They're more like characters and less like decorations - very enjoyable characters too. \n\nOn that note I was kinda meh about the whole teaming up with Risky Boots concept. When the only thing Risky does is sit at the dock and drive you from one stage to the other she becomes decoration. She does have her own part in the story of course, but she's given reasons all the time for why she cannot participate in anything which waters down the whole \"teaming up\" concept. I think a more interesting way to handle it would be to give Risky the pirate gear and leave Shantae some magic and transformations. It would have required different stage setups, but I feel it would have added something (pirate skills and a true teaming-up concept) without taking something (the enchantment of the transformations).\n\nThe items Shantae finds are all pirate items [spoiler]that were owned by Risky Boots before they were taken from her[/spoiler]: \n\nThe [b]pistol[/b] is mostly only good at hitting distant puzzle switches unless it's tuned up to max level. The pistol basically replaces the fireball spell from the first game (1-damage). With no limit to bullets there's nothing stopping you from slinging all the bullets you want out there but it's still slower to shoot 5-8 bullets than it is to just go up and hit someone once with her hair. When maxed up (5-damage) the pistol is actually pretty okay as a weapon. 2-3 shots will kill most minor enemies.\n\nThe [b]hat[/b] feels kinda dumb in all honesty. It's basically a parachute or a glider depending how you use it. I feel it's just dumb that a hat is given noriety as a pirate item belonging to Risky [spoiler]and the Pirate Master[/spoiler] but all it does is catch wind like a parachute. As far as game mechanics go it's alright. When you get the cannon you'll never use it again except for the puzzles that require you use it. I will give the animation credit though; it looks adorable.\n\nThe [b]scimitar[/b] is simply a down-thrust while in the air. This works really well in combat as well as opening passages under Shantae's feet. You can also see the scimitar when using the boots which I think adds a little more flavor to the item than a one-trick pony (realistically a sword feels like it should be usable as a weapon but it is what it is. There are a few enemies that are much easier to fight when down-thrusting above them.\n\nRisky's [b]boots[/b] are only usable on specific situations: primarily when there's enough flat land for running (technically you [i]can[/i] do a back-and-forth run and it'll still count as the building speed phase but no secret areas seem to be level with any of these areas I've tried it on which makes me think the developers might not have actually intended the back-and-forth movement to be a viable way to activate the boots). Once activated Shantae rushes in one direction dealing damage to anything that touches her and tearing down secret hidden walls. It's gimmicky as far as combat goes. You'll only end up using it when the stage was designed for it to be used since it requires prepping to pull off.\n\nRisky's [b]cannon[/b] is basically this game's double-jump (though technically you can use it three times per jump). While in teh air the cannon will fire downwards and propell Shantae upwards. Once you get the cannon you'll use it a lot simply for the overwhelming convienence compared to Risky's hat. In combat it's okay but really Shantae's hair and scimitar take care of most things combat-wise anyway - it's good for avoidance though.\n\n\nThere were also certain skills you could learn from a shop in town:\n\nThe [b]Back Dash[/b] makes Shantae slide backwards just like the first game. You'll never use it. If it were a particularly fast slide it'd have merit but it slides her backwards at the same exact speed you could just move her in that direction. The animation put into it is lovely though.\n\nThe [b]Back Flip[/b] can be a life saver. typically if you're hit hard or hit at all while in the air you'll be knocked back and fall until you hit the ground. If you back flip you'll hop out of that state and be able to control yourself. I found this particularly importanbt when jumping from rope to rope over pits. Backflipping and gliding with a hat or double jumping with a cannon back to a rope kept me alive a dozen times or more.\n\nThe [b]Power Kick[/b] is just straight up stupid. It's a slow melee kick that does barely any better damage than the hair. The hair will do about 8 damage and can be spammed. The kick will do 10 damage but you'll take about a half second to do it. That's not even considering the button combo you have to do to pull it off. It is also shorter range if I remember right. You'll buy this to try it (because your curiousity will force you to) and then you'll never use it again. It's a badly implimented mechanic.\n\nThe level design - and the story surrounding each level - throughout Shantae was pretty cool all in all. It never took itself too seriously but it kept me enraptured all through the game. It even managed to make a filler boss battle feel like more than it was. The Shantae games seem to excel at this through sassy comedy and sexy-cute visuals.\n\nI don't mind puzzles as long as they don't stop my progress. For the majority of the game this was okay. I was never hung up on anything long until the very last level. I'm of the belief that any game that has life bars or HP counts in them should stray away from including any instant killing factors (aside for bottemless pits anyway since that's just how it goes with pits). The final level is literally full of things designed to kill you in one hit. You'd probably think \"well the last level is suppose to be hard, right?\" and you would have merit to think this. But at the same time this game has you putting forth a lot of exploration and effort into finding heart squids to increase your HP. What is the point of this if when the final level comes you'll just die in one hit anyway? Is it challenging? Yes. It's also bad design.\n\nUltimately I did enjoy this game. The animations were sexy, adorable, and happy. The puzzles were mostly moderate or easy. The story was silly and fun.

You play as Shantae, a half-genie who is now just all human.\n\nOddly for a platforming game, there is actually a fair bit of story here; Shantae and Risky Boots, your sidekick/captain, are both reasonably well characterized, and the game makes a lot of call-backs to previous games\u2026 which I haven\u2019t played. While the game IS comprehensible, I have no idea who any of these people are so the little side-stories which feature them lack meaning for me. That said, the game is full of funny dialogue, and Squid Baron in particular made me smile with his fourth-wall breaking rants. The game doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously, and he was a particular highlight of that, but on the whole it worked reasonably well, even if it did rely a bit heavily on lampshade hanging for its humor.\n\nGraphically, the game is reasonably attractive as well; the 2D Sprite graphics look pretty good, and the larger character portraits which appear while the characters are chatting look great. The game\u2019s comedic style extends to its art, with the characters having amusingly exaggerated expressions. The game\u2019s art is somewhat sexualized \u2013 the artist clearly loves voluptuous women, and the hips of the game\u2019s female characters don\u2019t lie \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t to the point where it bothered me, and it is often played for laughs, particularly given one of the characters is an attractive female zombie. Plus, let\u2019s face it \u2013 a lot of people like looking at pretty ladies, so that\u2019s really probably a plus for a lot of folks. If that sort of thing DOES bother you, though, this is likely a game which will trigger your distaste, as several of the female characters are a bit bouncy.\n\nSquid Baron, again, really shines here \u2013 his sprite is amusing enough, but his character art is great, and his hyper-exaggerated expressions really help sell his silliness. \n\nAs for the gameplay itself, the game is\u2026 well, okay. It is a reasonable 2D platformer, but frankly, it is quite easy for almost its entire length. The game, unlike most such games, grants the player an inventory menu containing 12 items, each of which the player can carry 9 of \u2013 and this includes vast numbers of healing items, as well as items which block projectiles, damage enemies passively, and greatly increase Shantae\u2019s attacks. You accumulate them over the game, you don\u2019t really need to use them too frequently (especially once you get used to the way the game plays), and by the later portions of the game you will have acquired vast numbers of them, to the point where nothing can realistically challenge you. There is an in-game shop as well, selling items in exchange for gems dropped by pots you break and enemies you kill, allowing you to further top-up on stuff, as well as buy upgrades for your attacks which allow you to deal more damage.\n\nThe net result of this is by about halfway through the game you run out of upgrades to buy and pretty much end up with gigantic piles of items in your inventory which you don\u2019t even need to use. I started using some in the second-to-last dungeon just because I had so many, but I still had enough gems to be capped out by the end. I did use the damage-enhancement items on the bosses because there is absolutely no reason not to, and it makes getting the various no-damage achievements that much easier.\n\nHonestly, the achievements are the most challenging part of the game; beating it is almost trivial, and beating some of the bosses without taking damage is quite simple, while for others, it is moderately more difficult. This sort of thing \u2013 along with a few other random optional achievements \u2013 are likely to contribute almost all of the difficulty the game holds. It is only in the final two dungeons that the game really starts trying to challenge the player, and while the final dungeon does contain some pretty challenging portions (and a sharp difficulty spike), the final two bosses are strangely easy, with only the optional form of the final boss posing any real challenge to the player.\n\nThat said, the game isn\u2019t that short. While it seemed short while playing it \u2013 and the ample save points made it easy to get out of \u2013 the in-game timer said it took me a little under 9 hours to 100% the game. I\u2019d guess it probably took about 10.5-11 hours including the time spent getting the side achievements. That said, if you\u2019re looking for a really substantial experience, this probably isn\u2019t it \u2013 a lot of the time in-game was spent doing relatively unchallenging things, and there was some backtracking involved in gathering various collectibles. In terms of fresh content, you\u2019re likely looking at 6 hours or so of gameplay, maybe a bit more.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent but not amazing game. I recently played Strider, and that game felt a lot more satisfying to me than this did. Not to say that Shantae was bad, but it just wasn\u2019t exceptional; it is a decent filler game, but if you\u2019re looking for a high-end platformer, you\u2019re better off looking elsewhere. This is middle of the road; it probably won\u2019t be disappointing, but it won\u2019t impress you particularly either.\n", "timestamp_created": 1458654033, "timestamp_updated": 1458654033, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591655", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21976332": {"recommendationid": "21976332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064798613", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457509937}, "language": "english", "review": "WOW what a game.", "timestamp_created": 1458620461, "timestamp_updated": 1458620461, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.212522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21970328": {"recommendationid": "21970328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133703335", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465498915}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the best games I ever played.

With Pirate's Curse, WayForward seems to have drawn what made people fall in love with the idea of these games and jettison the clunkier parts for a streamlined and breezy experience that serves as a tidy little cap to the series. The basic gameplay retains the Zelda II/Castlevania formula of side-scrolling exploration and power-up collecting, while ditching the more tedious map traversal of the first two games in favor of a simple level select hub. For plot reasons, the transformation dances are replaced with pirate relics that handily map to your controller's various buttons. While the core platforming and boss battles are still tempered by a near endless well of health items, there's enough meat to the level design and platforming to keep it from feeling like you're blasting through the game with little resistance. And the impressive sprite work, soundtrack, and, ehem, signature sense of humor that have come to characterize the series are all intact. While I wouldn't say WayForward necessarily knocked this one out of the park, Shantae and the Pirate's curse is a respectable RBI.", "timestamp_created": 1457230247, "timestamp_updated": 1457230247, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583310", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21640476": {"recommendationid": "21640476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004767598", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457179265}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5b8\uc820\uac04 \ud574\ubd10\uc57c\uc9c0~ \ud558\ub2e4\uac00... \uc774\uc81c\uc11c\uc57c \ud55c \ub124 \uc2dc\uac04\ucbe4 \ud574\ubcf4\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00 \ub0a8\uaca8\ubd05\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc0ac\uc2e4 \ud574\ubcf4\uae30 \uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc740 \uc720\uc800 \ud3c9\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uaf64 \ub192\uc740 \uae30\ub300\uce58\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub358  \uac8c\uc784\uc778\ub370\n\n\ud574\ubcf4\uace0 \ub098\ub2c8 \uc77c\ub2e8 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \ucd94\ucc9c\ubd80\ud130 \ub204\ub974\uace0 \uc4f0\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc77c\ub2e8 \uc601\uc0c1\ubcf4\uc2dc\uace0 \uc74c \ub9d8\uc5d0\ub4e0\ub2e4 \ud558\ub294 \ub290\ub08c\uc774 \uc624\uc2dc\uba74 \ubc14\ub85c \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\uc154\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n2016\ub144 3\uc6d4 5\uc77c \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c 98\ud37c \uae0d\uc815\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\uc218\uac00 \ubaa8\uc790\ub77c\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778\ub370 \uc774 \ube44\uc728\uc774\uba74 \uc6d0\ub798\ub294 \uc555\ub3c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc774\uc8e0. \n\n\uad1c\ud788 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc88b\uc740\uac8c \uc544\ub2c8\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uc18c\uac10\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n-\uc7a5\uc810-\n\ub3c4\ud2b8\ub355\ud6c4\ub4e4\uc758 \ub355\uc2ec\uc744 \ud754\ub4dc\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \ub3c4\ud2b8 \n\uadc0\uc5fd\uace0 \uc139\uc2dc\ud55c \uce90\ub9ad\ud130 \uc77c\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud2b8(\uc911\uc694)\n\ub9e4\uc6b0\uc26c\uc6b4\ub4ef \ud558\uba74\uc11c\ub3c4 \uadf8\ub807\uac8c\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc27d\uc9c0\ub9cc\uc740 \uc54a\uc740 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\n\n-\ub2e8\uc810- \n\ub9f5\uac04 \uc774\ub3d9\uc774 \uc880 \ubd88\ud3b8\ud568.

Having never played a Shantae and hearing it was a metroidvania style game, I was dissapointed when it turned out to be a mostly linear 2d zelda affair. The backtracking, unlike in regular metroidvania which makes exploring the world and unlocking new paths exciting and lore-richening, seemed like a tedious chore in this game. Almost like filler that they had to do in order for the game to be just a bit longer. The good thing is that the fast travel things you can buy in the one shop (yeah unfortunately there's only one shop in the very paltry main city) in this game are cheap.\n\nNow some positives. The game plays and looks well, for the most part. The animations, music, and overall style of the game are on point. Usually I find that when a game panders towards an audience it is bad. At a cursory glance one look at Shantae almost looks like its pandering toward that harem big boobied fetish, and there's no denying that it is. Since the game is so tongue and cheek about the whole thing, and Shantae's dialogue is genuinely that of a cute character, I am down with it. It's not one of those visual novels that wants you to fap every second, the big boobs are there to be enjoyed in the background and in this case work as a fine character trait.\n\nThe dungeons, although entirely linear, had great platforming. Some rooms have you dying over and over to reach the goal, which I found quite challenging and awesome. The game starts out pretty easy, but about halfway through there is a major difficulty spike. Each and every boss in the game was excellently animated and a thrill to fight. All of the upgrades of the game got better and better, and by the end I truly felt like an OP character. This is how upgrades should be done, with each upgrade being a standalone good weapon, but also synergizing with the previous upgrades aquired. \n\nAnd since this review, although I liked the game, pointed out some flaws let me just point out one small thing that annoyed me to heck. It doesn't affect the gameplay, it doesn't affect the enjoyment, it's just that when the score and the graphics and the gameplay and everything else has such high production value why does the pause menu look so crappy? Like they used they paintbucket tool on the regular blue setting and called it a day. I know pause menu's aren't the most exciting part of a game, but it always looked out of place.\n\nWell anyway, despite the shortcomings and filler the game was cool. I'll pick up the next Shantae game if it's cheap and if it ever comes out.

It's longer, more balanced, faster-paced, and in general just more fun to play. Though I'd also say it's still far from a perfect game.\n\nA few things to note right off the bat; while this does have a metroidvania-style powerup system and shop and all that, the game map is divided up strictly into levels, each level being decently sized, but yeah there's no interconnected map here. The game does have an actual map system though, something that was sorely missing from Risky's Revenge. And as well you'll easily know when you've collected everything in an area since it shows on the world map.\n\nThe main game mechanics, Risky's various items, are much more fun than the dancing of the rest of the series. No more slowing to a crawl to perform a dance that's mostly only useful in a few select areas, this time you can pull any of your tools out at a whim and practically every one of them has uses both in platforming and in combat.\n\nThe pistol is, well, a pistol. You're gonna be using it for ranged attacks a lot, and though it's fairly weak compared to other weapons it's still plenty useful. The hat is mainly used for platforming purposes to glide through the air, but it's pretty solid. I do think it should pull out faster, there were a lot of points where I felt it was a struggle to use because of how slow it is to pull out (especially in one spot in the last dungeon that's waaay harder than it should be). The scimitar lets you bounce on enemies as well as break floor tiles below you, though you have almost no horizontal movement when using it, which would've been nice and allowed for some clever puzzles, but oh well. The boots are possibly the most fun item, letting you charge rampantly through everything, zoom zoom plowing through enemies, it's so much fun. Wish it was mapped to a button rather than to a context-sensitive timer, but it'd probably be horribly broken otherwise, I suppose. And the cannon gives you three extra jumps AND another aerial attack, allowing for safer fighting and pretty much breaking all the jumping puzzles in the game.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the mode you unlock after clearing the game for the first time that allows you to play through the game with all the tools from the start, speeding up the game quite a bit and allowing for some -fun- strategies against earlier bosses.\n\nThe bosses, then, let's talk about them. They're... a mixed bag. I like some of them, while some others are a bit... bad. The boss of the fifth island, for one, misleads you into thinking you should be fighting it with the gun since that's the most convenient weapon to use, but that is definitely NOT the weapon you actually want to use, you want to hair-whip it to pull it down to the ground, and... eh... I really don't like that boss because of the bad first impression it left on me. The boss on the sixth island is relatively easy, sure, but annoying since it's literally RNG and little else. I'm not really a fan of the movement RNG in these bosses in general, the third island boss, fourth island boss, and first phase of the final boss have it the worst in this regard, though maybe it's because I had to spend time grinding to no-damage kill these bosses, but it's a minor gripe. Overall the bosses are more good than bad though, in the end.\n\nThe enemies and combat in general are also pretty solid, there's a few that annoy, a few too tanky, a few too powerful, and the first area of the fifth island is just a huge pain because of rampant enemy spam, but in general it's balanced well with the platforming. There's a fair number of enemies back from Risky's Revenge, but plenty of new ones thrown into the mix as well. The platforming is also generally pretty interesting and creative, as are the few puzzles scattered throughout the maps. The exploration elements are there, too, even with the map designs, though some parts play out almost like an adventure game, trying to figure out where to go next or finding a specific item you need to progress the story, but poking around older areas with new tools tends to produce results most of the time. It's a very solid, enjoyable experience on the whole.\n\nThe game also looks great, the spritework and animations are lovely, the level graphics and background graphics are all nice, the character portraits look great. The game also sounds great, there's some reused music from Risky's Revenge but a lot of the original tracks are just generally nice and never really wear out, plus it helps that there's quite a ton of music in the game in general, 2-3 map tracks per island, multiple cutscene themes, a few boss themes, really no shortage of good tunes.\n\nIt's really hard to fault this game much, I had a few gripes with it but nothing that adds up to a major problem, and most importantly, it's fun.

However, compared to most generic modern platformers, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse distinguishes itself by the highest level of quality, with WayForward's pedigree in game development clearly visible throughout the whole game. Actually, this game is a part of an established series, being the third and latest installment to date.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice is the overall quality of graphics and animation, with the game being mostly done in awesome high-quality pixel art. Shantae also takes advantage of modern platforms by using high-resolution character sprites for dialogue segments. Everything looks even better in motion \u2014 the animations are surprisingly detailed and very smooth, so the fact that there are a lot of them in the game is a cherry on top. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse combines regual 2D pixel-art and modern visual effects, which look together better than you'd think. The game runs at 60 FPS, like platformers used to, and actually, should be played. Super smooth animations and super precise movement \u2014 eye candy and a soothing experience where the character moves exactly like you want them to.\n\nMusic and sound effects in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse don't fall short of the graphics, with the game featuring a large number of high quality and atmospheric music tracks, which greatly fit not only the overall game, but individual levels and characters as well. And since we're on the topic of levels, it should be mentioned that level design in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is great, both in terms of visuals and platforming. It's clear that developers at WayForward are masters of old school platforming, employing challenging and interesting design, traps, secrets and everything else that makes this game feel like such classics as Megaman.\n\nEvery world in the game (seven in total) not only has its own visual theme and music, but is also designed around different types of platforming that you'll need to employ. Some levels feature platforming that is heavily influenced by games such as Megaman, while metroidvania elements present themselves mainly through the world being a bunch of inter-connected locations, presence of hidden areas and new locations slowly becoming accessible with new item acquisition.\n\nUnlike previous games in the series, where Shantae used her magic, this time you're faced with the fact that she lost it (in the previous game), so she must overcome the challenges with various items that she'll come across through the game. Usually in a game like this items would be for unlocking / adding abilites, and weapons would be used for fighting, but in Shantae even weapons unlock new abilities to the player.    \n\nThe game world consists of different islands that are unlocked after completing boss fights. These boss fights aren't that difficult, especially if you stock up on healing items, but fun nonetheless. Bosses are very large, and have a cool design, which comes in variety - a huge-ass tank straight outta Metal Slug, a misspelled fire-breathing monstrosity Dagron, and of course, an abomination to your screen space in form of the final boss (true form only).\n\nTo sum it up, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a joy to play, not only because of visuals and sound, but stellar level design and gameplay. An interesting cute protagonist also helps. For some reason people mostly missed out on this gem, with SteamSpy estimating sales at ~25K. But you definitely should buy and play this game, even if you aren't a fan of the genre.\n\nP.S.

Risky's Revenge had confusing maps and slow gameplay that eventually turned me away from it. \n\nBut here we finally have what I can confidently call an excellent Shantae game. The gameplay is so much faster here and the world has been split up into different islands, making map navigation no longer an issue. And the music, man, I swear Jake Kaufman gets better with every album he releases. Rave in the Grave just blew my mind when I first heard it. It's so catchy. And I was really surprised when Scorching Dunes started out kinda generic, but then slowly evolved into a tune very reminiscent of the old Sonic games. And the tracks actually change a little bit on their second loop, keeping them from getting repetitive.\n\nBut of course, there are issues. The Monster Milk items, which greatly boost your attack power, make most boss fights utterly worthless. The only boss that I kinda enjoyed was the Steel Maggot, because it had mechanics that went beyond just using the item you got in that dungeon. You need a little bit of observation and trial and error to beat it.\n\nHere's the problem with all of the Shantae games. Your most effective method of attack is a hair whip that can't be used while moving unless you're in the air. The devs then have to design the entire game based around that limitation. So levels are a lot of running, then stopping to attack, then running, so on and so forth. It's a lot like Castlevania Simon's Quest. Most regular enemies are no challenge and only serve to hinder your progress. (This is also why I appreciate the new pirate items so much. They let you speed through areas much more easily.) \n\nBosses are pretty much the same. They all have periods where they just stand still and let you hit them repeatedly, which is required because of the limitation of Shantae's hair. It's a fault by design and should really be changed for the next game, Half-Genie Hero. I should never get to a final boss and not be intimidated. \n\nBut hey, Wayforward isn't the biggest company out there. They did what they could and I think they did great. The art, the music, the characters, the humor, and the improved gameplay thanks to the pirate items make Shantae and the Pirate's Curse a memorable experience. I just hope that Half-Genie Hero doesn't squander the achievements made in this game and takes steps backwards. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452238752, "timestamp_updated": 1452238752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687134", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20388507": {"recommendationid": "20388507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221484468", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453321422}, "language": "italian", "review": "Ancora una volta Wayforward ci consegna un altro fantastico Shantae, questa volta pi\u00f9 ampio e pi\u00f9 divertente che mai!\n\u00e8 incredibile come Wayforward sia rimasta l'unica casa non indie (anche se si comporta da tale) che sappia produrre questo tipo di giochi. Il punto \u00e8 che nel giocare questi giochi ci si aspetta di avere fra le mani un clone di Metroid o Castlevania (come il nome del genere ci suggerisce) ma Shantae \u00e8 veramente qualcosa di diverso: non c'\u00e8 nessun collegamento con queste due saghe e il gameplay, seppur ispiratissimo a questo tipo di giochi, dista ampiamente dalle saghe che hanno definito questo genere... ma andiamo per gradi!\n\n(Saranno necessari richiami alla storia del capitolo precedente. Se non volete spoiler riguardo Shantae: Risky's Revenge evitate di leggere i primi 4 o 8 righi a seconda della visualizzazione)\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse \u00e8 il terzo gioco di questa splendida saga. L'uso di Shantae \u00e8 un po' diverso rispetto allo scorso capitolo, questa volta potr\u00e0 contare solamente su abilit\u00e0 da umana visto che, il nostro mezzo genio, ha perso l'uso della magia nello scorso capitolo. Non ci saranno pi\u00f9 danze del ventre e trasformazioni, stavolta Shantae potr\u00e0 contare solamente sulle sue nuove armi da \"umana\" (nonch\u00e8 i suoi splendidi capelli); il gameplay risulta dunque sia rinnovato che fedele ai capitoli precedenti. Le mappe sono decisamente pi\u00f9 ampie rispetto al capitolo precedente e, nella forma, ricordano molto le mappe del primo gioco per Gameboy color (uscito alla fine del suo ciclo vitale, praticamente contemporaneo con il gameboy advance) infatti non sar\u00e0 presente la navigazione su pi\u00f9 livelli come in Risky's Revenge. In compenso, Shantae stavolta navigher\u00e0 per diverse isole nel corso della sua avventura offrendo dunque al giocatore molta variet\u00e0 e aumentando la longevit\u00e0 del gioco. Utilissima invece la nuova grafica per le mappe in perfetto stile Metroid/Castlevania dove saranno segnati i punti di salvataggio (in rosso per giunta), le entrate dei dungeons e i punti rilevanti. Saranno presenti inoltre molti riferimenti musicali dei giochi del passato insieme a moltissime canzoni nuove e ben composte. Rimossi i Magic Jars ma introdotti le magie nere, utili per completare il gioco al 100%, e i \"Calamacuori\" (stavolta il gioco \u00e8 completamente tradotto) che, come i frammenti di cuore in Zelda, una volta collezionati quattro di questi e portati dalla porno fabbra (il fabbro femmina?) di Scuttle town, questa potr\u00e0 aumentare di un'unit\u00e0 la nostra vita massima. Nessun sistema di level up \u00e8 stato introdotto, Shantae dovr\u00e0 ancora recarsi in negozio per comprare (pi\u00f9 volte stavolta) shampoo e balsamo per aumentare la forza del suo attacco primario e gli upgrades delle sue nuove armi. Come al solito i personaggi sono molto spiritosi anche se, la totale traduzione del gioco, non coglie appieno lo humor velato della lingua originale (ho visto un paio di screenshot in inglese di alcune battute e devo dire che rendono poco in italiano). Tuttavia le battute riescono comunque a strappare molte risate e lo stile grafico, soprattutto dei bellissimi artwork a cura di Inti Creates, \u00e8 semplicemente perfetto e decisamente superiore a Risky's Revenge. Come gi\u00e0 accennato, il gioco \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 grande rispetto al precedente ma questo, soprattutto nei primi livelli, risulta molto facilitato e se come me ci giocherete per pi\u00f9 ore consecutivamente (per via magari di un'influenza che vi costringer\u00e0 a letto) rischierete di finirlo molto in fretta! Qui per\u00f2, in sostituzione della modalit\u00e0 magica del vecchio gioco, sar\u00e0 possibile sbloccare la modalit\u00e0 pirata che consentir\u00e0 a Shantae di tenere tutte le armi ottenibili nei dungeons sin dall'inizio, consentendo di completare il gioco nel minor tempo possibile (e poter sbloccare dunque gli altri sfondi del men\u00f9 e forse dei finali alternativi).\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse \u00e8 un gioco validissimo che merita di essere comprato ad occhi chiusi! Tanti i miglioramenti e tante le promesse per altri capitoli ancora pi\u00f9 belli ed immersivi. Wayforward si supera ancora una volta, stavolta forse di poco, ma tanto quel che basta di poter parlare di miglioramenti e per rinfrescare una saga gi\u00e0 fresca di suo! In mia opinione Shantae and the Pirate's Curse rialza veramente lo standard per questo stile di gioco (in attesa forse di Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night) ed \u00e8 un action/platformer veramente eccezionale. Se siete amanti dello stile Metroidvania questo \u00e8 un gioco che non vi deve assolutamente sfuggire! Altamente raccomandato! \n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1452220953, "timestamp_updated": 1456020934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20385112": {"recommendationid": "20385112", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012650407", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452206741}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae is a cutie and this time she's got the booty (yarrrr)", "timestamp_created": 1452206844, "timestamp_updated": 1452206844, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20315877": {"recommendationid": "20315877", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971883897", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451976845}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing metroidvania with yet another great OST.", "timestamp_created": 1451977481, "timestamp_updated": 1451977481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20307409": {"recommendationid": "20307409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060143410", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451696361}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is an incredibly fun 2D metroidvania game.

This installment in the main Shantae series from Way Forward Technology, just like the previous installments, offers much more than whipping your hair back and forth, Willow Smith style. A 2D platformer with a stunning soundtrack, Shantae and the pirate's curse is truly a blast to play and is arguably the best entry in the series.\n\n[b]An uneasy alliance[/b]:\n\nShantae is a half genie girl, belly dancer, and the guardian of Scuttle Town. Following the events of Shantae: Riskys Revenge, Shantae has now lost her Genie powers, but instead gets to borrow some of her former nemesis Risky Boots weapons to get by. When the mayor of Scuttle town sells the town for some chocolate to the military madman Ammo Baron, Shantae is forced to spring into action. Bigger problems lies at hand though, as Risky Boots confronts Shantae about the impending return of the Pirate Master, an evil tyrant who was sealed away by the genies of Sequin Land long ago. They reluctantly choose to work together and weaken the dark powers across the land by visiting many different islands and defeating evil creatures to prevent the Pirate Masters return.\n\n[b]Hair whipping & dungeon exploration[/b]:\n\nShantae's pony tail is something to be respected and it will be your main way of taking on the great variety of enemies that you will encounter. Whipping enemies as well as breakable pots makes gems drop which you can then use to upgrade your various items and said hair. Scuttle town acts as the hub town and you return there many times to buy shampoo for her hair, making your attack power go up and a silky cream which allows for faster whipping. A few damage upgrades are also available for new items that you will acquire as you progress through the story.\n\nA 2D platformer with Metroidvania and The Legend of Zelda (Get item in dungeon, use said item on dungeon boss) style gameplay, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is certainly the best game yet in the Shantae series. Now that Shantae doesnt have to perform a dance (Although she is a very talented one) to transform herself into different animals but instead uses Risky Boots weapons and gear to get around, the pacing is a clear step up from previous titles. The dungeons are fun to explore and the platforming, while not being all that difficult, is still one of the best things about Shantae, mostly because of how perfectly precise the controls are. The dungeons also feature some thrilling boss fights at the end of each one, but I was a bit disappointed in the lack of difficulty and challenge most of them provided.\n\nThere are also Risky Boots army of small dark creatures called Tinkerbats that have been possessed by the Pirate Master's dark magic that Shantae can find in various locations. You can also find heart squids throughout the game that will increase your overall health. Just like in any Zelda game, trying to find all of these isn't all that compelling, with the somewhat lack of challenge that the game overall provides, but a few tricky platform sections and the latter part of the game will surely cause some unexpected deaths. The game lasted me about 10 hours the first time around and it also features a new game + mode, where you get to keep all your acquired items, but not upgrades and heart containers, and enemies do double damage.\n\n\n[b]Presentation & Soundtrack[/b]:\n\nThe game looks gorgeous in all of its retro glory and is populated with many lovable side characters, witty dialogue and some great 4th wall breaking moments (many of them courtesy of the reoccurring character, the self-proclaimed filler boss Squid Baron), amazing 16 -bit animations and it's the small details that really made me take notice. Shantae, as mentioned previously, is a seductive belly dancer, and sometimes she might start to sway her hips side to side to Jake Kaufman's expertly produced soundtrack. Even when you are crawling on the ground or carrying Rottytops, Shantae's green zombie friend, who just so happens to have a thing for genie brains, Shantae is shaking her behind or stepping to the beat.\n\nThe music is upbeat and absolutely brilliant and accompanies each stage perfectly. Jake Kaufman further enforces my strong need for great musical scores in video games because they can really make or break your gaming experience. With Shantae and The Pirates Curse, its top notch and I certainly don't blame her for dancing. \n\n[b]Verdict[/b]:\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse offers superb animation quality, a downright awesome soundtrack and addicting gameplay that will certainly make you want to come back for more. It might not the best Metroidvania style game out there, but it is one of the most memorable and fun retro style games that i've ever experienced. Her hips don't lie and neither do I, so get this game, you will not regret it.\n\n[b]9/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1451677600, "timestamp_updated": 1483632491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20172693": {"recommendationid": "20172693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261815856", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1438, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472246954}, "language": "spanish", "review": "jugabilidad muy buena pero algunas tecnicas necesitas ser un poco experto 7 pero bien, la musica de lo mejorcito un 10,\ngraicos pues para lo que es bien un juego de plataformas en 2d un  8, lo malo que habeces te tienes que calentar la cabeza, , lo bueno que esta en espa\u00f1ol\n", "timestamp_created": 1451636621, "timestamp_updated": 1451636621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20166535": {"recommendationid": "20166535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219251613", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453041267}, "language": "english", "review": "I truly believe that this game is one of the greatest if not THE greatest game of all time.

For a game made in 2014, it does an excellent job of capturing that classic old platformer feel and gameplay. But the appeal of this game doesn't end with the nostalgia factor. There's some really good humor in this game which makes for a really enjoyable play experience and the puzzles can get a bit tricky; not so much that they become a nuisance, but just enough to make you clever when you figure them out.\n\nThe characters were great and had a surprising amount of depth for a game that shows so much cleavage (pun not intended). There's a lot of character development in this game and, especially by the end, I found myself caring more then I would have expected about what happened to them and their relationships with one another. For me, this was one of the game's most endearing qualities.\n\nOn the negative side, this game does have it's imperfections, too. I mentioned earlier how this was a very loyal SNES-era style platformer and it is, in both the good ways and the bad. Playing Shantae and the Pirate's Curse reminded me why I would sometimes get so frustrated as a kid that I'd throw my controller at the wall. Things like timed jumps and frustratingly narrow gaps between spike filled walls, when not used properly, can easily become a nuisance which detracts from the enjoyability of a game. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse unfortunately succumbs to this pitfall. Long sequences that relied upon me timing numerous jumps perfectly - under threat of being sent back to the beginning over and over and over until I got it right- were aggrivating and the game would've been much better if they had been made so that you only took damage when you made a mistake, instead of being sent back to the beginning. The final journey to the big-boss was the most notorious culprit here, but there were other areas that suffered from the same problem. Forcing a player to replay long sequences over and over and over is annoyingly repetative and makes for a poor impression of the game as a whole.\n\nAlso, while I was able to get my Logitech Precision gamepad to work with this game, it required me to do some serious tweaking with some 3rd party software to get it to work and I was a little disappointed that Shantae and the Pirates Curse didn't include native support for it. \"Shantae and the Pirate's Curse\" is the kind of game that is really meant to be played with a controller (I briefly tried to play it via keyboard and I found it really awkward and hard on the fingers), so it's a shame there wasn't more effort put in to insuring that the game was more compatible with controllers.\n\nBut I won't let these minor frustrations ruin what was overall a really fun game!

You get Shantae and the Pirate's Curse.\n\nHOLY COW!!! This game is incredible! It somehow managed to take everything the previous games did right and perfect it. The game mechanics, from hair whipping to hat parachuting to simple running and walking animations, are very fluid and wildly entertaining to witness. The pace of the game is never too slow because you're always getting new items, which each give the game a new level of depth. The various levels you explore are vibrant and colorful, or dark and forboding if it's a dangerous level, but the tone matches each stage perfectly and helps to draw you into the world. All the characters are incredibly loveable and fun, and the character models themselves are stunningly beautiful from an artistic perspective! The music is also ridiculously catchy!\n\nI have tried, but I honestly CANNOT find a single problem with this game. The developers at WayForward have poured their hearts and souls into this game...and it really shows! As I have said previously on my review of Shantae: Risky's Revenge, this is a series that should absolutely be played. I can personally guarentee that you will not be disappointed if you buy this game, even at full price!

If you're into those things.\n\nThe only flaws I'd list are that you're given so many healing and buff items that you should never ever die unless you're intentionally stingy, there's a good chunk of backtracking required for just the main plot, and the final boss without tracking down all 20 Dark Magic items is pretty anticlimactic.", "timestamp_created": 1449964892, "timestamp_updated": 1449964892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19560273": {"recommendationid": "19560273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148565240", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451179605}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I want to poop on Shantae's chest\"\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1449552469, "timestamp_updated": 1449552469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.450921", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19557244": {"recommendationid": "19557244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055630763", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 842, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459398629}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 I love this game", "timestamp_created": 1449535684, "timestamp_updated": 1449535684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19537530": {"recommendationid": "19537530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049402635", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 1805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479410444}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Oh boy, this sure was a lot of fun.[/h1]\n100% collectibles in 7 1/2 hours. 7 1/2 hours [strike]i'd replay for the extra achievements[/strike] GOT THE ACHIEVEMENTS BOISS\n\nFirst of all, this game is a metroidvania. If you don't know what that means, google.\nAt this point by seeing the review is extensive, you'd want me to tell you how good it is.\nIt's fantastic 9.5/10 i'd order more but games take time. Will buy 1/2 Genie Hero @ release if sale. And since they're growing thanks to steam i do expect sales from them. That's something really good btw. Great job guys, can't wait to see what's next.\n\n[b]What's this game got of special?[/b]\n*Comedy & Unexpected shit\n*Great improvement in an amazing saga.\n*Well built personalities, lore connection and storyline.\n*Collectibles! Noice.\n*Replayability\n*Jake Kaufman made the music => It's more like the best OST ever (Once again, thank you for Mighty Switch Force OST, keep making more i'll be sure to pay for the games.)\n*Puzzles and stuff like that, backtracking for collectibles, and other tricky things.\n*TONS OF FANSERVICE EVEN IF IT'S NOT CONSIDERED FANSERVICE. FOR REALS, WHY DO THEY KEEP MAKING THAT KIND OF JOKES AND PUTTING ULTRA HD DIALOG PICS THAT SHOW LOTS OF SKIN? NOT LIKE IM COMPLAINING THO ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n*Cheaper than your classic triple A garbage\n-Not enough thighs (Shoutouts @ Mighty Switch Force) \n\nsomething like 1million/1 on pros/cons isn't something you pass up.\n\nGet this game IF:\n*You have money obviously\n*You are more than 15 years old and know what retro style has to offer.\n*Like difficulty scaling but also like to say \"FUCK IT ILL JUST DRINK INSTANT MAX HP POTION\" (yeh, there's that. Difficulty isn't hindered much tho)\n*Get this game altogether, you just should. It really is a fun metroidvania\n\nSo far, the newest game in the series is [u]a bit[/u] botched and not 100% finished so if you really are looking for the best one at the moment, get this one.",

I wish we'd seen the return of the belly-dancing transformations, but given this is a direct sequel to Risky's Revenge, I can see why they opted to leave the half-genie stuff out, seeing as she lost all her powers in Risky's Revenge.\n\nGraphics: 4.5 - The colors are vibrant and the backgrounds vary from island to island.  Still, it's a bit dated, but for this type of game, it's not a bad thing at all.  This game is set to stand the test of time as it just looks good and easy on the eyes.  Be prepared for MORE BUTT WIGGLES!\n\nSound: 4.5 - the voice-over work was interesting, but I wish they'd run with it a bit more.  It would have been a bit more engrossing having at least the dialogs between main characters/villains with voice-overs.  Still, Shantae's voice is cute and lovable.  The music does the job well setting up the scenarios and scenes everywhere.  \n\nControls: 5 - I'm using a 360 controller that's working flawlessly while I play.  The occasional ducking is a problem, but that's the CONTROLLER, not the game itself.  I fault Microsoft for that one because the d-pad, while great, is sometimes too sensitive and I find myself ducking and crawling when I meant to run forward.\n\nReplay: 4.5 - Even if this game is short, I still find myself always going back to platformers and playing them again.  This is why Super Mario Bros. series has always stood the test of time.  I always find myself going back and playing those games and I'm sure to find myself coming back to Shantae and playing it over again.  Still, I wish there were a few extra things to do during a 2nd playthrough.  Even Risky's Revenge: Director's Cut had the alternate costume playthrough, but still, I will most likely find myself coming back to play this again even after I've completed it 100%.\n\nFor followers of Shantae, definitely worth it.  Those new to the series may find it a little lacking, but the gameplay is solid and flawless in controls.  Anyone looking for a quick platforming fix will find plenty to like in this and the earlier entries of the series.  Steam and the world needs more platformers as solid as Shantae is and hope that there's future entries in this series.", "timestamp_created": 1448993517, "timestamp_updated": 1480409793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19406865": {"recommendationid": "19406865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045970843", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1452115090}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel compelled to leave a review because WOW, I'm blown away by how much fun I'm having.

But as you go further, the story and characters really unfurl their wings as the gameplay gets more difficult, challenging, and it starts to show just how much love and care was put into this game. The lo-fi graphics look amazing and are smooth as butter. The characters are all easily identifiable and rememberable. They're also all usually adorable and likeable, too, Shantae especially. She's always bouncing around with a big smile on her face, but she lets out a believable warcry that makes me love whipping dudes with her hair, when I first thought I'd hate it because it'd get repetitive. Nope, love doing it, all the time. Love jumping too... Because she's just so... Bouncy... Sorry, lost my train of thought there... Yeah, she's hot, sue me.

Matt Bozon & co. simply know what they're doing and that's that.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]:\n- Quality action/adventure in the vein of Metroid (in a cartoonish 1001 Nights-inspired setting);\n- Tight controls;\n- Nice difficulty curve (difficulty is only average, but the ramping up difficulty felt properly satisfying to me);\n- Great art and character animations, as is always the case with WayForward;\n- [url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4LrEWXuZRI]Great soundtrack[/url] by Jake Kaufman (other Shantae games, Mighty Switch Force, Shovel Knight);\n- Lots of variety in every aspect, from enemies to levels to music to gameplay mechanics.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]:\n- Initially feels a bit limited, takes a bit of time to [i]really[/i] get going (although never to the point of boredom for me personally);\n- Some people might not like old-school backtracking (e.g. you get an item--now you must find which previously met NPC to show it to);\n- Wacky writing occasionally feels a bit dumb rather than silly, but that's rare and mostly in the beginning;\n- High-res character portraits and fonts clash awfully and quite inexcusably with pixel-painted graphics;\n- Post-game / good ending stuff can get a tad tiresome, although the true final boss is satisfying enough.\n\n[b]All in all[/b]: despite the stuff listed as flaws, it's one of the best games in the action/adventure (\"metroidvania\") genre. Get this game and play it, you people. WayForward is a great studio. God bless WayForward.

favoring faster progression.  Gameplay-wise, it's what teh previous game SHOULD have been.  The game-pad controls make it so much easier to get into than Risky's Revenge, which I played with Keyboard (So that might be why), and the story is light-hearted and comical but knows just when to get serious.  The tone is always changing and always perfect for every moment in the game, and the Metroidvania aspect isn't as frustrating, except for a few specific instances, as previous titles in the series.  All in all, if you are trying to get the real ending (Multiple endings depending on if you got all the dark-magic or not) than you'll probably end up with a game lasting a few hours, mine was eight but I overpreppared for the final boss (I was worried that I sucked at the game more than I did) and missed a single dark magic so I had to fight him twice to get the right ending.  So a few hours, not that long, maybe not worth the full price, but ONLY if you want your money to exclusively buy very long games.  It's short, despite being hte longest game in teh series thus far, but you have to ask yourself, \"A long but mediocre game, or a short but awesome one?\"  Extra Credits on Youtube said it perfectly, \"Awesome Per Second.\"", "timestamp_created": 1447425715, "timestamp_updated": 1447425715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19046511": {"recommendationid": "19046511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004421830", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482373689}, "language": "english", "review": "I own this game like three times now and replayed the hell out of it on each system. \nI'm sure if you get this game you will not be dissapointed.", "timestamp_created": 1447396498, "timestamp_updated": 1447396498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19022014": {"recommendationid": "19022014", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970739339", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 355, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447295379}, "language": "english", "review": "Shantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse is the third and most refined entry of the series thus far, forming what is now called the \u201csprite trilogy\u201d. In this installment, Shantae teams up with longtime series antagonist Risky Boots on a quest to tame an ancient curse that threatens all of Sequin Land. Bereft of her genie magic, Shantae must instead make use of powerful pirate items: Risky\u2019s pistol, hat, boots, scimitar and cannon, to traverse the world. The overworld and warp points of the earlier games are replaced with a free-roaming stage select, where Risky\u2019s ship takes you to each of the levels, and she can be talked to at almost any time to leave your current island and travel elsewhere, up to the very end of the game. Easily twice the length of Risky\u2019s Revenge, Pirate\u2019s Curse retains most of the advances made in that game and also brings back a number of elements not seen since the original GBC game, most notably, the bathhouse in Scuttle Town that lets your recover health for free. Also, reloading a save will refill Shantae\u2019s health. Pike balls are once again consumables as in the original, and the storm puffs and fireballs are gone, but Risky\u2019s Pistol provides unlimited ranged attacks and can be upgraded, like Shantae\u2019s hair, for more damage. Shantae can use the hat to glide, the scimitar to pogo-jump enemies a la Shovel Knight, the boots to do a Super Metroid-style boost run, and the cannon to do up to three additional jumps, altogether making Shantae her most maneuverable self yet. The same great sprites seen in Risky\u2019s Revenge are augmented with new character art, new music, and a variety of new environments and enemies that revisit those seen in Shantae 1. Other new editions include consumable items that boost Shantae\u2019s attack damage, food items that drop off enemies and restore various amounts of health, and \u201cpirate flares\u201d that allow you to return to Risky at any time, so long as you are outdoors. Overall, Pirate\u2019s Curse is considerably more challenging then Risky\u2019s Revenge but not to the point of frustration- falling into a death pit or touching the spikes merely removes a single hit point and returns you to the entrance of the current room, and you can have a total of forty, and carry enough health items to render an actual game over a near-impossibility- thanks to the addition of auto-potions that trigger automatically upon losing all your health. It is not however, anywhere near as cheap as the first game, and for that I am thankful. If you liked the previous Shantae titles, Metrodivanias or platformers of any kind, Shantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse is a treat for your eyes, ears and fingers that should not be missed.", "timestamp_created": 1447280558, "timestamp_updated": 1447280884, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18977564": {"recommendationid": "18977564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043173847", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498502733}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Sequ\u00eancia sensacional de Shantae: Risky's Revenge.\nT\u00e3o bom ou talvez at\u00e9 melhor que seu antecessor.\nSimplesmente demais...", "timestamp_created": 1447106348, "timestamp_updated": 1447106348, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18966768": {"recommendationid": "18966768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062691458", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497240244}, "language": "english", "review": "satysfying metroidvania gameplay at its best", "timestamp_created": 1447049860, "timestamp_updated": 1447049860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18942866": {"recommendationid": "18942866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113586457", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 595, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441553395}, "language": "french", "review": "PIRATES, BOOBS AND FAN SERVICE.\n\n10/10 would play again", "timestamp_created": 1446944846, "timestamp_updated": 1446944846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540613", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18937848": {"recommendationid": "18937848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121851361", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 746, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450103911}, "language": "french", "review": "Masterpiece, absolutely amazing, artworks are the best ;3 but the emotions of a plateforming game and the retro quality are so so so so so so so GREAT :D humor, action and diversity.

Well, you've already encountered one of them -- I'm reviewing it right now and you're reading it. Again, I don't think words can possibly describe WHY this game is amazing, so I'll just write a few of the little things I love about this game in no particular order.\n\n1. Charging through every area in Risky's boots (this also functions as an anti-frustration feature if you want to buy something but you haven't a single gem to your name, as it's a very quick and easy way to get money and items)\n\n2. RISKY REDEMPTION ARC. I repeat, RISKY. REDEMPTION. ARC!\n\n3. The art (I especially love the new Rottytops)\n\n4. Rottytops in general (and all the other characters -- everyone is more likeable in this game)\n\n5. Pretty much all of Shantae's interactions with Risky from Saliva Island onwards are ADORABLE (especially arriving at each island, where there's always that moment Shantae forgets Risky used to be her nemesis)\n\n6. If you don't get all the cacklebats before the final boss, you'll feel more horrible for it than when you unlocked the \"heart of stone\" and \"play dead\" achievements in Risky's Revenge. That's right, it has two endings. I can't imagine a better ending than the \"true ending,\" though. Never in my life have I wanted to hug a pirate so much in either ending.\n\n7. MELT! THEM!! DOWN!!!\n\n8. \"Men are idiots. At least I still have Wrench.\" -- Sky (this is also her card quote, by the way)\n\n9.

S\u00faper divertido de principio a fin.\n\nBastante mejor que el anterior, no solo por la variedad de los escenarios, o m\u00e1s bien las mazmorras, que en el anterior todas se parec\u00edan, sino por los objetos que vas recogiendo a medida que avanzas en la historia. Como unas botas para hacer un ataque de carga y as\u00ed superar ciertas zonas inestables o una pistola que te permite accionar dispositivos desde lejos.\n\nNo hay transformaciones como en su predecesor, ya que en esta parte Shantae no posee magia. Sin embargo, en mi opini\u00f3n, no es algo que importe, pues los objetos que te van dando son muy divertidos y c\u00f3modos de usar.\n\nEl control es una delicia, responde perfectamente y eso se agradece much\u00edsimo, la sensaci\u00f3n que tienes al mover a Shantae es brutal, y aunque parezca una tonter\u00eda, no lo es.\n\nLa banda sonora tambi\u00e9n es muy buena, acompa\u00f1a perfectamente al ambiente y no cansa, y hay algunos temas que telita.\n\nLa \u00fanica pega que le veo es que es muy corto, unas 6 horas me ha llevado completarlo al 100%, aunque a\u00fan me quedan 2 logros, pero son de speedruns, y odio los speedruns xD.

Eventually I decided on a positive rating since I am glad I played it.  Besides, I know how this works.  If you disagree with the majority, your review will be downvoted into oblivion and never be seen, even if you have good reasons for your negative rating.\n\nWhile I have nothing but praise for [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/277890/]Shantae: Risky's Revenge[/url], Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is a mostly good game, marred by occasional bad level design and severe balance problems.\n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse has fun abilities, great artwork and music, good humor, and sex appeal, just like the previous games in the series.  It is longer than Shantae: Risky's Revenge.\n\nThe only technical complaint I have is that it would have been nice to have the window scalable in windowed mode.  The developers have my thanks for adding key remapping.\n\nAs for general complaints about the level design and difficulty, there are many cheap hits.  Zombies often spring from the earth directly under you.  Ghosts often materialize on top of you.  These are an almost constant problem on Spiderweb Island.  The problem with Ghosts also happens on various other levels that include them.  When Scuttle Town becomes corrupted by dark magic, the Pumpkin Fields becomes black, except for the sky, making it almost impossible to see enemies or their projectiles, since they blend in perfectly with background elements like foliage.\n\nThere are several unique, and bad (uniquely bad), level designs.\n\nOn Spiderweb Island there is an area where you have to carry another character.  This prevents you from attacking or ducking, and causes you to die in one hit.  Some timing in this area is unreasonably tight.  The worst offender is the room where you are in tunnels with too little headroom to jump until you reach an area near the end with a platform overhead, and a kissing robot at the other end that is running toward you.  There is only a few pixels of space between you and the robot when you successfully make the jump, which will likely take many, many attempts.  This area is agonizingly long, like most of the problem levels.  When I play a Shantae game, I want to play a Metroidvania, [i]not a racing game[/i].\n\nOn Tan Line Island there is an area where you have to stealthily escape a palace.  This prevents you from attacking or using any special abilities, and causes you to restart the entire area if you are spotted once.  You are expected to make use of new mechanics, like blending into the shadows, without any explanation, and given the severity of the punishment for any mistake, experimentation is extremely unpleasant.  This area is agonizingly long, again, like most of the problem levels.  While I [i]like[/i] stealth games (a lot, I am very fond of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/211600/]Thief[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/205100/]Dishonored[/url], and [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/214560/]Mark of the Ninja[/url]), this is like playing a [i]bad[/i] stealth game.  The player has almost no means avoiding enemies other than moving out of their sight.  No distractions, no clever movement options, no disguises\u2026  Making a mistake sets you back far too much.  When I play a Shantae game, I want to play a Metroidvania, [i]not a stealth game[/i].\n\nBy far the worst area in the game is the Pirate Master's Palace.  The area is lifeless except for a few Bats and Save Guy.  It is mostly full of instant-kill spikes.  Like the other bad areas, it looks like it was lifted from other games.  In this case, [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/70300/]VVVVVV[/url] and [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird]Flappy Bird[/url].  Like other bad areas, it is agonizingly long.  I died around 30 times in the first room before finding a way to bypass the first 3 rooms on Youtube.  After that, I was able to complete this area, but the process left me so infuriated and exhausted that I am unlikely to ever play through the game again.  This area officially \u201cruined the game for me\u201d.  When I play a Shantae game, I want to play a Metroidvania, [i]not Super Meat Boy or Flappy Bird[/i].\n\nThe final boss is almost as badly balanced as the level he lives in.  Until I encountered him, I had avoided sacrificing any Heart Squid children to make Heart Holders.  I wanted to finish the game that way.  Unfortunately, each hit he lands is enough to instantly kill Shantae without any Heart Holder upgrades, and attacks like his bouncing cannon balls and flying pistols seem to be impossible to avoid even with a Bubble Shield.  9 Auto-Potions was not enough to see me through the battle.  Despite being squeamish about it, and it costing me the achievement, I melted all the Heart Squid children I found into Heart Holders so I could finish the game and write this review.\n\nWayForward, if you are reading this, and I hope you are, please keep releasing more of this series, but make future releases fun, not frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1441802484, "timestamp_updated": 1441848439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505497", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17899325": {"recommendationid": "17899325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021263392", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468898056}, "language": "english", "review": "Extremely fun game if you enjoy a well-done Metroidvania game.

Light Genie Magic became Dark Magic, and the Tinkerbats became Cacklebats. On a side story, Ammo Baron has bought Scuttle Town from the Mayor, who bought chocolate... Again. Now, Shantae has to team up with Risky Boots to defeat the Pirate Master, collect the Dark Magic from the Cacklebats and rescue Scuttle Town from Ammo Baron.\n\nPros:\n- Shantae's adventure is now bigger, better and harder\n- Awesome OST\n- The characters are well developed\n- Lots of collectibles\n- Two different endings: The Good One, and the Bad One. I prefer to call them as Best Ending and Worst Ending respectively as there is almost nothing bad in the 2nd ending\n- There's one Nostalgia stage with music from Shantae from the Game Boy Color\n- Each boss has a different subtitle\n- 4 different In-Game Wallpapers\n\nCons:\n- That Last Dungeon is harder than anything else\n- Dagron is harder than the Last Boss\n\n[h1] FINAL SCORE: 10/10 [/h1]\nLong Story Short:\nShantae's adventure is bigger, better and much more interesting but you still need to play the other games to understand most of it.

Great gameplay, consisting of platforming, combat, and speedrunning, all coming together to create an incredibly fun experience. The story is compelling, being not too heavy, nor too light, while throwing in comedic moments and themes along with the more serious aspects.

Sound quality itself is top-notch, and nothing more needs to be said about the soundtrack than to go download it on Bandcamp right now (it's free!).

choice i ever made. Long story short with the history of me and\nShantae, the gameboy game was a great part of my childhood, and i wouldnt be here reviewing the games\nwithout it.\n\nIn anycase, seeing both the new games on steam, i bought them on an instant,\nas i knew that the games where made by the same guys, so i knew it be a\ngreat experience, just like with the gameboy color game.\n\nI will seperate each review for both pages, so beyond this sentance, the review will be different.\n\nHere is my review of Pirate's Curse. Similar to Risky's Revenge, it has the same sprites and graphical style,\nbut the view is zoomed out, giving you a wider range of the area you play in.\nThe is seperated into islands, and each offers a unique feel, music and challanges, thus giving a more\nvariation.\n\nUnlike the previous 2 games, Risky's Revenge and the Shantae on the Gameboy Color, this game doesnt offer\nany transformations, but isntead, gives you artifacts that gives you new abilities, while the belly dance was\nreplaced with an oil lamp that allows you to absorb dark magic or other gas like materials, wich will come\nessential.\n\nThe musics are amazing, and some of the songs are pretty darn cute, and it certainly requires alot for a music\ntrack to sound cute.\n\nThe sound effects are more 16-bit like, giving a more retro feel.\n\nThe game itself is somewhat more cryptic at times for first time players, so for those that does not like exploring\nor problem solving, they will be getting a little lost at times.\n\nThe Expression of the characters are cute, and really shows the\npersonality of each character during dialogs, and Shantae is amazingly cute in this version.\n\nAgain, Kodus to the developers of giving my childhood game new life, and a great experience\nthat i will forever remember.\n\n\nSo for my thoughts about recommending the game to people?

You play as Shantae, the half genie guardian of Scuttle Town. Recently you have lost your magical powers, but you don't let that stop you from saving the town once trouble comes through. Most of the trouble is caused by evil magic being sent out by the imprisoned spirit of the Master Pirate. It's your job to team up with your former rival Risky Boots in order to stop his minions, collect the magic, and prevent his spirit's escape. \n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple. You can run around, jump, duck, crawl, and whip your hair to attack. Along the way you will receive new items and upgrades to give yourself more abilities and more power. You use these abilities to access new areas in order to find secrets and progress. There are a few light puzzles and fetch quests sprinkled in, but the main play will consist of traversing overworlds and conquering dungeons. You can also increase your health and carry items to heal you on the go or to give you some other battle assistance. You'll need to skilled in combat, platforming, and adventuring to complete this game.\n\nThe music is overall pretty great, being polished and interesting to listen to. The art is a mixture of two styles. The playable game consists of colorful pixel art that is well animates, while the dialogue bits have hand drawn cartoonish representations of the characters. The sound effects are also an interesting mix of higher quality voice and sound sample along with retro style video gamey effects. The controls are tight and understandable. Plus, the dialogue is cute and can actually be funny at time. It's an interesting mixture.\n\nFor those who played Shantae: Risky's Revenge before this as I did, you'll be glad to know that nearly everything has been improved upon in this game. You get lots of new abilities rather than just recollecting the same ones from the previous game. The story is even more interesting with the same quality of dialogue. The hand drawn art is different, but it seems to have a bit more detail. This game has more length, with more places to explore, things to do, things to find, people to talk to, and just generally more everything, which means even more quality playtime. The difficulty is also higher for those looking for a greater challenge, which is welcome since this is a sequel, but not too hard for newcomers that would like to try it as well. The map system has been improved to read more like a standard metroidvania style map and show you where you have and have not been. If you liked exploring, platforming challenges, puzzle challenges, combat challenges, and just the overall gameplay of the previous game, you'll love this one even more.\n\nThere are a few issues with the game though. One that may have just been for me was that sometimes there was a flickering glitchy effect on some backgrounds. This usually only happened in the company logo right away and on the world selection screen, but it also did happen consistently in one temple where I kind of needed to know where the walls and floors were. It was only for that one room in the one temple, but it kept happening after a few reloads so it may be a real problem for others as well. Also, I didn't think the cartoonish characters hand drawn in dialogue scenes meshed well with the pixel style of the game. Mayb it's just me, but I would rather just keeping it all one way. That's minor. The difficulty could be a problem. It's harder than the previous game, which is good for people who played that first and it's not TOO hard for those who want to jump right in, but to some casual gamers it could be a bit too tough to get through. While I like that the map system has been reworked and the sailing aspect works will with giving Risky more purpose, it's a shame that instead of one big interconnected world it's now multiple smaller worlds you have to select separately.\n\nOverall, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is awesome. If you like metroidvania games, it's a great one. If you played the previous game (which I also reviewed on here) and liked it, this is definitely worth looking into. It's a fun, metroidvania adventure platformer with a pretty style. I like how fun, challenging, and yet forgiving the game is to make it a lot of fun to keep playing. Another one of the best games I've played on Steam. Is it worth the 20 dollar asking price? Well, personally I would say that, if you're really interested and liked the other Shantae games, then of course. Otherwise maybe wait for a sale. I got it for 15 and it was worth not being able to wait anymore. If nothing else, getting it at 10 bucks or less at some point is going to be a real steal, especially for all the content here. Shantae and the Pirate's Curse gets a 9 out of 10 for being a great blend of genres, gameplay, personality, and style. Also... I know I'm a pervert but...

Pirate's Curse is, in turn, a vast improvement.\n\nThough it retains the same sprites that were used on the DSi, the resolution is much sharper, with crisp, attractive backgrounds and new animations thrown in. This also makes the HD graphics used for conversations and menus a lot less jarring, but they still look a bit odd at first. Though enemy sprites are reused from Risky's Revenge, it also adds a lot more of theIt also has a lot more enemies, and new huge, screen-filling bosses help make hitting the end of a level a lot more exciting than before.\n\nShantae feels faster, jumps farther, giving a better feel to the controls, and her speed and leaping ability grow dramatically as you go through the game. Unlike the \"lock and key\" transformations of Risky's Revenge, which often don't see much use outside of opening up a new zone, you'll find yourself using most of the equipment which replaces the transformations in regular gameplay. The extra movement options also make traversing zones a lot easier. This time, the zones are connected through a central hub, and you readily can get items that return you to the hub. The exploration is much improved, though it still struggles a bit (being able to warp directly to dungeons, for example, would have saved a lot of tiresome trekking). The levels are now quite varied, often with different gimmicks other than just graphical stylings.\n\nIt's also a [i]lot[/i] funnier, and... might I say fairly fetishy by comparison, expecially during the early parts of the game. If that kind of thing bugs you, it will bug you. While it's not [i]quite[/i] Totally Spies, some pretty odd fetishes feel like they're checked. I just find it amusing, but others might find the humiliating nature of some of the situations more problematic. Still, the dialogue is far more clever than earlier iterations, and generally got me to at least crack a smile at some of the back-and-forths.\n\nEven those \"stop 'n go\" enemies I hated from the previous game are improved. For example, Riskys' Revenge had mermaid enemies that would try to bore you to death through periods of invulnerability, but now their windows of invulnerability are now far briefer. In addition, often Shantae can dispatch enemies much faster... or, later in the game, just heedlessly charge through them or float over them. Magic has been replaced with limited-use items, though in some areas they drop often enough you may as well use them all the time. Overall, it's a clunky system compared to refreshing magic, but it's not a real black mark.\n\nUltimately, Pirate's Curse is a lot of fun. Where Risky's Revenge relied mostly on charm and nostalgia for appeal, Pirate's Curse has a lot more substance. It often has different sequences where it offers variations on the core gameplay to keep things from being too monotonous, and the new equipment keeps shifting how you play the game. Thumbs down on a final level that suddenly kicks up the difficulty drastically and frustratingly, but at least is capped by a very satisfying end boss.  Though it's not a breakthrough or a massive innovation in the genre, it's a very solid platformer that feels and plays great, and gives me a lot of hope for the upcoming HD sequel.", "timestamp_created": 1436088288, "timestamp_updated": 1436088288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778340", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16889196": {"recommendationid": "16889196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042996095", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498021588}, "language": "english", "review": "This is honestly one of my favorite games.

While it was lacking in some aspects it was cool enough that after the convincing gameplays I decided to jump back to the series. This is definitely more fun and polished game and I can easily say it is worth your interest with only few hiccups along the way. If the game is solid, then I'm more than happy to nitpick some issues for further ironing out for the next Wayfoward's game. Criticism makes excellence!\n\nGame is notably faster than the Risky's Revenge. The previous game was pretty sluggish at times, but the improved controls, Shantae's speed and jumps in pair with good level design, help dictate a reasonable pace that makes you flow through the game with no noticeable frustrating moments. Graphics are in my favorite 16/32-bit Mega Man X4-rish style, that didn't really change after Revenge (with recycled sprites), but it still looks pretty nice, especially with the new locations. Bosses are definite plus. While not very challenging, they provide fun encounters. There are a lot of new faces as regular enemies which are good to see. Platforming? No complains there.\n\nMusic deserves an separate paragraph. Jake Kaufman did probably his best score yet. In my opinion it's far better than Shovel Knight's and provides tons of catchy memorable tunes that really \"sells\" the game. I would say that without this soundtrack, many locations wouldn't be as fun and atmospheric as they are now, since many of them are pretty generic. Mud Bog Island with Village of Lost Souls hidden within it is an great example of climatic location boosted by an amazing music. This stuff rocks.\n\nThe story. Characters are likeable and unique, scenes are full of humor and plot overall isn't particularly offensive, but...\n\nLogic? Out of commission. Setups? Wasted potential. Lore? Barely touched.\n\nIt looks like the devs had a plenty ideas for funny situations and hijinks between characters. There are lots of mini character arcs that bring this thing together, but logic behind why scene A resulted in events in scene B is completely bizarre. It fits the convention and style, but for me it is something of a missed opportunity. Keep in mind that this is a nitpick and Shantae doesn't need a great story to be an awesome game, but I would say that this is an aspect for further improvement.\n\nUpgrades. They are all powerful and really fun to use... unless we are talking about the Sword upgrade that is only useful for unlocking vertical shafts and nothing more. It gives no advanced mobility and is pretty weak against enemies. No sense in using instead of standard hair whip. Pistol and additional melee attacks also become obsolete really fast, but other upgrades are extremely fun to use and tinker with.\n\nAs for a completely minor sidenote, which doesn't hurt the game that much, but I would like to point it out... There is also a strange dissonance in level progression vs. classic Metroidvania mechanics. Shantae controls would really shine in level-to-level progression system (intro level shows this), but this series was very exploration heavy from the start. Game tries to bring the best of both worlds, but levels are not-seamlessly connected and they are overall pretty small, so there isn't as much exploration as in standard Metroidvania and there are not enough set-pieces as for classic platformer. You can really feel it, as the game has less adventurish feel and yet doesn't deliver as much level-specific excitement as Freedom Planet or Shovel Knight. Luckily, this is subjective and not very noticeable. It doesn't affect the enjoyment as much, probably thanks to the overall solid experience crafted by the devs.\n\nThe only proper negative that I can think of is the price. Content-wise, it offers a similar about of fun and features as afromentioned Shovel Knight and Freedom Planet, yet it's price tag is 5 dollars higher. 15 bucks is a perfect price for fun and enjoyment you will get from Pirate's Curse. It's solid platform game that is definitely worth your interest since it holds up a great quality on par with other genre representatives.

For starters, I didn't play any other Shantae games other than this. But judging by the trailers for the other games, I can easily assume this is the best. This game came out last year on 3DS and Wii U, and just a few months ago was ported to the PC. Here's my review.\n\nThe game plays like your average platformer. You control Shantae, who uses her hair to whip enemies, although later she gets upgrades like a gun, etc. The controls feel very smooth and responsive. You travel through six locations where you have to accomplish certain things and then go to the dungeon of the world. This heavily reminds me of Zelda, especially considering there are chests, keys, items, puzzles, etc. There are also a lot of secret items throughout the game. You can get jellies, which you can turn into health, and there are also bats I think that give you dark magic (you'll find out the use as you play). Also, you can use money earned from defeating enemies to buy one-time items (spike balls, shields, potions, etc.) or permanent upgrades (faster whip, more powerful, etc.). One thing I don't like is that some items are hidden in places that you either don't see (so either you have to get to them by complete accident or by trial and error), or that look like you can get them but you really can't. For example, there is a section in the sand that has tiny platforms that break upon touching them. I got very frustrated trying to get it, only to give up and learning that you can get it, but only after getting an upgrade. If it was more obvious that I couldn't get it, then I wouldn't have to be frustrated.\n\nPresentation-wise, this game has great graphics. They are in a 16-bit SNES style, although on top of that, there are full artworks of the characters in-dialogs. For some reason, WayForward decided to use a default font for the dialogs, which looks quite ugly and annoying if you ask me. The soundtrack? Don't even ask. It's f*cking amazing. The composer also made the soundtrack for Shovel Knight, Duck Tales Remastered, Contra 4, etc. There isn't full voice acting, only occasional words by certain characters are pronounced, ususally sound good, but can get annoying at times.\n\nWell, this game isn't super long either. You can beat it in three hours easily. Do I recommend it? Definitely. It is a little expensive compared to other indies (20$), but I still think it's worth it.

The actual gameplay is very Metroidvania too, lots of jumping puzzles, thought based puzzles, enemies, collecting jewels and gems to find and chests with equipment and keys in to find. \n\nThe game uses a 2D graphics engine, which I can imagine looks pretty good on the 3DS, however it does look like a bit of an emulated game on the PC. The dialog scenes look nice, but the actual in game graphics are very pixelated, granted some people enjoy that style so that may right be up your street. \n\nI must warn you, this game is not easy at all. You will die, and die, and die plenty of times. It may even have you rage quitting at points that it is so frustrating, but you can't help but load it up again in order to move on. The difficulty curve is very up and down, sometimes you can be going through one level and think its actually quite easy, then all of a sudden you are failing countless times on a specific area in the zone. Being hard is not a bad thing at all; it's actually something I really look for in a game. I did have to revert to Youtube videos for hints on how to get past some levels though.\n\nA full playthrough of Shantea and the Pirate's Curse took me almost six hours. Sadly I don't think there is much replay-ability to be had here; once you playthrough it the once - there is really no other reason to playthrough it again. \n\nThis is actually a well put together port to the PC. The developers have gone to the effort of adding full controller support along with a graphically helpful control screen to go along with it. I would highly recommend you play this game with a controller aswell; playing on a keyboard would be a disaster. \n\nI would recommend Shantea and the Pirate's Curse; but not at full price. I think the six hours it took me to complete along with the zero amount of replay-ability means you should really be picking this up on sale. However I did enjoy playing it, it is in no way a bad game. I am looking forward to trying out the other games in this series now!\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It has everything what it needs.\n\n+ As far as you go in game, you achieve  more various actions, which are useful in world investigation and also in battle.\n+ Explore the world to find hidden items and enemies. \n+ Talk to NPCs for getting hints, some of are needed to carry on the story. \n+ Story is not so original, but it doesn't disturbs the gameplay at all [spoiler] mostly\t[/spoiler]\n+ Animation is very smooth and well made.\n+ Soundtrack is suitable and is good enough to listen on IPod. [spoiler] Jake Caufman, you are amazing! \t[/spoiler]\n+ Shantae's voice is great and delightful for ears \n\n\"Wait, i supposed to play a game, where everyone is half naked (including the arci-nemesis)? play as a hero, which is a belly dancer (and also a half-genie), who attacks enemies with own hair? play in a friendly shiny world? shoot enemies and dash through whole army with a blade? Eat food to regain health and not even grow fat?\"\n\n[spoiler]+ \"Yes, please\"\t[/spoiler]\n\n? Sometimes you might be confused where you need to go, but... it is Metroidvania game, so you may be smart enough to complete the game without using any guides. Otherwises... well, you know [url=https://www.google.com] what to do[/url]\n? Pixel-art Retro game. I think i said enough.\n? Dropping-Items-System will suprise you. For Example, skeletons drop milk. Shantae drink it. She is angry now... HELLO, METROIDVANIA! \n\n- Usually game is easy, but sometimes (and unexpectedly) it is hard as hell. \n[spoiler] Mud Bog island is trully a nightmare, complete with sad music.

I found during my play through that while I still love this game, There was a noticeable amount of screen tearing going on. Not exactly jarring but definitely noticeable.\n\nHow does it run? Well considering that it pretty much is just a straight port to PC, It runs pretty well. No experiences with crashes or Bugs during my play through. And pretty smooth as well. \n\nA major up vote from me again as usual is the soundtrack.

At a glance, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse may look like a game for kids, but it's actually very deep and expertly designed, appealing on a variety of levels from platforming and exploration, to music and visual style. I love the sense of humor, too \u2013 there are tons of outrageous gags that make both the good guys and the bad guys completely lovable. \n\nMore so than its predecessor, Risky's Revenge, Pirate's Curse feels like a platformer, with more clearly-defined levels (islands that you sail to) and difficult platforming segments that require multiple attempts to complete. There's a general lack of warp points within the levels, which can make for a bit of frustration when you realize that you have to go through an entire area again to pick up something you missed. Also, the whole game feels a bit too small, and I wish there were more support items to use (like the pike balls) to add more depth to the gameplay.\n\nProblems aside, Shantae and the Pirate's Curse is the most fun I've had with this genre since the classic 2D Castlevania games. It's funny, stylish, and all-around an outstanding game that I heartily recommend. \n\n(Rating: 8.5/10 \u201cExcellent\u201d)\n\nNotes: I played Shantae and the Pirate's Curse with an Xbox 360 Controller for Windows.

The big difference between this and Risky's Revenge gameplay-wise is that the various animal forms are exchanged for pieces of pirate equipment that hit all the cues of a metroidvania; you have your triple jump, speed dash, hover ability, et al.\n\nStage layout and dungeon design are simple enough, but the \"overworld\" aspects of each island is a little too similar outside of their general theme.  The game is collectible friendly in that each level keeps a visible tally of how many hidden items are each level and how many you have already tracked down.  There's enough stuff to find to incentivize revisiting areas but not too many that looking for secrets feels like a slog or unrewarding.  \n\nThe soundtrack is as nice and catchy as is most of Jake \u201cvirt\u201d Kaufman's stuff.  The spritework is good and the game controls well.  Using the inventory/map is a little clunky, but not a big negative by any means.  Pirate's Curse is a relatively easy game, though it has a couple of areas that can be kind of a pain, like the stealth section and a final leg that's significantly harder platforming-wsie than the rest of the game, though it's not especially hard.\n\nAll in all, a nice little game that will take most people between 8-12 hours to finish but I can see it having a good bit of replaybility since once you beat the game you can start a new game with all of your pirate skills unlocked from the start, so you can triple jump, speed dash and so on right from the start.  Shit like that rules and means I'll probably play this again some time in the future.\n\nOne last thing, if the idea of cartoon boobs drives you crazy and makes you want to make a forums post about it, pass on this.

And even though I have not played any of its predecessors prior to it, I can positively say that this was a great introduction to a rather underrated franchise.\n\n\nStorywise, it's pretty much like: \"A great evil is attempting to rule over the land and you must stop it.\" I won't spoil what the rest is, but there ARE multiple endings.\n\nPresentation: The menus are a bit simplistic, but they get the job done.\n\nArt & Animation: Holy hell, are they FRIGGIN' AWESOME! just by LOOKING at the game you can see how much effort they put into character animations, especially in characters like Rottytops. The problem is some of the background can be a bit misleading. For example when I reached the part of Saliva Island with the Heart Squid (They increase your max health) behind stone walls, I thought that there was a secret room somewhere, but then I found out that the architecture on the upper-right corner was just background.\n\nPerformance: The game doesn't take much to run. Always a plus in my books.\n\nMusic: It's awesome, too! You got the pumping tracks of Tan Line Island and Scuttle Town, the dark and dreary Mud Bog Island and Village of Lost Souls, the cheery upbeat tracks of Propeller Town, the Tense Build-ups of the Pirate Master's Palace, and more.\n\nGameplay: Control is fairly tight, and thanks to a new update, a negative review has just been made redundant! The currency they use are called \"Gems\", but judging by the image in your HUD, they're Rupees. You can use them to buy Healing Items, Temporary attack buff items, Leaf Shie- I mean, Pike Balls, Pirate Flares which transport you back to the docks of an isand (Can't be used inside buildings/labyrinths), and Ability Upgrades/Advanced Moves (Like Jumping while KO'd in midair to recover.)\n\nThe upgrades are rather basic: Increase Damage and Speed with your hair, And damage for the rest. But the abilities are what sell it for me. ALL of them are used throughout the game: The Scimitar can be used to destroy blocks you can't destroy with your Whip/Pistol, the Pistol can be used to deal with distant enemies and switches, the Hat can be used to cross large gaps, the Boots to just speed through the entire thing while destroying everything in your way, and the Cannon, which gives you a Quadruple Jump (Cannonballs included).\n\nDifficulty: It's a challenging game, but the curve is a little bit off. For the beginning islands, the real challenge lies in knowing what the heck to do, but then you enter Mud Bog Island and the challenge ramps up due to the sheer amount of enemies you have to deal with. Then you reach the final level, which is pretty much an obstacle course set to test how good you are with the abilties. Can you reach great heights with the Cannon? Can you maneuvre around Spikes with the hat? Can you dash to the end with the Boots? If not, you will be using at least 3 potions just for the entire obstacle course.\n\nReplay Value: Unless you're a completionist or if the game is so good that you just want to play it again, there's not much replay value.\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nPresentation | 6.0/10 (Menus and dialogue boxes look simple, but it doesn't count much towards overall score.)\n\nArt & Animation | 9.8/10 (The pixel art animations look amazing, the game is bursting with colour, and the character portraits during conversations are a nice touch. But some of the background can be a little misleading.)\n\nPerformance | 10/10 (Always ran at 60 Fps throughout the entire adventure.)\n\nMusic | 10/10 (The score is just plain awesome, nothing else needs to be said.)\n\nGameplay | 9.0/10 (Control is tight, abilities are useful, but the Hat can be a little clunky sometimes.)\n\nDifficulty | 9.6 (The game is fairly challenging, but the curve is a little off, in my opinion.)\n\nReplay Value | 3.5 (Unless you're a completionist, I can't see a reason to replay the game again.)\n\nOverall | 9.4/10 (Apart from a few minor faults, and the fact that there's not much left to do once you beat the game, it's still a great game that every Metroidvania lover will enjoy.)\n\n\nMisc bits of advice: If you played the original Shantae before this, once you have the Boots, charge into the left corner of the first room of the first labyrinth. You won't be disapointed.\n\nEdit: I raised my review score because a recent update now allows you to change the controls, and gave Music/SFX sliders.", "timestamp_created": 1430335014, "timestamp_updated": 1433946052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15613264": {"recommendationid": "15613264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142788391", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470936359}, "language": "english", "review": "So this is the first Shantae game I've ever bought and I'm really enjoying it so far.  \n\nIt's an action platformer with a cute little story and lots of levels to explore.

Compared to Risky's Revenge, this is like 100x better, so if you liked Risky's Revenge, this one is a must buy.\n\nPRO's: \n\n- Perfect controls - never had a fail jump or miss-shot due to controls\n\n- Fun and addictive game - the characters are fun, as-well as the story and you will hardly get bored while playing\n\n- Graphics - a pixelated masterpiece. The characters and environments are rich in color and animation. Not one zone looks the same as another\n\n- Music - what good is a game without some quality music? Each zone has it's specific tune, some new, some remixed from previous titles and will set the perfect mood for each stage and situation\n\n- Gameplay - this is the major improvement over the last title.  They mixed the diversity and complexity of the 1st game with the quality of Risky's Boots and they managed to obtain a solid and lenghty game. When I completed the intro and saw that this game is composed of multiple islands (stages), I snapped my fingers and said to myself: this is promising. One hour later I was drooling at how awesome this is\n\nCON's:\n- If you want to gather all the hidden items, you will need to write the progress down a paper, because the game informs you of this only on the stage (island) select screen\n\n- The inability to tweak the volume and customize the controls...hopefully these options will be implemented with a future patch\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nDoes it worth the full price? Yes! It's one of the few games that I bought it at a full price and didn't regret it. So, if you want a solid platformer, with awesome gameplay, characters and story...then don't look further.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1430082831, "timestamp_updated": 1430082831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15565311": {"recommendationid": "15565311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106825427", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432272454}, "language": "english", "review": "Well this is a huge step up from the previous title, Shantae: Risky's Revenge. This game take place after the events of Risky's Revenge, so if you haven't played it and don't want to be spoiled stop reading the review and go play it.\n\nShantae is trying to remain guardian of Scuttle Town as a full human with no genie magic. Risky come in and tell her that the Pirate Master is returning and they must band together to stop him. The story is nice and got some good developments/reveals for the side characters. I personally like Rotty Tops backstory in the game. It may not be an award winning story, but it good enough to keep you entertained to the end.\n\nThe gameplay is the same in the previous game. A side scrolling platform where you whip you're enemies into submissions. In place of the animal transformations from the last game, you will now use pirate items to help you progress through stages and defeat enemies. At the shop you can buy additional items and potions to help you along the way and upgrade your attacks and pirate gear for more damage.

This game is long enough to keep you entertained and got some backtracking in it if you want get 100%. \n\nShantae and the Pirate's Curse kept me entertained to the end and left me wanting more.

I'm running on a Intel HD Integrated Graphics card with an Intel Duel Pentium 2.13Ghz and it runs perfectly at 720p.\n\nAnyway, this is the second Shantae game I played (the first being the original on the GBC) and I am really impressed. This game not only has great combat mechanics and metroidvania style exploration, but also brilliant dialogue. The first half of the game just doesn't take itself very seriously, and I love the game for that.\n\nThe art style is top-notch. Pixel-art is used for most of the game, with vectored character portraits being used in dialogue cutscenes.\n\nFan service and references to previous games are everywhere. [spoiler]I loved the hidden Dribble Fountain dungeon from the original game. :) Lol even Squid Baron makes a return as the midway filler boss that he was destined to be.[/spoiler]\n\nThe only problem I had with this game was a technical one. Half way through playing the game the graphics started to glitch out horribly.

It plays exactly like it does there, but there are very minor port issues I have, though it's not enough to hamper my enjoyment of this version.\n\nThe port issues thus far I've noticed is:\n\n1) The keyboard and controller bindings as of this moment cannot be changed or edited. It is a very minor issue, but I do usually like to customize my keybindings to something I find more comfortable, especially on the keyboard. The default bindings are a bit odd for the keyboard; being one of those sets that use the arrow keys for movement & ZXC/ASD for general action input like a game from the 90's would have instead of having WASD for movement & JKL/UIO for action input.\n(Port issue has been fixed!)\n\n2) During the opening level, the screen would continuously shake & quiver. It may have been the explosions of the buildings that shook the screen, but it seems to last longer then in the Wii U version, even after the explosion sounds stop. It does however eventually stop, but I thought it would be something to mention. Nothing that bad, just a bit odd.\n(Port issue has been fixed!)\n\nSo those are my opening thoughts on the Steam port for Pirate's Curse; one of the best games I've ever played on the Wii U, and now, despite than the minor port issues I mentions above, one of my favorite games on Steam; and featuring one of the most charming and adorable videogame characters you will ever go adventuring with.", "timestamp_created": 1429990781, "timestamp_updated": 1460780720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15541821": {"recommendationid": "15541821", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088818955", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456967096}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game fully on Wii U and it is a gem!

Big fan since the first game, and it just gets better and better. Pirate's Curse stays true to the controls and platform gameplay of the first two games, but includes new ways to attack and navigate. Shantae can no longer transform, but the items she finds in her adventure feel just as natural as her transformations.\nThe enemies are a combination of those from part 1 and 2 plus new ones.\nAnd the music, oh god, the music. Jake Kaufman, composer for the previous parts of the series, as well as Shovel Knight and Double Dragon Neon, is again responsible for it, and it is awesome. Fans of the earlier Shantae adventures will even get some familiar tunes.\n\nIf you still need convincing, listen to my annoying voice while playing the game:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFTpKTC_uE8\n\nTL;DR: Just buy it, man.", "timestamp_created": 1429951791, "timestamp_updated": 1429951838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15530829": {"recommendationid": "15530829", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054007222", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435422824}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0448\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0447\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e. \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e \u041d\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e (\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u044e) \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u043a\u0443. \u0428\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u0420\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0432 <3\n\n\u0410 \u043f\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0443: \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0442\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u0428\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438, \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1429946467, "timestamp_updated": 1429946562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561061", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15530257": {"recommendationid": "15530257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155870927", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 2844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500719192}, "language": "english", "review": "These are the pros and cons I have come up with during my first full (100%) playthrough of this game\n\n+ I have never taken so many screenshots in a single game before \n+ Platforming\n+ Artwork \n+ Soundtrack\n+ Plot (not just the story...)\n+ Humour in almost every cutscene\n+ Death barriers are clearly marked so you know which holes are hidden rooms and which aren't\n+ Lots of achievements\n+ Didn't feel like I was missing too much backstory even though I have yet to play the previous two games in the series\n\n\n- Two of the three combat skills you can buy are basically useless compared to your standard moveset\n- Maps do not tell you which items you have already found (and where they were located) which can lead to excessive backtracking\n- All the achievements are making my OCD kick in\n\n\nAll achievements acquired update:\n\n+ The speed run achievements are quite the challenge and the game rewards you with two \"fan-service-y\" wallpapers if you can beat it in under 2 hours with any% and under 3 hours with 100% completion. \n\n\nCompleted and acquired all achievements for Shantae: Risky's Revenge update:\n\nPirate's Curse vs Risky's Revenge \n\n+ More bosses \n+ More dungeons\n+ Less confusing map system\n+ Risky's ship and pirate flares replace Warp Squids (much more convenient travel than before)\n+ Twice as long to complete (not counting Pirate Mode)\n+ Movements and attacks are faster and more fluid\n+ More meaningful dialogue and story\n+ Artwork of characters has improved and looks more like a visual novel during dialogue\n+ Save files now display %completion and location of last save\n+ Different attacks do different amounts of damage instead of them all being considered one \"hit\"\n+ Better quality and more memorable music (the soundtrack is also twice as long)\n+ Graphics settings now allow true fullscreen (no black bars or stretch) for 1080p monitors\n\n+/- Graphics are more or less the same as Risky's Revenge\n+/- Weapons and items replace transformations and magic  (I personally like this game mechanic but some people would prefer the hallmark transformations of the previous Shantae games)\n\n\nShantae (GBC) 100% complete update\n\nIts kind of funny how I ended up playing this series in reverse order... Now on to the update:\n\nPirate's Curse has many references to the original GBC game. Many of the songs heard in this game are actually remastered from the old chiptunes of Shantae. While the original game was MUCH more difficult in terms of travel from one area to the next, I feel like Pirate's Curse was a nice change from most of your troubles being day travel (or rather NIGHT travel when enemies were twice as tough) to more emphasis on labrinths, quests, bosses, and overall story.  I still think Shantae is one of the best GBC games out there so don't discount it just because I said Pirate's Curse is better.

The puzzles are challenging, sometimes needing you to think outside the box to accomplish it. The enemies are well placed in the stages, preventing you from mindlessly steam-rolling through the stage. There are a lot of secret areas too, which rewards you greatly if you find them. The bosses are fun to go against, each requiring their own strategy to beaten. Plus, they get faster as they near death, increasing the challenge.\n\nArt: 10/10\nThe design of the characters are amazing. The way they're drawn, the personalities given to each character, the dialogue, it's quite astonishing.  (and maybe you might even add one or more of them to your waifu collection). The enemy art is also great. \n\nMusic:10/10\nEach piece of music is a magnificent work of art. It meshes well with the stages their associated with.

His spirit awakens to find out he's capable of taking over Sequin Land, and tries to spread the area with Dark Magic, effectively ruling it slowly but surely. It's up to Shantae, paired up with Risky Boots, to stop the Pirate Master by going to multiple islands and taking out the areas where he's getting his power.\n\nThis game is SO much better than Risky's Revenge ever hopes to be. It has a much faster pace overall, so it never feels sluggish. Shantae's attack, movement speed, and even the gameplay itself is generally quick, making killing enemies much less slow and tedious, and making the game overall a better, more paced experience. Other than that, it also has a much more interesting story with tons of character dialog and more immersive character development with funny and witty humor.\n\nYou aren't limited to one huge area like in Risky's Revenge, but you now have multiple islands to explore, each with their own individual theme and secrets to uncover; also their own dungeon. It certainly brings a breath of fresh air very often with each of the island's own unique style of puzzles, platforming, and fights. Pretty much makes the game itself very diverse so nothing is boring.\n\nShantae can no longer dance, but find some of Risky's pirate gear so she is granted more abilites. For example, she can find Risky's hat to have herself gently float downwards or use wind to go up, or Risky's pistol to solve puzzles and shoot enemies from afar. You'll find a new item in each dungeon, and they are well worth the journey to get them. Of course, it also makes the puzzles much more varied\n\nThe game is a little more on the RPG side this time around. Shantae's hair and Risky's weapons can be upgraded, and Shantae can even learn some new moves. It takes lots of money to get everything fully upgraded, so spend your gems wisely. It doesn't sound like much, but it's actually alot to upgrade. There's also healing items that enemies drop, and sometimes even attack items. You can access all of that by simply going to the item menu and using it, easy peasy.\n\nOverall, this game is wonderful, and a FANTASTIC step up from Risky's Revenge. If you can get this, get it. It's a wonderful platformer series that has a great, memorable story, and fun, fast gameplay.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1429834640, "timestamp_updated": 1429834640, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785380", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15508761": {"recommendationid": "15508761", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994372073", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 337, "playtime_forever": 1020, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431303471}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is spectacular. \n\nIf you enjoy platforming games you owe it to yourself to try this one out, either on the Wii U or on my personal preference here on steam.\n\nThe art style is vibrant, colorful and full of life, as are the environments, characters and Shantae herself. The dungeons and various islands are crafted to challenge your mind and creativity, while offering a wide variety of completely different enemies that don't hesitate to engage you. \n\nAs you progress you're granted new items that introduce unique facets to the gameplay. One delicious layer of cake after another, the sweet saccharine icing of course being the tight, responsive controls that let you play exactly how you need. \n\nThe plot is immediately engaging, and the music really psyches me up. If you were put off by the brevity in the prequel \"Risky's Revenge\" then you have nothing to fear. There's a huge supply of content in this sizable, well-polished package. \n\nphrasing", "timestamp_created": 1429820946, "timestamp_updated": 1429820946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731517", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15508641": {"recommendationid": "15508641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021498265", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433274191}, "language": "english", "review": "Risky's Revenge review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumperman/recommended/277890/\n\nThis game is good, and should be bought.\n\nPros:\n- Better and kind of worse item system. You are no longer trying to double tap the bottom screen of the 3DS to use an item. Instead you hit Select or whatever the keyboard control and press A on the item. The downside to this is the key items and map are also here, mainly the map. In the 3DS version you could have the map on the bottom, now you have to hit select then go to the map menu. I already beaten the game 7 times now so I don't need the map.\n\n- Better than both prequels. WayForward know how to make good sequels and this out of all 3 shantae games is so far my favorite. Longer story. fair gameplay, not too easy not too hard, it does get harder as you progress etc etc.\n\n- Good story\n- Memorable Characters (nameless npcs are even memorable)\n- Good Characters (I love all characters, even nameless npcs)\n- Challenging but not impossible \n- Excelent Platforming + Puzzles\n- Funny and unique dialouge.\n- Wonderful sprite animation\n- Awesome soundtrack\n- High replay value (After beating the steam version 3 different times I will have beaten this 10 times)\n\nCons:\n\n- Bad for players who do not have a thrill for adventure. This game does not exactly tell you what you have to do and where to do it. You have to use your brain and the tiny amount of hints the game gives to find out where things are. This is however good cause what's an adventure platformer if the game just tells you what to do and how to do it.\n\n- Grinding Gems to get items. The items for upgrades and moves can be way too expensive and useless. Like I said I beat this game a lot of times, I never used the back kick move, or the back dash. Back dash being 100 gems (not bad) and the back kick being 400 which is too much for something I never had to use. Also you have to upgrade your hair strength, whip speed, scimitar, and pistol 3 times which adds up to a lot of gems. It's not that bad to grind for them but it could of been done better.\n\nSo if you like Metroid/Castlevenia you will love this game. The story in this one is more deep than Risky's Revenge and the original GBC game. It is totally worth the 20 dollars to get. \n\nThat concludes this review with the 2 minor cons (one being really minor), I still have to give this game a wonderful score.\n\nI give this game a 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1429820433, "timestamp_updated": 1429820433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.847058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39499677": {"recommendationid": "39499677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122816181", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511203540}, "language": "english", "review": "words cannot express how amazing this game is. that's why this review is so short.", "timestamp_created": 1516503882, "timestamp_updated": 1516503882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39488013": {"recommendationid": "39488013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198402009459", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 201, "last_played": 1515793319}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\n  \ub300\ucda9 \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud6c4 \ub300\ucda9 \uac80\uc0c9\ud574 \ubcf4\ub2c8 \n\n  3d \ub2cc\ud150\ub3c4 ds \ud310 \uac8c\uc784\uc744 pc\ub85c \uc774\uc2dd\ud55c \uac8c\uc784\n\n\n  \uc778\uac9c\uc740 \uac70\uc9c4 \ub2cc\ud150\ub3c4 \uac8c\uc784\uae30\uc5d0 \ub9de\ucd94\ub290\ub77c \uc880 \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\n\n  \uc77c\ub7ec \ud558\ub098\ub294 \uadc0\uc5fd\ub2e4. \n\n\n  \uacb0\ub860\uc740 \uc138\uc77c\ud560\ub584 \uc0ac\ub77c!", "timestamp_created": 1516467411, "timestamp_updated": 1516467411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39465367": {"recommendationid": "39465367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231965792", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 642, "last_played": 1516465409}, "language": "english", "review": "I had mixed feelings about this game, because of all the performance issues and frustrating levels... still everything that makes Shantae great made up for that.", "timestamp_created": 1516389357, "timestamp_updated": 1516389357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39450509": {"recommendationid": "39450509", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998118312", "num_games_owned": 1580, "num_reviews": 262, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 609, "last_played": 1516222819}, "language": "english", "review": "Rating: 8/10\nGenre: 2d Action/Platformer\n\nThe Good:\n+ Good mix of platforming and combat \n+ Level design is well done often encouraging exploration\n+ Collecting new items allows you to revisit previous areas and collect new things.  \n+ Fun yet easy boss battles \n+ Witty dialogue \n\nThe Average:\n+/- A bit on the easy side for this type of game.

Goes to say a lot about the current generation of \"reaction video\" gamers. \n\nI don't know what Mr. Cawthon is thinking in his mind but I sure hope he comes back around to making games like this that are actually fun to play with so much to discover and don't require some teenage kid screaming on Twitch.\n\n[EDIT] Be careful with your keyboard's ESC button it doesn't close the in-game menus it straight up quits the game!", "timestamp_created": 1513691274, "timestamp_updated": 1514022326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38408816": {"recommendationid": "38408816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150566985", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499730034}, "language": "english", "review": "A good game to play if you wish to see the depths of Cawthon's imaginative genius, yet are too scared to open up Five Nights at Freddy's.\n\nTrust me, this game is so much fun. It's one of the most difficult games I've ever played (I used a walkthrough pretty much the entire time), but it was worth getting to the end.\n\nWhat makes it good:\n*Characters that I could easily connect with and feel for\n*The music is pleasant and easy to listen to\n*The graphics are FANTASTIC (Cawthon might not be able to animate people very well, but his robots are amazing)\n*Wonderful story with a touching message about...well, that's kind of a spoiler. Trust me, it's there.\n\nI think the only major downside is just how miserably difficult this game is. This game features things such as:\n*A time limit. If you don't complete the game in 15 in-game days, you're finished. That's it. You have to restart the game all over again (You might be able to load a save, but you'll probably still be replaying a huge chunk of the game). There are items you can obtain to lengthen the time limit, but these are somewhat rare. If this makes the game sound impossible, then don't worry: I completed the game without running out of time, and I'm not the greatest at games. Still, if it stresses you out too much while playing, then maybe you should forget about it.\n*The boss battles. There is no explanation of what each move does or even how the battle works. Once you study a walthrough, it should make some sense. Even with an explanation, though, the battles are pretty tough. However, this brings me back to my previous point: if you fail, you get kicked out of the entire area, meaning you've just wasted half an in-game day. To increase your chances of a win, you have to wait until nightfall and collect some level-up items, meaning you've lost more time. Do not worry; those who are patient will figure it out.\n\nYou're probably scared to play this game now, but I think the journey to the end makes it worth it. It was a ton of fun for me, even with all the game's flaws, and that's why I recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1513635066, "timestamp_updated": 1513635066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38383946": {"recommendationid": "38383946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070299760", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513537440}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a bit of a hidden gem.

Enter a simulation or pick up items by pressing down. If you want to drop an item, use your mouse to click on the [x] next to the item's icon. \n\n2) inside the simulation: walk by using the arrow keys, interact with merchants or virus by pressing down, purchase items from merchants by clicking on the item you want and jump/shoot by pressing x or y on your keyboard (x and z for QWERTZ-keyboards)\n\n3) Boss battles: use your mouse to click on the attacks you want your robo-buddies to use. There is a combat-simulator for this right in the first room of the station.\n\n4) Bonus: never ever hit ESC unless you really mean to end the game. \n\nNow go and give this game a shot.

The story might very well be high quality, but I wasn't able to get very far because just figuring out [i]how to play[/i] was an intolerable farce of trial and error on the keyboard.  Games are supposed to be fun, and this one became a chore very quickly, unfortunately.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nIt's a game about a sentient (AI) coffee machine trying desperately to keep things running on an abandoned off-world space station that humanity seems to have forgotten about.  What's not to love about that set up?  Add in some genuinely beautiful graphics and price tag of zero... Seriously, why are we still talking about this?!\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nThe controls are highly non-intuitive, which wouldn't be so bad in itself if the game actually [i]explained what they were[/i].  It tells you the controls for the main platforming game play, so that's fine, but it doesn't give you any instruction about secondary interfaces, like merchant store menus or boss fights (which play entirely differently than the main platforming part.)  They're not at all obvious, either.  I seriously could not figure out how to buy stuff from a merchant.  There was no indicator of which item was selected.  Every key with a function that the game had told me about so far just exited the store panel without effect.  Up/down arrows?  Nope.  Left/right arrows?  Nope.  Shoot or jump keys?  Sucka!\n\nI can handle a game that has non-intuitive controls, as long as the game [b][i]tells me what those controls are.[/i][/b]  Either in-game or in the main menu somewhere.  I can also handle a game that doesn't explain the controls, so long as those controls [b][i]are intuitive enough to figure them out myself.[/i][/b]  If I need to bust out Google just to learn what keys I need to press to buy a simple upgrade from a merchant, or to [i]do anything at all in boss fights,[/i] things have officially gone too far.

As an art piece, it's beautiful. I love the world and the animations which are incredibly detailed, and the story will keep you interested.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is where it falls apart. The game has two main large problems: lack of tutorials and wasting time. The main focus, the bulk of the game, and indeed the best part of the game is boss battles. These are broken apart with platforming segments inbetween. You'd be best off spending a lot of time in the provided battle simulator, which is the closest thing to a tutorial mode for the boss battles, which could've used more explanation but is ultimately not as hard as it looks to grasp.\n\nEverything in this game costs a tonne of points, which leads to it becoming a grindfest. One particular world you'll be visiting is underwater and is very slow to navigate. The game has a day/night cycle, though during the night you basically just play a minigame to level yourself up in boss battles, so it really just distracts and takes away from the main game which takes place during the day.\n\nIn summary, there is good here, but it's buried under layers and layers of inconvenience.

It's got a number of different mechanics, including a platformer inside of virtual environments, a very simple top down zelda-like shooter inside of virtual environments inside virtual environments, and a fast paced rpg combat system for fighting the virus that's assaulting the simulations.\n\nThe graphics are somewhat primitive 3d, but with a style that makes everything look surprisingly good. The environments can be a little confusing to navigate in some places but the initial exploration of the simulations is still fun. I'm in some of the later game virus fights and the game is definitely harder than I expected, but I'm not as good at micromanaging the RPG combat. The turns come really fast and on top of that there are minigames which your characters can launch which build up bonuses but have to be played while still controlling all of your actions.\n\nAll and all I'm really impressed with this game, it's got a lot of charm and I've paid money for games that were much worse.

By the time I got around to it, the game went free-to-play, and now you have no excuse not to play it.\n\nThe sci-fi premise here was a good one; without spoiling too much, a handful of AI's on a distant research station have a mission to run simulations to determine the habitability of a planet for human settlers.  Each AI has their own idea of how things will work best, and you get to experience each simulation through the course of the game.  A handful of intriguing twists are definitely what make this game worth the playthrough.\n\nThe visuals range from beautiful, to awesome, to ridiculous, to near-seizure-inducing.  The characters are interestingly designed and their simulations are fantastically imagined.  The research facility and simulations provide interesting contrast with the surrounding barren landscape under the quiet vacuum of a beautfiul starscape.  The battle sequences can be a bit much, at times producing effects fully intended to make them basically unplayable for a brief period.\n\nDown to the gameplay, which was actually a lot of fun.  A pretty sizeable chunk of the game is presented in sidescrolling, platforming 2D.  You jump, shoot lazers, pick away at the story, and power up for your confrontations present in each simulation.  Those confrontations are frenetic turn-based RPG battles.  I must admit that even after completing the game, some mechanisms of those battles remain a mystery to me.  The battle display is a tad overwhelming, Information all over, attacks and effects constantly firing seemingly without reason, handful of minigames just doing their thing all at the same time.

Yes I'm aware that that's the extent of all the main characters but their all just really well done \nThe gameplay it's pretty good and varied you have simple side scrolling platforming sections which are pretty good for the most part, overhead virtual dungeon crawler grinding hotspots which again are pretty fun especially if you can find all the secrets, walking while collecting stuff space invaders simulator is pretty relaxing and this part has a lovely background  and theme and finally the best part of the gameplay the RTS RPG battles! These battles are just super fun and feel really satisfying each of the 4 main robots ability's to succeed in battle depends on how well you manage all their ability's and believe me there are a ton of them to manage it may seem really complicated and hard to keep track of at first but after you get a good understanding of how each ability works everything just flows at an incredible smooth pace after that the end result will leave you feeling like an epic champion oh and as an added bonus you can shoot lazers and interact with NPCs in all these modes (the RTS RPGs don't have NPCs)\nI really like the learning curve this game provides you can figure out how all the essential mechanics work on your own as long as you pay attention and well read the descriptions but even if you can't figure everything out and end up feeling confused the game comes with an instruction manual in the games properties that pretty much explains everything\nThe Writing was also pretty good and at times pretty funny to\nThe credits were pretty cool now that may seem like an oddly specific thing to praise but there's some cool stuff added into them like still images of all the bosses you defeated with awesome music and while on the subject of the end game I think it's worth mentioning that the ending was also pretty good\nI like how after beating the game your still free to load back your save and explore for any secrets you may have missed or if your patient enough you can replay the game with all your upgrades intact\nThis game is free but if given the chance I would've gladly payed for it its just that good \n\nCons\nOne of the platforming levels is an underwater level and like most games with a water level it kind of stinks\nThis game has a time limit through out the whole game granted it pauses for boss battles or the dungeon crawler bits and is kind of important to the story as well as how the game works and when your on your last stretch of days you can find items that extend how much time you have left and running out of time doesn't result in a game over but I'm still not a fan of time limits even if in this case you don't really have to worry about it it just adds some tension and makes the under water level super annoying\nMalnez has a well designed level but it's annoying how you have to reach the very end of the level to talk to him when all the other levels have there respected characters close to the entrance\nBio-Beta's level can be a bit disorienting\nA few names in the instruction manual don't match the in game names but you can still tell whos who and what not based off the descriptions\nas you make progress in the game a static effect pops up in certain environments  combine this with how flashy the RTS RPG battles are and you have a game that could be considered epileptic so if you suffer from epilepsy you may want to avoid this game\n\nso yeah I really enjoyed this one and considering that it's free the only reason I wouldn't recommend it is if your epileptic but other than that I'd totally recommend this one as one of my favorites", "timestamp_created": 1497535237, "timestamp_updated": 1499004244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.729881", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32418117": {"recommendationid": "32418117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285546309", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497474549}, "language": "english", "review": "i love this game of couse i would its comeing from scott cawthon love him keep up the good work", "timestamp_created": 1497472449, "timestamp_updated": 1497472449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494864", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32398793": {"recommendationid": "32398793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268115996", "num_games_owned": 713, "num_reviews": 574, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497389684}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 - \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439!!!

This game not only has an enticing story that involves really awesome futuristic character designs, and a really cool setting, but the gameplay is very interesting because it changes the gameplay style in multiple ways. If you enjoy side scrollers, this game has side scrollers. If you enjoy RPG style boss fights, this game has RPG style boss fights. I honestly feel that this is one of the most underrated games that the online world has to offer. Now of course, the game does have some flaws to it that I'll mention just so I don't look like some blind follower of the game.\n\nOne flaw that the game has that I'll point out is that the game, while looking amazing at times, can have the occasional moment where something just looks really out of place, and it can take away from the experience if you are very picky about graphics, and art style.\n\nAnother flaw would be that sometimes the characters just keep talking for a very long time, and it can drive someone to just start skipping through a lotof dialouge that's very important if you care a lot for the story of the game like I do.\n\nOne final flaw I'd like to point out that can also be considered pro, it that a lot of the time, you're forced to start grinding the game's currency, and trying to find the merchants because at some points, the bosses become so difficult, the level of your characters don't matter, and what really matters is buying as much stuff that benefits you as possible. Now, you can either take that as a pro, or a con, I can see both sides.\n\nSo, that's my review on Desolate Hope, definetely in my top 5 for favourite games, and something I highly recommend!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1493411834, "timestamp_updated": 1493411834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31352380": {"recommendationid": "31352380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019388620", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493054957}, "language": "english", "review": "I was eying this before it became free, some time around when it was first released.

By no means is this quirky little game a masterpiece, but it is interesting and different, by its own right. And it is undeniably different than Scott's claim to fame in FNAF - in a great way.\n\nThe controls are a little stiff, and could be better. And having no options to pause the game, nor settings available that I can see is a little odd. It just wants you to hop in and play. \n\nThe graphics are really nicely done, and have an older feel to them. \nThe gameplay is a mix of resource management and metroidvania exploration. \nThe boss fights seem bizarre old school JRPG style with a lot of colors, flashing lights, and strange techniques. \nThe story and setting are the biggest draw, a cyberpunk style throughout it all, with an aloof humor in the machines and their visions of a perfect human habitat, in a forgetten corner of space.\n\nI could probably play through the whole thing in one sitting, and this is based off my initial impressions.

Which is...kind of the worst of both worlds? \n\nThe one other big downside is that the game has a twist...but it isn't hard to guess - the main thing keeping the twist hidden is that there are 4 or 5 other possible twists obscuring it. \n\nHowever, the game ends with a very good finale - including a monologue so good, that I cried trying to tell someone about it afterwards.

Para isso usavam rob\u00f4s, estes eram enviados para o espa\u00e7o e colonizavam o planeta, preparando-o para quando os humanos chegassem. Este projecto era repetido em massa e como tal, alguns dos planetas eram postos de parte ou esquecidos. No caso do jogador, ele \u00e9 uma m\u00e1quina de caf\u00e9 cujo programa quer ajudar a eliminar os v\u00edrus que atacam os diferentes rob\u00f4s da sua esta\u00e7\u00e3o, num planeta desconhecido. \n    Os elementos visuais deste jogo s\u00e3o um dos seus pontos fortes, um grafismo que me faz lembrar principalmente H. R. Giger misturado com tantas outras obras de sci-fi dos anos 80. O gameplay mistura v\u00e1rios estilos como RPG, plataforma e aventura e batalha por turnos, tornando este uma das melhores experi\u00eancias e maiores revela\u00e7\u00f5es para mim uma vez que n\u00e3o esperava muito de um jogo gratuito. Sim, gratuito!\n    A narrativa excelente lan\u00e7a uma crise existencial, questionando se valeu ou n\u00e3o salvar as cria\u00e7\u00f5es e simula\u00e7\u00f5es das m\u00e1quinas em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da sobreviv\u00eancia e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do ser humano, n\u00e3o sabendo se esta se concretizou de facto. Desperta sentimentos no jogador que nos obrigam a desejar uma sequela, ardentemente.\n    Tanto da parte da jogabilidade como da parte da narrativa este jogo \u00e9 uma surpresa, um \"abre olhos\", lembrando a comunidade Gamer de que jogos Indie e jogos gratuitos podem ser aut\u00eanticas obras primas, mesmo que esteja-mos habituados a encarar esta classe de jogos como inferiores e rudimentares. Scott Cawthon d\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m uma li\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 comunidade de Game Developers, d\u00e1 um grande exemplo de mod\u00e9stia tornando esta sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e3o acess\u00edvel, enquanto outros, com obras piores ou iguais as lan\u00e7am a pre\u00e7os exorbitantes. Esta mod\u00e9stia foi com certeza um ponto adjuvante na sua fama e sucesso com obras posteriores como a saga Five Nights at Freddy's.\n    Uma obra superior em todos os par\u00e2metros na minha opini\u00e3o, recomendo a 100% e a todos os g\u00e9neros de p\u00fablico.\n", "timestamp_created": 1484608872, "timestamp_updated": 1484608872, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29256717": {"recommendationid": "29256717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147885410", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484571447}, "language": "english", "review": "The ending alone is a good enough reason to play this game.\n\n\n\n\n(Finished this game whilst offline, so unfortunately my hours were not recorded.)", "timestamp_created": 1484426246, "timestamp_updated": 1484426246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29188168": {"recommendationid": "29188168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198343822893", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 50, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514216182}, "language": "english", "review": "Scott Cawthon's classic game.

Je m\u2019arr\u00eatai et fixai sa silhouette d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able. Il allait ouvrir la bouche pour que je puisse y compter les trous. Son haleine n\u2019avait que le m\u00e9rite de masquer son odeur de chien mouill\u00e9. \u00abVous n\u2019avez pas une petite pi\u00e8ce ? Je n\u2019ai pas de maison et je n\u2019ai pas mang\u00e9 depuis dix jours.\u00bb A ces mots, j\u2019attrapai devant lui mon porte-feuille pour en sortir ma carte de m\u00e9tro, lui tournai le dos puis m\u2019engouffrai vite dans le ventre de la ville sans un regard pour mon interlocuteur. Mon argent irait plut\u00f4t enlargir la panse de Gabe Newell o\u00f9 il serait plus heureux.\n\nEnfin arriv\u00e9 devant mon \u00e9cran d\u2019ordinateur, je me posai dans le moelleux de mon fauteuil \u00e0 roulettes hors de prix. La scoliose qui ronronnait de plaisir, j\u2019allumai mon unit\u00e9 centrale, pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9penser mes euros jalousement gard\u00e9s pour ce jeu aux superbes artworks qui m\u2019avait fait de l\u2019oeil ce matin. Et l\u00e0, la surprise. L\u2019\u00e9b\u00eatement. Merde alors, The Desolate Hope est gratuit. Mais genre vraiment gratuit. Pas la moindre petite trace de micro-transaction. Je baissai les yeux et regardai mon porte-monnaie rembourr\u00e9 de pi\u00e8ces et de billets. [i]Mais qu\u2019est-ce que j\u2019vais faire de tout cet oseille ?[/i]\n\nQu\u2019est-ce que The Desolate Hope ? Un Metroidvania ? Un vieux Zelda-like ? Un jeu de r\u00f4le ? Un jeu d\u2019aventure, peut-\u00eatre ? Aucun des quatre. Mais un peu des quatre quand m\u00eame. The Desolate Hope explore plusieurs pistes de game design mais n\u2019en pousse aucune assez loin pour en m\u00e9riter l\u2019appartenance au genre. The Desolate Hope est surtout un jeu qui ne nous abreuve pas de dicactitiels et nous donne l\u2019impression de vite nous abandonner dans son monde comme un sale gosse jet\u00e9 de la voiture sur le bord de l\u2019autoroute. [i]Maintenant d\u00e9merde-toi.[/i]\n\nLa premi\u00e8re heure de jeu est assez confuse. [i]Hein ? Je dois faire quoi ?[/i] Beaucoup de non-dits ne demandent qu\u2019\u00e0 \u00eatre entendus \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience, on retrouve ce go\u00fbt de la d\u00e9brouillardise qui a fait les grandes sensations des meilleurs jeux des deux d\u00e9cennies pass\u00e9es. On pense alors \u00eatre face \u00e0 un game design \u00e0 assimiler tout seul, comme un grand. Trop content d\u2019\u00eatre enfin en face d\u2019un d\u00e9fi intellectuel, la curiosit\u00e9 piqu\u00e9e par une direction artistique sublime qui nous servira de carotte, on d\u00e9cide d\u2019explorer ce monde \u00e9trange et m\u00e9lancolique qu\u2019on ne comprend pas tr\u00e8s bien. On chute un peu. On se cogne aux murs. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019au co\u00fbt de quelques \u00e9corchures et d\u2019un grand courage qu\u2019on commence \u00e0 se dresser sur les deux pattes arri\u00e8res. Au milieu de l\u2019effort, quand la douleur du muscle nous hurle d\u2019arr\u00eater, on ne c\u00e8de pas mais continue de pousser fort, alors on exulte, fiers d\u2019\u00eatre persuad\u00e9s d\u2019avoir appris \u00e0 marcher tout seul, debout comme un grand singe. L\u2019excitation retomb\u00e9e, on commence \u00e0 sentir la pression sous nos aisselles. On se retourne et d\u00e9couvre alors qu\u2019on \u00e9tait simplement tir\u00e9s par les bretelles.\n\nParce que quoi qu\u2019en dise la premi\u00e8re impression qu\u2019il laisse, The Desolate Hope n\u2019est pas du tout un jeu qui nous abandonne \u00e0 notre sort ; oui son univers nous d\u00e9stabilise, oui il y a beaucoup de choses \u00e0 comprendre par soi-m\u00eame, oui certains aspects vitaux du game design ne nous seront jamais expliqu\u00e9s mais non, nous ne sommes jamais seuls. Le jeu regorge d\u2019indications, nous tient par la main du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin et les niveaux sont assez \u00e9troits et peu nombreux pour \u00eatre tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s vite assimil\u00e9s. The Desolate Hope est un jeu qui pourra vous faire peur mais n\u2019est finalement pas plus dangereux qu\u2019un pistolet qui crache un drapeau [i]BANG![/i]. Les pics de difficult\u00e9 qu\u2019on rencontrera (essentiellement les combats contre les boss) ne viennent jamais du fait qu\u2019on ne sache pas quoi faire ni o\u00f9 aller : ce sont des obstacles pos\u00e9s sur notre route pour nous inviter \u00e0 chercher ailleurs dans le jeu des combines pour les surmonter. Un chouilla de d\u00e9brouillardise suffira \u00e0 vaincre les plus grandes difficult\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019exception peut-\u00eatre du dernier ennemi, assez redoutable pour nous demander un peu plus d\u2019efforts.\n\nComme Dead Rising, Pikmin, Majora\u2019s Mask et les autres meilleurs jeux du monde, TDH est un jeu \u00ab sablier \u00bb, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire un jeu que l\u2019on est chronom\u00e9tr\u00e9 pour finir. Mais l\u00e0 encore, la menace n\u2019est qu\u2019illusoire. Pour diverses raisons que la balise [spoiler]spoilers[/spoiler] me fera taire, il sera plus difficile d\u2019\u00e9chouer par manque de temps que d\u2019arriver au g\u00e9n\u00e9rique de fin.\n\nThe Desolate Hope n\u2019est donc pas un d\u00e9fi facile mais certainement pas un insurmontable. Vous aurez peur au d\u00e9but, serez rassur\u00e9s par la suite, vous aurez un pic de trouille un peu plus loin et serez soulag\u00e9s sur la fin. Depuis un HUB r\u00e9gi par le cycle jour-nuit (certaines actions ne sont disponibles que de jour et d\u2019autres ne le sont que de nuit), on se prom\u00e8ne dans un monde d\u2019apocalypse douce, entre les vestiges d\u2019une plan\u00e8te qui n\u2019a jamais connu la vie et des simulations informatiques qui n\u2019auront bient\u00f4t plus d\u2019\u00e9nergie. Le gros du jeu se joue comme un Metroidvania \u00e0 deux touches o\u00f9 le besoin d\u2019un objet ou d\u2019une comp\u00e9tence nous force \u00e0 faire des allers et des retours entre ses quatre niveaux. A l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de ces niveaux, on tombera sur des combats de RPG \u00e0 la japonaise en ATB (active time battle fa\u00e7on Final Fantasy) et des s\u00e9quences vaguement inspir\u00e9es d\u2019un Zelda en vue de dessus. M\u00e9lange habile des genres qui n\u2019excelle dans aucun de ses diff\u00e9rents gameplays, TDH est surtout une aventure visuelle, magnifique de tristesse, qui nous enlace dans son ambiance si particuli\u00e8re.\n\nCinq robots ont continu\u00e9 d\u2019exister sur une station coloniale abandonn\u00e9e par l\u2019esp\u00e8ce humaine. Dans seize jours il n\u2019y aura plus d\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. Comme les milliards d\u2019humains et d\u2019animaux qui s\u2019agrippent \u00e0 la surface d\u2019une plan\u00e8te trop occup\u00e9e \u00e0 tournoyer au milieu du rien pour les entendre, The Desolate Hope ne nous fait lever les yeux vers un ciel vide que pour nous faire comprendre qu\u2019il n\u2019y a que le sol. Et ainsi mettre un nom sur ce poids qui nous p\u00e8se : l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de la solitude \u00e0 plusieurs.", "timestamp_created": 1476429540, "timestamp_updated": 1477700666, "voted_up": true,

soundtrack, but they are dull (little more to do than spamming your shooting and collecting chips that are just laying there), the enemies have cool designs but all of them just have one form of attack which is shooting pathetic energy balls at you, and since the simulations are actually pretty small it gets really repetitive in the late game\n\n*The wireframe top-down segments are even more bare, its just looking for hidden corridors while shooting down mostly static enemies, it is somewhat more challenging than the platforming tho since bullets are harder to dodge and healing is not as easy, but overall they feel more like a tacked-on feature that was added onto the game to make it a little more varied rather than an actual part of it\n\n*The boss battles are definitively the best part of the game, they are fun, challenging, and confusing in a good way that makes you interested in learning better how they work, but I think they are unbalanced, enemy moves are disproportionately stronger than yours even taking in account it's 4 vs 1, sometimes the bosses destroy you if you even drop your guard one second, sometimes you destroy them 10 seconds into the battle if you get a little too strong for them and late in the game hacking chips practically become mandatory in order to beat them\n\n*There is little to do on the base other than go look for stuff on the outside and bringing it back to the Derelicts, it would have been nice if this part of the game was handled in a more interactive way\n\nIt might just be suited for people looking for something unusual and up to tolerate the clunky gameplay for it, but despite all it's shortcomings I think it was pretty good and ambitious for a free game made by one person, it makes me wish Scott did more than endlessly milk

You play as a coffee pot tasked with removing a virus from 4 robot's internal systems in order to keep the station running. While inside the robot's programming/system the gameplay functions as a platformer while you look for the virus to fight. The platforming is pretty fun giving you plenty of mobility allowing you to explore the numerous environments. When you encounter the virus the game changes to a rpg style real time turn based fighting system. The boss fights are super fun and very fast paced which can be great and enjoyable, or very deadly if you are not paying attention. There is a time limit represented by a day/night cycle which does add some tension, but more time can be added on during the night cycle if you find battery packs. The night cylce is when you can leave the hub world and search for items to level up the robots which are the memebers of your party during boss fights. One of my favorite aspects of this game are the graphics, the robots look great and really look intimidating while also looking somewhat cartooney. The Desolate hope is a great game that you can enjoy even if you dont like the five nights at freddys games, and the best part?

It's genre is hard to describe, but if you're asking me it is a an RPG with some Metroidvania and Time Management elements, but the real meat comes from its turn-based boss battles (even Cawthon admits to this).\n\nYou play Coffee, a sentient percolator on board the Lun Infinus space station. The space station is home to four (technically five, though one has since broken down) robots called Derelicts, who were tasked to create the ideal colony for humans by running simulations. Unfortunately, the Derelicts have been running far longer than expected, and a virus has started to worm its way into the simulations and wreak havoc. As Coffee, your job is to go to the simulations and locate the viruses, and the Derelicts will fight the virus off (the aforemented boss battles).\n\nGameplay is split into 3 parts;\n\n[olist]\n    [*]The first part is the Time Management aspect. The Lun Infinus has only 15 days worth of power left so you have to decide what to do. The day segments are when you go to the simulations and try to locate the virus, while the night segments have you scavenge for various trinkets that increase the stats of the Derelicts during the boss battles.\n    [*]The second part is the Metroidvania aspect. While inside the simulation, Coffee jumps from platform to platform, shooting hostile programs that inhabit the simulations. Aside from zeroing in on the virus (which you'll have to do 3 times per simulation), you can purchase upgrades for yourself or the Derelicts -some of which are necessary to progress-, making it easier as to go through the game.\n    [*]The Boss Battle aspect, and the real show stopper. This is where the Derelicts fight the virus (which thankfully does not consume time). It's semi-turn-based, in that the Derelicts and the Virus have a bar that fills up during the fight, and when it fills up, the Derelict/Virus can do an action. There's a lot of things that can happpen during the fight (especially with upgrades), though there's several ways to automate certain actions to take some load off.\n[/olist]\n\nPros:\n[list]\n    [*]Catchy Music. Unfortunately, Scott cannot provide us with a soundtrack, not that this stopped players from finding the songs he used.\n    [*]Incredible graphic style and character design. Seriously he really should focus on this more than FNAF.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n    [*]Metroidvania aspect can get a bit tedious, especially if you're farming cash for upgrades. And this is coming from a seasoned Warframe grinder.\n    [*]There is no Pause Button. Jokes aside, there's no way to pause gameplay (outside of a certain area that can be accessed in the simulations) so you better have some water nearby.\n[/list]\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nYes, if you can allot some time to it and if you're willing to withstand the Metroidvania bit.

Seriously, I was able to just mow over every boss in the game by simply unlocking all the conditionals and setting them all to stun the boss for one second. Except for one conditional, which I set to \"Charge Tweak\" the boss every ten seconds. However, when trying to play the game with a diverse set of conditionals, I found myself being constantly mowed over. So yeah, there are flaws.\n\nI will admit that there is a lot of room for forgiveness here because the game is completely free to play, no signup or anything. You simply download the game and play. I feel like I would probably still recommend this game to people if it cost money, but only if it didn't cost more than $5.\n\nSo what exactly is \"The Desolate Hope\"? It is a game made by Scott Cawthon, who is best known as the mastermind behind the \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" franchise. He made this game two years before the first FNaF was released, but it apparently didn't get onto Steam until 2014.\n\nThis game is a blend of three different game genres: 2D platformer, top-down dungeon-crawler, and JRPG (kinda). You start in the \"real world\", then gain access to four different digital worlds to explore. The \"real world\" and the four digital worlds are the \"2D platformer\" part of the formula. While you are within these digital worlds, there are terminals scattered about that you can access. When you access them, you are dropped into a digital world within the digital world where you can farm for money and unlock conditionals for boss battles. This is the \"top-down dungeon-crawler\" part of the formula. After speaking to a respective digital world's Derelict, you can find and confront the boss in what is basically a JRPG-style battle, but without the turn-based element. This is the \"JRPG (kinda)\" part of the formula.\n\nSince I've only played through it once, I'm a bit unsure what I would have to say about the game in terms of replay value. While I'm not eager to jump right back in and play through it again, there isn't anything preventing me from playing it again.\n\nAlso, let me just say that the demonstrational videos on the store page don't do the game's aesthetic justice. Seriously, this is actually a very pretty game. And that soundtrack! Tasty!\n\nThe story is suprisingly engaging, regardless of the fact that you are kept in the dark about what is actually happening for pretty much the entire game, right up to the final boss. The ending is definitely interesting to say the least.\n\nSo would I recommend it? Yes. I would definitely say this is something you should at least try.

A work of art, both visually and story-wise. This game features some of the best visual work I've ever seen, with a real '90s hyperfuture feel. Gorgeous. Story is subtle and effective, a tale of isolation, helplessness, and the terror of uncertainty. Characters are philosophical and devastatingly tragic, doing a good job of exploring the big question: Why do we even?\n\nI know why I even. To jack up spooky cybertards with the help of my robot pals. In the not-too-distant future.\nGreat fun game, ten out of ten, here's my firstborn.\n\nI was thrown at first by the simplistic gameplay. You derp around on rails to access the main platformer levels and eventually do some goofy top-down goofing. I eventually figured out the roles of these parts of the game: Basically you need to earn FAT STACK$ and buy hella upgrades to have any chance of winning the game, and you gotta do it fast-like before the landlord flips the breaker and things go dead. Yeah.\nBut you're here to fight a virus, and that's the main draw of the game. The battles are intense, complicated, and unforgiving; they're the only serious or difficult parts of the gameplay. You need to derp around the research station to access all the simulated worlds and to level your characters for battle. You need to explore each simulation carefully to find upgrades for your fine robo-dudesmen to use in battle, and to actually locate and challenge the manifestations of the Virus to initiate battle. You gotta enter the source-code world to get sweet conditional buffs for your battles. You gotta GIT GUD to beat the living hell out of robotic cyber-nightmares. IN BATTLES.\n\nFound a little glowing fireball? Activate it. Pull up your big boy pants.\n...\nAnd yes, you have to fight THAT. No, don't slam the escape key. Not that you can beat it first time. Haha, no. \nYou gotta GIT GUD.\n\nIt's time to micromanage four different characters with different move sets JRPG style, but *in real time*, trying to out-murder a terrifying robo-devil of some description while he is continuously jacking up yo boys with MIND LIGHTNING. Like a good frantic multitask in the morning? The final moves of each of your characters start little minigames *to be played at the same time* on top of the main battle in order to get some powerups. All this, and the virus is no sissy either. The difficulty ramps steeply, and the game is unforgiving if you are too slow or waste a move.\n\nFortunately, you get a practice arena in which to learn the ropes and PLENTY of fights in which to hone your skills. And failing a fight only sets you back in time- no resources are permanently used up, and you can try again. It's a good implimentation of super-crazy death challenges.\n\nIt's astoundingly addictive. Loads of fun.\n\nP.S. I note how most other reviews have either fewer than 3 or more than 10 hours of play. I reckon a first-time playthrough would take ~9 hours, so there's how you tell if somebody actually finished the thing. I definitely took a full hour to get familiar with the game, but then I was hooked good and firmly. \nThe ending is delightfully bittersweet. I hope you enjoy the heartfeels.\n\nP.P.S. Malentz is my favorite character. His outlook on life is eerily similar to my approach to College. I like how he's the biggest, spikiest, spidery-est robot, but collects toys and spends his time tinkering in his Farmville-style hermitage. He's also got the best moves, though there's competition from that big loveable teddy bear Alphon.", "timestamp_created": 1458623258, "timestamp_updated": 1458624422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21932275": {"recommendationid": "21932275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127819757", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456204472}, "language": "english", "review": "GG Scott, GG", "timestamp_created": 1458422759, "timestamp_updated": 1458422759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490368", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21811775": {"recommendationid": "21811775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077085867", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459167627}, "language": "english", "review": "its a funny indie RPG, but its hard, and if dont know waht to do \"like me\" \n\nbtw, its funny, and i have to say, better then fnaf!", "timestamp_created": 1457868318, "timestamp_updated": 1457868318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21778571": {"recommendationid": "21778571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111951775", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438460138}, "language": "english", "review": "You play as a coffee pot.

As a big FNaF fan (now Scott Cawthon fan) I did the same thing, and I still do occassionally as I'm going through. However, I think it's important to note that this is not FNaF and FNaF has nothing to do with it. \nThe Desolate Hope is an amazing game, and even though it probably will never be as popular as FNaF, I hope that someday Scott can turn out another game similar to this one (assuming that developing games is something he wants to do for a long time). The visuals are amazing, I've actually just set one of the scenes from the game as my wallpaper. The characters are loveable as hell, each having unique and interesting traits. Gameplay is, foor the most part, very fun. Music is well done, fitting to the atmosphere and easily getting into my head for hours (in a good way!). I'm a sucker for this old but beautiful graphic style, and sci-fi settings, so this game is like a little slice of gaming heaven for me. (Also I would die to have a game visually and atmospherically similar to this one, but have it be a hidden object/puzzle game rather than an RPG~)\nMy only complaints with this would have to be some aspects of gameplay. The nights drag on, and are pretty much just a lot of holding down the left arrow key, especially after you've gotten the wrench and have no incentive to care about how efficient you are in your nightly collecting. Another thing I took issue with was the real-time combat with viruses. I often find myself flustered and frustrated, which makes strategizing difficult. Lastly, if you want more upgrades, there's a good chance you'll be grinding in those little terminal worlds for money for quite a while, which I find really annoying. \n\ntl;dr : this game is freaking awesome and beautiful, but the gameplay can be frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1455088823, "timestamp_updated": 1455090304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21000437": {"recommendationid": "21000437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131442467", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454772807}, "language": "english", "review": "So what to say about The Desolate Hope ?\n\nAn alien / sci-fi styled mashup could be one thing\nthe game is setup up a world with 4 characters al doing there own thing waiting for it al to fail...\nAlso my experience with the game.

In it, you play a small video game program tasked with exploring several unique worlds and battling viruses within as per the orders of a coffee machine tasked with maintaining the extra-planetary colony of Lum Infinis. To aid you on your quest, you have the help of four derelict robots each running their own simulation for you to explore.\n\nGameplay is split between a megaman-style sidescrolling jump and shoot, a top down shooter where you explore cyberspace within cyberspace, and RPG-style 4 on 1 battles vs bosses. TDH features a really bizarre artstyle that I can only describe as \u201cuniquely Scott Cawthon\u201d and if you\u2019ve played any of his other games (especially FNAF) you\u2019ll see why. Another interesting feature of this game are the day-night cycles. During the night, you are relegated to exploring the surface world to scavenge for items to improve the derelicts, increase power to the station, or score a few extra credits playing a space invaders style mini-game. Daytime is considerably more busy, requiring you to dive into simulations powered by each derelict in order to seek out and destroy the viruses located within. Once you encounter a virus, you are thrust into a high speed active-time RPG battle where quick thinking and careful planning are required in order to survive.\n\nOn that note I have to say that, while most of the game was a fairly interesting experience, the boss battles are incredibly confusing and I managed to clear each one without really understanding what was going on. There is just so much happening on the screen in any given moment and the bosses will interrupt everything very frequently to do a full-screen attack. In any case I won, but I have no idea how or why.\n\nChaotic boss battles aside, I still really enjoyed The Desolate Hope and you probably will too if you like eccentric hybrid RPGs.

I think the good part was that the game was free. Final verdict: this game is a circle that has a beginning and no end, nor clues how to get to the end.

First of all, thne visuals are so overwhelming that you often can not even see the character. Ok, once you played a while you get used to it, but when you start the game, the game graphics looks pretty much the same as the loading screens, so when I first started it, I was waiting for the game to start, until after some time I realized that it already has.\n\nThe controls are also pretty bad. You can't reconfigure, so if you don't have an englisch keyboard layout, you may end up with a pretty weirt control scheme. I'm using a german keyboard, where x and z are exchanged, so playing with that means that I always have to cross over for shooting and jumping. This means that for faster gameplay it would be pretty impossible to play. Only way is to swith to an english keyboard layout.\n\nThe user interface in general is pretty badly done, so you don't have a clue with what objects you can interact and what is just decoration, especially since, most of the time you play with the keyboard, but sometimes there are menus where you have to switch to the mouse. The whole game is controlled with the cursor keys except the menus, which can be only controlled with the mouse, which is quite unintuite in this context, especially as there is no visual clue (again) that the cursor keys wont work here.\n\nGraphics and sounds are good, but as already mentioned, the graphics in particular is so heavily overloaded and colourfull that it's hard to discern your character.\n\nSo all in all, I can't really recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1448041848, "timestamp_updated": 1448041848, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528023", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19131294": {"recommendationid": "19131294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053549782", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436814524}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Scott se pudo aver hecho famoso por los FNAF pero este juego es una vasofia descomunal", "timestamp_created": 1447778254, "timestamp_updated": 1447778254, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415277", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19128968": {"recommendationid": "19128968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055783188", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447665993}, "language": "english", "review": "The controls were a bit wonky cause I'm more used to WASD for moving and mouse clicking for shooting. \n\nBut the art is pretty awesome, so far I like the games atmosphere though I'm not really far enough in to tell if I enjoy the story. \n\nStill...you play as a Coffee Pot and the game is free...what are you waiting for?", "timestamp_created": 1447767856, "timestamp_updated": 1447767856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19045757": {"recommendationid": "19045757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166802424", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447390033}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish there was an inbetweeen button to say 'maybe' I recommend this.  Rather than give you a giant wall of text like some reviewers, I'll try and sum it up as best I can:\n\nPros:\n-Gorgeous:  Some of the visuals are absolutely stunning.\n-Fantastic soundtrack:  Worth a listen in or out of game.\n-Charm:  You're a damn coffee pot, man.  A COFFEE POT.\n-Novelty: This game is a platformer with a unique story and JRPG boss batles.  Wha-?\n\nCons:\n-What the hell is this?: This game explains almost nothing. Most of the upgrades you can get have vague names that don't help you determine what they do or even what aspect of the game they help you with. I like games that don't hold your hand, but with the following problems (scroll down) this is almost intolerable.\n-GRINDY.  This is the worst part.  You must kill enemies in the platformer part of the game to collect colored eggs that help you in the JRPG battles.  Also, you must grind either in the simulations or in the terminals, going through the same enemies again and again in order to get bits for your VERY NECESSARY and OBTUSELY NAMED upgrades that you aren't even sure will help you because YOU CAN'T TELL WHAT THEY DO.\n\nTLDR: I found the game very charming at first with its visuals and good soundtrack...but the gameplay really brings it down.  If you find it enjoyable enough, however, there is enough there to keep you occupied for a while.  Your choice. Give it a shot and see for yourself.\n\nIt is free afterall, and I would probably not recommend it otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1447391816, "timestamp_updated": 1447391878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500087", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19005571": {"recommendationid": "19005571", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146088707", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447302625}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a must-play for people who like the RPG genre.

Hope, but is also going to shut up all the people who think that Scott Cawthon is a terrible game developer.\n\nBefore Five Nights at Freddy's, Five Nights 2, FNAF 3, and \"The Final Chapter\", there was a little splendid title called The Desolate Hope, made by everyone's favorite cryptic, Christian, 3DS Max and Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game dev, Scott Cawthon. ;)\n\nReferences aside, this is a game that everyone should play at least once in their gaming lives, and if not then maybe thrice; especially because this game is FREE! Additionally, if you know someone who hates Scott Cawthon just because of Five Nights at Freddy's, let them try out this indie gem to have them rethink themselves.\n\nGameplay.\nThe best part about this game is hands-down the gameplay. It actually combines three types of gameplay styles; top-view, Zelda-like shooting games; Mega Man style, non-linear platforming side-scrollers; and Turn-based RPGs with a unique blend. The RPG style is what I really want to talk most about. The first two gameplay styles are fairly self-explanatory (that is if you know what I'm saying), but Scott has added a very creative twist on turn-based RPG battles. Unlike traditional RPG battles, attacks come seemingly automatically, meaning that you need to react fast to initiate an action. It's a little hard to explain, but I'll try to proceed. Furthermore, there are nice little \"microgames\" that play during the battles which provide benefits to your party. I apologize for my poor explanantion, but its quite hard for me to put this into words.\n\nGraphics.\nI personally enjoy the visuals of this game, then again I also personally enjoy mashed potatoes with ketchup. The game's graphics use 3D images as 2D sprites, which in turn give it a strange feeling of playing a 3D game from the early 2000s, while in reality it actually isn't. Now this feeling, this is something that I like, as it practically tickles my spine with nostalgia. GG, Mr. Cawthon.\n\nMusic.\nWhile I'm under the impression that this game's music consists of royalty-free songs, they're still quite catchy and enjoyable.

Also, the game doesn't let you save your progress at will, and instead auto saves most actions and forces you to deal with failure. Yes, it does sound like Demon's Souls, and while there are no gameplay similarities, I felt it was worth mentioning how similar the atmosphere and pacing of the game was; the difficulty, too. Even if I didn't consciously acknowledge it at the time thanks to all the differences in gameplay, the atmosphere, pacing and structure of the game are basically identical to Demon's Souls, and that similarity really drew me in, and might draw you in. Anyways, the gameplay is unique, in that there are three sorts of gameplay (and small Zelda 1 dungeon style mini-dungeons); the solemn management and searching of the hub world night time management, when you enter a robot's simulated world, with the ruleset of a metroidvania shooter, and when you enter a boss battle, where you go into a turn-based RPG battle where accumulated, I guess I'd say, 'stat tokens' which you've picked up in the metroidvania gameplay add to the stats of all your characters during the fight. I have to say that the story, pacing, atmosphere and enigmatic nature of the game drew me in at the start, but I think that the game escalates the difficulty carelessly. You get some fast-paced challenging fights early on, but the game quickly makes literally every RPG battle consist entirely of one-shot attacks very quickly, ruining the chance to have a more sensible difficulty curve, and also making some boss fights simply too unforgiving.\nI would have liked this game, but the boss fights feel far too difficult. Seriously, it feels like you have to do things perfectly to win some of the mid-game and late-game fights, and it feels like the sort of design that is only intuitive to the developer.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I really, really wanted to love this game. The bleak atmosphere and story, the spectacular characterisations of the Derelicts (the robots), their virtual worlds, and their fall from grace, the surprisingly great, if odd and idiosyncratic presentation, set in a world where humans have already died out, the combination of several genres, the lack of hand holding, and the very compelling story. I just think that the game's too hard, and personally, I can't say whether I recommend this game or not. I think I recommend it, solely because I want a sequel to the game so badly; just, hopefully next time, the boss fights aren't so ridiculous, and the metroidvania areas slightly more distinguishable and less maze-like.", "timestamp_created": 1443509820, "timestamp_updated": 1443509820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538170", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18208563": {"recommendationid": "18208563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160350155", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443297602}, "language": "english", "review": "PLAY THIS GAME RN", "timestamp_created": 1443297846, "timestamp_updated": 1443297846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18191283": {"recommendationid": "18191283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116990158", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443291229}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[An\u00e1lisis is moving to intercept]....\n\nScott Cawthon es un desarrollador mayoritariamente conocido por crear la ya mundialmente famosa saga \"Five Nights at Freddy`s\" aunque es una saga excelente en muchos apartados, es triste que gente solo conozca a Scott por FNAF cuando ha creado juegazos como Desolate Hope, juego del que dar\u00e9 mi punto de vista ahora: \n[PROS]\n\n-Mezcla muchos generos y su jugabilidad es excelente: Tanto RPG como plataformero estilo Megaman, este juego dejar\u00e1 mas que satisfechos a los que amen cualquiera de estos g\u00e9neros anteriores, aunque si eres nuevo en los RPG no te recomendar\u00eda empezar por este juego, ya que las batallas son liosas al principio adem\u00e1s de que se complican con much\u00edsimas cosas apareciendo en pantalla, a\u00fan as\u00ed, es un juego muy entretenido, las batallas son divertidas cuando les coges el truco y no te aburrir\u00e1n. \n\n-Los escenarios son hermosos: Tanto los robots como los niveles son espectaculares y sorprende que un juego hecho por una \u00fanica persona tenga tanto detalle visual. El dise\u00f1o de los robots es extemadamente original  y ex\u00f3tico, todos se ven diferentes y \u00fanicos adem\u00e1s de ser extremadamente espectaculares y los escenarios podr\u00edan ser perfectamente usados como fondos de pantalla XD\n\n-Dif\u00edcil: Este juego es dif\u00edcil, las batallas son complejas y tendremos que aprendernos al pie de la letra las habilidades de nuestros robots, cada uno tiene un rol diferente en las batallas, y tendremos que lograr que trabajen en harmon\u00eda y sean todo lo efectivos posibles para ganar. En cuanto a los niveles 2D con nuestra cafetera coffe, muchas veces acabaremos perdidos en estos, y el hecho de tener un reloj contando el tiempo que nos queda para acabar con nuestro cometido a\u00f1ade tensi\u00f3n a el juego\n\n-Original: Este es uno de esos juegos raros en el buen sentido de la palabra, como ya dije antes, los robots son espectaculares y es genial como logra innovar en un g\u00e9nero ya tan usado como los RPG \n\n-La banda sonora: Soy consciente que no es Scott el compositor, y que toda la banda sonora es extra\u00edda de lugares externos, pero est\u00e1 tan bien seleccionada y funciona tan bien con la tem\u00e1tica rob\u00f3tica-futurista, que la primera vez en escucharla uno cree que ha sido creada expresamente para The Desolate Hope\n\n-Es gratis: Aunque yo ser\u00eda capaz de pagar voluntariamente por este juego, que se le va a hacer :/\n[CONTRAS]\n\nConfuso al principio: Este juego est\u00e1 completamente en ingl\u00e9s, si eres un paquete en ingl\u00e9s o solo entiendes lo b\u00e1sico como yo, te costar\u00e1 mucho entender todas las mec\u00e1nicas y tendr\u00e1s que empezar una nueva partida cuando ya lo entiendas todo, ya que este juego tiene un l\u00edmite de tiempo de unos 15 d\u00edas (no son d\u00edas reales, tiempo de juego) y cada uno que pase cuenta.\n\nColorines potentes: Las batallas de este juego son completamente locas, muchas cosas en pantalla y colores, aunque esto a m\u00ed no me importa, puede hechar atr\u00e1s a jugadores por esto. El propio juego tiene una advertencia al iniciar, prestadla atenci\u00f3n si ten\u00e9is alg\u00fan tipo de enfermedad que pueda interferir con esto.\n\nY las opciones?: El juego no tiene men\u00fa de opciones ._. Ni volumen, ni nada gr\u00e1fico, el juego no se puede poner en ventana y el volumen lo tienes que vajar con el mezclador de windows (o bajando directamente el volumen de tu PC) Y eso un defecto en el que los juegos de Scott suelen ca\u00e9r muchas veces.\n\n[CONCLUSI\u00d3N]\n\nEs un gran juego, y estando gratis en steam creo que todo el mundo que se haga llamar a si mismos \"gamers\" deber\u00edan por lo menos dignarse a probarlo, pese a sus numerables defectos, es un juego entretenido y bonito, me sorprende como juegos as\u00ed de buenos son pasados por tanta gente.

You play as a coffee machine named Coffee (or rather, a thing in the body of Coffee) in a space station named \"Lun Infinus\". You enter the rooms in it to find the \"Derelicts\" (giant robots). In the rooms of them you can also enter a simulation in which they are also present. Simulations are the 2D platformer sections of the game. Each simulation has different goals and upgrades you can buy from the robots.\n\n In some more hidden sections within these simulations are sub-simulations (a simulation within a simulation). Sub-simulations have wireframe graphics and work similarly to the original The Legend of Zelda (and look kinda like FNaF minigames). You and your rabbit (which only appears here, may I add) go from room to room until some monsters start appearing. Defeating a monster will make a cabbage patch appear which your rabbit then eats and you get some bits for it (bits are the currency of this game). There's also a place to buy upgrades here but I won't go too much into it. The main goal of sub-simulations is actually to unlock conditionals for battles.\n\nSpeaking of battles, they're probably the best part of the game! Within these JRPG-like battles, your creepy Derelicts fight against even creepier viruses. I won't go too much into getting to battles because I don't really want to spoil much. If you want to level up your derelicts for said battles, you'll need to go outside during the night phase when simulations are disabled and find some items they happen to collect.\n\n[b]CONCLUSION[/b]: C'mon, it's a free game, why are you still reading this?", "timestamp_created": 1439670146, "timestamp_updated": 1455292161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514759", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17540195": {"recommendationid": "17540195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166761676", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440878985}, "language": "english", "review": "saw this game by scott and saw that it was free and i was like, well in just gonna take that game i bet it could be fun!\n\n\n\n\nit was \n\n10/10 just as great as fnaf", "timestamp_created": 1439583166, "timestamp_updated": 1439583166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17536129": {"recommendationid": "17536129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091295851", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490480235}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "e divertido", "timestamp_created": 1439564459, "timestamp_updated": 1516297303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.968215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17535740": {"recommendationid": "17535740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119386277", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439558357}, "language": "german", "review": "Kostenloser Jump\u2019N\u2019Run Titel mit RPG Elementen\nPro:\n[list]\n[*]Die Gestaltung der Hintergr\u00fcnde und das Design der Charaktere sind wundersch\u00f6n und detailreich.

It looked interesting, so I said to myself \"eh, why not\" and downloaded it. I started playing it and was very pleasantly surprised. I expected a crappy little Mario rip off and got a cool little game with a witty attitude. I fell in love with the game in the first section of dialogue, to tell the truth. The gameplay itself is a bit wonky, but I've forgiven it for being so much fun. Anyway, after I had been playing for a little while, I loaded up the game and got another little surprise. This game was actually made by Scott Cathon, the same man who made the Five Nights at Freddy's series. This was the biggest surprise that I got because this game is extremely creative and takes little to no inspiration from popular opinion like the FNAF series does. For those of you who don't know what I mean by this, a TON of people are scared of anamatronics, so it only makes sense to make a horror game with them as the main antagonists. While this isn't a horror game, you can see some creepy-looking things in it. There's actually a simulation where you can see something that looks a bit like Freddy Fazbear in structure.* \nPROS AND CONS\nPros:\n-Very creative\n-Humorous\n-Witty\n-Interesting\n-Well-written\n-Lovable characters \n-Beautiful pseudo-3D environment \n-Interesting 3D design (there are 3D areas inside simulations)\n-Made by Scott Cawthon (if you like his work)\nCons:\n-Wonky control scheme\n-A bit confusing\n-A bit slow\n-Difficult\n-Made by Scott Cawthon (if you don't like his work)\nSo final verdicts? This game is AMAZING and would be worth a cheap price. However, it's free, so no one has an excuse - you NEED to play this amazing game. An honest 10/10 for this game.\n\n*This game was made before FNAF was even an idea, so I know it's not an Easter Egg, but it's still cool to see how his skills in modeling has developed", "timestamp_created": 1438440438, "timestamp_updated": 1438440438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17332974": {"recommendationid": "17332974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143546882", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438433551}, "language": "english", "review": "Five Nights at Freddy's, feel free to remove yourself from the spotlight.\n\nWelcome to The Desolate Hope. I've only played .8 hours at the time that I'm writing this, but from what I've played so far, this game is amazing. Its varied visuals allure the player into the many themes that this game has running through it. The simulation mechanics reminiscient of Inception fit perfectly into the game, allowing it to flow smoothly. The FNAF-like aspects of the game are just enough to make the player think about the game in a deeper sense, rather than making them feel like Scott just copy/pasted a bunch of stuff. The amount of these aspects also prohibits MatPat and nine year olds on reddit from getting in a big screamfest over how the two games exist in the same universe. Cause they don't. (Sorry MatPat, you're still awesome.) The story and diolouge of the game causes you to think, rather than just rushing through it. Also the soundtrack is so good, you might even play the game just for that. Which I don't recommend. Cause this game is awesome. And you play as a coffeepot. No other comment needed. I've encountered a few minor bugs, but nothing game-breaking. Other than that, I deeply recommend this game. \n10/10\n\nUpdate: Don't get me wrong, I still love fnaf.

Also this game is REALLY hard to get into due to a distinct absence of instructions, so be prepared to learn things the hard way.\n\nThis game is divided into four systems of gameplay. A megaman-style platformer where you manuever your character through a field of enemies that you shoot down with one button, a feverish JRPG with nineteen encounters which you'll probably redo several times as you learn how to fight, a simplistic dungeon crawler where you shoot wireframe enemies with beepy boopy bullets and get cash, and a walk across a serene, pitch-black landscape with a starry sky and a smoldering moon rising in the sky as you look for items to upgrade your party and extend the time you have to complete the game.\n\nOh, did I mention this game is fast?\n\nThe entire game took me eight hours of play, though I don't think I could have completed it without the extra time that was given due to finding power cells in the night. You have but a fortnight to complete your mission of purging the station of the virus that inhabits it. You play as an impromptu antivirus software controlling the body of the coffee machine who's AI awoke you from dormancy, and due to the fact that the act of running a game takes an ungodly number of commands and resources, you overwhelm the virus easily using digital representations of the four robots that act as supercomputers on the space station. The night is when you go out and search for gifts to give them, so that they give you more of their power during battle. Each robot, known as derelicts, has a unique set of skills in battle, and all of them are essential to your survival and success. This is where the main draw of the game comes in. During these short seventeen battles, you will need to use every skill that your team has to bolster your defenses and overwhelm the fuck out of your enemy until they crumble before your prowess. Combat encounters are modified by contingencies you obtain by completing the dungeon crawler segments; activating commands upon certain conditions in the battle being met such as stunning the enemy whenever points are scored in a minigame that each of the four derelicts can activate, or even having these minigames play themselves when they launch. During the megaman-ish platformer, defeated enemies drop powerups that will contribute stat bonuses during battle as a vital headstart. Pretty much everything you do outside of battle contributes to your party's performance, which is great, and it's actually quite hard to genuinely waste time unless you're idling, due ot the sheer number of upgrades you can find in each mode. Platformer mode is also how you buy upgrades, some of which will contribute to your performance in that mode, as well. These upgrades to your presence in this state are also simple, but I feel they're enough to make you feel like you're still getting somewhere, and getting stronger as you go.\n\nUnfortunately I can't think of a way to talk about the story without giving anything away. It's about a good number of things, pertaining to existencialism and spiritualism, the meaning and sanctity of life. Fortunately, despite the author being christian, I feel that he managed to make his viewpoint independent of religion, barring the ending. And the ending wasn't even bad, I feel it was a logical conclusion to everything that was building up, at the same time managing to still be surprising. Nobody is the villain here, because they all give you their own, valid reasons for how they're doing what they're doing.\n\nI know the way I described the story is vaugue, but if you can't play the game, you could easily find a transcript of what everyone says online.\n\n8/10 you play a coffee pot on an existencial journey through other robot's imaginations.", "timestamp_created": 1437057655, "timestamp_updated": 1437057655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17061610": {"recommendationid": "17061610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025065576", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436964907}, "language": "english", "review": "I am less than affluent (i.e. broke), therefore I will wait for anything and everything I want to play to go on sale.  Yes, even already cheap, obscure indie titles go on my wishlist until I see old man Steam is having one of his episodes and will trade me games for the unnamed contents of my pockets.  It also doesn't help that the obscure titles are less reliable in their overall ratings, so that I find myself owning games that give Steam refunds their raison d'etre.  \n\nThe Desolate Hope, however, is not one of these.  The Desolate Hope is a game that, after playing it, I felt guilty for not kicking a couple bucks to before it became free.  To wish I had paid money for a thing I got for free is easily the highest praise a cheap bastard like me can give.\n\nAlright, so what is The Desolate Hope?  Every time I try to explain its premise to someone, I come off sounding like a kid that's upended a forty of Pixy Stix.  So here goes:\n\nImagine that you are playing as Minesweeper.  No, not playing Minesweeper.  You are the computer program, Minesweeper.  You came preinstalled and have been idling in memory for someone to enjoy your frustrating trial-and-error gameplay.  Finally, you are activated; not by an eager player, but by a greater intelligence, the likes of which you can barely begin to circumscribe with your puny Minesweeper brain:  the AI for a robotic coffee pot.\n\nYour new coffee pot overlord has downloaded you into its body, while it oversees the vital functions of the space base you both occupy.  Your mission is to explore the base (long abandoned by humanity), gain the trust of several derelict robots that were once in charge of terraforming the planet, and seek out and eliminate a virus stealing data from the simulations they are running.  And you must do all of this before the station runs out of power in only a few days time.\n\nDuring the day, you will explore the Derelicts' dream worlds, the visualization of their efforts to build a home for humanity: their simulations.  At night, you will roam the barren wasteland of the forgotten planet the base rests on, looking for lost artifacts of humanity to offer up to the Derelicts so that they might offer their help to fight the virus.\n\nYou will face challenges that lesser coffee pots would buckle before and uncover the hidden secrets of the base, for all is not as it seems.  Also, there's a magic wrench and a spider named Sigfried.\n\nTruly, a tale as old as time.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is quite impressive. Though it does have that Sega CD/Saturn era pre-rendered style that looks kind of old and janky now, I hadn't realized that I do have some nostalgia for that. \n\nRegardless, the character models and environments in the simulations are very imaginative.  The Derelicts and viruses appear almost like something out of Aztec or Hindu mythology; towering over their private realms that are certainly science fiction, but have a magical feel about them.  But it wasn't until I was walking on the planet's surface as a tiny, lone silhouette against the void of space that it really hit me what a beautiful game this is.\n\nOf course, you want to talk gameplay.  Like the premise, it's hard to describe the gameplay without sounding like I'm vomiting up the product of a the orgy between a big pile of ideas (eww).  I have a feeling the game design document reads something like this:\n\n\"Yo dawg, I heard you like video games.  So we put some video games in your video game so you can play video games while you game.\"\n\nOutside the simulations, the game is at its most reserved.  Your coffee pot body is exceptional in that it can move around.  But that's all.  At this level, the game is an adventure game where you explore and collect items... and play Space Invaders at certain times, but that's neither here nor there.\n\nInside of the simulations, you are playing a free-roaming platformer where you can jump and shoot energy blasts and other such feats of percolation heretofore unknown to coffee pots.  You can dive into sub-simulations where the game becomes a top down vector-based shooter where you kill enemies to gain cabbages.  Makes sense? What if I told you a vector rabbit follows you around and translates them into free memory you can use to upgrade yourself?\n\nWhen you locate the virus, the screen swirls into a disco wonderland and the game becomes real-time JRPG style  combat where you control the four Derelicts against the virus.  And if that wasn't enough, we can go one deeper.  Within the real-time JRPG combats, one of the best moves for each Derelict is to call up a mini-game (each of the four gets a different one and you can have them all running simultaneously) that you can play to get buffs.\n\nSome would say that sounds schizophrenic.  Normally, I'd agree, but the Deolate Hope manages to take these disparate gameplay styles and use them to inform, further, and juxtapose the others.  It creates complexity, where I would label something else randomness.\n\nYour lonely sojourns on the planet's surface are quiet, somber, and low on action.  It gives the player a break from the intensity of the platforming and RPG combat while also giving us a stark \"real\" world to stand against the fantastic dreamscapes of the Derelicts and the psychedelic fury of the RPG segments.  And \"leveling-up\" the Derelicts is a matter of earning their trust so they will dedicate more system resources to your task.\n\nGathering free memory in the sub-simulations will allow you to purchase upgrades from vendors you find by exploring the main simulations.   And these upgrades and other power-ups you find are your ticket to success in the menu-driven battles against the virus.  You will need to gather every resource and have a full understanding of all systems to have any hope of success when suing the 1% - err, defeating the late game bosses\n\nUnlike some computer RPGs where combat is a placeholder for action until the boss fights, The Desolate Hope's RPG combat is fixture of strategy and challenge.  You will need to master buffs, debuffs, status effects, running mini-games, storing points, using hack items, and a slew of other systems before taking on the later bosses.\n\nIn fact, this is one of the few complaints I have.  I do love that I'm being challenged, when other titles in the genre often don't.  However, there is so much going on in these RPG segments that are the center pieces of the game and no explanation to guide you through them.  It becomes overwhelming.  I felt like an outsider taking a journey to the depths of superhero fandom message boards: just one incomprehensible wall of text describing powers and systems and the interconnectedness of it all that made me want to back out slowly and cry.\n\nHere's a tip: you won't figure it out for yourself.  Go get a guide.  There's a lovely one in the Steam Community pages.\n\nMy only other criticism is that the game is badly lacking in polish.  It's clear that this is Scott Cawthon's early work and there are some things missing that I expect in a paid release.  The game doesn't adjust itself to suit my native resolation, but rather resets my resolution to make itself fullscreen.  And there's no volume control or pause button.  Pressing escape just instantly closes the entire game.  You get the idea.\n\nStill, I obviously really like The Desolate Hope and would have been almost as enthusiastic if I had paid.  There's nothing game-breaking missing, though it would have been nice to see this one get just a little bit more love before being published.\n\nUltimately, The Desolate Hope is unique, compelling, fun, and free.  So why aren't you playing it?\n\nP.S. If you know or are Scott Cawthon, please tell him I will play Five Nights at Freddy's even though I don't like resource management or jump scares.  But I would like him to make another big sci-fi clusterfuck of whimsical ideas and gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1436973922, "timestamp_updated": 1449858066, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17035905": {"recommendationid": "17035905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094495769", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421459530}, "language": "english", "review": "is good", "timestamp_created": 1436832635, "timestamp_updated": 1436832635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16975824": {"recommendationid": "16975824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076732324", "num_games_owned": 727, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436541052}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Surreal but nice.", "timestamp_created": 1436537798, "timestamp_updated": 1436537798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501354", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16970637": {"recommendationid": "16970637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046670896", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496766853}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful artstyle + amazing RPG style boss battles + IT'S FREE", "timestamp_created": 1436508384, "timestamp_updated": 1436508384, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544109", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16944899": {"recommendationid": "16944899", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079402618", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436380105}, "language": "english", "review": "could you improve the controls", "timestamp_created": 1436373814, "timestamp_updated": 1436373814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16921946": {"recommendationid": "16921946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092071583", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421035905}, "language": "english", "review": "People told me it was good\nI was sorely dissapointed\nIt's good for having come out in like 1777 or something\njk\nThe maps were made by a monkey\nBoss fights sweet as sweet though", "timestamp_created": 1436252354, "timestamp_updated": 1436252354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16921328": {"recommendationid": "16921328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999540413", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446930710}, "language": "english", "review": "What do I do after I beat it? when I come back, the virus thing in Amos' room.\n\nother from that, This is the best RPG, Platformer Adventure game ever made yet.\nDespite Freddy Fazbear's horror fanbase, I would prefer this game more.", "timestamp_created": 1436247626, "timestamp_updated": 1436247626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16910903": {"recommendationid": "16910903", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968540004", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436214247}, "language": "english", "review": "I was going to buy this game 2 days ago and its free now for some reason.

While nowadays we know Scott Cawthon as the man behind the smash-hit, near pop-culture, Five Nights At Freddy's series one of his first releases was The Desolate Hope.\n\nThe Desolate Hope is a multi-genre game about a space station with only artificial intelligences around. The station was originally planned to house humans but there was never any contact made to say the humans were coming. Years after the expedition was supposed to happen a lone coffee pot robot is in charge of eliminating a virus thats attacking the remaning robots.\n\nTDH is a very extreme game, some things are very good and some things are very bad. The platforming sequences are (for the most part) rather bland and unengaging, the only exciting level would be Betagrid 0.9 but even it suffers from some poor design. Miradmoore is the absolute bottom of the barrel however, being an underwater stage with extremely slow movedment and exploration. This is made worse by the game's world timer, making it very easy to be booted from Miradmoore before you finish what you set out to do. The dungeon crawling segements fare no better, being extremely basic, rather unenjoyable or worthwhile, and feel more like just time wastes.\n\nIn contrast, the JRPG boss battles soar high above the other gameplay faults. The combat system in the JRPG segments is extremely innovate as it contextualizes the use of keyboard and mouse, not only that but it's frantic and fast paced with some of the game's very best music.\n\nThe real king of the game is the graphical presentation, Scott Cawthon has a unique, if not signature, design to his games and its originality is breathtaking. Even the most basic of worthless enemies have such a flair of animation that it comes off as a wholely different type of video game experience. Sadly there are some graphical misteps along the way.\n\nThe Desolate Hope does not get everything right. It's story could use a little more fleshing out, perhaps a bit more explination of some of the item shops, and maybe a bit better design of some gameplay segments. But when the game is good the game is golden, shining far past it's sometimes below-average moments and offering a very memorable experience.\n\nPros:\n- Some of the most wonderful graphics you'll see\n- JRPG battles are innovative and amazing\n- Fun cast of characters with a pretty good story attached\n- Otherworldly atmosphere\n\nCons:\n- Platforming and Dungeon Crawling segments are below average\n- Some graphical missteps along the way\n- Occasional poor level design\n- Can be quite a sporadic game at times, your milage may vary\n\nFor a more in-depth look at The Desolate Hope, please watch my video review linked above.\n\n- Mr. u Suk", "timestamp_created": 1436118525, "timestamp_updated": 1436118525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529148", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16863809": {"recommendationid": "16863809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074936171", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432158267}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting, quirky little game that combines aspects from a few different genres.

While clunky at times, it feels refreshingly creative despite doing little new. \n\nNormal levels play out like a simple sidescrolling platformer where you collect resources and unlock & upgrade abilities. Every map has one boss that you have to beat four times; although it sounds tedious, they mix things up by moving the boss entrance around the map and drastically increasing the difficulty of boss tiers (which essentially forcing you to play through other levels and then backtrack). This helps breaks up the flow and promotes exploration, instead of just steamrolling through the maps one at a time. \n\nThe bosses that you are preparing for during the platforming segments are the crux of the gameplay; it is really refreshing to look forward to a boss battle in a western game. These play out like JRPG battles, with your party of AIs on the right throwing their \"spells\" at the boss on the left. It took me a while to get used to it because its very fast and click-happy, with bosses often acting faster than your whole party can. Eventually the combat gets so fast that you have to use special abilities to automate certain functions (trying to avoid spoilers here!). Herein lies my biggest complaint because once the combat gets truly challenging and gives you all your tools & toys, the game just plays itself. \n\nWhile I really enjoyed this game, I don't see it getting a sequel anytime soon considering how it ends.

The atmosphere is just stunning, it take you a minute to admire the beautiful atmosphere, a few times I stopped and looked at the art style. The combat system is very unique, a bit confusing at first but you get the hang of it after a few tries and the combat music is so much fun to listen!\n\nHowever this game does have its fair share of problems, however none of them are game breaking. The gameplay may get repetitive, collecting chips at night and finding viruses during the day. Walking is very slow and their is no option to sprint or run a bit faster. There is a lack of tutorials to introduce you to the mechanics, which can leave you wondering for quite a while and asking yourself what on earth you have to do next.\n\nBut, this game is a gem of a game and I congratulate Scott Cawthon for making such a beautiful indie game very different to his widely successful FNAF series, and hopefully this game may be given so more love, care and attention and we get a series just like FNAF fans are getting right now.\n\nThe only thing I am sad to say is that although this game is very good, it is a lost gem piled from Scott Cawthon's other successful game series, which is a real shame :(\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

In The Desolate Hope, you are a computer program originally designed to run video games. Coffee, a walking, sentient coffee maker, activates you and explains that you are to take over his body and use it to fight off a virus that is attacking the simulations maintained by the other robots of Lun Infinus. Coffee would do so itself, but it's far too busy maintaining things and flagging the viruses for you. And with that, you're off on a very unique adventure.\n\nThere are four working robots running simulations on Lun Infinus, and you will have to enter each one and defeat four viruses within. Do not be afraid. They may look intimidating and even dangerous as you enter their respective chambers, but they're all on your side, and they're all quite friendly. Their simulations, on the other hand, have gotten a little... weird. Originally sent out into space to run these simulations for five years, they've now gone thirty years without contact.\n\nThe gameplay is rather varied. Although much of your time will be spent wandering and shooting. In reality, Coffee's body can't do much more than walk around and pick stuff up. You'll use the real world to walk between the robots' chambers and collect knick-knacks to give to the A.I.s within. Inside of the simulations, the game plays out as a sidescrolling jump-'n'-shoot game. You'll shoot enemies, find secrets, collect eggs which will help you against the virus boss fights, talk to things, and hunt for the viruses. You can find computer screens which will dump you into some sort of sub-simulation, an overhead wander-'n'-shoot game. Here you can collect resource chips (The Desolate Hope's currency) and destroy the rift-looking whatsit that's hidden away in one of the rooms to unlock a new conditional for later. Then you have the virus fights.\n\nThe fights against the viruses are where the game really shines. These are flashy, fast-paced RPG battles. They are turn based, but with an active time system (think PlayStation-era Final Fantasy). Your party consists of the four A.I.s that you've been helping, each of whom has a unique set of skills. Every time one of their menus pops up, you can use one of these skills, or charge. What skills you have access to depends on that A.I.'s level of charge, and keeping them charged is an important part of the fight. The viruses get tougher as you go, and you'll need more tricks up your sleeve to see this game through.\n\nThe A.I.s don't level up with experience. Instead, each trinket you bring back from your nightly expeditions outside will convince one to devote more of its resources to your cause, which is represented by the A.I. leveling up. You can purchase a variety of useful abilities from various robots within the simulations. And then you have those conditionals I mentioned. You can set one of a number of useful actions (healing, for instance) to occur when certain other events (like opening a mini game or getting a combo) occur within battles. The catch is, while you have the entire list of \"then\"s from the get-go, you have to find and unlock the \"if\"s yourself.\n\nSo, let's talk quality. The review part of the review.\n\nThe art in this game is really weird, but in a good way. You can tell it was created by the same guy who did 5 Nights at Freddy's. It's the way things are modeled and some of the textures, and it's also some of the weirdness and the robots. There's a giant robot in the background of one of the simulations that reminds me an awful lot of Freddy Fazbear. The way Coffee walks down the hallway of Lun Infinus seems like it probably directly inspired the shot of Foxy hauling ass down the hallway in the first 5NaF. The simulations all have different looks and feels to them. The sub-simulations look completely different from anything else, and the virus battles are flashy and remind me a bit of anime, only without the... y'know, anime. Even wandering outside at night is lovely and mysterious.\n\nA major contributing factor to that lovely mysteriousness is the gorgeous music. I can't give Scott credit with creating it, as he says he bought it all through a website called NEO Sounds. But I can absolutely credit Scott with taking the care and effort to find, purchase, and use the perfect tracks to complement each scene. I have no complaints about the music.\n\nThe story is one that kept me paying attention. The core plot isn't [i]overly[/i] complex, but it's presented well and supplemented with backstory and information about the world and A.I.s. As with everything else in this game, the story's got that air of mystery that draws you in.\n\nAs for the gameplay, I like it. The jump and shoot sections aren't exactly Mega Man, but they're not boring and they offer exploration and an engaging way to get from point A to point B. The overhead sections are neat if you're just trying to find the rift thing and destroy it, but if you wind up grinding for resource chips the game becomes pretty boring. Good news is, you don't [i]have[/i] to grind. Bad news is, intentionally or not, you're kind of encouraged to. See, the entire game operates on this day/night cycle, and the days and nights go by pretty darn quickly and you only have so many of them. You have plenty of ways to get resource chips as you go about your ordinary business, but the overhead sections are the only place where time doesn't pass (other than dialogue windows, I believe). Add to this the fact that you can buy the ability to earn resource chips even faster in these sections, and you'll probably decide it's easier to just grind for awhile rather than waste time.\n\nThis brings me to the time limit itself. It does add an element of pressure to the game, which is nice. But you'll need to figure things out for yourself, you'll have no idea what order to fight which viruses in, and if you're like me, you might waste a couple days trying to explore simulations which are open to you, but which you can't actually do much in until you have the right items. That said, even if you do wander aimlessly for awhile, you will probably eventually hit a stride where you can take out two or three viruses a day, making up for lost time. I still wound up completing the game like six-ish days ahead of schedule. And I hear you can find items outside which will grant you extra days, once you start cutting it close.\n\nAs I said before, though, the active RPG virus boss battles are where the game truly shines, and they'll be what you're striving for. Not the shooty bits, but the flashy, fast paced (the RPG battles are actually faster paced than the shooting sections, can you believe it?), try-to-even-begin-to-keep-track-of-all-this-shit-at-once-lol sections.\n\nWith the sort of creepy but mostly cool art, the fitting audio, and the sweet battles, I recommend The Desolate Hope. I don't know if it's free forever, but it seems like it probably is.

The first boss battle had me raging because the boss just spams attacks rather than takes turns attacking, while at the same time you have to attack back with abilities you can't study up on beforehand. This gives you no chance to figure out a strategy, instead you just have to take a shot in the dark until you figure something out.\n\nYou also have a charge meter to determine when you can attack, and a power bar indicating what attacks you can use.  Also the four colored eggs raise your Attack, Defense, Health, and Speed by an amount based on how full the bar is, VERY helpful during the boss battles.\n\nThe boss has a large charge meter which can be interrupted throughout the battle to prevent major abilities from being used against you, and they are not fun to endure...\n\nAll in all, this is a very well made, very unique game bringing two very different gaming elements together into one very strange, very addictive game.\n\n10/10 in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1430370079, "timestamp_updated": 1430370079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15616861": {"recommendationid": "15616861", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047510250", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433740137}, "language": "english", "review": "obvious rip off of binding of isaac. 0/10", "timestamp_created": 1430350269, "timestamp_updated": 1430350269, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.113469", "comment_count": "25", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15616659": {"recommendationid": "15616659", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182836366", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430348602}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Really good game from the mastermind of FNAF, I like the unique combat system, not sure if there's other RPG games with that combat, The dificulty is really hard bur fair at the same time, Worth to play if you're interested in Scott's Games", "timestamp_created": 1430348638, "timestamp_updated": 1430348638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467480", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15616244": {"recommendationid": "15616244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102988823", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438960184}, "language": "english", "review": "This Game.\nThis Game.\nI love this game, while your FNaF series was an amazing set, The Desolate Hope has remained in my heart as one of the most unnoticed awesome platformers of all time, and here we really get to see your talents in animation and design.\nunlike your FNaF animatronics, these robots look awesome, probably the best i've from you.\nOnce your done with FNaF, return to Desolate Hope.\nas for you, the reader, download this game, and if you played old 80's to 90's classics like Metroid, or Megaman, you will love this game.", "timestamp_created": 1430345482, "timestamp_updated": 1430345482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15608469": {"recommendationid": "15608469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079348553", "num_games_owned": 707, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430304366}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "It didn't work...", "timestamp_created": 1430304457, "timestamp_updated": 1430304457, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.436797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15605499": {"recommendationid": "15605499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113393997", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437809847}, "language": "english", "review": "I kept being reset but I still managed to beat the game anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1430277105, "timestamp_updated": 1430277105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15602807": {"recommendationid": "15602807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022107690", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492282101}, "language": "english", "review": "I get to fight giant demon virus-like monsters with a 4 man squad of giant robots, in a techno-dance crazy RPG/platformer hybrid where I'm assaulted by beautiful scenery, amazing monster design, and a soundtrack that's pretty badass in all respects.

You play as an AI from a video game system being repurposed for exterminating digital viruses, and you have a physical body on loan from a space station's coffee machine. The stated goal is to purge the viruses springing up in the simulations some of the robots on the planetary outpost/station which other AIs before you have generally failed. To do so, you need to work on numerous layers of your surroundings. As fair warning, this game really doesn't hold your hand, but does give you some room to experiment and learn what it is exactly that you need to do and how.\n\nAs for genre, it's pretty hard to classify this as any single genre as it's a mashup of several, while not feeling particularly broken. There's meatspace (physical space, rather), where it's closest to an adventure title similar to King's Quest, in that you have direct control over a character with limited actions rather than click and point like, say, Monkey Island 1-3. In simulations, it's more of a platformer/shooter, to sum it up. When you get into the source code segments (I don't recall the exact explanation to what these are, though I'm sure the game mentions it somewhere early on) it's more adventure/shooter like the original Legend of Zelda. And when you fight bosses, it's sort of an Active Time Battle RPG but also upwards of 5 or 6 games going on at once, and this is where the game may be completely overwhelming while also being an amazing spectacle. \n\nIt's almost beyond words to describe boss fights, I suppose the closest is what 80s movies predicted games in the 90's to be like? Either way, very unique, in a positive way. Character designs are also wonderful and range from beauty in simplicity to visually overwhelming and I love them all, honestly. The audio is pleasant and mostly appropriate for each area and segment, the game also does a great job of setting up just how grim the situation is without explicitly stating it.\n\nFor criticisms, the game has pacing issues similar to a roller coaster, slow build up before going extremely fast until the bottom of the next hill. As for graphics, very subjective to whether folks will like them, I find em charming personally, but some may not enjoy the mid 90's-style pre-rendered sprites and animations akin to Donkey Kong Country. Difficulty for each part of game is also VERY drastically different, which can cause a little bit of whiplash. I apologize in advance if there is a manual that explains everything somewhere, but there's parts of the game and characters that feel as though there's probably context given in something extraneously, such as in a manual with a little blurb about the character and maybe backstory, but there's quite a few NPCs who seem to just be there with the only context being \"Hey, this NPC performs function X or sells Y or sells Z for a small fortune.\"\n\nOverall, it's a rather unique experience and I'd suggest folks give it a fair shake.

You're good at what you do and you have an enormous fan-following. But I think I'm gonna step aside for a sec and admire Scott's lesser appreciated work, and a game which has quickly become one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nSadly, I cannot remember if I came across this game by browsing \"Games under \u00a34\" or if I only heard about it through Five Nights at Freddy's. But I'm so glad I found this game either way.\n\nSo what's the thingy happening, then? Well, you play as the re-programmed CPU of a video game controlling the body of a feisty coffee-pot with legs. You're stranded in a space station an unknown distance from Earth with 4 (once 5) super-computer robots who are trying to find a way to perfectly colonize distant planets for humans. Viruses are starting to take their toll on the simulations and the space station is on it's last shred of power, so it's up to you (and the AI of the coffee-pot) to gather as much resources as you can to take out the viruses before they ruin the mission.\nJust like FNaF, this is a really original concept.\n\nThe gameplay is broken up into several segments, all being from different genres of games, and you're constantly under a time limit; something you don't see in a lot of games. It's very reminiscent of Majora's Mask, in a way. This kind of gameplay mechanic would work in so many games which ignore it, like all the games where a big event is about to happen, but you could do a lap of the world before it even begins.\n\nSome may argue that the gameplay gets very repetitive after a short while, and I'll admit there are a few places that get rather tedious, but fortunately it's much more engaging than FNaF. Also, just like FNaF, it's feels amazing to beat the game because of how much work goes into it.\n\nAnd as for Scott's signature art-style, this game is [b]gorgeous![/b] Scott captures the creativity, the vision and the desires of the Derelicts perfectly in their simulations. And as for the space station and surrounding area, it's awe-inspiring how lonely it feels. Don't even get me started on how good the soundtrack is.\n\nYou get all this, and a ton of depth and story, for just \u00a33.99. It's a longer game than the Freddy Trilogy as a whole, and it's perfect for what it's trying to acomplish. I just finished this game clocking in 7 hours of gameplay and I can't wait to play it again.

You, the game program turned hero then put into a coffee machine (coffee still included) are on a mission to defeat a virus that's been wreaking havoc on a space base populated by 4 giant robots called Derelicts so that they can continue their mission to create a habitat for humanity. You enter into virtual worlds constructed by the Derelicts, root out the virus, and then delete it. You have 2 weeks to do so. Broken into three parts, The Desolate Hope's main draw is the RPG battle segments and Scott's signature \"shitty 90's CGI\" look that you'll love or hate. I love it.  The other parts of the game, a platformer and top down shooter, sadly lack the energy or even entertainment of the the battles. They're honestly kind of boring, but are necessary since Battles (They're such a large event in the game that they deserve a capital B) don't give EXP or money. The platforming is slow, isn't particularly challenging, and occurs within small, separate maze-like areas where you travel around and gain upgrades that let you explore further. The different areas are designed differently enough, such as one area being almost entirely vertical, which helps makes exploring a bit less tedious. The top-down shooter is accessed within the platformer, and is used almost exclusively for farming money which is used to purchase upgrades for the RPG segments. There's honestly not much to say about these segments, they're average at best and tedious at worst. The game follows a routine: platforming segment, talk to an NPC in the area, then go find the boss and engage in Battle. This allows the player to fight them whenever they want. Players confident in their ability can jump right in and fight, while others can grind a bit first. \n\n          However, it's such a wholly unique experience once you're playing the Battles that it's worth playing the game for them. Shit's flying everywhere, there's a racing minigame in the corner and it's making little squares appear, the music is remarkably unlike anything heard for an RPG about giant robots beating up another giant robot, numbers are popping out of everything, and the enemy just turned into a spring-y toy, only to come back and kill everything with a vaguely defined laser light show with names such as \"Intense Intensity\". I want to get into the game mechanics more but I feel that the Battles are best when you discover everything on your own, with the confusion you feel mimicking your character's as they slowly figure out how to  utilize the power of the Derelicts, who you control in Battle. The Battle system feels like the (il)logical conclusion to the Active Time Battle system, which is an RPG system where players take their turns, but only when their Turn bar has filled. You need to move as quickly as possible, make snap decisions, and deal with everything the boss can throw at you. It's the most active a player has ever needed to be during a turn based RPG, and it's just incredible at that moment when the entire battle system clicks into place and then you're that guy from The Matrix reading those green screens of gibberish. TDH follows after Shadows of the Colossus and as such the only enemy you'll ever face in a Battle are bosses, which is a double edged sword. It makes every Battle weigh more, since they're so limited, but they're also really fun so you want to keep playing them. If you needed a visual representation of how great the Battles are, this paragraph dedicated to them is more than 50% of this review.\n\nOh yeah there's also night-time segments since the game actually runs on a day-night cycle. Anything I've described up until now can only be done during the day. At night, all you can do is play a training machine for mock Battles, and walk to the left and pick up various items that are extremely useful and play the occasional Space Invaders clone. What the fuck\n\nGame clocks in at around 9-10 hours, possibly more or less depending on your completion. It's short, a wholly unique experience, and only 5 bucks.

A somber tune plays. I'm looking for items. No platforming in this area. Just left and right to move and down to interact with a sparkle on the ground. Suddenly, the game turns into space invaders. Green aliens appear above me and the game prompts me to press \"x\" to shoot them down. Why? Why here? I don't know. It just happens randomly. I feel like this scenario sums up my experience with The Desolate Hope fairly well. \n\nThe items I'm searching for are given to other robots. Our cause is to destroy a virus that plagues our space station. These robots are extremely intelligent and were designed to simulate human life on this unnamed planet. It makes sense that they each robot fondly collects particular human items given their mission. One hoards clocks, another stashes paintings. They \"devote more of their resources to the cause\" the more you give them objects they like -- in other words, they level up. \n\nI like games that bewilder me. I like games that are surreal. Why am I a coffeemaker? I don't know why I'm a coffeemaker. With a full coffee pot, at that. Coffee sloshes around in your pot with each step you take. You'd think such a fragile thing would make a poor protagonist in the platformer parts of the game, what with enemies shooting at you, but I guess it's made of reinforced glass. \n\nThere's platforming, RPG battles, and more. Take the ATB system from Final Fantasy games and inject it with steroids. That's exactly what you get during the RPG virus battles. They're probably the most frantic, explosive turn-based battles I've ever played. It's hard to really grasp what's going on at times, but I found myself doing well enough to win most of the time. The game isn't harsh if you fail; it simply kicks you out of the simulation you were battling in.\n\nThe game is somewhat dragged down by the lack of an options menu, long loading times, and choppy gameplay during the RPG bits of the game. The thing that I find most baffling is that the escape key exits the game completely. It's such a standard way to pause computer games that I accidently exited out of the game twice. As far as I can tell, there's no way to pause the game.\n\nDo the game's wildly disparate gameplay types coalesce well? Probably not. But I think the \"throw things at a wall and see what sticks\" approach works for this particular game. I definitely recommend the game if you want something unique and with good character and environmental design.

I only know of The Desolate Hope because of Cawthon's work, Five Nights At Freddy's. I didn't care for that, but I'm sincerely glad that it was made just so I was able to play this fantastic but flawed game.\n\nFlawed is even an understatement, it doesn't have a shortage of problems. The gameplay is split into 4 sections and 3 of them are boring to actively horrible. The levels are short and it takes only a few hours to explore them thoroughly. The game's progression is about grinding for currency to purchase every upgrade in the game - and every upgrade is needed.\n\nGameplay sections in this game are neatly split into the following:\n\n\u2022 A ATB (Active Time Battle, think Final Fantasy VII) system used to combat a total of 17 enemies (18 if you count the training dummy)\n\u2022 Platforming levels used to navigate each Derelict's simulation and gain access to each of the battles, as well as purchase items from vendors hidden and not\n\u2022 Overhead battle arenas that are also hidden in the platforming levels to various degrees, but no less vital\n\u2022 A mandatory side-scrolling collection minigame in order to level-up your party members\n\nComing to grips with each section requires experimentation and exploration. Unfortunately the game's own (largely forgiving but still present) time limit works against this, but without experimenting and trying new things constantly you can find yourself going around in circles unable to do jack squat.\n\nThe ATB sections naturally steal the show, despite their relatively small amount of gametime compared to the other sections. There's a fantastic amount of depth, even taken on its own merit -  the buff/debuff based strategy means blitzing your way through the battles just isn't an option, and experimentation is forced to the point where I was coming up with cascading choices the likes of which I hadn't seen since Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey. \n\nConstant meter management lends the pressure needed to keep things hype, and the pacing between battles is ramped up perfectly - with the final boss requiring a ridiculous amount of strategy that incorporates everything that you've learned so far (and then some, it's a right bastard). Despite the game giving you every skill from the get-go, the pacing manages to thrive in spite of that, an impressive feat. The combat is just fantastically-designed overall. \n\nThe rest of the gameplay is boring. Even actively bad at points. \n\nPlatforming sections are simple scrolling events. There's no difficult or demanding platforming, no interesting or particularly varied enemy types, the movement itself feels slow and clunky with minimal animations and stop-n-go momentum. Even the upgrades that affect the platforming just alter it so you spend as little time as possible there.\n\nOverhead battle arenas are even worse. There's 3 enemy types, no interesting formations, and the mechanics themselves are horrible. More so if you don't find the hidden vendor. You shoot in the direction you're facing and move at the speed of a snail - it's not twinstick, it's not shmup, and it's not fun.\n\nFinally there's the collection minigame which isn't anything. Moving in the one direction and collecting token items.\n\nIt's difficult to recommend this game because for most of it, you'll be slogging through one of those 3 terrible gameplay modes.

With no warning, the probe cargo changed from research supplies to clocks, toys, paintings, snowglobes and other sentimental junk, they started crashing into the planet instead of landing at the base....then they stopped coming altogether. \n\nIt has been thirty years since the last probe came.

Simulations in which the goal is to destroy a the virus,during the night phase the primary objective is to scavenge resorces out side the base on an alein world wich is indicative of leveling up your four robots to better combat the virus (Boss).This game gives you quite a bit of purpuse while at the same time personifying an atmosphire of hopelessness, if your not combating a virus your or saving your bytes (currancy)to buy some of the many upgrades your playing one of the sub games to unlock bonuses when you go after one of the five Bosses and keep an eye on that time meter its almost scavenging time, you are unabe to go into a simulation during the night phase and are unabel to go out to scavenge during the day phase which gives this game a whole other faceit making it feeling like a two differnt games, hey I dont know what a Giant simulation running robot wants with a snow globe but if he allocates more of his prosseing power and resorces to me (him leveling up) then more power to us, it's also a good idea to scavege power cells as your base runs on a power resivior and each day drains a power cell (After passing the tenth day, a few number of power cells can be found outside)I never found out what happens when you run out of power(came close though went down to 3 days of power left) but I can't help but feel somwhat sure thats when you lose and seeing as this game constanly saves there most likly wont be any \"loading up the save\" agin.\n\nThe only thing I feel the game could have used was a mini map.\n\nIn conclusion I give The Desolate Hope five Cyborg implants out of five (5/5) Fun gameplay, Awsome story ,Amazing Charactors and a strange well suited ending that brings it all together.", "timestamp_created": 1418851104, "timestamp_updated": 1418851104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13309920": {"recommendationid": "13309920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008620740", "num_games_owned": 1990, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418244141}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an interesting game.

Best way to describeThe Desolate Hope is Megaman/Metroid meets the timed battle system you would find in a JRPG, complete with nice looking pre-rendered backgrounds and characters. Bought the game after seeing it was on sale. Needless to say, it was worth the $1.24 spent on it.\n\n Most of the time, you'll be controlling an autonomous coffee-pot, entering the simulations of AI's in the day, and the surface of a planet at night. Within the simulations, the gameplay centers on the likes similar to Metroid and Megaman, jumping over pits and shooting bad guys. When it comes to fighting bosses however, control switches to the four AI's, switching perspective towards that of a JRPG like Final Fantasy VII. Combat as the AI's at first will seem a bit intimidating at first but once you understand each moves the AI's have, you can try to steer the odds to your end, so as long as you pick the right skills. Levelling up the AI's is also rather simple as the night segments as the coffee pot lets you find certain items to give to the AI's, allowing them to level up as opposed to the grinding you'd find in other RPG's. \n\nThough Scott Cawthon's fame may lie with Five Nights at Freddys, The Desolate Hope is another gem of Cawthon's work, one that is good mixture a platforming, turn-based fights, and artistic design.\n\ntl;dr The Desolate Hope is a gem from Cawthon like FNAF, but instead of evil animatronics, it's platforming, turn-based fights like FFVII, and nice pre-rendered scenery.", "timestamp_created": 1416724345, "timestamp_updated": 1416724345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13009781": {"recommendationid": "13009781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025225344", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416603808}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 presentation\n9/10 music\n3/10 plataforming & dungeon crawling\n10/10 boss battles\n10/10 mechanics depth\npretentious/10 ending", "timestamp_created": 1416433860, "timestamp_updated": 1416433860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575699", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12993797": {"recommendationid": "12993797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106999924", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 624, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475237151}, "language": "english", "review": "For such an addictive and unique game, I fail to see the reason why I should not recommend this to other people, especially for other RPGers looking to taste a new \"flare\" from the genre.\n\nPros:\n-The combat system is unique and enjoyably fast-paced.\n-Memorable characters, riding within a very compelling story.\n-An atmosphere that isn't exactly \"spectacular\", but the vibe it gives off just makes you stop and think: \"Woah, this looks pretty obscure. (In a good way)\"\n\nCons:\n-Gameplay may get repetitive, especially since a huge portion of it is basically a collectathon.\n-A part of the game's world has your character walking really slow. (While this issue isn't necessarily bothersome to all, it *may* drain your interest as the game progresses)\n-Lack of tutorials and intros for the mechanics which will lead you to experiment, not in a fun way. (According to a comment on this review, there's a manual in the game directory, but who reads a manual before playing a game anymore anyways?)\n\nThe Desolate Hope isn't perfect, the game may \"lag\" and/or freeze in a millisecond (I don't know if it's my PC, but I've tried it on another PC and it still has that issue). Other than the lag, the game is basically a work of art; eerie, different, and reminiscent of \"computer personality\" sci-fi tropes.\n\nThe game is also a \"hybrid\" with its genre, though as it stands, I perceive it more as an \"RPG\" with \"Platforming\" elements, than an essentially \"hybrid\" game.\n\nScore: Walking Coffee Maker out of Decaf Coffee\nThe game is fine and enjoyable. I just have a feeling that it could be better than what it is.\nThe game gets repetitive, but at the same time addictive.\nOverall, the game is good and it's on my list of \"favorite unappreciated games.\"\n\nP.S.: Even though it's free now, it's still the best $5 I've ever spent.", "timestamp_created": 1416322443, "timestamp_updated": 1473943090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.817835", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12929296": {"recommendationid": "12929296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071527925", "num_games_owned": 869, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415914123}, "language": "english", "review": "This si a f***ing hipster s**t !!!", "timestamp_created": 1415914441, "timestamp_updated": 1415914441, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.221118", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12885966": {"recommendationid": "12885966", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012194038", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450039587}, "language": "english", "review": "This has easily become one of my favorite games.

Una vez comprendida toda esta parte en el \u00e1mbito jugable es bastante simple, aunque no por ello menos complicado en las fases m\u00e1s avanzadas (especialmente duro en los combates contra los jefes m\u00e1s fuertes). Personalmente tuve que hacer demasiado uso del \"farmeo\" para poder comprar casi todas las mejoras posibles, no se me dan nada bien este tipo de combates y de haber sido lo contrario probablemente habr\u00eda podido terminar el juego en la mitad de tiempo como tantos otros.\n\nEspecial menci\u00f3n a la parte visual, con unas ilustraciones que pese a ser algo planas rebosan originalidad y est\u00e1n muy cuidadas. La m\u00fasica tambi\u00e9n es muy acorde y algunas canciones son realmente excelentes, es una pena que el autor del t\u00edtulo no pueda proporcionar la banda sonora por tratarse de piezas de terceros ni tampoco recuerde el nombre exacto de las mismas. La historia no est\u00e1 nada mal tampoco, y el final me gust\u00f3 bastante.\n\nLo que no me gust\u00f3 fue sobre todo la parte de farmeo (que realmente no es necesaria, pero como dije por mi dificultad para los combates me vi obligado a hacerlo) y en la fase de noche tuve sentimientos encontrados, ya que es muy bonita pero poco atractiva jugablemente hablando. Totalmente en ingl\u00e9s, aunque no es muy dificil de entender.\n\nEn resumidas cuentas se trata de un juego interesante, que quiz\u00e1 no tiene un gran despliegue t\u00e9cnico como otros t\u00edtulos pero tampoco lo necesita. Adem\u00e1s su precio es m\u00e1s que adecuado para lo que ofrece.\n\nConsejo 1: Establece como prioridad el buscar al menos 1 bater\u00eda en la fase de noche cuando falten pocos d\u00edas.\n\nConsejo 2: Hay lugares a los que \u00fanicamente se puede acceder con ciertos objetos, y el juego ofrece esta informaci\u00f3n quiz\u00e1 demasiado tarde dependiendo de tus preferencias.\n\nConsejo 3: Procura comprar cuanto antes la mejora que rebaja los precios a la mitad, y recuerda que los art\u00edculos seguir\u00e1n mostrando los mismos precios pero a la hora de comprarlos se te descontar\u00e1 la cantidad correcta.", "timestamp_created": 1412083572, "timestamp_updated": 1412086850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12193521": {"recommendationid": "12193521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013461184", "num_games_owned": 705, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411434094}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty enjoyable game, especially considering the price.

It's so weird and yet so compelling and enticing, showing you so much bizaare things and concepts. \n\nThe main reason why I think I like it... it is dripping with athmosphere, showing you a small robutt ecosystem with the simple task of fending of some viruses... and it slowly turns into a desperate struggle against slow, but almost unstoppable decay. It might be just me, but I quickly learned to love the 4 Robutts/Derelects, which are all simulating their own vision of colonizing the planet. They all followed a unique path, which suited them best... but despite being machines, showing a lot of personality, avoking emotions. \n\n[spoiler] Malenz, probably my favourite as the spider rowbutt. Tried his hardest to build a world with very ambitious methods, probably way too much. I think the fight with the viruses and the certain failure of his simulation made him retreat into his own little world... almost like a child with toys. At the beginning nice and friendly, thanking for your efforts to help, even if he doesn't think you will succeed. And slowly becoming more and more depressive... isolative... in the end not even bothering anymore to talk with you... just sad... retreating in a dreamworld to forget about his drawing closer demise... Denial\t [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Mirad, dunno about her, but probably the least interresting D: She still very cool. Store supporter in combat, which probably is the most unique way of a role in a RPG like combat system. Always so uncertain about the purpose of life... probably their creators/humans have destroyed themselves and that is the reason they have been abandoned. Even philosphing about people... maybe even machines having spirits. She accepted her upcoming death already and even shows understanding for the viruses actions... maybe its a living thing too that craves something. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Alphus! Hah! He is kinda the big bro... always happy to see you and very talkative. He thanks you for the most neglectable things and takes his mission very serious. He is the only one of the Robutts, that suck to the original purpose of the simulations and created a world, suitable for humans to live in... protected in big biodomes. I think he cares for everything else more than for himself... explaining why he asks you to stop bringing yourself in danger with fighting the viruses... and try to make use of the little time left. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Bio Beta... he got so close to finding out what was going on... secretly afraid of death, he tried to escape his form of an now immoblie simulation computer and ascent up to the next level... becoming human? Well... a sentinent being with a real body... either organic or machinistic... but he failed to either transfer functioning intelligence into a new body or creating new... something was always missing. He knows that something was going on behind the scenes, that nothing was as it seemed... asking you to investigate... before his time was running out as well. [/spoiler]\n\nThe fact that the game kept me guessing for the story and the twist the entire game was baffling... usually most modern games love to resort to the same old thropes. I guess this one has an standard thrope as well, but I didn't got behind it till short before the end. You get clues here and there, but they could point to multiple possible solutions.\n\nI am merely trying to process my troubled mind in the end... the game left me empty.\nI rarely ever cry from media or games, but this one hit me quite hard.\n\nJust the ending... yeah... not really what I was hoping or expecting... very very unfortunate the game didn't just stop at the words \"The End\"", "timestamp_created": 1402005123, "timestamp_updated": 1402005123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10330521": {"recommendationid": "10330521", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993661434", "num_games_owned": 4112, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1401850112}, "language": "english", "review": "The Desolate Hope, whilst not created by Arcen, ought to be worthy of an Arcen title. It has a delicious mish mash of genres and a wonderful streak of originality that pervades a goal based objective game. In all aspects, this feels very much like it -could- have come from an Arcen stable. That is high praise for a game, make no mistake. I regard Arcen as one of the few true shining lights, and whilst their attempts are hit and miss, their willingness to try new things makes them a publisher to always be interested in, regardless of what they do.\n\nIn this case the mishmash starts with a simple enough side scrolling platform style game (valley of wind style approach), then evolves into some top down exploration minigames with a sprinkling of shooting, and underscored by utterly over the top JRPG style active time battle boss fights complete with over the top animations and explosions and vivid colours. In between all this as a form of palette cleanser, there's a lovely 3D pre-rendered set of screens forming the backbone of the derelict space ship that your avatar, in this case, a mobile coffee machine (best, protaganonist, ever), tootles around, and during the night phases, you wander over a desolate planetary surface, lit in sillouette form to some wonderfully atmospheric music.\n\nIt's rough around the edges, the graphics are very much \"indie\", and the entire project feels very arthouse, but in a sense like most Arcen games, that's what gives it the charm. The fact that someone is able to bring so much to the table with limited resources and to show what games -can- be when they stop adhering to the boring AAA norms.

Here you enter the simulations, which are the platforner/metroidvania segments. You jump around, shoot enemies and collect stuff. You can also enter system panels to close security holes the virus may use. The game then switches to a zelda-ish style with topdown view and each screen representing a room with enemies in it.\nThroughout all this you collect system resources you can spend on various upgrades.\nDuring the night you just go outside the base, walk around the barren surface of the planet and collect items that you can give to the robots which will increase their levels.\nAll that leads up to the battles against the virus, which are semi-turn based battles akin to common JRPGS, but the battle system also has it's own unique twists and turns. These battles are the center of the gameplay, as nearly everything you do is to prepare for them. They can get a bit frustrating towards the end because of some pretty nasty enemy abilities, but overall they are fun and challenging and I didn't need to do any grinding to get through them (not counting the night segments, which are basically just that... plus a little bonus :P)\n The art and music are amazing, and I really enjoyed the story. The gameplay is fluent, but in itself nothing too special. Basic platforming for the most part, but the JRPG battles really stick out though. \nThe only other thing worth mentioning might be that the game is relatively short. I got through it in 6 hours. I *might* do a second run to get those 200% (only had 168% this time), but there doesn't seem to be any major replayability. So if you want something epic, don't look here.

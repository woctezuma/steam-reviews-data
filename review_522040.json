If you're not sure whether you'll like this game, I'd recommend trying Princess Remedy In A World of Hurt. It's completely free, and in a way could be seen as a demo of this game. In a way. This game is about as long as Princess Remedy 1. It does have a new 'Dating' mechanic which changes your special attack in battle. This can range from a landmine, flasks like in the first game, a short-range laser, and a larger flask. You can date any NPC in the game. The game also adds a little checkmark when you've 100%ed an overworld area, something the first game would have benefited greatly from. My first playthrough on normal took 53 Minutes, and I 100%ed the game thanks to that feature. When you finish the game, you get a little cutscene with the character you were dating at the time of beating the final boss, similar to the first game. The game is fairly challenging, with higher difficulty levels available for those looking for a harder (Or lesser) challenge, though even a fairly casual player should be able to beat the game on Normal without getting angry. The game relies a lot on humor and charm to sell itself, similar to titles such as Earthbound, and while I can't say I think the humor is as solid as in a game like Earthbound, it's still definitely worth checking out. Simply put, try the free game, and if you like it, support the developers by buying the sequel, it's definitely worth it in my opinion, especially at it's very low price point.", "timestamp_created": 1511737660, "timestamp_updated": 1511737660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37632760": {"recommendationid": "37632760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042900122", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512007567}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice fun difficult shoot em up", "timestamp_created": 1511682675, "timestamp_updated": 1511682675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36960466": {"recommendationid": "36960466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011522296", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485861593}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc5d4\ub529\uc774 \ub108\ubb34 \ub9ce\uc544\uc694", "timestamp_created": 1511419704, "timestamp_updated": 1511419704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36745093": {"recommendationid": "36745093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019960882", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510428512}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're on the fence about buying this three dollar game (mad respect for that fiscal responsibility, btw), play its ancestor and it will charm your socks off.\n\nThe first game was chock-full of charm and character, with interesting and challenging enemies and mechanics \n(I'm looking at you, jealous chest), but was also short in the best possible way.\nIt didn't overstay its welcome and when all was said and done it was simply a brief and enjoyable experience.\n\nIf you want a second helping of the first game and want to show your support, I can heartily recommend this game to you!", "timestamp_created": 1511378083, "timestamp_updated": 1511378083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36392321": {"recommendationid": "36392321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022107690", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 75, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510217479}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming, yet rather simple game. if you played the first and liked it, this won't disappoint.", "timestamp_created": 1510217481, "timestamp_updated": 1510217481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36314271": {"recommendationid": "36314271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361353947", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511987896}, "language": "english", "review": "i really love this game, challenging and fun, one of my favorite games ever.", "timestamp_created": 1509941126, "timestamp_updated": 1511386685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36312433": {"recommendationid": "36312433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113271055", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510265485}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you like the free orginal?

Goal is to save alot of people and upgrade your stats, like health, projectiles you shoot and their strenght. If you aren't helping people you explore the tiny world in search for chests, which also benefit you. \n\nThe previously mentioned mechanic here is that from the beginning on you can have a companion you can date and switch around as much as you like throughout your journey. Depending on which partner you have, they give you different special abilities during battles. Homing Shots, Speedup, Healing, little Traps and so on, its pretty self explainatory. The game is very fun and battles later on can get quite difficult, which i liked quite a bunch. Never in my short gametime did i feel the game being boring and love its cute style.\n\nIf you already liked the first, free game i can recommend this game just aswell.

There is much more land and people to cover, multiple bosses as opposed to just one, and the new dating mechanic, in which you can date and be accompanied by anybody you heal. When you have a special someone following you around, they will give you certain advantages in healing mode.

In my personal opinion, I think I liked the first game better just because it WAS the first game. Experiencing something as fresh and wonderful as the Princess Remedy franchise for the first time was an amazing experience, and I don't think I'll ever forget those first few moments of wonder.

This game is definitely the most enjoyable title I've played in a while.\n\nIf you're unsure, the first game is free so check that out before committing yourself to buying the 2nd title in the series.", "timestamp_created": 1485258433, "timestamp_updated": 1485258433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29449876": {"recommendationid": "29449876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080054140", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485198976}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0442\u0430\u043a, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0451\u043c \u0441 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u043a \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 Princess Remedy In a World of Hurt, \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043e\u0431\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u041b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0441\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0432\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043c \u043b\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \n\n\u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 -

It is fairly short, but sweet game with a nice variety of enemies & abilities. If you're skeptical about buying this, go try out there other game [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/407900/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_1][b]Princess Remedy in a World of Hurt[/b][/url] which has all the basic mechanics as this game.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nPrincess Remedy In A Heap of Trouble is a great retro, RPG game that has a unique gameplay style. The game is focused upon a young girl (Princess Remedy) who is trained to heal those who are hurt, and what a surprise that pretty much everyone in the world that she is in is hurt. Your objective is to heal all of those who are hurt in the world and to bring back peace to the world.\n\nSo first off lets talk about the main gameplay of the game and how you heal those who are in need. The way that you help these people is simple, talk to those who are in need and then defeat the enemies that are inside them... I'm guess their inside their mind or something but the game doesn't really clarify that. Defeating these enemies will heal the person and make them feel healthy again. It's not hard to tell that this is a different kind of RPG, which doesn't focus on the generic turn based battles but more of a kind of fast bullet hell style at times. You attack these enemies with pills that you shoot.\n\nThere is a nice variety of different kind of battle areas that you will come across when you are in battle, most if not all of the people have their own different battle areas. This makes for a nice variety of gameplay and the way that you handle the certain types of enemies that you may come across. As well as a nice variety of battle areas, you are also welcomed with a decent amount of enemies. Some of these enemies will just walk around not shooting, while others will constantly follow you and try to shoot at you. Needless to say you will have to adapt to your situation when battling.\n\nWhen you heal these people they don't instantly become neglected throughout the game, you are able to bring them along with you. Now why would you do this? Well, each person that you heal has a special ability that you can use while defeating enemies and healing even more people throughout the game. The special ability can range from shooting faster to healing yourself, it seems that there is a decent amount of special abilities to choose from throughout playing the game.\n\nAs well as defeating normal enemies there are also a few bosses that you encounter before you move into a new area. These bosses are a nice break up from the regular enemies that you encounter because they have all have different fighting strategies that you will have to adapt to and defeat them.\n\nIt's probably also worth mentioning that the game is pretty short and only lasts about 1.5-2 (playing on the easiest difficulty and collecting everything) and the game tries to make up for that with 3 different difficulties. Unfortunately, the difficulties are just sped up versions of the same game, a little disappointing but still overall a decent little game.\n\nOne last quirky neat feature that I enjoyed was at the end of the game you could bring along any person that you had healed and take them on a date. It then brings you to like a guitar hero like mini game where you have to match the arrow keys. A nice little feature to end the game on.\n\nI do love the graphics of the game, I have always loved more older retro games graphics they just seem to appealing to me. Although I do enjoy the graphics of this game, with their simplistic retro styled game I do feel like a little bit more time could've been put into them. For example, it is clear at times that your character is a single square with a single colour around your character and not transparent around your character. That's only a small thing about the game that I think could be slightly improved.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n+ A nice different kind of battling style\n+ A variety of battle areas & enemies\n+ Nice variety of special abilities\n+ Generally great Retro styled graphics\n+ Short (1.5+ hours) and sweet game\n+ A nice & quirky ending\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Graphics seem to be coloured all around the square your character is in and not transparent\n- The difficulties only increase the games speed to make it harder\n\n[h1]Result / Final Thoughts[/h1]\nOverall, this game is great a real Gem when it comes to retro styled bullet hell games. Although the game is short, it's well worth the price and you might even find yourself playing through the game multiple times.

The dating system is interesting, but some flask types are definitely more useful than others. The writing also didn't feel as fun as the Wash-Olaf joke was omnipresent and run into the ground until it was fine specs of sand. And while the boss battles were interesting, there wasn't as much exploration with the normal battle enemy types and it just felt like there should've been more fights to really get some interesting stuff like A World of Hurt did.\n\nMy final thought is that overall A Heap of Trouble has the quality of a free game while A World of Hurt is worth the $3.

In this game, the Princess is still romantically attracted to virtually everything in existence, but she's dating them to decide what special she gets during battle, as well as a fun scene at the end.\n\nTo those who don't know the original, this is an RPG with a battle mechanic like a bullet hell shooter that is supposed to represent 'healing' people by shooting the bejezus out of the physical embodiments of their problems, which sometimes aren't medical problems because this game is weird. Shooting happens automatically in the direction you're pointing, you move around a small arena with obstacles, you have a special power activated by virtually any button that has limited uses and depends on which NPC you are dating. There are bosses that mostly feel more like traditional shooter bosses and also freak me the hell out, causing me to shoot them even more enthusiastically to make them stop existing.\n\nThe game has very retro-style graphics and gameplay. I like it because the music is upbeat and the world is brightly coloured and fun, with a science fantasy feel to it. Virtually anything, including ducks, flowers, fires and doors, is self-aware and can speak, and therefore Princess Remedi is attracted to it. The humour gets extremely meta at times. This game gets compared with Undertale a lot but it feels like its own thing. \n\nThe game is very short with one-sentence dialogues that are usually comedic, something that can bother people but in my experience doesn't affect play. There is a large leap between difficulty modes. Personally I suck at shooters and can barely defeat the final boss [spoiler] and secret boss [/spoiler] on Medium.

The author can write... sentences.  The story that develops is tragic and touching in many ways.\n\nIf the author hadn't included the AIs, if we'd been left to discover what had happened and ponder it ourselves, it might have been a passable story.  But you must let both AIs comment on every letter, which slows the game down TREMENDOUSLY, and mostly they just make heavy-handed commentary and force us to answer inane questions (is slavery of women good?  It's totally messed up to teach women to read, amiright? ... and more in that vein).  One of the AIs is an interesting character, essential to the story, but her persistent hammering on me to make sure I got the message that slavery of women is bad, 'mkay? made her more annoying than endearing.\n\nThroughout history, there have been two opposing views of stories and of art.  One view, the older one, says that the purpose of stories is to answer questions and shut people up.  Creation myths.  Stories about Jesus.  Soviet Realism.  Mein Kampf and the sculptures of Arno Breker.\n\nThe other tradition says the purpose of stories is to ask questions.  Is history made by great men, or small actions (Tolstoy)?  Is civilization built by rational choices, or by mercy and grace (Dostoyevsky)?\n\nThe question that Analogue ultimately asks is: Is it okay to destroy society if it's hopelessly patriarchal?\n\nIs that a genuine question that's socially relevant for today?  Yes, it is, if you're a paranoid schizophrenic living in a fantasy world in which the Handmaid's Tale is relevant to the US in the 21st century.\n\nIn fact this is one of the few questions that contemporary \"literature\" Is allowed to ask, which is the reason I'm reading visual novels on Steam instead of the post-modernist crap found in literary fiction today.  The entire point of modernism, Marxist critical theory, post-modernism, post-colonialism, and everything else found in \"respectable\" critical theory today is to convince people to destroy Western civilization.  It's the same trick the Nazis pulled with \"Kultur\", just in the interests of different people.\n\nAnalogue's agenda isn't really to get you to ask that question; it's to surreptitiously get you to accept the answer \"yes\" to the question, \"Is Western society today hopelessly patriarchal?\"  That puts Analogue in the tradition of propaganda stories.\n\nIt isn't that hard to destroy civilization.  Western civilizations have fallen many times: demographic collapse across the entire region circa 1187 BC, the destruction of native North African cultures at the end of the Greek Dark Age; Rome destroyed by Christianity after 300 AD; the total destruction of Arianist (no, I don't mean Aryan) Christian Europe by the Franks and Byzantines; the destruction of the Sassanid and Byzantine Empires by the Muslims; the devastation of Eastern Europe and Asia Minor by the Mongols in the 13th century; etc., etc.\n\nNews flash:  Destroying civilization has never worked out well for women.", "timestamp_created": 1514394868, "timestamp_updated": 1514422396, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38671709": {"recommendationid": "38671709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150845984", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514350011}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game that has great character development and isnt just a some visual novel you sit around clicking and reading.

There's been, to understate the issue <b>vastly</b>, \"controversy\" around literary games, or as a certain toxic subset of the gaming community terms them, \"SJW\" games - usually called such because they have the audacity to include a queer character or characters of color or to critique some trend in dominant gaming culture.\n\nI am an unabashed \"SJW\" or \"social justice warrior.\" I have a full page dedicated to doxing me on a prominent alt-right website. I also think that while it <b>absolutely</b> deserves its place in the \"canon\" of video game history as a game which managed an impressive amount of storytelling with an incredibly small amount of art assets, and indeed made a fairly impressive effort at social critique, Christine Love's <i>Analogue: A Hate Story</I> ultimately fails as a game and as a social critique.\n\nBefore elaborating, I do want to warn people who don't know what they're getting into that <i>Analogue</i> is more or less a space opera retelling of Margaret Atwood's <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, a harrowing novel about rape and misogyny. Both of those things exist throughout <i>Analogue</i>'s narrative and intentionally discomfort the player. The game also has an undercurrent of fetishistic sexuality which is not something I find objectionable in itself, but which is handled in ways that seem quite hypocritical given the narrative the story is telling. At one point, for instance, one of the artificial intelligences who delivers the majority of the narrative in <i>Analogue</i> becomes angry with the player's character if the player chooses to dress the character in a particular outfit - an outfit which the game provides and which the character invites the player, in character, to dress her in. \n\nFull disclosure: my distaste for this game is absolutely driven by a personal dislike of the out-of-game politics of its creator. Christine Love has been a vocal spokesperson for transgender people and is perhaps the most visible openly transgender woman in gaming. She has also shamed a young transgender woman for having the audacity to praise Love for being a trans woman in games, because she has had \"the surgery\" and considers that part of her life over with.

The writing is definitely one of its strong points. Each of the characters have a very clear voice and personality. The basic premise, as others I am sure have explained, is that it's your job to comb through the ship's records in order to find out what happened to the Mugunhwa, a ship that crashed.  But what it turns into is that you must convince the AI on the ship to actually release the records for you... and, for a variety of reasons, neither Mute nor Hyun-ae are in a hurry to do so. A fortunate side-effect, though, is that it gives you time to really delve into the story. I for one found myself not really caring for my original mission and instead just wanted to hear more stories. \n\nAnyway, I would recommend this game to anyone who has the patience to read long chunks of text.

Check it out.\n\nAlright, to get a little more in-depth and probably spoilery: Analogue (and its sequel, Hate Plus), together form a character study of *Mute, one of the two A.I. ladies in all the screenshots. Analogue, by itself, is mostly a collection of fragmented journal entries written by people living on an isolated spaceship where society regressed to something like the intensely misogynistic Joseon Dynasty of historical Korea. The character of *Hyun-ae is also around, mostly as a satire of more typical visual novel heroines. There's an inconsequential framing device (the player character is a spaceperson on a mission to recover the data logs of the spaceship where everything went down) but that doesn't matter too much.\n\n*Mute is the most complex character in the story, and she touches on a lot of themes. As an artificial intelligence, she's a transhuman person and her story raises a lot of thought-provoking transhumanist issues: what would immortality mean for a human (or human-like) consciousness? is it moral to program a consciousness that lacks free will? how might a transhuman consciousness process love, hate, and other emotions? As the most powerful person in a fiercely patriarchal society who also happens to be a woman, she demonstrates internalized misogyny and homophobia and invites the player to explore those issues as well. As the last survivor (almost) of a spaceship she was built to protect and a society that's now extinct, she has to struggle to find a new purpose in life. The character of *Mute manages to do all this heavy lifting while still being a fun, snarky, nosy, judgmental gossip who, like, talks vaguely like a valley girl.\n\nOf course, *Hyun-ae is the one who shows up on all the screenshots and stuff. She's a relatively simple character, compared to *Mute anyway. *Hyun-ae's job, sometimes to the point of breaking the fourth wall, is to satirize visual novel heroines. She instantly (though not unconditionally) loves the player character, dresses up in cute outfits for them, craves their attention, etc., but the game goes and critically examines what might lead a person to behave this way. The element of satire goes way further in Hate Plus.\n\nThe bulk of Analogue is a collection of text logs written by the doomed crew of a huge spaceship sent from Earth at slower than light speed to colonize some distant planet but which ended up adrift in space. These provide the player with an autopsy of the regressive, misogynistic society in power at the time that an unknown tragedy killed everyone except *Mute and *Hyun-ae. Some are written by lowly peasants, some by rich nobles, some by men, and some by women. They sketch out an interesting and compelling cast of characters as well as the ugly culture in which they lived, and form rich ground for a lot of thinking on sociological and social justice issues. One of the most powerful themes that comes across in these writings is the fact that even though individuals are rarely malicious, the institutions they live in can be incredibly harmful. I would think most players would end up empathizing with the denizens of the Mugunghwa while simultaneously condoning their destruction (or at least sympathizing with their murderer), which is a great showcase of the writer's skill.\n\nUnlike its sequel, Analogue can stand on its own. The ending doesn't resolve much, but the story doesn't present many dangling plot threads anyway.

You have to hunt for the story it's not just given to you. For once this is a visual novel that embraces the genera, and is not just a story with some button prompts and a nice background.\n\nThere are a few changes I would make to the game such as allowing you to see who you have shown what files to and swapping the back and forward buttons for the 3 menus (I mean come on it's only one more button and it would save a lot of time), but other than that I really enjoyed it. The story could be very confusing at times with all the Korean names with no visual reference but by the time I beat it I was fairly confident I know what all had happened.\n\nThis is a story that can get quite mature, less so with the character actions and more so with the reactions to events.

That's par for the course when discussing visual novels, but that's also why I tend to trust VNs from well-known studios/devs, because at least you know you'll get plot while playing VNs of acclaim like [i]Clannad[/i], the [i]Grisaia[/i] Trilogy, or [i]The Devil on G-String[/i] in exchange for their premium price.\n\nBut, let's rewind time back to 2012, when Gangnam Style was top of the charts around the world and every tween and their literature teacher was dying to see [strike]Shaky Camera: The Movie[/strike] The Hunger Games. In this archaic age of yore, there were, quite frankly, no good visual novels on Steam, save for one: Christine Love's [i]Analogue: A Hate Story[/i]. Back then, I wasn't sure how much story ten bucks could really buy, but boy I was surprised.\n\nAnalogue eschews all the teenage high-school setting jazz you'll see in 99.9% of visual novels out there. Instead, it opts to tell the fate of a ruined colony ship, the Mugunghwa, in a decidedly sci-fi setting. It does this with considerable polish.\nAnalogue's presentation is simple, nothing more and nothing less required to tell its story, letting you explore the lore of the ship's mysterious downfall at your own pace as you literally read through logs like the investigator you are supposed to be. At the very least its more interactive than half the VNs on the market, with a very entertaining minigame thrown in halfway through the story. \n\nNow then, you can hold off on impulsively buying those tempting 11 Anniversary Lootboxes in Overwatch since for those same ten bucks, you get a substantial story and can brag to your friends all about the \"Joseon\" Era of Korean history.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, what's more important? Getting yet ANOTHER Tracer legendary skin or knowing what \"Joseon\" means? You be the judge of that question.\n\nJust uh...don't blame me [spoiler]if your 10 bucks gets you neither of those, in the end[/spoiler].\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n [*]Absolutely riveting plot\n [*]Cute AI girl[spoiler]s[/spoiler]\n [*]Different outfits on a whim for Cute AI girl[spoiler]s[/spoiler]\n [*]More game interaction then smashing \"ENTER\" every 10 seconds\n [*][spoiler]Stop a nuclear explosion with your hacking skills[/spoiler]\n [*]A feminist game that makes sense\n [*][spoiler]You can achieve the impossible dream every indecisive teenage Light Novel main character wishes they could make by quite literally cheating the system[/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n [*]No voice acting, but that's completely fine\n [*]Relatively short, but there actually is a sequel so more playtime there too I guess\n [*][spoiler]Learning about how unpleasant people from the Joseon Dynasty could be is disgusting[/spoiler], but that's the point\n [*]Not that I care but its based off of Korea and not Japan so you \"purists\" may have some beef with that.\n[/list]\n\nNo but seriously.

It\u2019s also not that long\u2013 I got 98% completion in, according to Steam, 2.8 hours. So it\u2019s more than worth the investment.\n\nThere are two stories here. The frame story is that you are sent as part of your job to go through the records of a recently rediscovered lost ship/space colony that has been gone for hundreds of years. You head over and start sifting through the log files with the help of the ship\u2019s AI. The second story is what actually happened on the ship. The setting is simultaneously a future dystopia and a past dystopia\u2013 the frame story takes place more than a thousand years in the future, while the secondary plot takes place six hundred years before that.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe the game without getting into spoiler territory, but I\u2019ll do my best: the gist of the secondary plot is that on this space colony, some unspecified disaster caused major social and educational regression and an extreme population reduction that ultimately resulted in the establishment of an extremely oppressive patriarchal society in which women rarely are allowed to leave the home and are often married off as young as 12 or 13. A young girl put in stasis before the disaster due to an illness wakes up hoping that a cure has been developed, only to find the world has gone to hell.\n\nThe game is simultaneously a reflection on the horrors of the past\u2013 a particularly disturbing post-game author\u2019s note lets you know the circumstances are based very heavily on actual customs of Feudal Korea\u2013 as well as a warning about where we could head in the future. The girl wakes up and tries to tell her new \u201cfamily\u201d about her illness by emphasizing how thin and pale she is, but all the men hear is a woman\u2019s whine and all the women hear is bragging about good looks, which would sound extreme if the exact same thing hadn\u2019t happened to me in the past. It\u2019s an examination of the ways women survive in such an oppressive society, and what happens to those who don\u2019t fit the mold.\n\nThe final reveal of the girl\u2019s storyline was something I saw coming by the time I got there but was hoping wouldn\u2019t happen all the same.\n\nThe gameplay itself was clever, if simple. The navigation was freer than you usually get in a VN, as the interface is of a computer system you can explore more or less however you see fit\u2013 as the AI offers commentary\u2013 though the AI will dole out information based on how you interact with them so the story itself it ultimately nonlinear. In addition to reading snippets of the ship\u2019s logs and chatting with the AI, there\u2019s also a command input console where you can type in whatever you please to the ship\u2019s computer. I thought the puzzles involving the commands were interesting enough to require some good thought while also logical enough to be solvable on your own.\n\nThe weakest part of the game to me was the ending of the frame story. The story itself is somber, serious, and tragic, but the AIs end up flighty, silly, and almost like caricatures. Like, after everything that\u2019s gone on, Hyun-ae suddenly turns into terrible tsundere and decides she\u2019s in love with you and wants to get married? What? The LAST thing she should be interested in after what she\u2019s seen is some kind of weird relationship with a stranger. The tone shifts from torture and oppression to some kind of parody with no warning whatsoever, and it\u2019s like she just forgets what you were looking at. It\u2019s jarring, but also comes off as though the game doesn\u2019t take its very, very serious subject matter seriously at all. \u201cOprression and mutilation destroy lives. CAN I BE UR WAIFU????\u201d Just wat.\n\nIn the same vein, I thought calling the \u201cbest\u201d ending a \u201charem\u201d ending was ridiculously tacky. In a story where women are literally being forced into harems, just what the hell. Is it supposed to be a joke? Why is that something to joke about? Is it some weird attempt at meta-commentary on VNs? Wrong place, wrong time.\n\nSo yeah, the last five minutes or so of the game are\u2026 bad. They\u2019re just bad, there\u2019s no way around it. But overall?

There were a handful of elements I was really impressed by, but ultimately I don't recommend it. It's frustration incarnate; more time invested in it brings the opposite of a sense of reward.\n\nAnalogue is a VN showcase of interesting ideas that are never seen through to their full potential. The setting is barebones, any mystery of the events on the lost colony ship doesn't have any real contrast with the experience of the player's blank slate agent; indeed throughout the game I felt the real mystery was finding out what was normality outside of the ship.\n\nEvidently centuries ago there was development of human level AI and the resources to build giant colony ships to a destination so far away it'd be travelling for generations. But the player's character just accepts this as an inconsequential triviality, as though they're walking out to the wilderness to pick up a memory card from a crashed weather balloon a few miles out of town; where the world hasn't changed since the balloon's launch.\n\nVNs without a strong plot or compelling characters reallly don't have much going for them. Analogue doesn't really possess either. Indeed, the bulk of the writing is incomplete logs about a crypt ship. Instead of this being a compelling slowburn of intrigue, many of these logs and letters read like they're all written in one voice, giving little individuality to what's meant to be wildly divergent experiences on the ship.\n\nTo make this worse, there's additional UI frustration as actually trying to progress through the VN has no obvious path; it's continually go to a log, then attempt to point it at 1 of the 2 main characters. Here at least there's a sense of individuality and characterisation, but that quickly wilts as there's instead an impression of neither being more than a heavy handed framing device - one is basically parroting a dogma of \"Isn't a functional society the most important thing WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION WHATSOEVER?\" and the other displaying both staggeringly unsubtle withholding of information, and a need for continual validation. Both treat any response to any disagreement shockingly poorly, as though that verbal disagreement was the worst thing to ever happen to them.\n\nThe bulk of Analogue consists of the following: Trying to find to right log to read, then push at the right character to see if they will either release the next set needed completion or discuss their take on the other character aboard the colony ship, in the correct order. Advancing the storyline in this VN felt like a chore. Instead of a replay bringing revelations and discovering mistakes I'd made in hindsight - different perspectives on the same events for example - it felt I'd covered the meat of the content on the first pass, and later variations were last minute indulgences that never met much scrutiny as to whether they deserved inclusion.\n\nAnalogue greatly benefits from Isaac Schankler's music, ranging from mellow slice of life to urgency and impending catastrophy, and I'd say it's the strongest and most memorable part of Analogue. Additionally there was one segment with an element of a looming success / fail state that brought some badly needed focus with clear objectives and a sense of urgency to achievement them to the proceedings.", "timestamp_created": 1493064508, "timestamp_updated": 1493064554, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588215", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31301883": {"recommendationid": "31301883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085499843", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511971261}, "language": "english", "review": "EN\nBasically I liked the game because of the plot, well, music.

Je craignais \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de tomber sur des fan-fictions boursoufl\u00e9es, des histoires de Mary-Sue o\u00f9 les auteurs se projettent \u00e0 mort... bref, on va dire que de base je n'\u00e9tais pas le client id\u00e9al.\n\nJ'avais un peu entendu parler de Analogue en bien, et je me disais que s'il fallait vraiment toucher au genre histoire de ne pas mourir idiot, je ferais probablement celui-l\u00e0... pas un grand choix hyp\u00e9/passionnel, mais bon la curiosit\u00e9 \u00e9tait l\u00e0.\nEt quand le hasard d'un cadeau a fait que je me suis retrouv\u00e9 avec ce titre en main, je me suis dit que c'\u00e9tait le bon signe pour s'y mettre, c'\u00e9tait la bonne conjonction... et bien m'en a pris.\n\nAnalogue n'est pas un simulateur de drague.\nAu d\u00e9part il s'agit d'une simili-enqu\u00eate. Oui il y aura - un peu - de drague (quoiqu'on pourrait plus parler de l'\u00e9valuation de sa compatibilit\u00e9 et de choix de confiance) mais l'essentiel de la lecture du jeu consiste \u00e0 essayer de comprendre ce qui a pu se passer dans un vaisseau spatial immense retrouv\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9rive dans l'espace et dont toute la population est morte. On ne parle pas d'un \u00e9quipage massacr\u00e9 par un alien. On perle de la population d'un vaisseau destin\u00e9 \u00e0 coloniser des plan\u00e8tes, le genre de bouzin abritant des millier d'\u00e2mes.\n\nLe jeu ne baigne pas pour autant dans une atmosph\u00e8re horrifique. Il n'y a pas de danger \u00e0 affronter. Tout le drame s'est pass\u00e9 il y a trop longtemps. L'activit\u00e9 principale consiste \u00e0 lire des logs des habitants et \u00e0 interviewer de fa\u00e7on assez sommaire l'IA du vaisseau pour comprendre ce qui s'est pass\u00e9. Et c'est tout. Mais Analogue est tr\u00e8s bien \u00e9crit, et ce peu de choses \u00e0 faire, Analogue le d\u00e9veloppe tr\u00e8s bien.\nLes logs sont bien \u00e9crits, styl\u00e9s, porteurs de la personnalit\u00e9 des habitants, l'IA du vaisseau est bien typ\u00e9e et ses r\u00e9parties parfaitement adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 l'ambiance du vaisseau : c'est tr\u00e8s bien fichu.\n\nMais l\u00e0 o\u00f9 \u00e7a devient remarquable, c'est que le jeu aborde un sujet pas simple d'une mani\u00e8re au final assez fine.\nSans gros spoilers, le jeu va \u00e9voquer toutes les probl\u00e9matiques d'un probl\u00e8me de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9 \u00e0 la discrimination.\nMais il va le faire sans gros sabots. \u00c9voqu\u00e9 par les situations d\u00e9crites dans les logs. Dans le ton employ\u00e9 par les protagonistes, y compris par l'IA, qui adapte son discours, selon ce que vous direz sur vous et votre jugement sur ce que vous lirez. C'est remarquable de justesse.\n\nDans ce genre de \"v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 th\u00e8se\", on aurait pu tomber sur une narration avec des gros sabots, avec une situation tire-larme (il y en a, hein) et un discours univoque pour dire \"houlala ce qui se passe l\u00e0 c'est mal\", mais non : le jeu fait le pari que vous allez vous indigner tout seul comme un grand. Le jeu \u00e9voque les paroles de protagonistes qui ont int\u00e9gr\u00e9 et d\u00e9fendent leur position de victime, ou celui de la majorit\u00e9 approuvant le syst\u00e8me. C'est bien fichu et \u00e7\u00e0 marche. Dans l'absolu, il pourrait servir d'outil de sensibilisation int\u00e9ressant...\n\n... mais c'est aussi un jeu. Comme je le disait, l'activit\u00e9 ludique en tant que tel ne vole pas haut, mais elle fonctionne assez bien.\nEn gros vous vous activerez en :\n- lisant des logs et en les soumettant \u00e0 une IA, qui vous demandera sommairement votre avis dessus, et en ira de son petit commentaire\n- bidouillant sur une console avec invite de commande pour g\u00e9rer deux trois param\u00e8tres pour r\u00e9gler quelques probl\u00e8mes\n- faisant quelques choix \"moraux\" et de sympathie/antipathie, pour d\u00e9terminer votre affinit\u00e9 avec l'IA\n\nLe jeu comporte 5 fins. Je fais ce retour apr\u00e8s en avoir vu une (la moins sentimentale des 5, je pense).\nUne partie se boucle en 2-3 heures... et encore, sur ce premier run, j'ai pris mon temps pour bien tout lire.\nL'ensemble a suffisamment titill\u00e9 ma curiosit\u00e9 pour que j'ai envie de d\u00e9bloquer les autres fins.\nLes graphismes sont sommaires, mais fonctionnent. Bon, comme d'hab, c'est typ\u00e9 manga.\nTout est en anglais (plut\u00f4t un bon niveau). La culture de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9voqu\u00e9e est cor\u00e9enne.\nL'interface fait le job, mais auraient pu \u00eatre un peu plus ergonomique. En l'\u00e9tat, \u00e7\u00e0 n'handicape pas le jeu.\nLa musique a le m\u00e9rite de ne pas prendre la t\u00eate mais est totalement oubliable.\n\nAu total, vous ne jouerez pas \u00e0 Analogue pour son gameplay de guedin, et sa production value \u00e0 trouzmiyon de dollars.\nMais vous y jouerez peut-\u00eatre pour la qualit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9livrance de son message.\nEt ce ne sera pas du temps perdu.", "timestamp_created": 1487173145, "timestamp_updated": 1487173145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29929119": {"recommendationid": "29929119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198282033422", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467153470}, "language": "english", "review": "This visual novel is very good and intriguing.

It was something fun to play once and discover the truth. But only if it's on sale. \n\nPros:\nThe music was pretty chill and relaxing. Good reading music, since there was a lot of reading involved I approve of that. \nThe world was pretty interesting, just the whole mystery of what happened at year 0. \nReading people's personal logs was super invasive and almost like reading their diaries, I felt like a real historian. \nTechnically all logs are accessible without following any search paths - if you have the logID you can read and show any log to the AI without bothering with the actual story\nThe console hacking phase was pretty fun and interesting\nThere were a few (slightly buggy) shortcuts in the ui that made it more tolerable to read\n\nCons:\nThe waifu stuff. I really, really could have done without it. A lot more tolerable if you play the game telling *Mute you're a woman, but only a little.\nThe AI's not having comments on stuff that I thought was worth commenting on. (\"I don't know what you're looking for\"). Or repeating the same thing for a lot of logs. \nThe mystery of Day 0 remains (there's a sequel which really wasn't worth it)\nI was much more interested (especially coming back from the sequel to this game) in what happened from Year 0 to the years which were relavant to the issue at hand. \nI wish it was all from the console ui and not from the unfun ui the game takes place in.

Even more confusing because I think it was written by a white canadian girl but whatever.\n\nBut there's this interesting thing going on in that it explores what would happen if a multi-generational space voyage had something catastrophic happen and all memories and culture from the civilization who launched the ship in the first place were more or less erased and subsequent generations had to deal with a reversion to primitive/more openly patriarchal cultural structures.

Theres a lot of reading- essentially you're going through lots of historical logs and guaging input from one of two AIs regarding said logs. It took me a little while to get going as it does seem to be an overwhelming amount of information at first, but its not as bad as it first looks.\n\nBy the end of the game I felt slightly uneasy- in the same way I felt uneasy after I read George Orwell's 1984. If you play it you'll probably get where I'm coming from.\n\nSo now I've fully completed this game I'm looking forward to playing Hate Plus which delves into parts of the story missing in this game.

An interesting based-on-historical-real-life world hidden in a typically ludicrous 'Japanese' visual novel where anything resembling a female falls in love with you.\n\nMy biggest worry when starting this is it would have too much reading and no interactivity. Thankfully it's not a giant novel hidden within a 'game', and you get some yes/no questions that can alter things a little. These Q&As aren't done perfectly, sometimes neither choice is what you want, and things happen that you should have choice over but couldn't help, but not enough for me to be annoyed about.\n\nI've played two of these types of games now (although this is set in some form of futuristic Korean ship rather than Japan), and am struck by the similarities. There's always one chick who's pretty, cute, subservient, likes geeky things. Then she has a sister/friend/nemesis who has an 'attitude', a kooky sense of style and is independent - the hard to get one. Yet one or both randomly and suddenly fall in love with you with equal ease despite not knowing you and it being ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED that you're a loner who is awkward in the outside world and avoids people. Oh, and the women in this game are AI, so NOT EVEN REAL OR PHYSICALLY ABLE TO INTERACT WITH YOU.\n\nThe reason I mention this is I thus fully expected this to be written by a guy who has projected himself as the main character, but actually it was written by a woman, a self-proclaimed feminist, and the main point was that it was supposed to bring awareness to the horrible things women in Korea a couple of centuries back had to live through. So I don't get why I'm wanting to bang the AI or why she felt the need to dress it up with this flirty subplot. I guess this is what these kinds of games all do, given my limited experience, but there's nothing wrong with breaking the mould.\n\nThere are some interesting mini-stories told via the diaries and emails you snoop, written well enough. So I do recommend this game if this all sounds normal to you. You're probably used to it by now. If it's your first foray into this mad world of awkward Japanophile virgins, it's worth a look too since the world there once was on this ship is kinda interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1480407134, "timestamp_updated": 1488670609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28019103": {"recommendationid": "28019103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131600031", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 504, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439905400}, "language": "english", "review": "I think it's a great concept that ends up being fleshed out really well too!

You're hired to go investigate a derelict spaceship and find out what happened.  You arrive on the ship and use the terminal to activate the ship's AI.  You spend the game interacting with the AI and reading the ship logs of various families and people who were on board to find out what happened.  Reading logs and interacting with the AI causes her to unlock more ship logs.   Log entries are often given to you out of order & out of context but fill in as you discover more, so they will eventually make sense.  Some other stuff happens as well.\n\nCouple of cons:  1. Reading some logs can be confusing due to the confusing family names not being particularly memorable.  Expect plenty of \u201cWho's this guy/girl again\u201d moments until you read a bit and hopefully remember who that person is.  2.  Getting 98% of the logs and finding out the one you're missing is the pronunciation log that you're pretty sure you got before.\n\nNot a lot to say.

Just enough filler to keep you engaged so that when something important does come up, it feels all the more significant. The twists felt well built up to, and many of the characters felt like they had unique perspective, which is very difficult to pull off as well as Christine Love did. Really on a technical sense, there are generally very few bad things, and even those are just the smallest grammar nitpicks. \nBut the story itself is amazing. I wouldn't want to spoil anything, but I only want to say that it is [i]extrordinarily[/i] tragic. Romeo and Juliet (to pull the easiest metaphor) never knew such hopelessness, I swear. The two main characters give such a different perspective from each other concerning the events that I honestly think that it just would not have worked without either one of them. \nThe only issues I have are a minor bug concerning getting the 100% log completion and that it was a bit short; I passed the game in 2 sittings, 4 hours total (but I am a fast reader.) The rest of the time I spent trying to complete it without looking up walkthroughs, which did double my playtime. \nAll in all though, an amazing experience that will stay with me for a long time.

You're presented with one objective: discover what happened to a certain ship, the Mugunghwa, through the logs of its dead crew. And of course, download said logs and get them to your employer. After all, you gotta get paid, ya' know?\n\nBut it goes deeper than that.\n\nWhen I said it's unlike any others, I meant it. Unlike other VNs, you don't go to exotic locations, meet new characters, or stuff like that... all you got is a terminal. At least, at first. Because then, the cutest goddamn AI you could ever meet comes to greet you, gives you a display, and the game goes on.\n\nAnd boy, does it go on.\n\nIt may seem short (Took me 6 hours to 100% the game), but I promise it will be worth your while. With an amazing. and for some people, minimalistic (even though I think it's prefectly fine that way) cast, a deep, rich storyline, moments that will make you laugh, moments that will make you cry, and moments that wil make you feel dread, and doubt your own morals and opinions you had at the start of the game... Analogue: A Hate Story is a must-have, in my opinion. It's easy to get into, REALLY easy to get hooked, and immensely satisfying to play through until the end. \n\nAnd it has a sequel, Hate Plus, so you'll be able to get even more of the amazing duo that is *Hyung-ae and *Mute!\n\nOverall, I give this game, a 9 out of 10. It was an amazing experience, and I would certainly buy it again if I could.\n\nWhat are you doing, reading this review?!

It is at once futuristic, yet historical; fantastical, yet grounded; beautiful, yet haunting. It is not the world which drew me to [i]Analogue[/i], but it is certainly what drew me [i]into[/i] it, making me want to read more and more about it, learn more about its society and people, and see it from the perspective of each and every of its inhabitants.\n\nIn many ways, it had to be what drew me in, as it will have to be what draws in anyone who plays it: unravelling the mystery of what happened on board the [i]Mugunghwa[/i] is, after all, the sole meat of the game. Fortunately, Love's talent for writing made engaging with her world an easy task, bringing it to life with skill both technical and poetic. Though the game presents the player with numerous logs, letters, transcripts, and diary entries, each stands apart from the next through the care with which it was written. Each word seems carefully and deliberately chosen to present the reader with the most information in the most concise package, painting the narrative\u2014and everything and everyone in it\u2014with vibrancy and depth. Love knows players will spend a lot of time reading, and she takes care to waste none of it.\n\nToo, Love's understanding of the human psyche shines in the way [i]Analogue[/i]'s characters are brought to life. The AI constructs *Hyun-ae and *Mute, with whom the player interacts, reap the most visible benefits, and throughout the game I found myself caring for them, and empathizing with them, as though they were real. Yet even the characters we only read about in logs benefit here, each with their own unique personality and perspective. The style and tone with which each author writes reflects this, and aids the player in untangling [i]Analogue[/i]'s dense narrative.\n\nAside from the writing, I will also take a moment to praise the game's other perks. Isaac Schankler's beautiful soundtrack can be both catchy and poignant, and I've listened to it outside of the game countless times. [i]Analogue[/i]'s \u00e6sthetic is clean and refined in a way which puts to shame other visual novels, especially where the user interface is concerned. Finally, Love finds novel ways to utilize the Ren'Py engine's Python scripting system, and the game's sometime reliance on a command line interface certainly appealed to my inner nerd.\n\nAlthough I have difficulty criticizing [i]Analogue[/i], I would be negligent if I pretended the mechanics of play lived up to the game's otherwise high standard. The foremost issue I have is the series of binary dialogue options the player must use in response to the AIs *Hyun-ae and *Mute. This is explained as a technical limitation on the part of the protagonist's computer interface with said AIs and their ship, and while this fiction might excuse the crudeness of the mechanic better than other visual novels do, it's made frustrating by the way the player's responses are framed by the game.

Having played two of Christine Love's other titles (Digital: A Love Story, and Don't Take it Personally Babe, it Just Ain't Your Story,) and enjoyed them, I went into this knowing to expect a good story, and one that was quite possibly heart-wrenching.\n\nIf you're a reader, or into old feminist works, you will immediately notice the resemblence to The Handmaid's Tale, which is about a society where women are more or less just baby machines, and rather than being based off the Korean Joseon period, it's about a Christian fundamentalist society. I read it as a high schooler, and it was at times one of the most harrowing and eye-opening books I'd read.\n\nAnalogue is like that, and it's even more harrowing when you realize it's not far off from what the historical basis was like. It forces you to wonder \"why? Why would people even consider doing this?\" especially as it grows more and more horrific. You don't know which characters to like or trust, especially as *Hyun-ae and *Mute present very different views of the logs and what happened. Though, keep in mind, *Mute is the product of the Mugunghwa's society, and *Hyun-ae...well, she's arguably a bit more progressive about women, but you'll see the why of it is a bit more complicated. You are forced to question and consider the roles of both AIs and people like them in a society like this, as well as the other women in the logs, and the various men. Nothing can be read in black and white.\n\nYou realize that if you grew up in a society like this, what we see as being unacceptable would be what you see as what's right. You may short-circuit a bit, because the actions taken against the society are arguably more or equally wrong.\n\nThere are so many elements to this that you note as you play it once, twice, more than that, that it becomes deeper and deeper. The story fleshes out as you hear both AIs' sides of the story.\n\nMy only real gripes are these: I wish it was more interactive, and having to go through all the AI commentary on the logs is tedious.

It doesn't go with the sterotypical cliche of the characters parents being killed when they were young, or that they never had parents. The story is as follows, you're sent on a mission to extract information from a abandoned ship the Mugungwa (I may have misspelled it, it's hard to remember because it's Korean) to see what exactly happened to it. When you reach it you need to access one of the A.I to guide you through the information. You get to choose between two A.Is, *Hyun-ae or *Mute. Both have pretty interesting personalitys and have their moments. Now this is all i'm going to say because I don't want to spoil the entire thing, but I will tell you this. You get to change what outfit *Hyun-ae is wearing, you can choose between things like a scientist, a detective, a maid and other things, it's adorable and I love it. Also one thing to note that it is for adults, a lot of sexual things and violence, however the sexual part can acutally be pretty funny,\n\nIf you're looking for an engaging and interesting story, you've come to the right place. \n\nAlthough i don't quite recommend its sequel, Hate Plus. It's not bad but it has flaws that Analouge didn't have. You play the game in 3 different days to reach earth to do some stuff. Each day you uncover more informations from the Mugungwa's files and uncover more parts of the story. For one once each day is done, you have to wait exactly 12 hours real time to play again, and that's pretty dumb. Also, like Analouge, It has sexual stuff and violence, it even describes lesbian relationship, but that's not really bad, but it did make things pretty awkward. Another thing and *SPOLIERS!!!!!*\n\nAt the third day, it's some special occasion and *Hyun-ae will tell you about how much she loves cake before she became an A.I (Yeah, she was a real person and became an A.I... Because plot.) and wants to have a cake, so you and *Hyun-ae decide to bake a cake. However this isn't a virtual cake, she wants you to make an actual real life cake. That's when I stopped playing, I get it that it's adorable and how she's and A.I and you're a person and it's a relationship going on and it gives it more character to make it more engaging, but i really didn't want to put in effort to bake a homemade cake, i'd rather just buy cake mix and do it. And besides, I may be a sad pathetic loser, but i'm not that much of one that I would share a cake with a girl inside a computer. \n\nCase closed, Both games are good, but I prefer the first one over

Discovering what happened on the ship has its fair share of juicy twists and turns. Good shit \ud83d\udc4c\n\n[b]* A remarkable example of hard working developer research, put to great use.[/b] The fictional setting draws parallels to ancient Korean culture, in regards to the universe, characters, world view, and other details. (This wasn't localized! It was completely made by someone English. Both the obvious examples and subtle references to Korean dynasties of long ago are super impressive)\n\n[b]* Three dimensional characters whose personalities, growth, emotions, and motives are explored.[/b] Well, technically they are two dimensional, but... you get the point. Don't be fooled by the \"A.I.\" interface. This story is full of people who are undoubtedly human and their development is one of the main highlights of the experience.\n\n[b]* Solid UI, artwork, and a wonderful soundtrack.[/b] The OST is on steam too! The aesthetics aren't just high quality, they also fit really well considering other aspects of the game.\n\n[b]* Player interaction is a huge plus as well.[/b] Considering that the game definitely has some emotional impact too. I won't get too into it because of spoilers. There are also 5 different endings. You can save/restore at any point, so as long as you keep a save before any major decisions then 100%'ing is easy peasy. Don't worry, most of the endings don't require much backtracking.\n\n[h1]Neutral / Notes:[/h1]\n\n[b]* Make sure you go through the different endings.[/b] I'm thinking of two of them especially, due to the important plot resolutions that only occur during each individual one.\n\n[b]* When it comes to VNs, this is definitely a bit less \"visual\" and a bit more \"novel.\"[/b] There is a lot of reading, specifically logs. There isn't as much dialogue as you might expect, although there is certainly enough and it is very effective. Well, that being said... not only the player choice but also the open parts of player exploration are key to the overall experience. It wouldn't work as well if it were a literal novel either. Overall I'm glad the devs chose this format. VN players more fond of bright artsy types with lots of interacting may be a [i]little[/i] thrown off though.\n\n[b]* This is probably worth going through in one go.[/b] Getting one ending doesn't take too long, although it does depend on how fast you read I guess. My reasoning is that between the complex structure, Korean names, and overall captivity the story has, if you leave it for a long while some of the details may be lost when you return. I mean I went to grab lunch and came back fine, but don't get halfway and then forget about it for a month.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n[b]* The setting could have been explored more.[/b] I talked about the cultural aspects a lot, because that's what Analogue focuses on. But it could have focused at least a little on the science fiction part of the setting. It takes place on a spaceship! Granted it's a big one designed to send an entire people to start a colony, but this doesn't come up as often as I'd hoped. For the most part you could really completely forget that this isn't actually an ancient society. Aside from an awkward puzzle bit, the game does not explore the futuristic concepts. This also leads to a plot hole regarding AI and humanity, but I got over that pretty quickly.\n\n[b]* I wish the game had a bit more contrast in certain areas of the plot.[/b] Now, this one is [i]a bit nitpicky,[/i] but I didn't want to include only one possible negative. That'd be kind of silly. Anyway, I found myself thinking as I played this, \"Wow! That's so much different/worse than my own experiences...\" While this effect is executed really well, it could have happened on a character vs. character basis a bit more. The cast includes primarily high-society upper class people. The majority in poverty is mentioned, but it isn't explored enough to draw a contrast between the two. Also, aside from one main character (that conflict was handled in an AMAZING way!), society is very similar minded. This is done for a good reason, and the characters are great, varying in personality and niceness and redeemability and all of that stuff, but I ended up hoping for a bit more direct conflict as opposed to the indirect conflicts of people under one worldview.\n\n[h1]Misc.[/h1]\n\nI'm a bit iffy about the sequel. This one wrapped things up very very nicely, and the different endings left just enough up to interpretation that after it was all over the story had a lasting effect on me. Haven't played the sequel yet though, so don't take my word or anything. Fingers crossed! I can't say much else without spoiling the first one. Sorry.\n\nSheesh, this took me quite a bit of time to write. Didn't realize it was so late already.\nTL;DR: if you like VNs and haven't play Analogue: A Hate Story yet, hop on it! \n\nIf you have any constructive feedback, go right ahead! I appreciate it.

Allerdings bietet das Spiel mehr an, als ein Buch bewerkstelligen k\u00f6nnte.\n\nDie Handlung dreht sich darum, dass man als Spieler den Auftrag erh\u00e4lt, die Geheimnisse des Kolonie-Raumschiffes \"Mugunghwa\u201c zu l\u00fcften, welches seit einer langen Zeit als verschollen gilt. Dies tut man, in dem man die Logs (oder besser gesagt, die \u201eTageb\u00fccher\u201c) der dort damals ans\u00e4ssigen Bewohnern liest und allesamt herunterl\u00e4dt. Allerdings stellt sich schnell heraus, dass man wegen technischen Problemen nicht einfach so nach den Logs suchen kann, sondern eine (weibliche) AI diese rausfiltern und dem Spieler zur Verf\u00fcgung stellen muss.\nEntsprechend wird man in diesem Spiel sehr viele Tagebucheintr\u00e4ge lesen. Doch man wird sich auch sehr oft mit den AIs unterhalten. \u00dcber die Geschehnisse, die auf dem Schiff passiert sind\u2026. als auch \u00fcber deren Meinungen und Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten.\n\nEs mag ziemlich komisch klingen, dass ein [i]Dating-Sim[/i] [b]2 weibliche k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenzen[/b] beinhaltet.

Man muss sich diesen Zustand im Verlaufe des Spiels (im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes) erarbeiten! Oder man kann dies auch komplett ignorieren und sich nur auf die \u201eeigentliche Arbeit\u201c konzentrieren. Und je nach Pers\u00f6nlichkeit der AI wird sie auch entsprechend darauf reagieren.

I almost couldn't bring myself to finish the game.  The horrors of living in a closed backwards society with no escape or enlightenment are overwhelming.  Only the knowledge that this is still happening and will continue to happen in the absence of reason gave me the courage to face the truth of the human beast.  It's not something we should try to hide from or sweep under the rug.  It reminded me of the determination to continue I felt when playing The Walking Dead or Game of Thrones from Telltale Games.

I also imagined that getting that out of the way quickly was the right way to do things, and then I could go back and and fill in some more background details and side stories and whatnot. As it turned out, I hit a certain turning point very early in my gameplay, picked a side without really realizing what I was doing, and just sorta got to an ending, with a pile of logs unread. It had been intriguing and interesting, but I felt like I missed most of the game. So then, of course, I immediately started it over again. And that's when it really became great.\n\nThe characterizations of both AI characters, first of all, is excellent - not just in their backstories and interactions, but in the fact that they're both kind of annoying and they're both kind of wrong. It's refreshing, and it makes the game's atmosphere really 'work' - you're not trying to find the 'right answer', you're trying to find the truth. Really, one of my few complaints would be that I want to experience more of the world (the setting is established, but most of the game is character-focused), but that's hardly a fault, and if Hate Plus serves that purpose as I suspect it might, it's no fault at all.\n\nThe one quibble I do have is that the console screen creates expectations that aren't met. The fact that you're past a certain turning point is only indicated by a vague-sounding error (since you can still shift power around and such) that initially made me think I had done something wrong, and I spent quite a bit of time trying to carefully manage that situation to accomplish something that it turns out is simply impossible. This isn't helped by the fact that the 'copy' command, as far as I can tell, doesn't ever actually serve any purpose.\n\nRegardless, though, the dialogue, the characters, the story - all of that is very well done, and since that really is the heart of the game, any issues beyond that are fairly trivial. It is a fairly short game (7.5 hours for 100%, and that's spending probably the last hour tracking down a block of logs that's only unlocked by asking *Hyun-ae a question I had assumed she would respond badly to), but it's absolutely worth experiencing.", "timestamp_created": 1467937754, "timestamp_updated": 1467937754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24158798": {"recommendationid": "24158798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013156635", "num_games_owned": 664, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467901847}, "language": "english", "review": "Story of hatred, mass murder, regressing cultures and exploding reactors.\n\nIt's cool to see a game set in a different culture, but the unusual names kinda blend together, which makes telling the background characters apart difficult.

So I though, \"What the hell\" and gave it ago. I remember buying it because I am a fan of Sci-fi, Horror, and Transhumanism which is something that the company really pushed with this games advertisement.\n\nThe story was above average when compared to the high quality stories from World End Economica or Fault Milestone but it  really kept me entertained. Having to piece together all the political aspects and the motivations of all the characters by reading the logs was very different from everything else. Interacting with the Mute and Hyun ae was solid and really helped to flesh out their characters and their beliefs. This story takes itself seriously and really doesn't go in the direction I and most likely anyone who has played this game thought it would. The game as a whole can be very unnerving and will cause you to pause as you read certain sections, making you feel for the characters and even though fictional, calling into question what your belief systems are and making you wonder just how far would you go if ever crippling hatred caused you to break.\n\nSo far i've only gotten endings 2 with 87% completion on my first try and ending 4 with 63% completion but I am definitely going to look up a guide to getting all the endings.\n\n\nSo I guess it all comes down to this.....Do I recommend it?\n\nWell....yes, yes I do. \n\nThe game as a whole when it comes to visual novels has a rating of 8/10 from me. That is hard to achieve in my book and I don't rate all games at that level.

This believe this game was in the $1 tier. \n\nThis is not your typical VN, but it was a very refreshing, albeit short-lived, experience. While there is an acceptable amount of dialogue to be had between both the AI characters you interact with, the bulk of the game's story comes in the form of journals, logs, letters, and diary entries that you read through. Additionally, actually having to use a computer terminal for various functions makes the novel more involved with the player's direct actions, but the novelty of the mechanic can wear off on subsequent playthroughs. If anything, I wish that the game expanded upon this a bit more, and perhaps with a bit less hand holding.\n\nThere is a LOT of reading required in order to grasp the story fully, so should you play this game I highly recommend making sure to pay close attention to what you read to get the most out of it. If info dumping is not your thing, this game may be lackluster to you. Having read all of the logs in the game, I found myself enjoying the story and drama from those moreso than my interactions with either AI. This is not to say that I didn't like the AI characters. Both had enjoyable quirks to their personalities, but I found myself wishing for more dialogue with them by the time I had finished.\n\nWhile this game is NOT an eroge by any means, there is an element of romance in the game, and certain logs and entries you read through are mildly explicit.  It is not without plot significance, so just be forewarned. Minor context spoiler: [spoiler] The explicit scenes described do not involve the player character, but rather, other characters recounting their activities. \t[/spoiler]\n\nMy only real issue with these logs, which I do not fault the game for, was minor difficulty in name recognition. While there are in-game resources to assist with this, all of the game's character's are Korean, which I had difficulty putting to memory.\n\nIt took me under 5 hours to sub-optimally get all achievements in this game. Playtime is short for a VN, but minor complaints aside I was plenty satisfied with my game experience. For what effectively was a single evening of plot dump, I would be very hard pressed to pay a full $10, but if you see this game on sale and are looking for an entertaining story, consider picking it up.\n\nThere is also a direct sequel to this - Hate Plus.

It's a little bit diffrent then \"normal\" VNs. It tells the story with letters of dead persons but let me explain:\nYou play an \"Space Detective\" who has a mission to discover an old generation Ship wich got lost hundreds years ago. When you enter the spaceship you'll meet Hyun-ae. She is not a living human but a computerprogram. She is the only person who interacts with you. Together you'll try to get accses to the database of the ship. You'll find diary entries and documents of the people of the ship. They are more then 200 Years old. While you gather deeper and deeper in the story of the ship and of Hyun-ae you'll meet another program: Mute. She is against Hyun-ae and blame her for what happens to the ship... But then you must made an decision....\nReading all the letters from an past civilisation and interact with the two KIs is very fascinating. Every letter you read can be shown to the KIs and they will comment the content. So you can get hints of whats happened and how you'll act later. Discovering all the story makes you feel like a real \"Space Detective\" and makes fun! Its very suprising how well the VN Works with so much Visual Content. The Background is white and you only have one of the KIs at your side all the time. But the story is generating by reading the reports about a lot of diffrent people so you get in the affairs of them and eventually discover the bis secret wich sorround Hyun-ae and Mute...\nIts another way of makeing an VN but i can just recommend it!

It's not a bad game, per say, but coming off of Digital, it's attempts at moral quandaries mixed with mediocre art and a dumb cast are at best quaint and at worst cripplingly mediocre.\n\nThe good thing about both these games, however, are their status as freebie games, and their short run times.\n\nGameplay wise Analogue resembles Her Story, only less interesting and more traditionally minded. The affection mechanic for the featured anime girls is underdeveloped to say the least, and while her exploration of feudalism and gender politics are actually beat, God dang if this game isn't a chore to play and not enthralling enough to push through that.\n\nIf you're wondering, I did complete this game, via a walk through because midway through the endless periphery text no longer held surprises, I just wanted to get to the end to see if there was a point. Instead I got a harem? What? If this is about gender politics then why do I end up with two digital women on my analogue schwanz?

You can beat it once, discovering about 50% of the story and thinking that you don't need the rest, but soon you will return, feeling that you must see the whole picture.\n\n[spoiler]For me personally, ending 4 (or the Mute's route in general) seems the most reasonable, mature and completing the story. Hyun-ae's route seems more childish and fanservice-like, let alone the Harem Ending.

I only wish the game had more freedom in how to discover the plot.

The setting created is very interesting, with this fusion of futuristic and medieval, and the themes the story present are well-developed. The revelations in the end are dark and heavy, but adequate to the tone of the story.\n\nHowever, some moments were not - some of the dialogue becomes too much like a dating sim, and it's kinda jarring.

Your being paid to just get as many files and get out but you end up with so much more. \n\nAfter loading though the clukly terminal an AI loads, she can help you debug and find a bunch of files. Reading them really brings to life the world, the AI and what unfolded to make this *perfectly servicable* vessel uninhabited. \n\nSpoiler incoming, the AI you meet after running her program asks you some rarther personal questions which are used for possible achivements and are the first few branching points in the early game. She has a very interesting backstory [spoiler] She was frozen, sent forward in time praying for better medicine. It does not exsist, traditional gender roles are enforced and coming from the past she has none of it. So her new parents maim her throat, she cannot back-talk anymore and is married off to the leader. In her hate for the future she breaks into the command terminal, shuts off life support and uploads herself into the computer. Everyone dies.

Like I said, I enjoyed it and it can be fun, especially due to the political/cultural aspect, which is something I personally like. However, the story simply isn't that strong.\n\nTo begin, the story is paper thin and mostly centers around 'the Pale Bride' -- a name which suggests more mystery and intrigue than the game eventually reveals. The plot is focused on what happens with this Pale Bride and what happens to the inhabitants of the ship. There are actually quite a few other mysteries, but the game never even tries to resolve them, so those two are the ones that receives focus. Meanwhile, the story that the game does focus on tends to be nonsensical most of the times and mundane at other times.\n\nThis is alright as this is an indie game and short one at that. I don't expect the developers to perform magic by creating a mind-blowing story in such circumstances.

LeGuin, Margaret Atwood, or a pre-awful-human-being Orson Scott Card.\n\n[i]Analogue[/i] is, essentially, a virtual epistolary novel--a phrase which here means \"a book made of documents from random dudes/dudettes.\" Much like the now-lauded [i]Her Story[/i], it's up to the reader to piece together what happened to wipe out an entire ship of potential planetary colonists. Here's a hint, folks: AWFUL THINGS.\n\nBoth AIs--*Hyun-Ae and *Mute-- are engaging characters, but it's *Hyun-Ae who steals the show in this installment. (*Mute gets her own time to shine in the follow-up, [i]Hate Plus[/i].) *Hyun-Ae is likable, mysterious, and somehow unnerving all at once. As the player learns more about her, they begin to realize that there's quite a bit *Hyun-Ae is hiding...and *Mute might have good reason not to trust her.\n\n[i]Analogue[/i] is, by the end of the story, one of the darkest games I've played. Even the joke ending can't erase the horrors that led an entire ship full of human beings to its death.

You find that its crew is dead and only the ship's AI is remains to keep you company.\n\nAs you play through the story you discover information about a woman called the \"Pale Bride\" who was forced into a patriarchal society and the downfall of the crew as a whole as a result of it. The story is told mainly through text logs that show letters, diary entries and such with some input from the AI personalities that exist within the computer, *Hyun-ae and *Mute, both representing opposing views on the matter of how the ship's society operated. *Hyun-ae is the woman who hates the ignorance and cruelty of the men and women who blindly accept the traditions and world views forced on them, while *Mute is the maiden who sees no problem with the world and happily agrees with and is very protective of the old gender roles.\n\nThe themes are quite mature and depressing, much more so than what you might expect looking at the screenshots. The people described in the logs are mostly awful people, if not by choice then by simply not understanding the opposing point of view, and reading through their entries was really painful at times. I could practically feel my stomach churn as I read the final log.\n\nAs for the VN itself, the way it tells its story is quite interesting, as it's mostly you simply investigating text logs. Most of the story takes place in the past and you are merely reading about it as an outside observer, not as a participant. This also makes it that much more painful when you realize that you could do nothing to stop the events that unfolded. The one complaint I have would be regarding the reactor malfunction part, which is somewhat infuriating if you just came for the story. Outside of that, the story and presentation is fine and unique enough to set it apart from most other VNs out there. There isn't as much artwork as most other VNs as it all takes place inside a holographic interface, but I'm fine with that. After all, the story is the important part and not the graphics, but what little there is of it is pretty good. There are multiple paths to take and I would strongly suggest you explore them as well just to get a bigger picture and see how the viewpoints of the two AI personalities conflict.\n\nI'd recommend this VN to people who are a fan of the medium and maybe even those new to it. Just know that the story is a bit darker than the initial impressions would have you believe.", "timestamp_created": 1450976742, "timestamp_updated": 1507927043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506039", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19905329": {"recommendationid": "19905329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134653495", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 317, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513076817}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ub300\ub7c9\ud559\uc0b4\uacfc \ubd88\ub95c\uc744 \uc639\ud638\ud558\uba70\n\uadf8\uac83\uc744 \uc815\ub2f9\ud654\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ub0a8\uc790\ub4e4\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud574 \ub0a8\uc131\uc5d0\uac8c \ud638\uc758\uc801\uc778 \uc5ec\uc131\ub4e4\uc740 \ub610\ud55c \uc8c4\ub2e4 \ubbf8\uac1c\ud55c \uc871\uc18d\uc774\uba70 \uc624\uc9c1 \ub0a8\uc131\uacfc \ub300\ub9bd\uac01\uc744 \uc138\uc6b0\ub294 \uc5ec\uc131\uc774\ub098 \ub808\uc988\ube44\uc5b8\ub9cc\uc774 \ud604\uba85\ud55c \uc5ec\uc131\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \ubb3c\ud0c0\uae30\ub97c \uc2dc\uc804\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc774 \uac8c\uc784\uc5d0 \uc758\ud558\uba74 \uc870\uc120\uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \uacb0\ud63c\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc5ec\uc131\ub4e4\uc740 \ubd88\ud589\ud574\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\uc65c\ub0d0?

The logs, in my opinion, are both a good and bad design choice. It\u2019s good because it\u2019s up to your imagination to process what is going on. On the other hand, it feels like I\u2019m reading a history book all over again! Maybe it\u2019s all the dates and charts that makes me feel that way, but I think it could have been handled a little better. \n\nThe game did not need player choices since the backstory mattered more than the characters, but it was neat that they included that. One player choice in particular had such a good and elaborate setup that I consider it most memorable moral choice in any visual novel I have played so far. I\u2019m not going to spoil what it is, but you\u2019ll know it when you see it.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to both visual novel fans and people who have not played a visual novel before. \n", "timestamp_created": 1449736779, "timestamp_updated": 1449736779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500485", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19571749": {"recommendationid": "19571749", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993557288", "num_games_owned": 1484, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 704, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442042086}, "language": "polish", "review": "To Visual Novel - wiadomo, cz\u0142owiek si\u0119 nie nagra, a do popatrzenia te\u017c niewiele - w tym konkretnym przypadku grafika jest wyj\u0105tkowo ascetyczna.

In the game, you are investigating a generation ship that disappeared 600 years ago and has just been found. You\u2019re tasked with finding out what happened by reading through the ship\u2019s logs. The ship has two AI which can help you with your mission, though they aren\u2019t particularly reliable narrators.\n\nGameplay mainly consists of reading through the ship\u2019s logs and asking the AI about them, who may then open up new logs for you. The main interface for accessing the logs is slick, attractive, and very easy to use. There is also a Linux console interface which you use to perform certain actions on the ship, such as enabling or disabling the AI, or downloading the log files. As someone who has never used Linux I found this interface a bit puzzling at first. It\u2019s the first thing you see when the game starts and it took me a few minutes to figure out what it was expecting me to do.\n\nThe most exceptional part of the game is the writing. The logs, written as diary entries are enthralling. There are multiple authors and each one has a clear and distinct voice. They paint a picture of a spacefaring society that has somehow regressed into a medieval patriarchy. You don\u2019t get access to all the entries though, and often get things out of order, so you need to piece together the story for yourself. Depending on which AI you have active, you may learn some parts of the story but not others. It\u2019s quite well done.\n\nAs for the interaction with the AI though\u2026 ehh. One AI is a giggly, cosplay-loving schoolgirl. The other is a casually misogynist and homophobic security program.  If I had known nothing about the creator of this game, Christine Love, I likely would have written the game off as sexist drivel and quit before I got too far in. However, I assumed that there was probably going to be a bigger point or message to the game, so I continued.\n\nI haven\u2019t played a ton of visual novels before, the most similar experience I\u2019ve had to this was Long Live the Queen. An aspect of the genre I find hard to reconcile is that I want to see multiple endings, but the process of replaying and trying new things to get to those endings is exceedingly tedious. Careful use of saves can reduce the amount of repetition, but it\u2019s hard to know exactly when the important branches take place and I find myself mindlessly clicking through things I\u2019ve already read/seen way more than is enjoyable.\n\nVerdict: Recommended for those who like the genre. The writing is strong and the story is compelling. While I personally don\u2019t enjoy the repetitiveness required to experience all of the endings, I think this game will appeal to fans of visual novels.", "timestamp_created": 1448638569,

I was really sold on the main character, and deeply moved by the history that unfolded. YMMV as always but this game really made me feel the desperate sadness it was aiming for. \n\nAnalogue has a delightfully minimalist intro and u/i that really rewards effort on the player's part to discover the context for the story, so I would not recommend looking up any of the lore before you play - if you don't want to spend some time piecing it together for yourself then you won't enjoy the game anyways!", "timestamp_created": 1448198710, "timestamp_updated": 1448198710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19214208": {"recommendationid": "19214208", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068097401", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447846734}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best visual novels I've ever played.\n\nThe premise is simple, yet compelling. You are a nameless, genderless, ageless space investigator sent to read the logs of the long-dead in order to understand what happened on board the generation ship, Mugunghwa. You do this with the assistances of two AI, *Hyun-ae, a young woman, and *Mute, the ship's security system. They are the powerful personalities that make this game worth playing, and if you're anything like me, you will fall in love with them both.\n\nWarning: the logs deal with physical and emotional abuse aimed towards children. It also explores homophobia, speifically towards lesbians, misogyny and classism. Forgive me if I spelt any of those words wrong.\n\nAnalogue's gameplay is entirely text based. You will be reading log after log after log. Initially, the logs aren't that interesting, but very quickly, I was drawn into the game. The GUI is sleek and actually does feel like a futuristic computer. It's simple and easy to use, and it's unlikely you'll ever get lost. The most confusing it gets is when you need to prompt the AI to search for more logs by clicking on logs written by the particular person you wish to investigate.\n\n(I hope that sentence made sense).\n\nThe real focus of this game is the AI, although Analogue focuses more on *Hyun-ae then *Mute. (*Mute's game is Hate Plus, the sequel to Analogue, which I also recommend you buy). I won't spoil anything, but through these women, you're confronted with some serious moral ambiguity. Actions and beliefs that are objectively terrible are rationalized, and suddenly you're not sure what to think.\n\nThe minor characters are basically every person you'll read about in the logs. They all serve their purpose; no-one is focused on so extensively that they over-shadow everyone else. Moreover, they all feel like real people. The logs are well written and feel genuine...although I do feel the lesbian sex between too women was written in more detail then strictly necessary.\n\nYour choices matter in this game, btw, particular when you're finally given the option to stop being a genderless and ageless entity. Whether you select male or female will influnce one AI significantly.\n\nOverall, this is a very good game. It's heart-felt, its well-written, its fascinating, and its cheap.

Haven't gotten around to the second game in the series at the time I wrote this post, so my review is based on only this first one and what I've completed of it thus far.\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10\n    For a low priced VN (9.99) the graphics were pretty amazing. I wasn't expecting the graphics to be were they were, so it was very nice to be surprised by this. \n\nGameplay: 8/10\n    Probably one of the most interesting things about this VN. It is a VN, so don't expect 3D action, but man were some of the puzzles and choices intruiging. The puzzles were not hard, but not necessarily easy. One of them even gives an alternate ending, which is interesting. I also like the computer aspect where you have to type in the information via the keyboard. Over-all. it was an interesting style and I would love to see more styles like this.\n\nCharacters: 7.5/10\n    The characters were also quite interesting. Both girls had their own unique personality, making you either hate or like them (I liked both personally). The design for both of them were also nicely done, adding more to the uniqueness of them. I didn't rate an 8 due to the fact that only one of the 2 had a in-depth background while the other was given some, but nowhere near as much as the other. (Might change after getting rest of trophies)\n\nStory: 7.5/10\n     The story was really, I mean really. interesting. It took place in a spaceship out in space. You have a possibility to end up with 1 of 2 girls (or both if you get the harem ending) or obtain the bad ending. This much is common in most VNs, but the uniqueness of this one is the files and history. Both the files and certain options you make will give detailed information about the past of the game's story. Then there's the fact that the story of the second game is determined by what ending you got in the first one, a little twist not seen in most. Put simply, a wonderfuly (but short) storyline with interesting twists.\n\nOver-All: 8/10\n    I would most certainly recommend this to both begginers and advanced VN readers.  =(^,.,^)=\n\nNominated for the \"Woah Dude\" medal. =D", "timestamp_created": 1447739713, "timestamp_updated": 1480013362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19109470": {"recommendationid": "19109470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030956258", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402289440}, "language": "english", "review": "A reading simulator", "timestamp_created": 1447658225, "timestamp_updated": 1447658225, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19101129": {"recommendationid": "19101129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048054765", "num_games_owned": 1570, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460383112}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game I highly recommend.

The ship is silent, it's crew long dead, the only remnants of life are the two AI programs Hyun-ae and Mute. Together you dig through the archives and records trying to piece together what went wrong.\n\nThis game is it's own prequel in a way, you already know how it ends you just need to take the journey to find out how it got there.

This \"unreliable narrator\" mechanic is what makes a visual novel so much more interesting and entertaining than conventional book novel.\n\nThe first few entries aren't that exciting, but as I uncover more story along the way, they gives me the urge to continue on. The logs are so carefully crafted, that almost every entry contains a mystery that tickle my curiosity to find out what happens next. The plot are mostly dark and sad, full of love and hate. The few happy moments in the game helps to further contrast the rest of the sadness.\n\nThere are a lot of waifu moments in the game. I am not a big fan of waifu games, but I do find them quite entertaining in this game. They serve as great timeouts in-between reading, helps me clear my mind and combat read-exhaustion.\n\nThere are a few occassions that you need to type some unix-like commands into the ship's console. There is also a timed-puzzle event in the game, which is very easy to solve if you're a gamer. In my opinion, these puzzle elements are completely unnecessary and breaks the mood for novel reading, but they do enhance the unreliable-narrator mechanic and further establish the 2-distinct personality of the AIs.\n\nThe background music is very nice, a mix of Korean-Asian styled theme played with clean modern-futuristic digital music. The music also blends nicely with the mood of the logs you are currently reading, as well as the personality of the current active AI you are interacting with.\n\nThere is one thing that I struggle in this game: I find it very difficult to remember Korean names. I had to re-read many logs to fully understand what's going on sometimes.\n\nIf you do not hate reading, this novel is definitely worth a try.\n\n[h1]For achievement hunters[/h1]\nA minimum of 4 play-thrus are needed to 100% this game.

What I liked was that the game doesn't take very long to complete, even with the branching storyline, and it's a well written story. There's only one traditional \"adventure game\"-type puzzle, which is the nuclear reactor, but it's easy to solve. The real puzzle is trying to see all of the log files and getting all the endings, to try to get the best picture you can of what happened to the spaceship and its inhabitants. Normally, in any one playthrough, you would not be able to see everything, but in a metanarrative sort of way, since you can go back and start over, you can combine your knowledge from different playthroughs to put everything together. Another game which does this is \"Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors.\" \n\nMost of the game is spent reading. Once you've played through once, you can skip reading the log entries that you've already done, and you can skip any dialog with the AIs, making it easier to get to the other branches. This game is a visual novel, but instead of showing text in a small 4-line box like most Japanese VNs, this game uses the full screen to show text, which I liked. \n\nAs for the story, I liked it. The inhabitants of the spaceship, in the years covered by the logs, live in a society based on a historical period of Korea. There's a real struggle for the main character, who is really like a time traveler from today's world, to be understood and to try to live in this society. The only thing I wish is that there were more written about what happened on the spaceship. You only get a glimpse of the lives of a few characters, momentary fragments in time in the form of letters, diary entries, or other notes. \n\nOverall, an excellent game.", "timestamp_created":

A visual novel based around Korean history where you progress by showing documents to cute AI women is probably a concept that either appeals to you or doesn't.  However, it's well implemented, and the story it's telling is a lot more interesting than it first seems.  I only have two problems with it: Firstly, the opening is hopeless.  The initial set of documents you get are some of the most aggressively boring in the whole thing, and the most interesting story arcs it has are hidden away and unlikely to be found in a first playthrough.  Secondly, it feels a bit reversed.  The sequel has logs from before the logs in this one, but takes place after it for the purposes of the 'you romance cute AI women' subplot.

Read the clues, note if there is some additional information, read the new clue. Layered on top of that you have a \"discussion\" (approve/disapprove option) with the AI's which has story consequences. If you're looking for anything more exciting than that, move on. There is one more exciting sequence that uses an DOS style interface to interact with a mainframe computer, but FEAR this is not.\n\nStorywise: Solid. It's pretty upfront about what big mysteries cannot be solved, though it does suffer from an overbundance of side characters (once I gave up on trying to remember who was who I enjoyed the game much more. The ones that mattered stuck with me). That said, it is exploring a cacooned society on a space ship through diary entries, and things may be trigger-y for some people, and is definitely created from a feminist perspective.\n\n[spoiler] Specifically, one of the main characters is a 13 year old girl who gets married to a 40 year old, after her spirit is broken. There is also clear condemnation of a lesbian relationship. And the general (intentional and story-relevant) world-vibe of \"the woman's place is in the kitchen\".

It tells a very impactful and well-written story about discrimination, hate and vengeance, that will most likely move you deeply and make you think about the problems it touches on, even if you don\u2019t fully agree with the positions it takes.\n\nThe UI and graphics are very thematic, fitting the sci-fi setting and nature of the storytelling very well. Most of the game consists of reading through messages and logs of the ship, databases of which you\u2019re exploring as your main mission. Be prepared for a bit limited interactions and a lot of text, but I think all of it is written well enough and offering such an engaging story, that unless you\u2019re super-impatient you\u2019ll never feel bored \u2013 especially because there\u2019s a bit of investigative element to it and it\u2019s quite enjoyable to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. There are only two characters other than player, both of them A.I., but they actually have quite a lot of personality and conversations with them are interesting.\n\n[b]There are some confusing mechanics later in the game, so don\u2019t feel bad about using a walkthrough, especially for the one timed section. Other than that, I don\u2019t really see many negatives about Analogue. If you don\u2019t fix on its agenda in unreasonable ways, you\u2019ll find an exceptionally crafted and memorable story, that will stay with you for a long time. It can\u2019t really be called \u201cfun\u201d, considering the its heavy, often depressing themes, but it sure is compelling and that\u2019s the one thing I truly care about when approaching a VN[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1441135395, "timestamp_updated": 1504353310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17789574": {"recommendationid": "17789574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088642130", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 602, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423357706}, "language": "koreana", "review": "[h1] \uc815\ub9d0\ub85c.. \uc644\ubcbd\ud558\uac8c \ub054\ucc0d\ud558\uace0 \uba4d\uccad\ud55c \uc8fc\uc7a5\uc774\uc8e0. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub54c\ub294 \uadf8\uac8c \uc815\uc0c1\uc774\uc600\uc5b4\uc694.[/h1]\nAnalogue: A Hate Story\ub294 \uce90\ub098\ub2e4\uc778 \ub808\uc988\ube44\uc5b8 \ud06c\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud2f4 \ub7ec\ube0c\uac00 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ub178\ubca8 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc73c\ub85c, \ud2b9\uc774\ud558\uac8c \uc870\uc120\uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ub0a8\uc874\uc5ec\ube44 \uc0ac\uc0c1\uc744 \ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uac8c\uc784\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc606\ub098\ub77c \uc911\uad6d\uc774\ub098 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc744 \ubc30\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \ub9ce\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud55c\uad6d \ubc30\uacbd\uc758 \uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc801\uc5b4\uc11c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud588\ub294\ub370, \uc815\ub9d0 \uc758\uc678\uc758 \uba74\uc73c\ub85c \uac8c\uc784\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\uc8e0. \n\n\ud55c\ud3b8 \uc81c\uc791\uc790\uac00 \ub808\uc988\ube44\uc5b8\uc774\uc5ec\uc11c \uadf8\ub7f0\uc9c0 \ub3d9\uc131\uc560\uc790\uc758 \ube44\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \uc0b6\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub3c4 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uace0, \ud6c4\uc18d\uc791 [\ud5e4\uc774\ud2b8 \ud50c\ub7ec\uc2a4]\ub294 \uc544\uc608 \uc774\ucabd\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ucee8\uc149\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uc758\uc678\ub85c \uc218\uc704\uac00 \ub192\uc740\uc9c0\ub77c \ud638\ubd88\ud638\uac00 \uac08\ub9b4 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uc788\uc5b4\ubcf4\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\ubc30\uacbd\uc740 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc6b0\uc8fc \uac1c\ucc99 \uc2dc\ub300\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uc2dd\ubbfc\uc9c0 \uac1c\ucc99\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c \ucd9c\ud56d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098 \uc18c\uc2dd\uc774 \ub04a\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ubb34\uad81\ud654\ud638\uc758 \uae30\ub85d\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c \uc8fc\uc778\uacf5 \uc870\uc0ac\uad00\uc774 \ud30c\uacac\uc744 \ub098\uac04\ub2e4\ub294 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ub85c\uadf8\ub4e4\uc744 \uc77d\uace0, AI\ub4e4\uacfc \uc18c\ud1b5\uc744 \ud558\uba74\uc11c \ubb34\uad81\ud654\ud638\uc758 \uc9c4\uc2e4\uc744 \ud558\ub098 \ud558\ub098 \ud30c\ud5e4\uce58\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uac8c\uc784\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc740 \uadf8\ub0e5 \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc640 \ub300\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uc560\ud558\uace0 (\uc0dd\ub7b5)\ud558\ub294 \uc5ec\ud0c0 \ubbf8\uc5f0\uc2dc\uc640\ub294 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \uc6b0\uc120 [\uc624\ubc84\ub77c\uc774\ub4dc \ud130\ubbf8\ub110]\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac8c\uc784\uc774 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uac00 \ub41c \ub4ef\ud55c \ucc29\uac01\uc744 \uc8fc\uac8c \ud558\uace0, \ud50c\ub808\uc774 \ud558\ub2e4\uac00 \uc9c0\ub8e8\ud560\ub54c \uc57d\uac04\uc758 \ubd84\uc704\uae30 \ud658\uae30\ub97c \uc2dc\ucf1c\uc8fc\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. \uce90\ub9ad\ud130\uc5d0\uac8c \ub85c\uadf8\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub85c\uadf8\ub97c \uc77d\uc5b4\ub098\uac00\uba74\uc11c \ubb34\uad81\ud654\ud638\uc758 \ube44\ubc00\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\n\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub294 \ud761\uc785\ub825\uacfc \uc81c\uc791\uc790\uac00 \ub9d0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uc758\ub3c4\uc758 \uc804\ub2ec\ub825\uc774 \ub300\ub2e8\ud588\uc73c\uba70 \ud2b9\ud788 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4\uc758 \ubc88\uc5ed\uc774 \ucd08\uc6d4\uae09\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.

The game's themes focus similarly around human/computer interaction, interpersonal relationships, and LGBT issues; but focus primarily on \"transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness and cosplay.\"[/quote]\n\nIf you're interested in sci-fi, socials or intense storytelling with at last some mature topics, you don't do anything wrong in buying. As a Visual Novel, there isn't much to say about gameplay other than reading, exploring files & clicking on stuff. Make up for the simple gameplay is the story (that's why they call it \"novel\"), music & background. Analogue don't need the heroines full nudes or encounter extreme situations to be a \"good\" visual novel. \n\nThe story is very deep (even though it was short) which caught your attention just after few \"log\" and have 5 alternative ending (even the bad ones) that [strike]can satisfy any gamer[/strike]. Both 2 main heroines: Hyun-ae & *Mute are wonderfully developed through the story, making me sometime forgot they are AI [spoiler]Hyun-ae is way too adorable with her cosplay thing[/spoiler]. I was a little disapointed that it was quite easy. Not so much detective work and only two passages where you could use the console somehow free and creative. The art is done well, as is the writing, there isn't really anything just remotely bad about the game, what you expect from a VN is what you get, and what you get with this is great.\n\nIt's a novel I would gladly recommend to anyone who is willing to share his or her time to enjoy a nice written piece of art, with beautiful graphics and a nice and intuitive interface.", "timestamp_created": 1438790423, "timestamp_updated": 1438790423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17393622": {"recommendationid": "17393622", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971948490", "num_games_owned": 1722, "num_reviews": 93, "playtime_forever": 1155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1377184766}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those games where it's more about the atmosphere it creates and the emotions it inspires than the actual content.  It's definitely gameplay-light, almost at a text adventure level, so it's definiltely not for people who can't play a game without shooting things.  \n\nAs it's largely about reading through the logs of a Korean starship, it's initially extremely confusing to Western eyes, as it's very hard to keep straight who all the characters are.  The logs are written like you're just overhearing a few other people's conversations, and so it's often filled with references to people who never appear in the logs again, or are important, but at the start, it's hard to tell what is or isn't important.  \n\nIf you bear through it for a few hours, however, you find it's largely focused upon a tiny handful of individuals, and is an extremely personal story.\n\nThe funny name of this game is an inversion of Christine Love's first (and available for free) game, Digital: A Love Story. (Get it? It's a love story, but it's written by someone [i]named[/i] Love, so it's also a Love story! Ha... ha... Anyway...) While Digital was set in the past, and its themes were about how people looked to the future, Analogue is set in the future, and about a society that wants to send itself back to its past.  \n\nThe author, Christine Love, has, and puts in everything she makes, strongly-held and strongly-expressed ideas about women and lesbians in particular.  Korean (and by extension, Chinese,) traditional patriarchy clashes brutally with these themes.\n\nInversely, the AIs the player deals with are almost too colorful and anime-esque for the drama in front of which they are standing.  The 'real' action is long since passed, and the player really only has a choice of taking one or the other (or why not, take both!) along with him or her.  It's a minor issue here, and a much worse one in Hate Plus, but the story in the logs has an entirely different mood and themes than the one the player actually participates in with the AIs, which is far more about describing yourself and your point of view to the AIs.  In essence, if you took out the log reading, it's just the player flirting with girls in a standard Visual Novel with an unusually large number of choices.", "timestamp_created": 1438745118, "timestamp_updated": 1438745118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479249", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17326244": {"recommendationid": "17326244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058777344", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 570, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473499672}, "language": "koreana", "review": "OST\ub3c4 \uad1c\ucc2e\uc740 \ud3b8\uc774\uace0.\ud604\uc560\uca29\ub3c4 \ubaa8\uc5d0\ud558\uace0.\uba54\uc774\ub3c4\ubcf5\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0.\uc774\ub7f0 \uc5ec\ub7ec\uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc18c\ub4e4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubc84\ud2f8\uc218\uac00 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \ucd94\ucc9c", "timestamp_created": 1438396168, "timestamp_updated": 1438396168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.977376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17302049": {"recommendationid": "17302049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071441898", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511915656}, "language": "english", "review": "It was okay.\n\nI found Analouge: A Hate Story to be kind of boring and uninteresting.\n\nIn the beginning, you're an individual sent to find out what happened to a ship who's entire crew died. You do this by accessing a terminal and going through the logs and diary entries. You have two A.I's who guide you through it on your quest to discover the truth and what happened her. However the question of \"How did everyone die?!\" gets wrapped up surprisingly quickly within a few minutes after talking to a new A.I you obtain named *Mute, and then switching back over to the other A.I to question them about the new information. Basically at that point you just need to use your imagination and \"boom\" you know what happened. At least, if you're keeping an open mind to how this happened. You'll figure it out long before you find the truth which is very disappointing.\n\nThe game revolves around a family drama on a marriage dispute and the personal life of a specific person. Also about how women are treated in this family.\n\nI found this really uninteresting and boring. I didn't care to remember anyones name except the Pale Bride the drama was about, because I wanted to know about her life. She was the only person I had any interest in and needed to know the truth about. Everyone else was faceless, mundane, shallow, boring, obnoxious, idiotic and moronic.\n\nI think that the logs could've been easier and more fluid and interesting to look at and switch between. Because this game is all about reading the logs and pressing questions on the A.I you're currently partnered up with. Because sifting through the logs got really messy as I progressed through the game and the overrall reading screen presentation was really boring as the screen was just deadpan text.\n\nAnyways, the music was nice in the game. I think it kind of lacked the functionality to cue perfectly for emotional and important logs you read. But the music was nice to listen to and sort of dragged on sometimes. But either way, didn't really mind the music, could've been more emotional/better though.\n\nThere's times in the game you have to enter commands like\n\n>enable_ai *Hyun-ae\n\nand\n\n>power_control enable core1\n\nAnd things like that. Those parts were kind of fun actually since I never really get to mess with those kinds of things and the game made a pretty nice puzzle segment on the terminal commands. And I thought that was pretty good and fun.\n\n\n\nAnywho, after I learned about the Pale Brides entire life and how the entire crew died. I immediately quit because there was absolutely nothing interesting left in this visual novel for me. I didn't care about getting the 5 endings and I honestly only spent roughly ten minutes with *Mute. I didn't like her at all and she was gossipy and annoying.\n\nThey made Hyun-ae constantly try to fall in-love with you over the game and I found that annoying, I get 'why' she was doing that. But I still think the game could've been more mature and just cut that bit out. It was obnoxious and didn't really provide and depth to the story or the A.I's character\n\n\nAll in all, Analouge: A Hate Story I found to be an okay experience. I personally couldn't find any reason to bother playing/reading after learning about the crews fate and the life of the Pale Bride. Maybe you will enjoy whatever else this game has to offer.\n\nI have HATE PLUS and I will probably read it since it has a question I want to know in it, so I want to know the truth.\n\nSo I got this game and HATE PLUS as a gift, I don't recommend the full retail price, but at the same time I think it's reasonable and fair. I just simply didn't enjoy it, however 20 dollars for a bundle of this game and the sequel doesn't sound unreasonable. I think you should get it on a sale however if you choose to buy this video game and possibly the next game.\n\nThank you for reading, I hope my review aided you in your decision if you want to buy this video game or not.", "timestamp_created": 1438279198, "timestamp_updated": 1438279198, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.433315", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17274416": {"recommendationid": "17274416", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090139950", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 33, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438129718}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "naum sei", "timestamp_created": 1438128779, "timestamp_updated": 1438128779, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17271983": {"recommendationid": "17271983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077063794", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427143277}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game for people who think Ulysses is a readable novel, or that Dark Souls is 'slightly difficult'.", "timestamp_created": 1438116730, "timestamp_updated": 1438116730, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.417052", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17237644": {"recommendationid": "17237644", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109032187", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437920526}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucca8\ubd24\uc744\ub54c  \uac4d  \uc624\ub355\uac9c\uc778\uac00 \uc2f6\uc5c8\ub294\ub370,\n\n\ub9c9\uc0c1  \ud574\ubcf4\ub2c8\uae4c  \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ubc29\uc2dd\ub3c4  \uc694\uc998\uac9c\uc774\ub791  \ub2e4\ub974\uace0  \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \uc88b\uace0\n\n\uc5b4\ub290\uc21c\uac04 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c  100% \uac9c\ubaa9\ub85d\uc744  \ub298\ub9ac\ub824  \uc0b0\uac9c\uc744  \uc9c4\uc9c0\ud558\uac8c  \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub124\uc694\n\n\n\ud560\uc778\ud560\ub54c  \uc798\uc0b0\ub4ef", "timestamp_created": 1437927605, "timestamp_updated": 1437927605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17228679": {"recommendationid": "17228679", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971019043", "num_games_owned": 808, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1354608000}, "language": "english", "review": "The game was super fun, and told an interesting, dark science fiction / historical fantasy story.\n\nBut the achievements took a lot away from me because of the flippant way that they identified the ending course I took.

Bittersweet is about the best you can get out of the ending.  I really can't give many more details without blowing it.  Also there's a minigame of sorts involving using commands in an old command prompt style terminal part way through the game and it is timed(although they do give you a generous time allotment to do so) so be ready for that when it comes up.

Imagine if you read a book and once in a while a friend pops in to ask your opinion on what you read.\n\nMusic\nThe music is fitting even if it does leave some desire for more.

This has to be the best visual novel ever! What could possibly go wrong? \n\nWell, just about everything because this game is something that belongs to every social justice warriors game collection. Game is practically a tool for feminist (and I mean feminist in the bad way, you know what I mean) propaganda, is filled with (the usual) half-if-at-all thought and contradicting morals and values that are pushed right down your throat in every single turn possible. Story completely ignores both cultural and individual differences, has no place for a voice of reason or common sense and throws all middle grounds out of the window. In this game you are either a sick monster (you know, a white male heterosexual) with your opinions or a liberal fairy without a gender identity. \n\nThings we learn from the story are that \n1) having a gender is a bad thing \n2) marriage and family is even more so \n3) tradition is always bad and should just be erased along with everything not fitting into anarcho-liberal thoughtbox\n4) all men perceiving themselves as males are evil and/or stupid drunks and the only one worth your feelings are those puffs that \"surprise you every day\" with agreeing to everything you say\n5) all women are stupid slaves (and of course evil) unless they think the way script writer does \n6) having a child is the worst that could ever happen \n7) good women enjoy sex with strangers and try to be lesbian while cheating their husbands if possible\n8) [spoiler]it is OK and fine and recommended to perform a genocide, killing thousands of innocent men, women and children, if you have been treated like shit at some point in your life\n[/spoiler] \nYes, seriously. \n\nThere are multiple endings (for a person in his/her right mind, perhaps only one) but they are not that rewarding. Story ends, you'll get an ending screen with some vague nonsense and credits and that's it. There's a few concept art to be unlocked and the trophies but they really are not worth subjecting yourself to the stuff you will be fed.\n\nIt's a shame really as technically this was pretty good for a visual novel. It had its moments and a decent writing. The other AI in the game, *Mute, was perhaps a little more sane than the main character. Actually the moment with her was probably the best part of the game I think. I'm pretty sure there is some ideology pushing behind her too depending on the choices you make though.

different reasons, the first that hit me is the whole concept of the story, you're a simple space investigator that is investigating a wasted-away old and big spaceship where tons of people used to live in it. The first thing you see in this game is a \"console\" where you can interact with the main computer, you will be forced to choose to boot one of the two AIs (you can switch beetween them during the game), [b]Mute or Hyun-ae[/b].\nThose two are the main characters and they've have a completely different behavior and way of thinking, they have both different and awesome backgrounds, one is the main AI that controlled the whole spaceship, she knows everything of everyone and she doesn't like the other one, Hyun-ae. Hyun-ae is a girl of an of old era that was put in cryostasis by her father for centuries because she got a disease that could not be healed in her times, so her wishes were to be healed after centuries where hopefully the medicine was more advanced, but something went wrong after she quit the cryostasis.\nThey're both well written, everyone of them got different soundtracks and different ways to answer to your questions with well made face expressions.\nThe soundtracks are great, well placed and put exactly where the atmosphere needs them to be, i think that they're great too expecially in some parts of the game.\nI wont say more on the AIs because i don't want to create spoilers but i would spend some hours talking about them. \nThe interface is pretty and well made, i really felt that it was a computer interface, even if the AI were much more human than i expected.\n\nYour job is to search between tons of logs to reveal and discover the true story behind the destruction of the spaceship with the help of the two AIs, at first you will feel lost in this sea of logs but when you keep discovering things the puzzle will complete itself with some reasoning. The feel of feeling confused because the story-telling is purposely put in a way where you will discover mixed parts of it. You will discover how the people used to live in that spaceship, the [b]Mugunghwa[/b], the traditional society where people lived in, the sturdy classism and so on (trust me there is a lot to say about this). Almost everything in [b]Analogue[/b] leads to deep meanings, why don't the AIs like eachother (or i should say they hate eachother)? Why was everyone so evil with the [b]Pale Bride[/b]? What has she done? Why is everyone dead?\nSimple questions, difficult answers with very deep meanings, sensations and reasons.\nThe game has 5 different endings and i only unlocked one of them in 5.2 hours.\n\nI liked a lot this game, i recommend [b]Analogue: a hate story[/b], it's worth its price.

So let's break this down into pros and cons, shall we?\n\nPros:\n+Great anime-style art\n+Interesting and thought-provoking story\n+Very well written, I really appreciated the language used and the format of the story\n+Fun gameplay style\n+\n\nCons:\n-Doesn't hold your hand, this is only a con if you don't like thinking\n-Not a lot of action, but remember this is a VN\n-It's pretty short if you're only looking for one ending (there are several)\n-I found a typo... I'm really just nitpicking here. Honestly there aren't many cons.\n\nThis is one of my new favorite games. The story is exceptional, and the author is willing to tackle some big issues and really make you think about morality and what it means to be human. The characters are compelling, even though there are only two of them (besides the player), and the gameplay is very interesting. Basically you play as a space explorer on  a mission to figure out what happened to the Mugunghwa, a derelict space ship, by reading the ship's logs and correspondence from its inhabitants. The interface is a lot of fun to play with, and I especially like the command console where players are able to input commands directly into the ship's computer (such as enable_ai, power_control, decrypt files, etc). Overall, this is definitely a \"must play\" for any visual novel fans.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

Pocos juegos se animan a contar historias no lineales donde el jugador debe juntar pieza por pieza e interpretarla seg\u00fan sus experiencias, y Analogue: A Hate Story hace esto medianamente bien.\n\nAntes de comenzar, debo decir que esta VN, por su contenido, ritmo y est\u00e9tica, NO ES PARA CUALQUIERA. Es decir no porque tenga contenidos que sean dif\u00edciles de interpretar, sino por como es el titulo en comparaci\u00f3n con otras VN donde el lector debe, valga la redundancia, leer la exposici\u00f3n de la historia a medida que los eventos hacen de veh\u00edculo para proseguir. Habiendo dicho eso, puede que te aburra a los primeros minutos f\u00e1cilmente porque no hay nada que le sea parecido a la estructura de una VN convencional. Sin embargo si pretendes leer algo que no sea fanservice puro, con clich\u00e9s que se dejan ver muy pronto y una narrativa que involucra temas no tan convencionales en el g\u00e9nero. Aunque sera el deber del jugador dilucidar cu\u00e1les son ya que el titulo te los entrega por piezas para luego armar el rompecabezas.\n\nLa historia nos pone en un futuro donde la humanidad ha podido viajar por las estrellas, teniendo avances incre\u00edbles en la tecnolog\u00eda. Un detective (sin dejar muy en claro si lo es) es contratado para investigar una colonia espacial que desapareci\u00f3 hace siglos atr\u00e1s sin dejar ning\u00fan tipo de rastro de su tripulaci\u00f3n o pistas que aclaren qu\u00e9 fue lo que sucedi\u00f3. Dentro de la colonia, tendremos la asistencia de una IA llamada *Hyun-ae, quien nos aclara que desde el incidente de dicho lugar nadie mas ha interactuado con ella, mostrando cierta necesidad de entablar una conversaci\u00f3n con el personaje de vez en cuando. A pesar de su actitud tranquila y accesible, nos esconde algo detr\u00e1s que no se evidencia muy de repente, pero si que hay varias piezas que encajan en todo esto, como por ejemplo la negaci\u00f3n al hablar de ciertos temas, la misteriosa ignorancia de algo que funciona desde el d\u00eda 1 en la colonia como  una bit\u00e1cora inteligente y la suplantaci\u00f3n de quien seria la otra IA encargada de vigilar y mantener la colonia.\n\nM\u00e1s adelante se introducir\u00e1 otra IA denominada *Mute, quien desde su mirada nos aclara que hay algo que se oculta entre ella y *Hyun-ae, mas aun cuando ambas tienen personalidades muy diferentes y sus puntos de vista en lo que respecta a la tragedia de la colonia espacial es muy dispar, pero que presencian una misma tragedia. Obviamente el contenido de la VN va m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de los evidenciables conflictos entre las IA, aparte de ello hay otras historias secundarias que sirven de refuerzo (ciertas de ellas) para ambientar al lector a qu\u00e9 tipo de personas habitan la colonia, cuales eran sus estilos de vida, las diversas peleas entre dos familias muy importantes y alguien en especial quien termina siendo el art\u00edfice de una tragedia, mas bien, alguien quien vivi\u00f3 con un enorme remordimiento. Aunque tambi\u00e9n tocan otros temas un poco m\u00e1s complicados de digerir como el machismo nacido de un sistema patriarcal, infidelidad, amores prohibidos, problemas familiares, abusos y otros que han una peque\u00f1a gala en la historia. Con lo cual, aclarando nuevamente, no es una VN para iniciados, m\u00e1s bien, para un publico \u201chardcore\u201d (si es que los hay en el g\u00e9nero).\n\nEn tanto a gameplay, podremos leer las diferentes entradas de bloques donde se ira desvelando los misterios de la colonia, no solo eso sino que podremos tener una peque\u00f1a opini\u00f3n de lo que le\u00edmos y a veces nos dar\u00e1 el acceso a otras entradas importantes. Otro aspecto importante del mismo es la consola de comandos de la nave, donde tendremos que usarla para hacer diferentes tipos de cosas como activar una IA habilitada, descargar los archivos que hayamos juntado de la colonia, desencriptar bloques de entradas ilegibles y otros comandos que ser\u00e1n esenciales en un determinado punto de la historia donde el asunto se pone bastante tenso. B\u00e1sicamente el titulo se resume en desbloquear la mayor cantidad de entradas hablando con cualquiera de las IA's disponibles y resolver el misterio de la desaparici\u00f3n de todos los humanos de la colonia.\n\nSin embargo, y hay que admitirlo el juego nos da much\u00edsima exposici\u00f3n continua sobre eventos que no se interrelacionan efectivamente, siendo algunos relevantes y otros f\u00e1ciles olvidables. Esto lleva al jugador a leer cosas que no aportan mucho frustrando la experiencia de la historia. Tambi\u00e9n se a\u00f1ade los diferentes nombres de las familias y sus integrantes que est\u00e1n en conflictos siendo un total caos al tratar de entender sus linajes y comunicaciones en las entradas, ademas de tener en cuenta que estas est\u00e1n desordenadas en tiempo. Como punto final los escenarios no son muy originales que digamos y puede aburrirte muy r\u00e1pidamente sumando los otros aspectos denominados, aunque el resultado de todo esto es a causa de una historia complicada cuyo evento catastr\u00f3fico de importancia se puede resumir en tan solo 20 palabras pero que se da la molestia de darle contexto al g\u00e9nesis de la tragedia de la colonia.\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story es complicado de seguir, tanto que podr\u00eda clasificarse como pretencioso el cual en ciertas ocasiones lo suele ser, pero en general es una VN que tiene toques oscuros, depresivos e intensos. La longevidad depende mucho de cuanto quieras empaparte en las entradas de la colonia y con que IA te lleves mejor, por sobre todo a quien de ellas creer y apoyar su mirada en todo esto. Si bien el gran final carece de impacto es una experiencia que te mantendr\u00e1 curioso al respecto a pesar de que para ser una VN, es bastante at\u00edpica.\n\n[b]7/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1430012284, "timestamp_updated": 1430012284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606740", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15546973": {"recommendationid": "15546973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038538734", "num_games_owned": 353, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430000134}, "language": "english", "review": "By far the most interesting visual novel I've played.

A Dark But Great Anime Visual Novel.[/h1] \n[list]\n[*]Genre: Anime Visual Novel. \n[*]Developed & Published by: Love Conquers All Games \n[*]Platform: Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.\n[*]Business Model: Base Game. \n[*][i]Copy Purchased by Myself[/i] \n[/list]\n[b]Preamble[/b]\nMy first foray into the Anime Visual genre got started on a darkly toned story. No, I didn't know what I was getting into. But, I don't think I couldn't have started off on a stronger note. \n\n[b]Overall Story Thoughts[/b]\nAnalogue starts off light enough. You\u2019re an investigator, hacking into the Mugunghwa, a colony ship that lost contact with Earth a long time ago, and are greeted by a cheerful AI who\u2019s just happy to see anyone communicate with her. She can talk to you but you can\u2019t talk to her due to a translation problem/mcguffin. Yes/No/Maybe are the answers you can give her. So, you need to read the ship\u2019s logs, point the AI to one of them and see what they say about it. Put clues together and figure out what went wrong. It\u2019s when you discover the second AI that things start to get a little distributing. I won\u2019t say anything more specific because that will run into spoiler territory and really, this game is all about the story. \n\nThe story can be a bit hard to follow at times. Logs are setup to be read at your own pace and in the order of your choosing though the game makes sure that they\u2019re relevant regardless of when you read them. However, I found that the usage of Korean names can make it hard to follow who\u2019s who. The game doesn't really give you any straightforward tools to keep things straight. There are notes on pronunciation (which is very helpful I might add) and the two main family trees. However, I wish I could click on each name in the family tree and get a short bio about them (and maybe even get a list of information I\u2019ve found about them up to this point) to keep things straight. I didn\u2019t feel like I got my head wrapped around who was who until the later half of the game. For 59,000 words, I\u2019d say the story is a bit more dense with lore, name usage and politics than the average story. But it gives you a really good sense of what the ship life and people involved were like so long as you\u2019re willing to get invested.  \n\n[b]Override Terminal[/b]\nWhat really caught my eye was the override terminal that gets used in the game at a couple of moments. It\u2019s a variation of a Linux Command Line Terminal that you use to perform certain actions on the ship\u2019s computer. It really sells that you\u2019re actually hacking into the ship. The terminal is easy to use and the help prompt will give you all the necessary information. I really liked this feature and I hope to see other games use it. \n\n[b]PC Settings[/b]\nTypical settings for games of this genre are here such as text speed, skipping read text and animations on/off. Audio sliders for music and effects are available as well. Resolutions are restricted to 1024x640 and 1024x600. Those are some...odd resolution choices to say the least. If you, understandably, don\u2019t have these resolutions available, the game will be up-scaled and/or letter-boxed to match it. The game looks fine up-scaled. For an AVN, there is a lot of attention to detail and great use of UI to sell the futuristic aspect of the game. It does feel like something a future OS might look like. \n\n[b]Atmosphere & AI Characters[/b]\nIt\u2019s a good looking game for an AVN. The music creates a great electronic atmosphere to pull you into the game. It does repeat pretty often but it\u2019s subtle enough to prevent it from becoming annoying. There are romance options with the two main AIs if you wish to pursue them. Otherwise, they can be skipped, aren't gratuitous or ridiculous if you do wish to pursue them. Considering they\u2019re the only people you can interact with in the game, there\u2019s a lot of weight riding on their shoulders to be interesting characters. And I think they\u2019re pulled off really well, each containing surprises you wouldn't expect. A minor side note: you can change their outfits as well. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nThis game gets [b][u]dark[/u][/b]. It comes up to the gratuitously dark line and stops itself just short of it to its credit. I really liked this title. As an introduction into the AVN genre, I don\u2019t think I could have chosen a better title. The mystery, the futuristic setting and serious dark tone are well executed. The music and graphical presentation really sells the experience as well. While it can be a little confusing at times with names and culture references, if you\u2019re willing to get invested it can a rewarding experience.

By reading each log entry, you are given more of the story and what starts out as a simple, \"salvage,\" mission, turns into something that I became engaged in as a player and as the character I was playing as.  This is one of the few games in which I've genuinely cared about the characters and the story.  Sure, The Walking Dead had plenty of characters I liked, but this game had my face litterally no more than six inches from my screen as I read through the text.  This game had moments in which I laughed out loud, stopped to process what I had just read, go back and re-read text files multiple times, feel shocked, and, believe it or not, disgusted.  I'll admit that I originally got this game for a certain achievement (I think you all know the one) but I eventually became more focused on the story.

This was my first crack at a visual novel of this style and I gotta say that I really enjoyed the experience. This is different because you aren't spoonfed the story. You're free to discover many different ways to view and interpret the logs. During my final playthrough I wound up coming across information that I'd never seen before that gave me an entirely different perspective of the storyline. Some people won't enjoy this game because there aren't any funky backgrounds or pictures and actual gameplay is lacking, this is almost entirely reading but if you like to read this won't bother you.

So I'm going to be as honest about the game as I can, without discrediting the creator.  First things first, I LOVE Digital:  A Love Story.  It was immersive, engaging, and overall a nice game to play.  I liked the characters, I loved the setting, I seriously loved that that game.\n\nNow, Analogue:  A Hate Story on the otherhand...  This \"game\", takes inspiration from the first, but is more story oriented than gameplay oriented.  Well, let's be honest, there wasnt any real \"gameplay\" in either itteration.  It's more like an interactive story than anything.  So to be clear, the first one had you doing stuff and actually let you connect the dots in the story.  While this one is a WAY more self explanitory story.  Anyway...  I finished the first game.  But this one couldnt keep my attention.  I found myself getting bored with it, every time I tried to play.  The story wasnt bad, but it just didnt resonate with me.  I felt like the story was becoming a little agressive in the way of the creators politics.  It became almost like I was reading a strongly opinioned blog that had nothing but agression towards the \"Patriarchy\".   As a man, I kinda started feeling like this story wasnt for me, and was directed towards a \"certain\" audience (like a fox in a henhouse kinda feel).  And after each story, the caracters kind of pressure you into choosing the \"right\" answer.  Choose the \"Wrong\" answer, and things will take an OBVIOUS turn for the worse.\n\nI stopped about 3/4 of the way in, and just lost interest in it entirely to the point where I uninstalled it.   \n\nWould I recommend this game?  That depends...  None of my friends would like this kind of game anyway, so I cant say for sure.\nSo dont let my thumbs down discourage anyone else from buying it.  I just didnt like the story as much as the first one (and the first one was free).\n\nI will say this though.  I praise the graphic artist for such great work on the character models.  They fit wonderfully with the characters personalities.  \n\nStory:  Meh/10\n\nGame Play:  Reading/10\n\nArtwork:  School Rumble/10  (This is a good rating :3)\n\nOverall Verdict:  Feminism/10  Would fight patriarchy again.", "timestamp_created": 1427469436, "timestamp_updated": 1427469436, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558881", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15070216": {"recommendationid": "15070216", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984309692", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427417867}, "language": "english", "review": "Analogue a Hate story is Cyberdyne Waifu simulator.

I do remember seeing the trailer, and being intrigued by the thought that there was more to this story than there seemed to be. \n\nI wasn't wrong in the least. \n\nWhile I don't have a solid basis for comparison, I do think that the minimalist style, smooth animations and unobtrusive soundtrack really complement the game. The focus is on the story that your A.I. of choice is telling you, and nothing else...with the possible exception of the A.I. themselves. The differences between *Mute and *Hyun-ae are profound, and only become more so as you spiral down into the mystery of the ship. While ultimately, the story here is *Hyun-ae's, *Mute's perspective provides a counterpoint essential to seeing *Hyun-ae's actions in the right light. When you're reading the story told by both women, captivated by the pieces of the puzzle falling into place, the mood can turn rather intense. \n\nThough there is humor here, too. *Mute is remarkably crass, given her programming, and the levity her sass lends some serious situations is appreciated. *Hyun-ae is playful in her own right: should you befriend her enough, she will display different outfits for you, letting you use the in-game terminal to play a limited form of dress-up. \n\nSpeaking of the terminal, that and a Yes/No dialogue wheel will be the principle ways you assert yourself in-game. It's actually a nice mechanic. There are several times where the terminal comes in handy, and it's pretty intuitive to use. I also found the UI - probably due to that minimalist feel - comfortable to pick up. \n\nAll told, I couldn't find much wrong with Analogue. It was a wonderful introduction to the visual novel genre, and I plan to pick up it's sequel, Hate Plus. Might look into other visual novels as well, if they're half as good as this one.", "timestamp_created": 1427373892, "timestamp_updated": 1427373892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510204", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15042020": {"recommendationid": "15042020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143037911", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427229042}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has been out for a while and I don't know who else would still buy it so I'll keep it as short as possible.

women's roles in society and familial and cultural traditions. Taken place aboard a long abandoned spaceship of the past, an intelligence agent stumbles upon this craft in order to retrieve important intelligence, only to be surprised by the things he/she finds inside.\n\nThe Good:\n\u2022 Features more interactivity than standard Japanese VNs\n\u2022 A neat addition of a \"command system\" minigame that involves inputting command codes into a computer system which is used to interact with the two heroines and the spaceship itself\n\u2022 A detailed, emotional, yet disturbing story with realistic characters\n\u2022 Various viewpoints depending on each heroine\n\u2022 A cute dress-up game featuring Hyun-ae (one of the heroines)\n\nThe Bad:\n\u2022 A rather bleak UI compiled onto a solid white background\n\u2022 The email log method of storytelling can become quite confusing & sometimes rather boring\n\u2022 Little romantic interaction for those who are looking for a heavy romance VN\n\u2022 An unimpressive OST with a lot of replayed soundtracks\n\nWhat makes this VN different than others?:\n\u2022 This is a story about hatred, hardly romance or love. This focal point in itself makees this VN a truly unique reading experience.\n\u2022 Storytelling through logs of the past. Very little text takes place during real time & 99% of the information you acquire about the heroines is through these logs.\n\nOverall, compared to other VNs, the art and music is rather bleak and character interaction is limited, as most of the text comes from logs of the past. But fortunately, the storytelling is strong enough to evoke emotions of empathy for these heroines through strong character development. \n\n6/10 [Good] - My review was subpar, but at least the game wasn't.", "timestamp_created": 1425956564, "timestamp_updated": 1426221851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14816603": {"recommendationid": "14816603", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998273415", "num_games_owned": 679, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425001731}, "language": "english", "review": "[table]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]AUDIO[/h1][/td]\n[td]Moody[/td]\n[td][h1]VISUAL[/h1][/td]\n[td]Animu[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]DIFFICULTY[/h1][/td]\n[td]Moderate[/td]\n[td][h1]VIBE[/h1][/td]\n[td]Desolate[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n[td][h1]CRAVING[/h1][/td]\n[td]Fresh Text Adventure[/td]\n[td][h1]ON SALE[/h1][/td]\n[td]Occasionally[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]PROS: [/b]Atmosphere is engrossing, it's easy to want to finish this game in one sitting. There is a fair amount of content to read through over the course of all endings. I found it surprising that segments with the command prompt were super engaging and fun! Interface is different from most other VNs, though easy to adjust to.\n\n[b]CONS: [/b]Being unacquainted with traditional Korean names made it tough to really grasp what was going on through my first play-through. Their length and foreign nature made it hard to visualize what was happening. Visual novel stills in the form of photographs or single frames taken from \"security cameras\" would have been a great aid. A single playthrough is a bit short. More direct interaction with Mute and Hyun-ae would have been nice.\n\n[b]WORTH: [/b]I thoroughly enjoyed this story and think it's worth purchasing at full price. If you don't plan on donig more than one play-through however, you may not get as much time out of it as I did.\n\n[b][u]OVERALL:[/u] [/b]A general synopsis of Analogue is deceptively uninteresting compared to experiencing it first-hand, something I don't see very often with text adventures.

Basically all of Christine Love's work is, but these are just amazing.\n\n\nI actually like Hate Plus more in some ways and Analogue more in others. So I'm torn as far as which is better, but I can safely say that they were both well worth the effort. I have like 4 hours on this game, but I actually played it through multiple times--I read insanely fast--and can safely say that I'm glad I did so.\n\nWriting: Best part, honestly. Love's writing is able to be expressive and emotional with ease. Characters have their own voices, their own personalities--and with this many characters, you better believe that's a feat. Nothing is over wrought or underwritten. This is an episolatory Visual Novel, and it works.\n\n\nGraphics stuff: I liked the interface. The console part was the least impressive, and some people might find it rather hard to believe considering the advanced tech--though keep in mind that the ship is only a few hundred years ahead of us in its origin--but its a callback to Love's earlier freeware game, Digital: A Love Story and reminded me a bit of the Amie interface. The two AIs are Animu waifu material. No way around that. The art is good quality, though, and their expressions are both endearing and rather genuinely funny. Mute's a bit more expressive, but that fits the character. \n\n\nMusic: It's good! However, it's far from amazing. Digital: A Love Story's soundtrack was PERFECT and I want it rather badly--Analogue and Hate Plus's is decent and I wouldn't mind paying a few bucks for it. There were a lot of good chances to use music to set scenes that were passed up.\n\n\nAll in all? 10/10. Yes, it's not perfect, but a 10 isn't for perfection. It's for games that leave me either thirsty for more ad infinitum or games that after I play them I turn the computer off, stumble into bed, and think lots of big, scary thoughts. This game and its sequel do both.\n\n\nTry it. It's only $10.\n\n\n(Also, if you're still unsure, try Digital: A Love Story and \"Don't Take it Personal, Babe, it just ain't your story\" which are both free and by the same person.)", "timestamp_created": 1425715725, "timestamp_updated": 1425715725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14722476": {"recommendationid": "14722476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049964330", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425286957}, "language": "english", "review": "To start it off:\n\nIf you want a story of tragedy, time-skips, mystery, love, and hate in a Visual Novel with a lot of story reading, this is the game.\n\nWhy I recommend you get it:\n\nI'm normally not the type to read story or backgrounds in a Visual Novels unless they hook me in with a good intro. The intro didn't have a really strong one but since I was livestreaming it, I continued on. When you learn the first mystery, I got hooked and reeled.\n\nEventually, you'll learn of what happens to a whole colony in a spaceship that went missing for 600 years, inhabitants missing and the only witnesses are computer AI's.\n\nGameplay is like Phoenix Wright where you read some stories, ask the AI's about the stories that seem questionable (or spam like the original Phoenix Games), and they'll reveal more diaries and logs from the inhabitants. \n\nEventually, you'll learn what happened to them, why, and how you decide the fate of the AI's in the end. It's not a story of love. It's a hate story, a story where you find the AI's cute, but in the end, it's just to cover up a cruel past.\n\nHope you guys do enjoy it. ^^", "timestamp_created": 1425292816, "timestamp_updated": 1425292816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14720161": {"recommendationid": "14720161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011584592", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1398388292}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubb34\uad81\ud654\ud638\uc758 \uc717\ub300\uac00\ub9ac \uc0c8\ub07c\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac74 \uc8fd\ucc3d\uacfc \uc804\uae30\ud1b1\ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc8fd\ucc3d\uacfc \uc804\uae30\ud1b1\uc740 \uc774\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc544\uc8fc \uc88b\uc740 \uc120\ubb3c\uc784\uc774 \ubd84\uba85\ud558\ub2e4\n\ubd80\ub974\ub989- \ubd80\ub989- \ubd80\ub2e4\ub2e4\ub2f9 \uc704\uc774\uc774\uc774\uc774\uc774\uc774\uc774\uc774\uc774\uc789- [\uc804\uae30\ud1b1 \ub3cc\uc544\uac00\ub294 \uc18c\ub9ac]\n", "timestamp_created": 1425270052, "timestamp_updated": 1425270052, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14717579": {"recommendationid": "14717579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072072986", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469371920}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, this is certainly not for everybody, but HELL I recommend it!

The art is nicely down for the characters.  And...well, it's quick.\n\nCONS: This visual novel has many failings.  The two female AI's are both rather unlikeable, both their actions beforehand and after.  They try to give a sympathetic reason to make their actions acceptable, but it fails.  The story is relatively dull, and the endings don't really feel satisfying.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS: Relatively simple, no real problems getting any of them.\n\nFINAL: The visual novel's failings are it's major downfall.

Having some of the most indepth characters, fantastic music, and more philosophical themes than your body can handle, Analogue: A Hate Story is a story that will leave you intrigued to the very end...if you are an avid reader and like philosophical stuff.\n\nPros:\n\n- The themes it deals with are some of the most unique and untouched upon subjects I have ever seen in any game to this date. Dealing with interpersonal relationships, LGBT, transhumanism, and loneliness. It certainly isn't cliche.\n- Isaac Schankler is one of the most musically talented people I have ever had to pleasure to listen to. Buy the soundtrack, now.\n- Other things that would delve into spoilers.\n\nCons:\n\n- If you're not a person that reads books often, prepare yourself for a problem. See, Analogue isn't a traditonal visual novel focused around dialogue and art. No, it's more minimalist. Being next to only text. It's litreally wall after wall of text. This isn't a bad thing, but if you're not an avid reader it will be daunting at best.\n- Not an ideal entry point as your first visual novel, no I have better things for that.\n- Could've been maybe just a tiny bit longer.", "timestamp_created": 1424847595, "timestamp_updated": 1424847595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14643703": {"recommendationid": "14643703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076456917", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425180754}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only played through it once so far, but I found it a satisfying experience.

But, despite the lack of subtlety, this game really gets you thinking about its center topic (sexism) a lot, so I gave it a pass.\n\nWhen it comes to mechanics, this game really knows how to create an immersive experience. Most of the things you see on the screen are diegetic so you might as well turn off the lights, put some headphones and pretend you are in the vicinity of a derelict spaceship, trying to learn its secrets through a computer terminal on a ship of your own.\n\nThe only thing that really bothered me, was that while using the terminal, I found myself pushing tab or the arrow keys the way as someone using UNIX or Linux would and though there's no real reason for the game to behave exactly as these systems it's kind of nice to have it respond to you the way you'd expect. It makes it for an easier and more comfortable interface. \n\nAnyway, this game was a very interesting approach to visual novels and I really enjoyed playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1424837527, "timestamp_updated": 1424837527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14628332": {"recommendationid": "14628332", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993692909", "num_games_owned": 1108, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424739785}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like reading walls of text and try to make sense of it, you won't go wrong with this game.

This is by no means a game for everyone, but if you like reading books that do not shy away from heavy subjects and social issues, this is probably a game for you.\n\nThis story explores a real period of history with extreme gender inequality, but puts it in a science fiction setting. The start is a little hard to get into, but soon enough a highly compelling mystery story emerges, touching on topics as surpression, marital problems, abuse, forbidden love, and having to adapt to a society that is not your own. It is not pretty and some parts may be hard to read, but the interpersonal, psychological, and sociological aspects of it are very deep and realistic, and the pieces of the story come together in a horrifying yet unique and captivating way.\n\nIf all of that sounds interesting to you, I highly recommend playing/reading this interactive novel.\n\nAlso, be prepared that due to \"technical issues\" in the computer system of the space ship Mugunghwa, the AI will at times force you to give overly black and white answers to questions that really need a third option. When that happens, remember that in the story your possible answers are formulated by the AI, and as such are colored by their own way of thinking, not that of the protagonist.\n\n\n\nPS: if you want to experience almost all the story the game has to offer AND not spend a lot of time on multiple playthroughs, I have a small tip with only a [i]very[/i] minor spoiler: [spoiler]At a certain point in the game you will be asked to confront the AI *Hyun-ae with questions.

Good soundtrack, excellent attention to minor details. I only wish the game itself was longer.\n\nI've decided to write this review [i]before[/i] playing the expansion, Hate Plus, so that that experience wouldn't color my impressions of this game.\n\nNo synopsis, that would just be repetitive, not to mention rude. Play the demo. After decades of exposure, I've lost a lot of interest in the manga style, but I tried the game anyway and was oddly drawn to it in a way that is difficult to relate. Perhaps not being Japanese played a role in getting me to give it a shot, I'm not sure. The music is good, but there are not many pieces in the soundtrack. That stuff said, let's just focus on what sets this game apart.\n\nThe game itself is one part first-person narrative from the perspectives of many people within the setting, you know, 'before the incident', and one part interaction with one of the two main, interactive characters. If you were to add a repetitive action game in the middle, you'd end up with a far better written and more mature .hack game. I was thankful for the silent protagonist role, having a pre-written stand-in to take on 'your' feelings and beliefs can be very immersion breaking.\n\nThe place where this game really excels is in the 'little things'. I'll not spoil what those little things are, but they make the characters that you [i]can[/i] interact with feel a lot more believable and 'alive'. Clever use of game devices give the illusion that the interface is natural, which adds a lot to immersion. While some parts are extremely blunt (borderline shocking, considering the context), I felt the story and presentation overall had an alluring subtlety and mystery to it that is strangely devoid in most game stories and, well, from most books, music, and television shows as well.\n\nMy main complaint with the game is that it is short. While I don't believe in dragging things out for the sake of length, and there is certainly enough there to get the story across with the degree of completeness that I would consider necessary, I felt that the brevity left an empty feeling. A, 'But, wait, I like these characters! It's over already...?' feeling. It's actually a bit ironic. Loneliness as an underlying theme makes much of the hurried feeling in the dialog quite forgivable (even endearing), but again, there's still an abruptness to it that feels disheartening.\n\nRegarding the style and themes of the game, this is by no means a critique of the writing, which is excellent. But, without looking, I easily pegged [i]who the author is as a person[/i] from just the story. For those who know, that is probably not too surprising, but I felt it was worth mentioning. The writing is highly indicative of that person's personal tendancies, experiences, and perspective, which do give it a richness that may otherwise be lacking. I would be very interested in seeing the author involved in collaborative projects (in part because the loneliness is just falling off the plate...).\n\nThe author appears to go to great lengths to give a feeling of neutrality overall, aside from the innate societal problems related to the mysterious transition back to the Confucian culture and Chinese writing system of the Joseon era. By the way, if you're on the fence about trying this game, it would be [u]extremely helpful[/u] to you to watch the excellent Korean television shows Dae Jang Geum and/or Tree With Deep Roots (both extremely relevant, for different reasons), though I'm sure other Korean 'period dramas' set in the Joseon era would help spark your interest and understanding.\n\nBut, finally, the most important part of the game is the storytelling. In the end, the story itself is not as horribly complex as its made out to be as you go through it, but the way everything is revealed, piece by piece, has you drawing conclusions and asking questions that, of course, you cannot voice, but still feel more immersive and palpable than if you were to quietly come about them while reading the story as a plain narrative text. Having the characters play as guide and co-discoverer with you give a feeling of 'togetherness' that is traditionally difficult for games and books to thrust upon their users.\n\nIn closing, I can't wait any longer to play Hate Plus, and I hope to see more material from this game's author in the same vein.", "timestamp_created": 1423979628, "timestamp_updated": 1423979980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542675", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14475382": {"recommendationid": "14475382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157596964", "num_games_owned": 614, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423966440}, "language": "english", "review": "Being honest, the first minutes I played Analogue: A Hate Story I thought it was a boring game with little to no things I could interact with. After having a look at all the good reviews it had here on Steam, I decided I would give it another chance. And that's exactly what I did. It's not your usual game (if you could call it that), and probably not your typical visual novel either, but it narrates a very interesting story, which surely won't leave you unmoved. Some tips, just so you start with the right foot when playing the game, or if you are thinking about buying it:\n\n- Do you enjoy reading and books in general? This is definitely important, because 99% of the game is just reading. I'd recommend that you start playing whenever you don't feel like smashing enemies and just having a quiet, relaxing evening. \n- Do not pay too much attention to the family trees. There are way too many characters which only appear mentioned once, So yeah, try not to feel overwhelmed: there are only a few characters you should really focus on.\n- Do some detective work! The story is original and very compelling. Even if I thought both of the game's AIs were way too cartoonish for my taste, it's pretty easy to understand them as characters and be moved by their reasons and actions, as well as by all those different stories that take place in the logs of the korean ship where everything took place. It's not really neccessary to think too much about what happens next in the story as you play through it, (you are told about everything at one point or another)  but be sure to use your logic and common sense and you'll be surprised when you find out what really happened in the story  way before you even get to read it. \n\nDefinitely a very original and compelling game/story/book. It'll keep you entertained for a few hours, as well as its story will probably stay in your thoughts for a few days more. Btw, I loved the Ender ending. :-)\n\nPs for the devs: One AI per core? Why can't I disable one of the AIs and enable the other one, if both are in the same core? C'mon! It only makes sense, and that way you would be able to get one of the achievements without breaking the 4th wall.

It's one of those stories that you can't really express in words to give it justice, so you have to experience it for yourself to really understand what's going on here.\n\nThe general gist of the story is that a colonization vessel, which was sent more than 900 years in the past, has been found derelict in space with everyone on board having been myseriously killed several centuries before. There are two AIs aboard this ship that have context as to what happened, but the true story is in the logs that the last generation aboard the ship had kept. You're only given a very small amount of logs to begin with, but you will eventually find the entire truth as you show your AI friends what logs you are more interested in hearing about. They will also give their own context and thoughts to drive home what happened aboard the Mugunghwa.\n\nOverall, it's a story about how a majorly regressed society with its own major problems can cause its own demise by not being able to look past its own norms. It's a very tragic story, one which you know was diseased in the beginning and only furthered by the fact that it's a guarantee that none of them will survive the encounter.\n\nAs for the two AIs, I really liked the default AI (*Hyun-Ae)'s route. Without spoiling anything, her emotions and thoughts feel real and the situation she's in really adds to the experience. *Mute wasn't quite as strong; while her opinions were definitely understandable, she never had the same type of draw that *Hyun-Ae did. \n\nThis VN is also not afraid to show a girl on girl love affair between a noble and a peasant in a society where women are expected to fully devote their lives to their husbands.

The actual visual novel elements are solid, giving you plenty of room to make different choices which heavily affect your relations with the ships two main AI's- Hyun-ae, and Mute.\n\n- Characters -\nThis might fall short, considering there are only three actual characters in the game, including yourself. However, I found the ships two AI's to be both unique and well written, each in their own way. I can't say much for Mute herself, as I went with Hyun-ae's route, however the limited dialogue I had with her was... Well, certainly interesting. As for Hyun-ae, she happens to be my favorite part of the game, being extremely likable and interesting right from the start. \n\n- Story -\nThe story is sort of in the backround, but no less involving and important. As I mentioned before, you uncover most of it through the ships various documents, and through talking with both the ships AI's. It seems to be a take on a post-apocalyptic (sort of?) take on japanese culture mixed with a lot of science fiction elements. Confusing, right? Nonetheless, it tells a surprisingly human and very thought provoking story, on morales, cultures, and general humanity as a whole.\n\n- Final thoughts -\nOverall, I had a lot of fun with this game, dispite it being a bit short (about four hours, but I'm a fast reader), it tells a compelling story, has some great characters, and is overall a generally good experience.

so this review might sound unsatisfactory for most people, but this shows how much this game moved me, so here I am.\n\nOne of the features I really liked about Analogue: A Hate Story is its innovative story-telling system. Reading through the logs while your AI side kick gives you information about the people who wrote those logs and trying to uncover the mystery which led the space ship mugunghwa to its current state, this game makes you question what is right and what is wrong. Make you wonder if there is really something called \"right\", while you read through all the text it gives you. Reading happy memories, tragic events, scandalous diaries just makes it all the more interesting. It is as if such a community existed there and you really are reading memories of their daily life.\n\nAnother different point of this game, for me at least (I don't know if there are other VNs featuring this kindof stuff since I didn't play so many Vns), that it introduces you a different viewpoint about computers and AIs. To make this review spoiler free, I won't go into detail, but you interact with AIs as if they are humans, and deal with their personalities.\n\nOf course there were things I didn't like about the game. The most obvious one was the lack of things you could do with the console. I think if we had other events other than a certain one to really rely on the console. Again, for the sole purpose of not giving spoilers I won't go into detail, but I can say this, it is as if the whole console is just there so you can use it when it is necessary, and further playing with it won't be very useful. Especially given that it can cause bugs in the game.\n\nOverall, I liked the game as it is, but I could have liked it more, what's more, the game has a sequel, which I am currently playing, and it just add to the spice of the story. I recommend this game to everyone who wants read a good story with good twists and characters, to people wants to have good visual novel experience with a different way of story telling, and to everyone who wants to have a change of pace and try something new by giving a go for visual novels.", "timestamp_created": 1421162251, "timestamp_updated": 1421162251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13969770": {"recommendationid": "13969770", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010455087", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443492853}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c \uaf2d \uae6c\ub2f5\uc2dc\uace0 \ub178\uac00\ub2e4\ub85c \uae6c \uc990\uae30\uc9c0\ubabb\ud558\ub294 \uba4d\uccad\ud55c\uc778\uac04\uc774 \uc4f0\ub294 \uae00\n\uce90\ub098\ub2e4 \ub300\ud559\uc0dd\uc774 \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uac8c\uc784\uc778\ub370 \uaf64 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc0ac\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uac12\uc740 \uc544\uae5d\uc9c0\uc54a\uc740\ub370\n\uc6d0\uc790\ub85c \ucf58\uc194\uc740 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc\ud558\uc2e4\ubd84\ub4e4\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\uc2e4\uac70\uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\uc5ec\ub7ec \uc5d4\ub529\uc744 \uc804\ubd80 \ubcf8\ud6c4\uc5d0\ub294 \ub3c4\uc804\uacfc\uc81c\uae6c\ub2e4\uace0 \ub610 \ub9e4\ub2ec\ub9ac\uace0\uc788\ub294 \n\uc790\uc2e0\uc744 \ubcfc\uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \ud55c\ubc88\ucbe4 \ud574\ubcf4\uc2dc\uae30\ub97c \ucd94\ucc9c\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub294 \ubc14\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\n\ub9d0\uadf8\ub300\ub85c \ube44\uc96c\uc5bc \ub178\ubca8\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c \ucc45\uc77d\ub294\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uc2dc\uace0 \ud558\uba74 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4\n", "timestamp_created": 1421158336, "timestamp_updated": 1421158336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13966892": {"recommendationid": "13966892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097695855", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508440543}, "language": "russian", "review": "I love this game.

Story is definitely the most emotionally moving novel I have ever read - and that is saying something. The tale is horrifyingly grim, and it is not advisable to go through the entire novel in one sitting... Pace yourself if you have a tendency to be affected by emotional dramas.\n\nThe story is well-written and engaging, though the bulk of it coming in the form of old logs written centuries ago, leaves annoying gaps in the storyline - reading all the logs does fill in most of the blanks, though. More frustrating about this, though, is that you are left sitting with an intense desire to re-write the story, and make everything right.

I can finally do a full review. [u]No gameplay review, no graphics review, no settings review, just a story review, since this is a [b]Visual Novel[/b].[/u] If it's the sound, I guess it's worth noting it's pretty good. I would've done this at around 8 hours Steam time, but apparently there was this one log in the Helpful Block that wasn't popping up unless you manually search it, to complete the achievements.\n\nAnyways, where do I start? \n\nWell to begin, my first impression on the game before I bought and played it, I thought it'll be some spunky [b]RomCom[/b](Romantic Comedy) with AI waifus. 'Cause, srz, isn't that what a lot of people who's interested gonna think?\n\nI was wrong, the first few minutes all I did was read, and read, and read, thinking I'll get bored soon enough. But, little did I know, I was in for a treat that tastes sweet, yet strongly bitter at the same time that'll leave a long-lasting taste in my mouth. The [u]more time I invested into it[/u], the [u]more I got interested in the story.[/u]\n\nThe game is [u]not an actual interactive Visual Novel where there will be actual interactions[/u]. This is where the Anime clich\u00e9 is used to most likely interest buyers and get immersed in the story. Thing is, it's more of [u]just a plain Novel[/u]...that's Visual(wat). \n\nInstead of reading straight from a book though, you read logs of the dead last generation crew that was on the ship. It's not that straightforward of a read, but you look for the logs, putting them together and making a conclusion, piece by piece. \n\nI am not gonna spoil the story, or what I/or other people most likely felt, since it'll be better for you to find out yourself.\n\nTo summarize the setting and theme of the story. The logs take place in somewhat Medieval futuristic lost 1st generation colony in space, where the decline of education and sciences takes place, the literacy rate has fallen, and as medicine also fell, so does the birth rate and life expectancy. Where you read logs of some of it's last generation high-ranking people that mostly just includes various events about romance, lust, sadness, and various other emotions. It's not as deep as you'd think, but it's fair enough for me atleast. [u]Since it's romance-based, there are no science logs, or any explanation on how life it is there, but you can imagine it, since it's heavily foreshadowed.[/u]\n\nTo generalize, [u]real life setting comparison is the Medieval era that took place after the Dark Ages after the fall of the Roman Empire. Based loosely on the Joseon Dynasty in Korea, which overviews one of the most tragic eras for women.[/u]\n\nAnyways, as a bookworm, a lover of various novels, some of them romance, and visual novels. I could say this game is worth buying [b]IF YOU'RE ALSO THE SAME[/b]. [u][b]BE WARNED[/b] though, there are various forms of misogyny in the story, and this is to emphasize that the game is to raise awareness of feminism, as the game [b]WAS MADE[/b] by a feminist.[/u]\n\nStill, [b]8.5/10[/b]. \nCheap, fairly good story, and somewhat a relaxing way to spend a few hours during the night.

Being greeted by your \"new family\" who tell you what to say, what to think and even how to feel in order to not violate their social norms? Being told that your identity, the place you carved out for yourself in the world, is long forgotten, but that they already have a new role good and ready for you? That your dreams no longer matter?\n\nThis fate, among many others, is one of the gears in the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/video/209370/]complex machinery[/url] that would end up removing all traces of life from humanity's great hope, the huge pioneer starship [i]Mugunghwa[/i], in [b]Analogue: A Hate Story[/b].\n\nIn this unconventional sci-fi/mystery visual novel, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102790442]you are a space investigator[/url] hired to find out the truth about what happened to the [i]Mugunghwa[/i] and how it got lost on its mission to settle foreign planets. Arriving at the wreckage and linking up to the ship's computer, you are greeted by the archival A.I., who offers to help you sort through the letters, reports, and diary entries of the people who lived on board before a mysterious catastrophe killed everyone. You quickly learn that very little is as it seems, and there are [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109949970]so many personal motives[/url] wrapped up in the situation that actual honesty is hard to come by.\n\nThe presentation in [i]Analogue[/i] sets up a computer-y atmosphere with abstract backgrounds and actual in-story explanations for things like the multiple choice \"dialogue wheels\". The effort put into the art is largely concentrated into the two highly detailed on-screen characters, who delight with a plethora of poses and facial expressions to convey their emotions. The soundtrack, especially the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZa_7ZG18kQ]character[/url] [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eWID0SxeCg]themes[/url], features recognizable melodies (sometimes in several variations) realized in a consistent style that works extremely well with the atmosphere constructed by the rest of the story.\n\nFor most visual novels, the user interface tends to be an afterthought, and only rarely is it a point of contention in a review. [i]Analogue[/i], however, eschews the medium's tradition of a branching linear narrative and forges its own path in regards to navigation inside the story. In essence, every piece of text that you can find is one of the \"files\" of the ship's archive that you can view in any order, and you can also [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=138323912]talk to the A.I.[/url] or [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=77358249]drop back to the command-line interface[/url] at any point. This provides the player (a term that I use deliberately, because for Analogue, being a mere \"reader\" really isn't enough) with a high amount of agency that few visual novels choose to provide. It also creates a proportionally high number of opportunities to fail, for example if the player is not quick on their feet when it comes to using the computer terminal as the situation requires.\n\nThis sets up an interesting contrast with the main character's agency in the plot. After all, many years have passed since the events you read about and there is no way to influence the outcome or to save anyone. The only thing you can do is to find out the truth. There is a present-day plot involving the main character and the two artificial intelligences that still reside on the ship's computer, but the focus is on the mercilessly unchangeable past.\n\nThe people on the [i]Mugunghwa[/i] lived in a surprisingly traditionalist society with strong codified gender goles and rampant classism. The members of the noble families all struggled for power, but no one seemed to heed the big picture or pay any mind to the ship's course. It was a troublesome situation in which a little girl from hundreds of years ago was awakened from cryostasis. Her family hoped that the [i]Pale Bride[/i] might bring them salvation, but what could she do to find her way in a society that was so radically different from the one she knew? You notice early on that she seems to be somewhat of a focal point for the events on board following her reawakening, but how does she factor into the eventual genocide? What caused the ship's undoing? And why do the two A.I.s despise each other so much?\n\n[i]Analogue[/i] is, at its core, a mystery story. While it is still a visual novel and you can gloss over most of it without really internalizing it and still get to the end, it is a more rewarding experience to actually untangle the relationships of the characters and understand how their motivations propel them to do what they do. There aren't really any mechanics in place to support this endeavour, other than the family trees that the A.I.s helpfully provide you with. I found that my enjoyment of the story increased significantly as soon as I started taking my own notes with pen and paper. I would encourage you to do the same, because otherwise it is very easy to lose your perspective as you wade through the countless documents, each colored by its author's perceptions.\n\nBit by bit you wrestle the truth from the ship's archives, and slowly you piece together the puzzle until you are able to see the full picture in all its horror. All aspects of it, from the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=111176874]psychological[/url] through the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102790455]sociological[/url] to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=102790499]interpersonal[/url] themes of the story, paint a drab picture of loneliness and despair. It poses the uncomfortable question of whether the ship's population as a whole might have been beyond salvation for who knows how long, doomed many years before the finale of the story; whether the event that put an end to all biological life on board was merely the logical conclusion, much like you would turn out the lights when you leave an empty room. It's hauntingly honest in its depiction of the darkest depths of the human soul, and after completing the story for the first time, it left me with a strong feeling of unease about what any one of us might be capable of, given the right circumstances.\n\nIt does also have its lighthearted moments, and even though visual novel connoisseurs will find many tropes and clich\u00e9s conspicuously absent, [i]Analogue[/i] coquets with the expectations carried over from its genre siblings in certain moments, such as when one of the A.I.s [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=109168856]invites you to dress her up in various outfits[/url]. It's no stranger to fun and there is plenty of clever humor to be found in the data logs and the A.I. banter.\n\nThe overall execution in this VN is so congruent and polished that any perceived shortcomings almost have to be rooted in personal taste. Some people might not care for the minimalist presentation, others might have preferred a more linear way of storytelling, yet others may have their reasons for not wanting to read a story where gender inequality is a prominent theme. But judged on its own merits, I can find nothing but praise for [i]Analogue: A Hate Story[/i] within me. It's unique and interesting, and if you think that a mystery visual novel with deeper than average gameplay mechanics might intrigue you, I can recommend it without reservation.", "timestamp_created": 1420918667, "timestamp_updated": 1421284675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 129, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862320", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13926757": {"recommendationid": "13926757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095224464", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420907472}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub9cc\ub4e0\uc774\uac00 \ub808\uc988\ube44\uc5b8\uc778\uc9c0 \uc54c\uae30 \uc804\uc5d4 \ub098\ub984 \ube44\ud310\uc801\uc778 \uac8c\uc784\uac19\uc558\uc73c\ub098 \uacb0\uad6d \uaf34\ud398\ubbf8 \ub808\uc988\ube44\uc5b8\uc758 \ubb38\ud654\uc0ac\ub300\uc8fc\uc758 \uc0c1\uc0c1\uc18c\uc124.", "timestamp_created": 1420907415, "timestamp_updated": 1420907415, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.437956", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13923633": {"recommendationid": "13923633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068230162", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423471086}, "language": "english", "review": "Tho the endings could use more development, the game itself was great the aspects of reading a whole life and history or people was amusing as were the two main heriones of the stroy.

It is very common for the bulk of gameplay in a VN to be clicking to advance text with intermittent choices.  There are usually static backgrounds and various illustrations of characters in different poses.  That is generally all there is to it.  So hopefully you like reading.\n\nSo, Analogue: A Hate Story.  This is a game set in the far future.  You navigate the logs of a derelict spacecraft with the help of an AI personality to discover what happened to the ship.  As you read logs, new logs are unlocked that show you more of the society onboard the ship.  That is pretty much all I'm willing to say because this game is pretty much exclusively story.\n\nRemember this is a VN, and I think this is a good introduction to the genre.  It is true to the genre as it is a lot of reading.  There is a UI to it though, and the way you navigate the game actually feels more like a game than VNs typically do.  It is also short; I'd say 3-6 hours to finish all the routes.  Don't quote me on that though.\n\n\nAll in all, should you play it?  Yes with caveats. \n\nAs long as you:\nlike reading\nlike or are ambivalent toward the anime art style\n\nAlso consider:\nGame length.

You are told to figure out what happened, copy the files, and get out, and that the ships AI, *Mute, would assist you.  But when you arrive *Mute is disabled--and instead, you run across an AI called *Hyun-ae.  Who is *Hyuan-ae?   What happened to the colony ship and the passangers?  What about *Mute?  To find out the answers to these questions, you must read through the various ship log files (letters, diaries, etc.)--and chat with the AIs.\n\nWhat you uncover is fascinating and disturbing.  If it were told in realtime, it would be a horror novel.  But by setting most of the action well in the past, it allows the player to discover a happy--or at least happy-ish--ending.\n\nIf you like murder mysteries or period dramas, or crazy little love

The only graphics are the AI figures and the white backdrop. You can change Hyun-ae's outfit, but that's it. \n\nAlthough I thoroughly enjoyed the game, it is not a game for everyone. There is a lot of text to read. You spend almost all of your time reading through the ship logs. There is no action and no excitement because that's not what this game is about. It tells a dark story through narrative, a very well-written one that is. I did not find every single log to be interesting to read, but that's to be expected since some characters outshine the others in depth and relatability.\n\nA major weakness is its low replayability. It's just not the same the second time through when you already know what the revelations are. The first playthrough was magical, and it stirred the emotions. For the second and third playthroughs, however, you'll probably be wanting to click through everything as fast as you can so you can unlock the new endings.

A narrative is made clear by reading accounts given by other people of events. Also uses the unreliable narrator mechanic, the persons giving you information and exposition withhold information and hint at things to be discovered later. I like both of these things.\n\nYour character is an investigator or mercenary of sorts investigating a ship that was lost contact with thousands of years ago. It was apparantly a ship holding an entire society meant to establish the first colony in another star system. AI on ship *Hyun-ae greets character. Many documents, letters, and diary entries detailing life on the ship before everyone died give the player a sense of what was going on.\n\nThe story revolves around the character 'The Pale Bride' which is mostly a tragedy. A young girl, the 'Pale Bride', of 13 on the ship was put in cryogenic stasis b/c she was dying and they figured those in the future would have better medicine on the ship.\n\n Stasis pod is shattered, she awakens to a deeply backwards society resembling ancient China, Japan, or Korea, one of those. Complete with emperors, family dynasties, and deep misogyny, the new society does not at all have the means to heal her, and rather intends to have her married off to the 'emperor'.\n\nThe character protests at first and maintains her own free will, but is slowly degraded and controlled. The girl's real name was apparantly Hyun-ae, the name of the supposed AI on the ship.\n\nThe last diary entry revealed details the girl refusing to be married to the emperor, only to have her tongue cut out by her adopted father for speaking against a man. Her description of the scene is rather disturbing and you'll quickly come to be horrified by and hate the society she's awoken to.\n\nEveryone on the ship has been dead for 600 years apparantly. The security AI on the ship, *Mute, entirely accepts the backwards beliefs of the ship's culture, but reveals things to the player about what happened to the ship. Primarily, she reveals that *Hyun-ae is responsible for everyone's death.\n\n When questioned, Hyun-ae will reveal a diary entry where she had become a submissive, dehumanized wife of the emperor, having almost entirely forgotten her past identity and sense of self. During a visit to her adopted family, her 'father' says how happy he is with her, as she used to be so protesting and angry, but that she's really surprised them all and become a success.\n\nUpon hearing this, she suddenly remembered all that had happened, how she had lost herself, her identity, and now that her adopted father was actually praising her for how she had become dehumanized and made into an object, she wanted nothing more than to kill him.\n\nShe could not bring herself to stab him with the knife she held. The player will recall an earlier entry where it is detailed to 'The Pale Bride'/Hyun-ae that the password to the emperor's shipcomputer is her birth name, as a sign of appreciation. This is willingly revealed to her b/c it is assumed that women couldn't ever use a computer. Using this, she accesses the computer and disables the ship's life support and downloads her consciousness onto the ship through some sci-fi absurdity.\n\nOf course, there are many other details and sub-stories, but that is the gist of it. There are five endings allowed for the player depending on their choices. The easiest is to simply gain the password to the computer, download the ship's files, and leave the AIs behind. The four other endings require a more thorough search and understanding of the narrative.\n\nI started the game not expecting it, but I must admit that the game is dark/disturbing, tells good stories, is not plagued by awful cliches, has good music, requires player agency and choice, and has multiple ways to complete it. \n\nI recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1419888666, "timestamp_updated": 1419888666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13691241": {"recommendationid": "13691241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087951064", "num_games_owned": 367, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420636542}, "language": "english", "review": "An interesting story and charming characters!\nEven if those two girls don't seem attractive to you right now\nyou'll be in love with them in just a few minutes as you play the game :D\nThe interface design is simple yet beautiful.\nThis game is definitely worth buying.\nIt would be much fun if I had more chances to use the override terminal.", "timestamp_created": 1419870329, "timestamp_updated": 1419870329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13684338": {"recommendationid": "13684338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069817955", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438103647}, "language": "english", "review": "Yea so I'll put this out there first: I suck at console commands and the lot, and I believe I missed a few important details in the beginning but here.

On the other hand, the HUD was a little confusing, and the tutorial was pretty much like darks souls. -call me out if you disagree- As for the characters, ( yes there are two, it says it in the game description) they felt rather obvious, although the backstory is what really made the game. Major tip for full enjoyment. Take. Your. Time. Dont worry about the system password, heh, you'll find it waiting right in front of you lol. But yea, the back story really made this.

Short answer get it but if you want a more in depthe review look Below.\n\n\nIn-depth review minor spoilers\n\nDon't worry like I said only minor spoilers. In this game you play an intersteller investigator assigned to investigate the wreck of a multi-generation colony ship sent out by Korea in the 24th century. What makes the game interesting is what you find as you dig through the ships logs and your interaction with the ships two AI's *Hyun-ae and *Mute (the * denotes they are AI's.) Basiclly, at some point in the ship's past all computer data was wiped and the captain declared himself emperor and institued a feudal secioty that like one would expect is sexist, classist, homophobic etc. But the story isn't about the formation of that culture (that's the topic of the sequel Hate Plus.) The story is about how that civilization ended as told through the eyes of the people living at the time\n\nWhere the AI's come in is that both AI's have opposing views on the morality of the secioty *Hyun-ae the first AI you encounter is critical of the ships culture where *Mute is a defender of it. As you would expect this makes you like *Hyun-ae better than *Mute since *Mute is basiclly a woman defending Sexism. But the funny thing is as the story unfolds and certain plot twists are revealed *Hyun-ae becomes less likable and *Mute becomes more likable leaving you feeling conflicted about both.\n\nNow the Bad. more minor spoilers\n\nMy biggest beef with this game is it forces you to choose the ending half-way through the game. I get what the developer was trying to do you are supposed make a snap judgement as to which AI is right, before you have all the information. That would be Okay but I don't feel like it is well executed since it easy to pick the choice you don't want (in my first playthrough I wanted to side with *Hyun-ae but got stuck with *Mute) and after that choice you cannot switch AI's again for the rest of the game. So save at when your log enteries hit 50% complete.\n\nIssue 2 i have is that the \"perfect\" ending requires you to do large amounts of metagaming the only way you can get it without help takes at least 2 or 3 playthroughs (depending on who you side with playthrough 1) and I do mean at least that number in reality you could play the game a dozen times and not find the perfect ending.\n\nAll in all I give the game an 8.5 out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1419821750, "timestamp_updated": 1419821750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13675423": {"recommendationid": "13675423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048846018", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419391958}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a fan of visual novels with unique and interesting stories to tell, which Analogue definitely did.

The story is excellent and enticing, and the characters (despite there only being two you can interact with) are deep and interesting.  As far as replay value goes, it's a good game to replay a couple times in order to get all content; but once you've 100%-ed it, you may want to move on to another game.\n\nIf you're not familiar with visual novels, they are a genre of video games that rely heavily on reading text, and primarily offer binary choices as the only method of affecting the game.  Analogue is unique in this genre because the player gets the story through reading diary entries and correspondences between people from hundreds of years ago, rather than by interacting with other characters.  In addition, the player isn't limited to infrequent binary decisions: they also can affect the game by showing any of the logs to either one of two AI characters, and they will read and react to whatever its contents are.  There's also other ways to interact with the game, but going into detail about them would spoil the fun of discovering how to interact with the game.\n\nIf you're on the edge of buying or not buying Analogue: A Hate Story, I would definitely recommend getting it.

You log into the ships computer and with the help of 2 AI, Hyun ae and Mute, you must uncover the truth of the colony and why there is no one alive on it anymore.\n\nYou will have to do some basic programming to find all the info you need so there is input despite all the logs you'll have to read, some go into 6 pages in length so prepare your reading glasses and pay close atention to the details, you will be quizzed by the AI girls at intervals during your investigation to get your opinions on some of the things that you read in these logs and possibly get them to give you more logs.\n\nYou will read a number of different stories that happened during the final years of the ships human life, you may be shocked, you may be disgusted but it will make you want to read on and find out the whole story.\n\nThis game would take about 5 hours to complete one playthrough, but there are 5 different endings including a special harem ending (Yes they may be Computer programs but if you so choose you can agree to get married to them)\n\nI give this game a solid 8/10, the interface isn't perfect but it does it's job and it gives you a little extra input and involvement than other Visual Novels, so if that sounds good to you it'd be worth your time to pick up.", "timestamp_created": 1418415472, "timestamp_updated": 1418415930, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6,

Considering the game's length, it is easy to pick up and finish in one sitting. You'll be hooked regardless, so there is no need to worry. There is some basic puzzle solving and you most certainly must have the ability to read in order to fully enjoy this game. The themes are rather mature, so I would not recommend that younger audiences play this game. Now with this out of the way, let us delve into it. Let us delve into the past.\n\nYou are a simple pilot investigator flying in space when you come across a ship. The ship has no life on it; however, you decide to connect to a computer terminal where you meet an artificial (yet cute) inteligence named *Hyun-ae. She greets you with much respect seeing as she hasn't had contact with anyone for over six-hundred years. The game works as a series of log files that are shown to you by *Hyun-ae, and you simply read them and talk to the artificial inteligence to listen to their responses. The AI will ask you a few questions and you'll have the ability to modify values in the terminal in order to change your story path accordingly. The concept may seem simple and boring; however, it is far more interactive than it seems. What really makes this game special is the content itself, which for emphasis, I will add, is what really takes the cake.\n\nIf you're a fan of seeing characters develop, you are most certainly looking in the right place. What really stands out though is this game's reoccuring theme regarding sexism, sexuality, and sex. The game itself portrays these themes in very unique ways, but I would just recommend playing it since there isn't much else I can say about the game's story. The themes displayed in the game are even more than just that, though. The game explains much more and will require your experiences to interpret them. There are multiple endings that allow for the players to experience each theme in a different light and perspective. Analogue: A Hate Story does not disappoint, and I highly recommend that even people who are not fond of visual novels pick up the game.\n\nHonestly, this one is a life changer.", "timestamp_created": 1417585735, "timestamp_updated": 1417586425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13179057": {"recommendationid": "13179057", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066577118", "num_games_owned": 324, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418214134}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uadf8\ub0e5 \ub3c8\uc774 \uc544\uae5d\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub2e4\n\uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \uc0b4\uc9dd \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4\ud3b8\uc774\uace0\n\uc77d\uae30\ub3c4 \uadc0\ucc2e\uc740 \ud3b8\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc\n\uadf8\uac83\ub4e4\uc744 \uac10\uc218\ud574\uc11c \ud50c\ub808\uc774\ud558\uae30\uc5d4 \ucda9\ubd84\ud558\ub2e4\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1417432969, "timestamp_updated": 1417432969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13176660": {"recommendationid": "13176660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093055557", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415235565}, "language": "english", "review": "An evocative tale with a very well composed soundtrack.

There's some hacking-esque console interface type stuff you have to do at points as well, which involves puzzles of sorts. \n\nSo, if you are looking for exciting, adrenalin-pumping gameplay, you should look elsewhere. What you'll find in Analogue, however, is a really deep and interesting story with good writing and character development, and non-linear exploration not in a physical sense but in a story sense.\n\nIt's a fantastic read, if reading is your thing. Tragedy upon tragedy unfolds before your eyes as you piece together fragments to learn how truly deranged things can get in a highly traditional, patriarchical colony starship. Themes of personal liberty, feminism, LGBT and so on are addressed in a way that's reasonable and not at all heavy-handed. That is, none of those \"cis-hetero shitlord\" bashing. \n\nThe characters, though there are only two you actively speak to, are numerous yet realistic and developed in a way that makes them come to life.

The majority of interaction takes place speaking with sentient AI on the ship, with communication limited to a few binary (yes/no) prompts and sharing specific information. The story is told via the ships' logs being revealed from this communication with the AI.

Especially with idiot men and most ( not all) women the same. But I stress, that's the most you'll want it for...reading an author's perspective on such. Not much of the game itself =_=, in action, visuals, routes--ultimately even decision making is ruined, as you need more info regardless!!\n\n***EDIT: OOO I CAN EDIT :D. ***AND SPOILERS!!\n Don't worry not much to say; a second ago, when I said \"idiot men\"? Ya, it's not that I hate my own sex here - I try to stay objective of the two believe it or not - but that society in this game is so distanced from ours, that their logic can't even comprehend a sliver of how what they do may be wrong. Both the WOMEN AND THE MEN have this issue: guys are blind to their faults, women blind to explaining how they're right--and so, it's shallow. \nThis game will stir thoughts at best, leave you sorely empty handed at worst.

The story is presented via numerous documents and two A.I.s who also serve as pursuable love interests, all the while trying to influence the player's decisions. The experience is quite short-lived, which feels weird, considering that the story is clearly trying to emotionally influence you and centers around some fairly dark themes. More often than not though, these are presented in a pretty hamfisted way and the addition of extremely stylized characters makes for quite a mixed-bag overall.\n\nApart from an input-based sequence I encountered right at the end, there really is not any gameplay to speak of. The soundtrack served it's purpose as background music for you to read notes too but that's it.

But this is a special visual novel, it is not as simple as the others. But first things first.\nThe most important difference that makes this novel special - \"interaction\" with the novel. Or gameplay, here as you like (although some players will eat me for using the words \"visual novel\" and \"gameplay\" in the same sentence.\nDialogues are few, and all communication is reduced to reading records found on the ship and opened in time. In other words - a short story by 95% consists of reading various diaries, finding interrelations between them, and which is necessary for an understanding of what is it that happened in the game. \nAnd the plot is interesting. We - aerospace engineer, who flew to study the missing ship.\nAnd the plot is interesting. We - aerospace engineer, who flew to study the missing ship. Here the developers have tried and we have a fairly extensive functional interactions with the ship itself and existing records - work with artificial intelligence ship, switching various triggers of very interesting work with the functions and much more.\nAnd the end - this is the culmination of all that we, as an aerospace engineer, can do.\nHowever, despite an interesting story, I would recommend this visual novel only to those who already have an extensive view of the games of this genre. There's a lot of information, especially about the relationship between the members of the ship, and it is difficult to handle with it. For a beginner.\n\nWe now turn to a more subjective facts.\n\nScenario: 8/10 \nVERY cool story that has serious connotations relating to our reality with you. Spoils a great script, only one thing - the same name and very strained description. I was confused in the names and  had to read descriptions many, many, MANY times.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\nI fell in love with them. Really liked these characters. About protagonist knows nothing, but it is only does that get used to the role. Girls are worked out perfectly, and their story is very interesting and touching.\n\nGraphics: 7/10 \nLovely character sprites, the interface \"operating system\" and... That's all. There's nothing else here, the background is almost always the same.\n\nSound: 6/10 \nHonestly - could have been better. But thanks to the fact that the sound is not irritating and does not distract from reading the notes. There is no voice acting.\n\nAnd a little notice: there is no erotic component in here :)\n\nSo, this novel is pretty good, I can honestly recomend it for experienced players. If you are a beginner - of course, you can try, but you'v been warned above.\n\nGood luck, and have fun!", "timestamp_created": 1413057505, "timestamp_updated": 1479994264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12437538": {"recommendationid": "12437538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050752464", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413114885}, "language": "italian", "review": "Consigliato, una storia davvero incredibile con colpi di scena che mi hanno lasciato senza fiato.\n\n10+", "timestamp_created": 1412962031, "timestamp_updated": 1412962031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12428675": {"recommendationid": "12428675", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987668808", "num_games_owned": 233, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412887103}, "language": "english", "review": "Text-based, command-prompt-driven investigation into the disappearance of a long lost earth colony ship.\n\nSurprisingly engaging for what is essentially a look into gender disparity within an era of Korean society.

The odd and disjointed storytelling was a little off-putting at first, but curiosity about the Mugunghwa and what happened kept reeling me back in. The plot is pretty dark, and some of the log files are a little difficult to read. The resolution of the mystery is honestly pretty heartbreaking, but I couldn't help but keep reading.\n\nOverall, it was super enjoyable, and I definitely recommend getting the soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1408836423, "timestamp_updated": 1408836423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11814652": {"recommendationid": "11814652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055759177", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1354262400}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4. \ube44\uc8fc\uc5bc \ub178\ubca8.\n\ucc98\uc74c \uc811\ud574\ubcf8 \uc7a5\ub974\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc758\uc678\ub85c \uc7ac\ubc0c\uac8c \ud588\ub124\uc694.\n\ubc1c\ucee8\uc774\ub2e4\ubcf4\ub2c8 \uc6d0\uc790\ub85c \ud574\uacb0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uba87\ubc88 \uac8c\uc784\uc624\ubc84\ub098\ub354\uad70\uc694....\n\uc800\ub9cc\ud07c \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ubc1c\ucee8\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c\uba74 \uc990\uac81\uac8c \ud558\uc2e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\ub0b4\uc6a9\ub3c4 \ucc38\uc2e0\ud558\uace0 \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \uc88b\uace0.", "timestamp_created": 1408677360, "timestamp_updated": 1408677360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11811090": {"recommendationid": "11811090", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029161120", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408651297}, "language": "english", "review": "Harem ending was so worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1408652049, "timestamp_updated": 1408652049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500269", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11810885": {"recommendationid": "11810885", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998420890", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1352098800}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uae30\uacc4\ub355\ud6c4\uc0c8\ub07c\ub4e4\uc774\ub098 \ud558\ub294\uac8c\uc784 \u3157", "timestamp_created": 1408651011, "timestamp_updated": 1408651011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498363", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11800277": {"recommendationid": "11800277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071548134", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392495589}, "language": "english", "review": "It's about that time when you got really mad trying to set your analogue clock.", "timestamp_created": 1408580102, "timestamp_updated": 1408580102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11788790": {"recommendationid": "11788790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031868974", "num_games_owned": 820, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 324, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457397818}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding story.

Visual Novels are completely different than what is considered to be a game so my expectations will change according to that, meaning I am looking for a decent story over anything else. If you don't want to read everything I have to say for whatever reason, skip down to the very bottom to read my overall impressions.\n\nA short summary on what the story is about:\n- Basically, you are an anonymous space investigator sent over to a deserted space vessal named the Mugunghwa to recover log files left behind by the ship's inhabitants in order to discover the reason for the ship's disappearance. You log on the ship's main computer and meet an AI named *Hyun-ae who is suprised to gain external contact after 622 years of idling so she is willing to help you recover as much data as you can before departing from the Mugunghwa for good.\n\nNow I shall move onto my opinions on each of the following sections:\n\nThe Story:\n- Personally, I don't like to read a lot of visual novels because to me, most of the stories they provide feels very similar to one another with the primary goal is getting to know a group of girls and ultimately pick one to be your lover. This however makes me feel like picking one of the two AI's (or both if you somehow cheat the system) is more or less a side objective to me that I will eventually complete, but aside from that, saying anything else for this section will make it more of a generalization of the whole novel with the possibility of leaving out important details so moving on...\n\nThe Theme:\n- This is pretty interesting to see topics like misogyny and conservative politics based on the Joseon Dynasty to appear in this form of media. Now after reading that first sentence, some people might think it has extreme views of feminism, but after reading through all of the logs, I never though it went to the point of being extreme, but also enough to make me open up and think about these topics in more detail. I will warn you some of the logs have some sexual themes, but thankfully no images.\n\nThe Characters:\n- When meeting the two AI's, you will notice they both possess the typical tropes you would usually see, in addition to having completely different political views and backgrounds, with *Hyun-ae from a more liberal background and *Mute from a more conservative background, leaving the investigator with a personality that is based on yours. Personally, I find both *Hyun-ae and *Mute pretty interesting to say the least. Other characters mentioned in the novel will only be read though log files and there are quite a bit of people to read about so I'm just going to let you find out who they are for yourself.\n\nDecisions:\n- There are five endings to reach and the choices made throughout your playthrough will determine what the AI's think of you (the harem ending requires you to cheat to some degree, which is pretty funny once you manage to do that). The questions you need to answer will mostly involve yes-no type questions. If you decide to pose as a woman, *Mute's dialogue and opinion on you will completely change, but *Hyun-ae's opinion will remain the same since you really never tell her any general information about the player.\n\nLength:\n- One playthrough might be around 4-6 hours average if you took your time to read. For something of that length, I could care less because I really enjoyed the story and the topics it presented.\n\nThe UI (User Interface)\n- Looking around in the terminal can be a bit troublesome at first, but you will eventually figure it out and the UI is overall easy to navigate.\n\nThe Soundtrack:\n- I would say the soundtrack is pretty decent and fits the mood for every scenario you read.\n\nWhat is my conclusion? I had a very intriguing experience that gave me traumatizing thoughts that will stick with me for the rest of my life. In my opinion, it is definitely worth full price in addition to the soundtrack composed by Isaac Schankler and of course, definitely worth having a look at. Don't pay any attention to the official Metacritic score simply because after reading them, it felt as if some of them were judged a little unfairly becuase they just didn't like the story and of course the novel was judged by ONE person with a total of five people from different publications reviewing this novel making the score completely skewered making it seem not as good as everyone says it is. If you are still skeptical despite everything I said, there is a demo for you to look at to see if you like what you have read so far.

The real goal of Hate Story is to understand the two AIs left on the Mugunghwa and the people who shaped their lives.\n\nDark in some places, saccharine in others, the tone shifts throughout the game but I never found myself experiencing whiplash... And for a detective story - a mystery, which means you should be kept guessing most of the arc - Hate Story's plot is telegraphed early on. But that you can see the answers coming is not necessarily a negative; not all stories are measured by their plots, instead by how they make the player feel, and Hate Story managed to engage my gooey center. I empathized with not just the AIs but also many of the background characters mentioned in the log files the AIs provide you with.\n\nAt the end of the day, whether you would enjoy Hate Story or not has more to do with you than the game itself. It\u2019s a polished experience, but if you don\u2019t enjoy reading for hours at a time or hard science fiction blended with a westerner\u2019s anime aesthetic, then there are other visual novel games out there for you. \n\nI\u2019ll put it another way: Hate Story is about people\u2019s stories, the player is almost an observer for most of the game. You ultimately decide the two AIs fate, but there\u2019s little leeway in the endings, which Hate Story boasts five of them...

In other words, I believe you'll either really like this game or really dislike this game.  As you can see from my thumbs up right there^, this game was certainly a hit for me, but as Visual Novels aren\u2019t for everyone, I cannot guarantee that it will be for you as well.\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story gives you, a deep space investigator, the task of sifting through the written records of the now dead inhabitants of a long lost (and now newly re-discovered) colony ship with the help of the ship's two cute and (mostly) friendly AIs.  As you read each document, you\u2019ll slowly piece together a fuller story of the ship\u2019s \u2018not-quite-right\u2019 society, and the events that lead to its ultimate demise.  I found the story tastefully dark and engaging enough to keep me flipping the pages (as much as you can flip pages in a Visual Novel) until the very end.\n\nThe only real complaint I have is the lack of a difficulty setting.  Granted by definition Visual Novels don\u2019t have much gameplay to them that could be altered by a difficulty setting, but in this VN in particular, there is one section where I would have enjoyed a bit more of a challenge.  With only mild spoilers, suffice to say that you are given too much time to complete a certain task that anyone with any sort of experience with Command Prompt will fly through in a quarter or less of the allotted time.  A difficulty setting that decreases that time would have been a nice addition.\n\nRelatively minor discrepancies aside though, I believe this game is definitely worth a shot if you\u2019ve ever got $10 (or $3.39 if you\u2019re buying during a super-sale like I did) to spare, whether it turns out to be a hit or a miss for you.", "timestamp_created": 1404004931, "timestamp_updated": 1404005032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574618", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10918359": {"recommendationid": "10918359", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994456767", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403381966}, "language": "english", "review": "Analogue is an absolutely wonderful game.

I also like the art (though, as made obvious by the screenshots, it's pretty minimal), and I really enjoyed the file structure of the game.

It's a good idea to keep a notebook and pen handy, or a tablet to take notes on.  The story is fragmented like a puzzle that is put together piece-by-piece.  The game is very unique in that regard and it's unlike anything I've ever played before.   I've played a lot of games with great storylines, including the  Final Fantasy games that provide a story where you just sit and play through like a movie.   This game is the opposite of a Final Fantasy game where the story is something that isn't just given to you, you have to unlock it piece by piece and then realize how each piece fits together like a puzzle.   Very cool idea and I'll also note that this game has multiple endings, just like Chrono Cross/Chrono Trigger or any of those other very famous SquareSoft story-based games.

Se voc\u00ea tiver cr\u00e9ditos sobrando, entretanto, vale muito \u00e0 pena.\n\nBom, sobre o jogo:\n\nAnalogue \u00e9 MUITO bom. Eu normalmente tenho expectativas min\u00fasculas sobre Visual Novels, porque elas sempre t\u00eam plotholes terr\u00edveis e/ou escrita ruim, mas Analogue n\u00e3o. Pra entender a hist\u00f3ria, \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que voc\u00ea tenha que jogar mais de 2 vezes. Uma para cada rota (*Hyun-Ae e *Mute), e uma pra tentar conseguir todos os logs. Isso \u00e9 um ponto positivo, apesar de n\u00e3o parecer. Se chama Replay-Value.\n\nPor ter poucos achievements (e f\u00e1ceis de conseguir, ali\u00e1s), voc\u00ea pode sentir a vontade de jogar o jogo novamente para consegu\u00ed-los. Felizmente voc\u00ea pode pular qualquer di\u00e1logo que j\u00e1 leu, aparentemente, mesmo se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o salvou o jogo depois de algumas conversas. Os extras tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o legais (concept arts, boxart, etc.)\n\nMas... o jogo tem um pequeno problema: MUITOS personagens irrelevantes. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 isso, mas nomes coreanos s\u00e3o DIF\u00cdCEIS de memorizar. Se o jogo n\u00e3o tivesse as \u00e1rvores geneal\u00f3gicas das duas fam\u00edlias num lugar bem f\u00e1cil de achar, seria um problema maior, mas ainda assim \u00e9 confuso.\n\nEm geral, o jogo \u00e9 \u00f3timo e superou as minhas expectativas.

Like Digital, the entire game is presented on a computer screen, though Analogue is a lot more futuristic while Digital is set on a retro 1980s computer.\nYou learn about what happened on the Mugunghwa, a lost colony ship in space, through reading various logs from a dystopian era - its last days. Parallel to uncovering these details, you interact with the two remaining AIs on the ship who help you discover more logs, add commentary & befriend you.\nA very well made game - it even has a reference list, showing that a lot of research was done on the Korean Joseon era.

It's creator, Christine Love, cheekily describes it as being more about transhumanism, traditional marriage, loneliness, and cosplay. Maybe that's true. All I can say is that as a man, the game struck me as unflinchingly feminist. Now, I don't mean that in a confrontational, all-men-are-rapist-pigs straw feminist sort of way. Hell, maybe feminism is not even the right word for it, maybe it's just a game about female experiences presented matter-of-factly. Ladies, this may seem obvious to you. But to us males, this is a wholly unsettling and unexpected revelation. \n\nThe story as outlined is simple and humble enough. You, a private detective (in space!), travel to a recently discovered wreck of a space ship, which had been previously lost for thousands of years. This ship once held an entire nation of people as it traveled to a distant planet. Somewhere along the way, the ship's inhabitants died out completely. It's up to you to sift through the ship's computer data (with the help of artificial intelligence friends) to discover the fate of the lost nation.  \n\nIf you're like me, that story sounds fairly pedestrian so far, right? But the ship's recovered computer logs tell a much different, much more personal story. \n\nOver thousands of years, this isolated society has regressed in both education and culture to the whereabouts of 15th century Korea. Despite living on an impressive space-faring vessel, and being assisted by futuristic artificial intelligences, its inhabitants are mostly simple farm folk who know little of the ship, or the universe, around them. And just like in 15th century Korea, conditions for women are horrifyingly bad. \n\nThe AIs ask you personal questions throughout the game, such as who you are, where you're from, and whether or not you've visited Pyonyang. You know, getting-to-know-you stuff. The first time I played through, I was asked if I was a male or female, and I answered honestly. I played through the game, and that normally would have been the end of it. However, there's a Steam achievement for playing through a particular ending as both a male and a female, so I played the same ending again. As a female, the writing changes. In this new scene, it was all I could do to not reach through the computer monitor and slap that AI around until the smug falls out. \n\nThis AI's dialogue is fairly standard and neutral as a male, while as a female, the AI's dialogue is condescending and dismissive of everything you say. As a male, this concept that I could be disregarded so easily was a bit shocking. \n\nIs Analogue a FUN game? By no means. In fact, there's a race-against-the-clock mission (in a visual novel!) that really should have been heavily altered. But its story is solid, and compelling enough to make you overlook its flaws. Even weeks later, the story stuck with me, haunting me, making me question every interaction I've ever had with women over the course of my life. \n\nTL;DR - Do you like reading? Play this game.

Analogue will not give an adrenaline-rush game with action and things constantly happening. What Analogue does provide is a remarkable story far above what most any other game provides, an experience that is not easily brushed off, and in my opinion is one of the best games out there on steam.\n\nThe gameplay of Analogue isn't even what everybody would consider \"gameplay.\" You read through the journal logs of people you don't know, skipping around between people. Between some of the reading, you converse with one of the two AI, mostly about them, yourself, or what you just read. Just about the entire gameplay experience is reading, and while this may seem boring Analogue is a game that shines when you really stick with it. At first, it does feel rather boring, and you find yourself not caring about what you are reading. But as time goes on, you really start to get deep into it and it becomes a remarkable story that you really feel invested in. The story itself is very dark, and at times gruesome, but never feels ridiculously so. The anime art style gives a major contrast to the dark themes in the story.\n\nThe game itself isn\u2019t without its flaws. It really does take time to start to care about the logs, and there really isn\u2019t anything to switch up the reading, save for answering some questions and a short and extremely easy cmd segment. Furthermore, one of the endings gives you a major moral choice, posing an extremely difficult question that is very hard to choose. However, if you choose one of them, it gives you essentially the same ending as a \"game over.\" Technically you have completed the game, but it gives a sense that your moral position was \"wrong\" which is not appropriate to make a player feel like when you give them such a hard moral question and they respond with a perfectly valid and understandable answer. Some of the \"dialogue\" with the AIs can also feel unimportant and pointless at times.\n\nWhile the game isn\u2019t perfect, Analogue: A Hate Story is still clearly a phenomenal game. It goes beyond what most games do, and delivers not only a great, deep story, but also one that has more impact than most any other video game story out there. It leaves you really thinking about morals, but more than \"right-verses-wrong. Rather, it covers hard topics, such as self-preservation, revenge, guilt, manipulation, betrayal, politics, murder, oppression, women's rights, and domestic abuse. Some may compare it to a book because of the lack of control you have over what happens and the sheer amount of reading, but I disagree, as I feel no book could quite deliver the same impact as this game does. Overall, Analogue is a game that I highly recommend, and one that is worth the time to get invested in. It is a dark game with massive impact you will not soon forget, and I doubt you will regret purchasing if you really take the time to care about the brilliant story.\n", "timestamp_created": 1403211575, "timestamp_updated": 1403211575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10536132": {"recommendationid": "10536132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140176725", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463274406}, "language": "english", "review": "Not much I can say besides buy this game, it's GRATE like cheese.

Unlike most other \"video games\" this one is not really an action filled/ fast paced work, so if you don't want to get into something that does not involve shooting or killing, this is not a game necessarily made for you. But, if you enjoy an emotional and worthwhile story, this is a must!  Before I got this game, I thought that all visual novels were basically hentai games. I was TOTALLY wrong about that. I don't believe that a game had ever made me feel so much emotions or had mpacted me before. Of course the awesome music also intensifies the experience.\n\nIF you are into reading or at least decent in reading large amounts, then this game will provide to you a chance to really get into the text and learn much about different things.

Na dann werde ich dir eine kure Review geben.\n\n\"Analogue: A Hate Story\" kommt im typischen Anime/Manga Stil daher und sieht, meiner Meinung nach, mehr als akzeptabel aus.\nDas Charakterdesign ist sch\u00f6n anzusehen, wobei die Hintergrundgrafik sich als sehr langweilig gestaltet. Zum Gameplay gibt es nicht viel zu sagen. Man liest. Und das wohl die meiste Zeit. Gelegentlich gibt es noch kleine Kommandozeilenpassagen, diese sind durchaus interessant, sind Spieldauertechnisch aber verst\u00e4ndlicherweise nur geringf\u00fcgig enthalten und dienen wohl nur dazu dem Spiel etwas mehr Interaktion zu zuf\u00fcgen.

Sure, there are elements of that format, and you do have the ability to manipulate the story somewhat through your responses. However, this game is more of a visual novel in the purest sense: it invites you to uncover a story. Apparently there's 59,000 words of text in this game, so if you're feeling unfulfilled by finishing subsequent playthroughs within ten minutes like one of the top-rated negative reviewers, you're doing it wrong.\n\nTo be fair, Analogue is a short game. There's not a huge amount to it, and it doesn't take a significant time investment to complete. However, what is there is charming and thought-provoking, with a surprisingly interesting - if slightly two-dimensional - story to be dug through. I'm sure if you were to put the game into Skip Mode, you probably could get the best ending in ten minutes, but you'd be totally missing the point.

The two AI, Hyun-ae and Mute, are gorgeous in their differences, and humorous in comparison, one showing somethings while hiding others and vice versa. And it's a good thing you've got these two (ONLY two? In a VN? But but... yeah. This is no ero story :P) chirpy and/or eager-to-please starbabes to guide you through the diaries of  the Mugungwe's last days because... Everyone will read something different into the historical world created, into the character of the Pale Bride, and into how everything comes to a conclusion. I, for one, fell helplessly in love with a fake AI in a game... so there's that.\n\nHowever you choose to enjoy the game, as an explorer, as a route seeker, as a completionist, there are hours of... entertainment, I won't always say enjoyment. Some messages are uncomfortable to hear and Christina Love does, once again, a wonderful job of giving us a rude awakening to things we might rather ignore.\n\nRead like a novel, this is harrowing and heartfelt.

You can play it and understand it, but it would be better for you to play that before you play this, at least to get the gist of what Christine Love is about with her writing. But anyway, here's my review of the game, trying to prevent any spoilers to the best of my abilities:\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThe time is... Very far into the future. After the horrific events of \"Digital: A Love Story\" that took place in the alternate future of 1982, we are introduced to the idea that a machine that the government created had a slight knowledge constrainment complex. The computer decided to split its components to learn the most about the one thing that it could not comprehend: Human emotion. Therefore, the one thing the computer tried to emulate was humans; some capable of something the computer, affectionately named \"Mother\" by the seperate constructs, had not been prior: Love. \n\nMuch later in time, humanity has developed brilliant technologies: one of them being the fact that you can travel through space with Light Speed and beyond, with several colonies set up around the galaxy. However, the thing is, colonies had to be set up the hard way years before: Generation Vessels. A Generation Vessel is a huge vessel capable of containing an entire society for literally generations while they head for the next planet to colonize. However, there's a problem. When society is contained in such a way that leaves the beurocrats, the power-hungry and the overall morons to run the ship, eventually people forget things. Things that might be important. For instance, why you're even floating in space to begin with. And so the sad tale of the Mugunghwa begins with, ironically, it becoming lost in space for years.\n\nThis is where you come in. As a freelance worker, you get a job from the Museum after the Mugunghwa suddenly appears out of nowhere, completely derelict. As you enter the console and try to log in, you realize you can't obtain the files you require to complete the mission without help. Good thing there's an AI in charge of the ship named *Hyun-ae who's more than willing to help you find the password... Or maybe a little more, especially since there's a discrepency: an AI named *Mute is supposed to be in charge of the ship, not *Hyun-ae, and the fact that a recurring character by the name of \"The Pale Bride\" keeps appearing in the log documents... What link does she have with what happened to the Mugunghwa? \n\nSTORYTELLING:\n\nI would like to point out that the storytelling in this game is fantastic. It's perfectly paced, however you need to take one thing into consideration: The logs that appear are not in chronological order, until others are unlocked. Speaking of which, how you answer questions reveal different logs for you to read, as well as the different logs you show *Hyun-ae, the different logs you would recieve if you showed the same to *Mute. Aside from the jumbled chronology, it's really well done, and I commend Christine Love highly for it. \n\nPlus, when you actually get to spend some time talking to the AI themselves, I found myself wishing that I could actually be speaking to them, Cortana style. (Actually, if someone blends the Cleverbot program with this thing, that would be awesome) They are rather life-like, and that's fantastic. It made me care about the characters, and that is really awesome, especially for a game. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nAh yes, this is something that shouldn't really even be an element in Visual Novels, should it? Kind of goes against what the Visual Novel thing actually is. But in this, I must say, when you have to step in and make big decisions -- and there are several, and some will make you sweat -- you really have to think about them. There is some actual gameplay in there, so it isn't a glorified clicking or space bar simulator, or anything, though the \"gameplay\" is really just a console you have to wrestle with. There was one point when the game... Well, I will abstain from the details, but I felt legitimately relieved, intelligent and glad I love Sci-Fi afterward. It's awesome, and it is one of the things that makes this game awesome.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThere are no voice actors, much unlike Steins;Gate, Chaos;Head or most other Visual Novels, which means the only real sounds are the generic button sounds and the soundtrack. Now, the generic button sounds are actually quite good, and I quite enjoy the sound that plays when you show a log to the AI. But the real thing that I enjoy about the sound is the music. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and I highly reccommend you buy the Soundtrack with it. It's really well made, and it conveys what is happening perfectly. It's very atmospheric, and I quite enjoy it.\n\nREPLAY VALUE:\n\nThere is no linear plot. It has something of seven different endings, meaning you are going to get a bucketload of replay value in this. Plus, there are tons of achievements and tons of logs for you to unlock!\n\nOVERALL:\n\nWhat can I say? You can dress *Hyun-ae in a lab coat and she makes a Steins;Gate reference. You can't go wrong with this game. However, if you do not like Visual Novels, I might play Digital: A Love Story first.", "timestamp_created": 1393124411, "timestamp_updated": 1393124411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9225875": {"recommendationid": "9225875", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972147252", "num_games_owned": 1388, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393114700}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a stellar example of what interactive fiction can be.", "timestamp_created": 1393114854, "timestamp_updated": 1393114854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499476", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9224602": {"recommendationid": "9224602", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990635634", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393197469}, "language": "english", "review": "gud", "timestamp_created": 1393107769, "timestamp_updated": 1393107769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9221837": {"recommendationid": "9221837", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966580242", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393098881}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this for the Valentine's sale.

I have played a few like it but most were free online games that were not very good. Picked this game up on a steam sale and it has gotten me interested in this genre. The gameplay is pretty much reading through letters and journal entries,  trying to understand what caused the death of the ships inhabitants. The best part of the game to me would be the two A.I. programs, the soundtrack, and the way you interact with the game.\n\nThe game introduces you to the two A.I.s and they are fun to be with. Sure they play up to some stereotypes and some people will get upset that the choices you make with them basically boil down to being nice or being rude with no gray area. I like this because if the relationships in the game were as complicated as real life then it would be frustrating. The two A.I.s are fun enough to listien to and interact with. I did not find a single time that I found myself wishing that they would shut up (though to be fair I only went through the game once and so have limited experince with one of the A.I.s.) The tedium of reading letters and journal entries are broken up by showing the letters to the A.I.s and getting their view of it which can be radically different depending who you show it to. This fleshes out the story while allowing you to get to know the A.I. \n\nThe soundtrack of the game is fun to listen to. It re-enforces the space theme of the game and changes at some of the more important parts. I can't say much more about the soundtrack since I am a pleb with little knowledge of music. All I can say is that I love music from video games that I can listen to in the backround and this serves that purpose. It is a soundtrack that I do plan on buying. \n\nFinally I enjoy the way that you interact in the game. You start the game at a computer terminal, typing in commands. The rest of the game is spent going through screens, reading journals and interacting much the same way you would if it was actually your computer. I have not played a lot of games that used this set up so it may just be the novelty speaking but I felt less disconnected from the game than other games I have played in the similar vein (again, a very small pool.) The computer interface is used very effectively about half-way through the game in a way that was loads of fun.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this game. Is it worth 10$? I can't answer that because I bought it for less and am new to the genre and don't know the average cost of these games. I enjoyed it and if you can get it on a steam sell I would suggest you do. I had fun and there is some replay value with the multiple endings. So to me it was worth it and I might pick up the sequel at full price with the soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1393021525, "timestamp_updated": 1393021686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9204572": {"recommendationid": "9204572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015848596", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450613665}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud604\uc560\uc9dc\uc751 \ud558\uc545\ud558\uc545", "timestamp_created": 1392991488, "timestamp_updated": 1392991488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9199478": {"recommendationid": "9199478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078996516", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1392559292}, "language": "english", "review": "This is hands down one of my top 10 games ever.

As it's disappearance is an unsolved mystery of history, you are assigned to retrieve from the derelict any and all logs that might reveal what happened to the ship.\n\nRemote accessing the direlect's central computer, you meet two AI who help you navigate the logs, left behind by the long deceased crew.\n\nGameplay: Like you would expect from a NV, the game is HEAVILY text-based.  The opening has you interfacing with a really basic computer interface (the override terminal), where you have to type out the commands; for example \"enable_ai [name].\"  \n\nFrom there, the game proceeds to a slick, minimalistic interface.  The currently active AI stands to left, and on the right are buttons to talk to the AI, access the log documents, and return to the override terminal.  (It also contains recently read messages and the \"Exit\" and \"Options\" buttons on the bottom right).\n\nDialogue with the AI is handled through \"chat bubbles,\" while your responses are limited to two choices (typical of a \"yes or no\" or \"agree or disagree\" variety).  The majority of the game, however, is spent reading the logs, letter, diary entries, ect, of the crew.  Only a few of these logs are initially available.  But you have the ability to show these logs to the AI's, to which they will give a response, often unlocking related material.\n\nAnother thing of note is that during conversations with the AI, *Hyun-ae in particular, the \"chat bubble\" will often proceed to fill up with text, only to have the \"bubble\" suddenly flicker, part of the text gone to replaced by something different.\n\nMy overall views on the interface is that it does it's job.  It's clever, minimalist,and streamlined, allowing you to focus on the story itself.\n\nStory aka the part when the review really begins\n\nWhile being set far, far into the future, the story is actually about history.  To be more specific, it is about the the civilisation of the crew which, having been separated from any outside influences for hundreds of years, have adapted a Joseon Dynasty-like society.  (It should also be noted that all the crew are descendants of Korea)\n\n\nThe story can be divided into two what I like to call \"arcs,\" (the correct terminology might be \"path,\"  but I feel the word \"arc\" better expresses how I viewed them), the *Hyun-ae Arc and the *Mute Arc.  Each arc is the sum total of the logs that particular AI provide and the input they give concerning those logs.\n\n*Hyun-ae Arc:   What I consider to be the primary arc, this Arc focuses on the Pale Bride and the Kim family, to which she belonged.  To be blunt, I didn't really enjoy this arc all this much.  It relies heavily on culture shock and plot twists, to shock the player into having the desired emotions of disgust, sorrow, and empathy, and to communicate the ideas and thoughts behind the arc.   Unfortunately, I already have had a general knowledge of this type of culture, and I found myself able to predict the major plot twists well in advance.  As a result, I never felt any shock (although I will give the story credit for momentarily making my sick to my stomach when I realized what the last plot twist was).\n\nThis problem compounds with the issue that the arc really has only one character, the Pale Bride.  Almost all the logs in the arc are there only because they mention the Pale Bride (or were written by her), and the arc's AI, *Hyun-ae, only really humanizes the Pale Bride, only giving generalist descriptions of the other characters involved.  That is fine, that's what this arc is about, the Pale Bride and her alone.  But the problem is, to truly enjoy the arc, you need to sympathize with the Pale Bride.  But the only way the story makes you sympathise with the character is via shock, once again bringing us to the issue stated above.\n\nOverall without that all important shock factor, this arc felt try dry and uninspiring.  It is, however, very detailed and realistic in its presentation of the ship's society, and it proves to be a fairly interesting experience (it caused me to lose a night's sleep, in fact).\n\n*Mute Arc:  This arc focuses on the Smith family, and *Mute's relationship with them.  In contrast to the *Hyun-ae Arc, this arc focuses on humanization of its characters, something it pulls of wonderfully.  As a close friend of the Smith family, much of *Mute's dialogue focus on trying to get the player to better understand the members of the Smith, to not only see the bad in them, but also see the good.  Via *Mute's feedback, each life.  They were all flawed; many of them did horrible things; but it also made you realize that they weren't necessarily people.  It made you better understand the circumstances that accompanied their actions, their feelings, their motives.  It is this humanization that made me love this arc.\n\nSummary & Recommendation: A slick, streamlined interface; a story with a highly detailed society based on an actual society in our past; a \"primary\" arc that relies heavily on a shock factor, without which the arc is uninspiring (but still fairly interesting); and a secondary \"arc\" that does a great job of humanizing it's character, of presenting characters that are deeply flawed but not necessarily bad people.\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story is a fascinating and entertaining experience.

It's also a bit different in terms of play to a normal VN, which makes it interesting.\n\nWhen I want to read a visual novel I dont typically look at steam as my first route - I naturally know a lot more about Japanese authors as I got into the medium through Fate/Stay Night and Cross+Channel; however I decided to give this VN a shot. I cannot reccomend it enough.\n\nSince I am going to assume you already know about visual novels and dont need any 'herp derp \"its not really a game\"', I will spare you that. Instead you will get my first impressions from my first completion.\n\nTo get them out of the way: Music and Visuals.\nThe music is nicely done, setting a good tone. It isn't 'in your face' amazing, nor are there any specific tracks that are really memorable - but the music does set the tone nicely. My only complaint is a minor one: when going between different log menus, the different tracks sometimes have a somewhat dissonant transition (that is, a tense soundtrack quickly going to a relaxing menu soundtrack).\nThe visuals are also nice, the menu design fits the game as a whole and the character designs and artwork are very good, I cant speak for *Mute, but *Hyun-ae's expressions are always clear, and her idle sprite is reflective of her current state even outside of specific conversations (Also the little achievement icons are adorable, for reals.). Being able to dress *Hyun-ae up in various outfits and have amusing roleplay conversations (She even quotes Makise Kurisu [of Steins;Gate] in her scientist outfit, which is more than enough reason to buy it I mean come on.)\n\nSo with that, the story itself.\nYou go to a Korean spaceship to figure out what the hell went wrong with it. You are tasked with collecting log data in order to piece together the mystery of it all, and encounter 2 AIs along the way. Since I wish to avoid spoilers I'll mention things in a more aroundabout way.\nThe tone is pretty dark. The story concerns itself with looking at a society that has no women's rights - at one point mentioning that most women's messages were deleted after being read, as they weren't worth the harddrive space, and it would protect the female sender as women were meant to be illiterate. Hearing about how the Pale Bride was mistreated, seen as acting like a boy for showing any kind of independant thought was quite disgusting too read - but that is exactly the purpose of the story. The themes are as above. I could go into more detail, but I feel I've said enough.\n\nFinally, the presentation. This is not a VN where you watch characters interact with character sprites on screen. Instead you read logs of correspondance between characters, with the AI's opinion given to you. As more logs are unlocked over time and you uncover more of the story, the story progresses. There is also a console command system in place for switching between active AI and various other elements (such as which costume you want to put *Hyun-ae in). Its definately a new and interesting experience for people who are not used to VNs which are not in the more typical format, and at the current sale price - definately worth a try.\n\nOverall: Pretty damn solid VN. I will be playing it again now that I understand how it goes a little more. Strongly reccomend if you are running out of your backlog and want something interesting.\n\n[SPOILERS]\nThe download command ends your game.

I'm a big fan of the science-fiction and transhuman genres, and Analogue seemed to offer a bit of both.\n\nI was not prepared for what this game had to offer.\n\nPerhaps calling it a \"game\" is a bit generous. It's an interactive novel, with almost no action sequences to speak of. The closest you'll come to any sort of twitch-reflex or quick-time events is typing into a terminal while an angry countdown clock stares you down. But still, there are choices to make and consequences to pay, with five potential endings - four of which can be carried right into the second game, Hate Plus.\n\nDon't go into this game expecting action and excitement. If you're looking for that, then you're in the wrong place. But if you enjoy a gripping tale of political intrigue, psychological horror, and surprisingly dark themes - then this is absolutely worth the price of admission. Don't let the cute, anime-inspired artwork fool you. This game is absolutely for adults, and not because of any sexual themes or nudity (although there IS a bit of the former).\n\nIf there's anything to complain about, it's perhaps the usual drawback of an interactive novel. It's relatively linear, fairly short, and light on replay value. Oh, sure, it's worth trying for the different endings (most of which require their own distinct play-through), but you'll still be forced to read a lot of the same letters and dialogue. And, while the writing is absolutely fantastic, it still gets repetitive the second or third time through - especially once you've learned all of the twists and turns that the story has to offer.\n\nBut still - if you're into mature, psychological tales of intrigue and murder, then this game is absolutely worth at least ONE play-through.

There are very limited choices when it comes to the visual novel genre on Steam, but this is well worth the find.

It might sound like the plot of a horror game, but believe me it's nothing like that. You start out typing commands into a computer prompt, figuring out how to maneuver through the operating system. Later you'll come to meet the two remaining members of the ship: two AI girls known as Hyun-ae and Mute. The two have very different opinions on what happened; and their conflicting stories will add to your dilemma. You spend the rest of the game rather tediously sorting through encrypted ship logs one by one...the only boring part of the game, really. Reading each log is immensely interesting, though; like reading a rich novel filled with romance, political intrigue, drama and suspense. You will also interact with the girls a lot; who you believe, the choices you make, what logs you decide to show to them and how you answer your question will guide the story to it's conclusion.

It is an emotional roller-coaster from start to finish that swings everywhere between playful fun and horrified disbelief. \n\nIt is hard to summarise the story without spoiling anything, but I'll try doing so by saying that it's a story about the devolution of society as we know it now into complete and utter patriarchy where the women themselves believe that their rightful place is in the service of their husbands. The only exception to that is our heroine who provides most of dialogue and commentary on the individual files.\n\nSpeaking of files (and correspondence), those are the primary narrative tool that Christine Love employed to tell the story. That is perhaps the most unique aspect of Analogue, when it comes to the storytelling. Instead of exposition through dialogue, which is the most typical form of exposition in visual novels, we are greeted by a wonderful system which makes the game feel more like a literary work when compared to its run-of-the-mill counterparts and allows you to form your own opinion on the matter, rather than forcing that of the characters on you. Dialogue of course is in the game, but the amount of characters is minimal and they mostly provide commentary in which they express their own personal stance on the situation explored in the entry.\n\nThe file system, though, was also the source of my biggest problem with the game. It may be due to my own incompetence, but I did manage to get myself stuck at a point where I was clueless as to how to gain access to the rest of the files, which was also the reason why I had the game sitting on my hard drive for months only 2/3 finished, because once I lost track of the story, it was a bit of a challenge to get myself back on track again. Today I finally gathered enough courage to try and get back on the story-train and I simply blitzed through it. The story left a deep impression in me and for those unsure about buying this game, yes, it was worth every penny.\n\nPS: Can't wait to start finally playing Hate Plus!\nPPS: Christine Love, your Twitter is one of the coolest places on the Internet!\n\nEdit: Spelling", "timestamp_created": 1391640355, "timestamp_updated": 1391669241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8981156": {"recommendationid": "8981156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016323174", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478953624}, "language": "english", "review": "Put your prejudice away.

It'll take you about an hour to finally get a handle on who is who.\n\nThis game has a lot of choices.  I'm a fan of the visual novels with three choices max.  Each creating a separate ending.  Having too many choices makes you start second-guessing whether or not you made the right one.  Unless you're aiming for a certain achievement, most of them don't matter.\n\nAnd finally, there are some minor inconsistencies.  For instance, you have a multiple choice user input because text translation is not supposed to be working.  And yet you are still able to use the text field to find specific records.  If you go out on a limb and believe that the text field is directly linked to the underlying command line operating system and not to the AI generated user interface, then it makes sense.  But it's a complicated explanation and there's no implication that that's the case.\n\nOverall this story tells a tale that makes you decide which side is right and which side is wrong.  But there are some stunning reveals contained within both sides that make you realize that your first conclusion was wrong.  So if you get the game, check out both sides.\n\nThen try and figure out whether or not the perpetrator of the Mugunghwa's final moments were justified.", "timestamp_created": 1390639299, "timestamp_updated": 1390639299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494118", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8809756": {"recommendationid": "8809756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025838564", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1393728096}, "language": "english", "review": "I don\u2019t usually enjoy these types of games, but I liked this one. It\u2019s sort of like an interactive mystery novel with pictures (be prepared fod for a lot of reading). The reason I liked it is because the story is, shockingly, pretty interesting. It also introduces enough game elements to prevent it from being nothing more than a pure text adventure and the length is just right.\n\nYou play the part of a salvager who is trying to uncover what happened on a derelict generation ship, which is one of the theorized ways humans might be able to explore the galaxy. The way this story goes is how I think such an attempt would end in real life, too (I\u2019ll stop here before revealing any spoilers).\n\nThere are different levels of depth to be discovered to the story as well as multiple endings. What you uncover depends on what questions you ask and how deep you dig. The game is also timed, in a way, so that after a certain point certain endings become impossible depending on what you\u2019ve done so far. Thankfully, the game\u2019s length is paced excellently so right around the time you are getting tired of reading the text, you\u2019ll find yourself near the end. You\u2019re also able to speed through much of the text on subsequent playthroughs to see different endings, which is nice.\n\nI liked the music a lot, too. It sets a very appropriate mood throughout the story. I played this with headphones on and I\u2019d recommend that. It greatly increases the immersive feel as this game is best enjoyed with a couple of hours blocked out and no distractions to take you away from it, not unlike reading a book.\n\nIs it worth $10, though? That\u2019s a tough call and will depend on just how much you like this sort of thing. It will only take you 2-3 hours to get through this and considerably less to view the alternate endings, if you even care about doing that. And once you beat it, there is little reason to play through it again. I bought it during a Steam sale, though, and am content with what I paid for it.\n\nI will say that the music and writing are above average and the artwork is well done.

You are an investigator in the far future, looking into the mystery of a disabled colony ship recently discovered in deep space. Your task is to work your way through the logs of the ancient ship to determine what happened to the population, along with the help of the ship's onboard AI.\n\nArtistically, Analogue is an excellent novel. Its graphically appealing, with suitable music to fit the mood. The characters are well designed in their anime stylings, though outside of the characters there isn't much in the way of artwork. The story itself is deeply engrossing as you watch the plot unfold and the secrets of the various players are revealed.\n\nThis game falls short in the technicals. The game occasionally had trouble rendering, even in fullscreen mode, which caused lag on the cursor. The reader also leaves something to be desired, with occasional issues in scrolling.\n\nText heavy, this is really only a game for people who enjoy deep plot and lots of reading.

If you don't like to read, you're going to hate this game. There's no way around it. Now that that is out of the way, on to the review.\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story is best classified as a Visual Novel. For those unfamiliar with this style of game, you're essentially reading a book, taking control of a character's actions. I.E. it's a choose-your-own-adventure style book... with pictures (hence Visual). For those unfamiliar with this type of book, the story progresses up to a point, then you're given a choice: \"If you choose to do A, go to page 49, if you choose B, go to page 81,\" where the story continues based on the decision you picked.\n\nTime for my opinions:\nI really enjoyed this game. I got immersed into the story and honestly had fun making decisions both honestly and silly-ly (not a word, I know; but hopefully you get the point). Not everyone is going to be so easily immersed into the story (at least the forums give credence to that), I ride the emotional roller coaster easily enough to understand that about myself. What might be most interesting about the game is that I really didn't like most of what went on in the log files of the game, yet I still think it's a well done game.\n\nI'm just going to toss the summery into the TL;DR section.\n\nTL;DR\nThose that like reading, and what-if scenarios will likely enjoy this game.\nVisual Novel enthusists will also likely enjoy this game.\nThis game can be completed (100% achievements) in under 10 hours.\nIf you can get immersed in the story, you will love this game.

I've had limited experience with visual novel games, most of them stemming from well known titles such as Fate/Stay Night and Clannad as the likes. But lets get on with the review.\n\nStory: Lets start here, since visual novel's main draw is the story.. The game starts off as you playing as a space engineer recieving a distress signal. Upon reaching the ship, you reach the mainframe and start looking at the logs, unsuspectingly coming across an A.I. From there, you find out what happened to the ship and its crew. The story was fantastic, and gives very interesting in-sight into how women were treated in earlier centuries, as well as ancient korean traditions. The characters you read and meet upon have their quirky personalities you will come to deal with, and they done great work on them as well. \n\nGraphics: Great hand-drawn korean style artwork. It lacks the luster of triple A visual novel games, but the artwork isn't the main focus, but the story. Don't expect Gainax level artwork, but its still pretty good.\n\nGameplay: To many budding visual novel gamers, the type of user interface is quite different. Menu's and selecting options can be a real challenge intially, but once you get a hang of things it's really not that bad. And of course, reading is the gameplay here, and read you shall. In-game, you will read and read upon logs in which you find out what happened to the crew, there are also moments where you make choices that will determine the outcome of the end. There are also few sequences where you do some activites which is a interesting change of pace. Overall, pretty solid for a visual novel.\n\nReplayablity: Of course there is replayability, mostly in which you start over and see what would happen if you were to take a different route.

Its so good it has reinvigorated my love of the visual novel format and cemented this author/designer/studio as an instabuy for future products.\n\nThe mechanics of this game is reading through letters of a derelict spaceship floating in space and it is your job to figure out what is going on. All of the things you will read will not be in order so you could be reading about a night out with the guys form someone you have never heard of and the next log you read is from the captain's wife. Then you read more and find ways to connect these 2 things and uncover the mystery of who is who what they did and how it got everyone killed.\n\nThe entire time you are reading logs an AI joins you and assists with logs and giving you any information she has and trys to fill the plot in with her. The personality of the AI that you meet is great and helps give the story a personal feeling. (I know this is going to sound sappy) but that makes it seem the story is trying to communicate with you directly the way a book just can't.\n\nI can't recommend this enough.

They both had their own personality and beliefs. They were very deep charcters, but we also got to see why they were the way they were. The game is mainly played from reading diary entries from the ship's crew. Through that you gain insight on what happened on it. You spend a little bit of the game in a DOS style console. It's not hard or as complex as DOS though. Both the message reading system and DOS part of the game are really well done.\n\nThe Bad: The only small nitpick I have with the game is that it was hard for me to keep up with the characters with no sort of way to just click a name and have their bio pop up (or at least what I know about them so far). There isn't really any bad parts to this game unless you don't like reading or you want something with a little more interaction like you'd get from another genre.\n\nThe Ugly: N/A No bugs, no crashes, just a clean game.\n\nSummary: If you like to read and you want a good story buy this.

If, instead, you're interested in this sort of thing or is willing to try something different out, read on.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, WOW is Analogue good. Probably one of the best things I've tried out on Steam recently! It's about you, a space investigator, attempting to find out what happened to a ruined spaceship (the Mugunghwa). A simple premise, but the execution is amazing.\n\nTo start off, let's talk about the presentation. The entire story is told through old logs written by the ship's inhabitants, as well as conversations with its AIs (*Hyun-ae and *Mute), and all of this is seen through a single computer interface. Again, it's simple, but it works perfectly while also being quite unusual, so I really liked it. It does a very good job at delivering the plot and setting by simultaneously giving you a lot of information while also allowing your imagination to put everything together by itself.\n\nAnd speaking of the setting, that's where Analogue truly shines! First off, it's based on Korean culture, which is... not something that you see very often (if at all), so it's refreshing to have something like this. Second, I really appreciate the research that was put into it. As the author explains in the bibliography, society aboard the Mugunghwa was based on a certain period of Korean history, and knowing that things like this actually DID happen at some point in history adds so much more weight to the story, as well as having the secondary benefit of making it educative without feeling forced.\n\nBut what about the story, huh? There's no easy way of explaining it properly, but it's a wild ride. The horrible things detailed in some of the logs really leave an impression on you (sup Block 1), but you also have things such as *Hyun-ae dressing up in a maid outfit and being adorable or *Mute being tsundere, and the contrast between the serious and easygoing parts causes both to be even more impactful. In addition, though the narrative is mostly direct, it still sometimes leaves little hints about certain things here and there, so that you can put everything together in your head before seeing it explained in a log or something, and it's great.\n\nOther things to talk about... the art, while not the best, is still pretty good, and does its job well. Same goes for the music, pretty much. And I really enjoyed that one puzzle involving the reactor and a command-line interface.\n\nBut of course, Analogue is not without faults, and I find that most of those can be found in its technical side. It's annoying how you need to wait a second for buttons to work after you change pages, and there are some problems involving event flags, such as the one involving decrypting Block 3... but really, those things are pretty much insignificant in the grand scheme of things, not managing to be anything more than annoyances.\n\nBottom line: if you don't mind reading a lot and is interested in learning something about Korean history, definitely give Analogue a try. I certainly didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be.", "timestamp_created": 1386167013, "timestamp_updated": 1386167013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7903797": {"recommendationid": "7903797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027105020", "num_games_owned": 506, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421148186}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ube44\uc96c\uc5bc \ub178\ubca8\uc778\ub2e4.\n\uc77c\ub2e8 \uc7a5\ub974\ubd80\ud130 \ud638\ubd88\ud638\uac00 \uac08\ub9ac\uc9c0.\n\uc5ec\uae30\uc11c \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub97c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba74 100% \ub124\ud0c0\uc77c\ud14c\ub2c8 \uac04\ub2e8\ud558\uac8c \uc124\uba85\ud558\uba74 \uadf9\ub2e8\uc801\uc778 \ub0a8\uc874\uc5ec\ube44 \uc870\uc120\uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \ud604\ub300\uc778 \uc784.\n\uc678\uad6d\uc778\uc774 \ubc14\ub77c\ubcf8 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uacfc\uac70 \ub77c\uace0 \ubcf4\uba74 \ub418\uaca0\ub124.\n\ubb50 \ubcf8\uc778\uc740 \ub098\ub984\ub370\ub85c \ub9cc\uc871\ud588\uc74c.\n\n\ub367\ubd99\uc5ec\uc11c \uc815\uc2dd \ubc88\uc5ed\uac00\uac00 \ubc88\uc5ed\ud55c \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \ud560\uae00\ud654\ub97c \uc790\ub791\ud55c\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1386118663, "timestamp_updated": 1386118663, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7903044": {"recommendationid": "7903044", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993332289", "num_games_owned": 448, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422723452}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't start playing this if you have an exam the next day- this story grips you.

Through the eyes of the impotent and the weak in a society, Love teaches about the corruption inherent in absolute power and the evils of paternalism.\n\nMuch like Margaret Atwood (especially in her \"The Handmaid's Tale\"), Love here very obviously takes a side, but unlike Atwood, Love exercises subtlety in her approach and refrains from meandering tracts meant to score political points against straw men. In Atwood's work, the message might as well have been duct-taped to an anvil and dropped on the reader's head, but here, the effect is just as shocking, but nowhere near as heavy-handed.\n\nThe art and sound are also excellent, more than enough to serve their purpose in delivering the story.\n\nWatch out, this one's got a wicked bite.\n\n== LambdaScores ==\nStory: 8/10 | Art: 7/10 | Sound: 7/10 | Engine: 7/10 | Overall: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1385989267, "timestamp_updated": 1385989267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.595014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7873376": {"recommendationid": "7873376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996542922", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495405099}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well made VN.

On the Mugunghwa you find two AI's in charge of the logs of the ship. The gameplay is pretty simple, read the logs, show them to the AI's so they can help you find more, and repeat until you are satisfied. Maybe you can get one of the AI's back home, maybe not, or maybe both.\nBut what makes this so amazing is the backstory behind the Mugunghwa, its people and its tragic conclusion. Saying anything about that would be considered spoiler, so if you want to know what happened, either buy this, try the demo to catch a glimpse, or get spoiled somewhere else, I'm not talking anymore about the heartbreaking story.\nOnly found a pair of problems with this game. First, sometimes it's possible to get \"stuck\", specially during the meltdown sequence. That's not neccesarily bad, but can get frustrating. The other problem comes with the specs. Even if my computer can move this, sometimes it lags a little bit. It doesn't affect the gameplay, but can be annoying from time to time.\nSo overall, this game is simply pure love, 9/10 on my opinion.

And I say product because this doesn't necessarily qualify as a game. I was on the fence with this for a while because I wanted to expand my gaming genre horizons a little bit and decided that a visual novel would be a pretty big expansion. I downloaded the demo, tried to rush a little gameplay in before bed, and was surprised at the fact that there was none. I finally picked it back up on another day, when I could actually read without worrying about the time and actually got into the text. I was hooked instantly.\nI want to use the new Steam Review Feature, so I'll make a quick overview of the visual novel here.\n----------PROS\nNice Sy-fy setting\nUnique form of storytelling (I haven't seen it presented this way very much)\nPleasant art-style\nDeep subjects\nInteractivity\nMultiple endings\nKorean culture\n----------CONS\nLots of reading\nMinimalistic artwork\nShort Storylines\nKorean Culture\n\nI can't think of anything really bad about Analogue: A Hate Story, just know that it isn't a game. It's called a visual novel because there is a lot of reading. If you do not enjoy reading you probably would not enjoy A Hate Story. Another potential problem is that it has more \"mature\" topic matter. Nothing EXTREME, but it would most likely bore children since it has deeper subjects like ethnicity and sexuality. I haven't finished all the endings or found all the files yet, but so far I've only found 3 pages that might cause a problem. The worst in here is the word breast so far, and I don't think anything is going to get any worse.\nI don't like how each ending can be played in one sitting, but there are multiple endings so you could at least squeeze a few more playthroughs out of it.\n\nThe product features Korean, mostly only in the names. It won't be a problem though, because Analogue: A Hate Story goes as far as to give you a little cheat sheet so you know how to pronounce all those names. The downside is, the names are really confusing at first but that only helps make the story more submersive later on. If I remeber correctly, it's got full Korean support, so that's a plus too. If anyone is trying to learn Korean this is definitely something they should look into.\n\nThe interactivity is hard to explain. One thing over people seem to have problems with is visual novels with only the words and pictures and scenes. This isn't the case, and you'll need to do a lot of clicking and typing to complete stuff. (Keep in mind that that's all you do gameplay wise.)\n \nIt's got an anime/manga artstyle, but it's not intrusive and it shouldn't scare you away if that kind of stuff isn't your thing. There could have been better artstyles, but the manga one conveys the message well. It conveys the story better than a more realistic approach would for me, and it keeps in line with most visual novel styles that I know about.\n\nWhen I started it up and actually read everything, I wasn't expecting anything too good, but I kept reading and got interested in the plot. When the demo ended I bought the game instantly and kept playing. If you aren't sure about this product and haven't tried the demo, I highly recommend it.\n\nIt just blew me away personally, and it made me want more. I'm definitely going to try to read everything in this and the sequel. The best part is, it sparked my interest in the Koreas and Korean, and I'm wanting to try to learn more about it.\n\nWell, I'm tired and should be in bed as of the time of this review being written.

The main task of the player is to find out what happened with a derelict spaceship and its passengers. This job has been given to you by an organization that archives space colonization history. The ship was one of the first to leave Earth seeking other habitable worlds. Ships like these were meant for travels spanning generations, and when you arrive you soon find out that it has already been on a journey for several man ages. Fleeting in space for thousands of years, it shows no sign of life. You find out what took place by reading log entries stored in the ship's computer systems and by talking to the ships artificial intelligences. The visual style is manga inspired and there is very little animation \u2013 the mimicry of the characters is instead shown through still drawings. The drawings are nonetheless great.\n\nThe themes of the game are sexism and the relationship between humans and technology. The society that is described is extremely twofold. Through the ship logs you get an insight into three high ranking families' game of power. The men hold all political power, the women are instruments for giving birth and bringing up heirs and their coming courtesans and wives. Many of the logs are written by characters who have been raised under this social system, so they don't question morale or ethics, as otherwise would have been appropriate. But in between these entries you find some people questioning such a divide and react by trying to escape the required norm. One of these characters is called the Pale Bride. This is the person whom I related the most to. Her background is different from anyone else on the ship. This difference in background leads to some interesting confrontations with the rest of the passengers. I won't say much more about it, because that will ruin some of the story, but there is gripping and intricate character development at work here. My hat is off to Christine Love for fantastic writing. The Pale Bride story made me feel deep sympathy. Love raises questions about sex discrimination and freedom of speech, and gives the player opportunity to express their opinion.\n\nThe game stars two artificial intelligences (AI) that you can interact with. You interact by showing them the logs and by answering if they indicate they have something to say. The AIs are the only characters that are visually represented in the game. They often share their views on the people whom have written the logs, and I found their views affecting my own understanding and opinion about what took place. If they ask you a question, you will be given two choices. They will respond differently depending on what you answer. You can also influence the opinions of the AIs when your answer is given. All the log entries are not available from the start (you actually have to power on the ships batteries to get access to anything), and those you have access to are randomly spread across the history of the ship. By showing an AI an entry you may get access to more entries. This way you slowly start putting the pieces together. The jumps in time give the storytelling a distinctive touch. The names of the inhabitants is in Korean, and you are early on given access to a family tree that helps you sort out the names. That being said, the names of all the women are mostly incomplete, since the family name of a wife where the only name that were noted. Daughters were not included.\n\nAbout halfway into the game an incident occurs which sees the game deviate from its ordinary game mechanics. This brings a different kind of tension to the game, in the sense that time becomes a factor you have to take into account. The way you play through this short sequence is by typing commands into an old school 80's style monitor. That's all fine, but then there's the problem that this monitor doesn't display that many lines of text. And when you type a command to display all the commands at your disposal, that alone takes up half the screen. Next, you try some commands to find out what they do, and you find out that they are not relevant to what you're trying to accomplish. Now, the command index might have scrolled out of view, so then you need to type in the command to display the list again. This could have been avoided with the use of a simple list displayed separately from the monitor. As mentioned earlier, this is a brief part of the game. One that doesn't keep it from becoming a great one. The sequence has its pluses, the factor of time keeping you on your toes and the sudden realization that you are indeed on board a dying starship. Oh, and the last part of the sequence is a fantastic twist that I didn't see coming at all.\n\nAfter you have been introduced to the two AIs, you find out that they also have an opinion of each other, and they offer different views on the inhabitants of the ship. This is where the good stuff starts. With two AIs saying different things and asking for your trust, you have to make up your own mind based on the happenings described in the log entries and each of the AIs comments to them. The game boasts multiple endings, but personally I've only seen one. On a second playthrough, if taking other choices throughout the game, I might have been told a different version of what happened. But this is only guesses. It still adds to the replay value. \n\nEven though your original goal is to figure out the fate the ship and its inhabitants only to file a report to your employer, the player focus is shifted to the victims of this oppressing regime. Through brilliant writing and surprisingly human AIs reactions to what you read, this tragedy feels more and more personal. After a while is doesn't feel like a mission (as described in the company paper), instead you feel a need to have a final say in the events.\n\nThe portrayal of AI in this game is thought provoking and flirts with the roles and positions that AIs may inhabit or even fill in the future. It poses a question as to how we see artificial intelligence and what separates this form and the organic form. I found myself from the start naturally skeptical as to why the AIs wanted my trust. What value does it have for them? They are merely an extension of the ships machines \u2013 are they not? What value can be found in a button press?\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1385507095, "timestamp_updated": 1385507095, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512195", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7767708": {"recommendationid": "7767708", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986122446", "num_games_owned": 1171, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1377420318}, "language": "english", "review": "Rather interesting experience.

Basically, you play the part of an 'investigator' who have radio contact with a ship which was basically lost for thousands of years and suddenly reappeared.

You get to learn of the what, how and why things happened as they did.\n\nThere's different endings - five to be exact, each giving you an achievement which is kinda nice. Not like you really need much excuse to play and get all the endings. Truth to be told, the first time you get one ending, the story you get feels abridged. There's plenty of loose ends but another play-through with different choices nets you more unveiling of the story.

It's also a bit more accesible than Analogue: A Hate Story, so in general it's a good place to start to see if you even like Love's style before spending money on a more involved and intense story.\n\nNow, when I say Digital has a interesting execution, that isn't to say Analogue doesn't. It is similar in many ways, but it's different - which is good, really. The interface of both games fits the story and setting. Analogue does feel more like a visual novel, though. But probably because it's longer and there is quite a bit more reading. However, it's a complex story, and told in a way that is engaging. It also manages to deal with many serious themes. Patriatrcy, sexism, sexuality -- to name a few.\n\nSo, try Digital: A Love Story and if you like it, then chances this is a game for you (mind you, this is... well it is called \"A Hate Story\"). Or, just buy this first and find out and then go back to Digital! And forward to Hate Plus (which I haven't played yet.

You do this with your sidekick AI partner *Hyun-ae.\n\nI cannot comment on the story for fear of spoilers, as this game is very story-centric indeed. However, I will say this - I found it to be a strong, solid tale of a retrogade society diving into its demise. It has a good couple of side stories as well, but the main arc is where all the meat is at. You also have a second AI partner who you encounter (or not) after a certain point.\n\nOverall, I feel that Analogue manages to vary the visual novel platform enough to attract people that would otherwise not liken the visual novel structure.

Dispatch Control sends their secret black ops team to do their dirty work, the Mugunghwa security team, led by *Hyun-ae. Following Dispatch Control's orders and assassinating those whom they believe are criminals, Mugunghwa security kill a man known as Emperor Ryu, but soon discover he was a civilian reporter, documenting civilian deaths caused by Mugunghwa security. *Hyun-ae and his team realize they have been duped by Dispatch Control and desert, becoming space pirates on the run from Dispatch Control's forces.\nTen years later, *Hyun-ae drunkenly attacks Dispatch Control's battlecruiser, the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, while near the ship of Mugunghwa. *Hyun-ae rams the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, hoping to gain revenge on Dispatch Control. The ships collide, forcing both to crash land on the hull of Mugunghwa. One of *Hyun-ae's men, *Mute, is critically wounded in the crash and *Hyun-ae is forced to find an energy cell to drive the ship's medical equipment. On the ship, a former popular tropical-like resort destination, the population has mutated into feral tribes and carnivorous plants. *Hyun-ae fights through to one of the salvage ship from the beginning of the game's escape pods, and retrieves the escape pod's energy cell, as well as an \"instinct leash.\" The leash, when worn, begins to provide him strange tactile information, such as points for each enemy he kills.\n*Hyun-ae returns with the cell, and while *Mute is under operation, the mutants attack their ship, leaving *Mute a disfigured cyborg. *Hyun-ae and *Mute, the only survivors, decide to work together to get off the ship, despite *Mute's disapproval of *Hyun-ae's thirst for revenge. The instinct leash leads *Hyun-ae to another escape pod, where they find a UNIX command-line terminal, a salvage ship from the beginning of the game security soldier who agrees to work with *Hyun-ae and *Mute, but only after they rescue Dispatch Control. As they battle through the ravaged city, a UNIX command-line terminal explains that Mugunghwa has been used by salvage ship from the beginning of the game security as a sort of training grounds, with the instinct leashes the soldiers wear as a means of ranking those within the test; those that scored kills would be the only ones that could get ammunition and other supplies to survive. When *Hyun-ae learns that a UNIX command-line terminal was Emperor Ryu's daughter, he tells her that Dispatch Control was responsible for her father's death, but claims he does not know who actually killed him.\nThe three make their way to the top of a skyscraper where Dispatch Control's pod landed. a UNIX command-line terminal accuses Dispatch Control of her father's death, but he simply pushes her off the side of the building. Dispatch Control then warns *Hyun-ae and *Mute that there is an armed \"DNA bomb\" on the salvage ship from the beginning of the game that will wipe out all life on the ship, and they must go and disarm it, as his rescue ship will not arrive in time. As they travel underground, Dispatch Control explains that prison convicts were used as the labor force to maintain the ship; they rebelled when toxic byproducts, created by the ship's solar radiation shields, were dumped in the underground prison. The convicts destroyed the shields, exposing the entire population to mutating radiation.\nAboard the salvage ship from the beginning of the game, Dispatch Control tricks *Hyun-ae and *Mute into arming what was actually an inert bomb, and leaves them to die. As fire breaks out aboard the fallen ship, the two are saved by a UNIX command-line terminal, who survived the fall by catching a power line on her way down.\n", "timestamp_created": 1373687767, "timestamp_updated": 1373687767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "397920": {"recommendationid": "397920", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970351352", "num_games_owned": 568, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 294, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1377831859}, "language": "english", "review": "real talk this game is awesome", "timestamp_created": 1373685899, "timestamp_updated": 1373685899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "670843": {"recommendationid": "670843", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974959026", "num_games_owned": 707, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1373369258}, "language": "english", "review": "Data forensics!

You don't jump, shoot or hit things with a crowbar. All you do is point, click and read. If you find that frustrating, then this definitely isn't for you.\n\nAnalogue can be deemed as a horror story but it doesn't deal with blood, monsters or zombies. It takes themes like biogtry and misogyny and really digs deep into those themes to showcase the disasterous effect it has on a society. What's interesting is that the story based upon old Korean society. However, the story is not always intense. There are some comedic moments and such. The story is an engrossing one and really pulls you in once you get into it. It's short but that's okay since I feel this is a game you can enjoy on a saturday afternoon.

There are cute anime chicks involved, as well as the ability to choose chat options with them in between reading.  \n\nIn this story, you are a solo space traveler on an apparent contract job. (No you don't get to fly the ship.) Your job is to find out what happened to an old asian colony ship. With the help of the old ships AI(s), you have to dig up as much information on what happened to the crew through reading logs and eventually download the information for your client. While reading logs, the AI will ask you about what you read, or make a statement about the character(s) or problems involved with the entry, allowing you to get a bit more insight as to what happened. This gives a unique environment where you feel as if you are reading along side an AI, and can at times really get into the story.\n\nIt does not take long to get through the game, but expect a ton of reading. Purely a virtual novel at heart, but with a 'choose your own story' ending, thus creating a much more interactive environment than other VNs like the Sakura Paradise game (Where you really have no control over the game besides watch and hit next).\n\nThis story has a very large dose of maltreatment of the sexes... specificly the fairer sex, and points towards cultures that used to, and still do, treat them very poorly. The game is rather obvious fairly quickly in showing their agenda to create a sense of oppression which may be quite real in the world, may still be unwelcome to some players. So you have been warned if that is of little or no interest to you.\n\nAfter the game is done, there is little replay value besides getting the achievements, all the endings, and/or all the entries, yet the game does give you a feeling of completion and does not leave you 'in the dark' about anything, aside for what happens to your character and the AI after the game ends... but that is what the sequel is for.\n\nHope this review helped some of you make a decision on this game~", "timestamp_created": 1355315862, "timestamp_updated": 1441342497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534884", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2111963": {"recommendationid": "2111963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002483440", "num_games_owned": 747, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434178378}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc74c.\uc544\uc9c1 \uc624\ub798\ud558\uc9c4 \uc54a\uc558\ub294\ub370 \uc74c\uc545\ub3c4 \uad1c\ucc2e\uace0 \uc5ec\ud2bc \ud55c\ubc88\ucbe4\uc740 \ud574\ubcfc\ub9cc\ud55c \uc791\ud488", "timestamp_created": 1355047691, "timestamp_updated": 1355047691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1137587": {"recommendationid": "1137587", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987572242", "num_games_owned": 833, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 548, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395472557}, "language": "english", "review": "It's heavy on story while light on gameplay, but if you're okay with that, it's great.

It is not one where you pit your -supposed- skills against computer- or human-controlled opponents. It offers a fairly refreshing twist to the way stories are normally told.\n\nFirst off, let me say upfront that if action is all that matters to you (and/or you're not a fan of visual novels), don't even bother looking at this game - you're entirely incompatible with it and simply won't think much of it, so save yourself time and don't bother with the demo (or reading the rest of this review). In fact, the screenshots on the game's page are all you will ever see in the game, the rest is up to your imagination. You won't see the [i]Mugunghwa[/i] or its interior, nor your own ship's. There is no voice acting, and all you will ever interact with are two AI individuals, and an override terminal through which you can switch between the two and perform some other tasks.\n\nHowever, if you are willing to look beyond that, the storyline is actually pretty interesting. It's really hard to explain it without spoiling anything, and I think the description on the game's page does a fairly good job of explaining the context. I recommend giving the demo a go, it's well worth your time if you're willing to look deeper than the seemingly simple first impression - I was already captivated by the storyline in the demo, and so much so that it successfully persuaded me to get the full game.\n\nUnfortunately, if you're still unfamiliar with the names, the questions the AI occasionally asks of your opinion will sometimes catch you off guard as you struggle to recall who they're talking about, and the inability to refer to the family tree at that juncture only serves to compound the problem.\n\nAt some point in the game, the override terminal will temporarily become an integral part of [i]your[/i] story, so don't forget how to use it (although it should be easy to figure out how). It would be nice if it supported tabbed commands (i.e. pressing tab to autocomplete partially entered commands) and command history (i.e. using the up and down cursor keys to speed up entry of repeated commands) just like its real life counterparts, since at the abovementioned point in the game, you'll find yourself typing largely the same commands over and over.\n\nAll in all, a piece well worthy of your time.", "timestamp_created": 1335836845, "timestamp_updated": 1388336228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3059796": {"recommendationid": "3059796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016748899", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1524, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400368112}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best $9.99 I've spent in a while.

Renpy ist eine frei verf\u00fcgbare und kostenlos nutzbare Entiwcklungsumgebung speziell f\u00fcr VNs, welche es vor allem Anf\u00e4nger leicht macht, in die Materie der VN-Entwicklung einzusteigen. So ist es kein Wunder, dass es Unmengen an Erstlingswerken von Hinz und Kunz auf dem Markt gibt, von denen der Gro\u00dfteil eher nicht so gut ist.\n\nDie Frage, die sich hier stellt, ist nun lediglich, ob dieses Spiel es wert ist, dass man daf\u00fcr Geld und Zeit darin investiert.\n\nDas Setting ist durchaus interessant: Man spielt eine Art externen Mitarbeiter oder Dienstleister, der f\u00fcr eine gewisse \"historical society from the outer colonies\" ein im Weltall gestrandetes uraltes Raumschiff untersuchen muss. Die Spielfigur betritt deshalb das Raumschiff und klinkt sich in die Boardsysteme ein, wo sie sich entweder mit einer von zwei k\u00fcnstlichen Intelligenzen unterhalten muss, oder in einer Befehlszeilenkonsole Konsolenbefehle eingibt. Mithilfe von Logdateien, die der Spieler nach und nach im Bordcomputer findet, muss er das Geheimnis und die Vergangenheit des Raumschiffs rekonstruieren.\n\nWas sich auf dem Papier durchaus spannend anh\u00f6rt, erweist sich in der Praxis als ein bisschen anstrengend. Die minimalistische Oberfl\u00e4che und die Befehlszeilenkonsole wirken einerseits immersiv, was gut ist, andererseits aber auch etwas eint\u00f6nig. Der Spieler f\u00fchlt sich zwar wie ein Ermittler vor einem Computerbildschirm und muss auch ab und an Befehlszeilenkommandos in ein schwarzes Konsolenfenster eintippen, doch gerade das und die wenig abwechslungsreiche grafische Darstellung der KIs lassen das Spiel optisch recht schnell langweilig werden.\nDie Recherchearbeit an sich ist okay, doch muss man oft Logdateien mehrmals \u00f6ffnen, um zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, ob man bereits die KI dazu befragt hat. Hier k\u00f6nnte man das Spiel nutzerfreundlicher gestalten.\nDas Wichtigste ist jedoch die Geschichte, denn wegen dieser interessieren wir uns \u00fcberhaupt f\u00fcr das Spiel und es l\u00e4sst sich hierbei kurz und knapp sagen: Ja, sie lohnt sich.\n\nZusammenfassend kann man also nur sagen, dass sich das Spiel durchaus lohnt und mit einer Laufzeit von etwa f\u00fcnf Stunden auch zu schaffen ist. Die Geschichte ist recht traurig, aber interessant und in etwa auf dem Niveau eines Jugendromans. Die koreanische Sci-Fi-Umgebung ist hierbei grunds\u00e4tzlich eine angenehme Abwechslung, im Gegensatz zum typischen japanischen Schulleben oder dem europ\u00e4ischen oder japanischen Fantasy-Mittelalter. Grafisch hat das Spiel wenig Abwechslung zu bieten, was aber auch gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils durch die Spielmechanik bedingt ist, welche wiederum sehr interessant ist.\n\nPreislich halte ich das Spiel mit 10 EUR bei etwa f\u00fcnf Stunden Laufzeit f\u00fcr zu teuer. Ich empfehle, auf einen Sale zu warten und es f\u00fcr nicht mehr als 5 EUR zu kaufen.\n\nWer auf \u00e4hnliche Spiele steht, kann sich das einige Jahre danach erschienene Spiel Her Story anschauen, welches statt Logs auf realverfilmte Videosequenzen (Interviews) setzt und auch mit einem angemesseneren Preis (etwa 6 EUR) daherkommt.", "timestamp_created": 1520277414, "timestamp_updated":

Una sociedad, en la que de un momento a otro a las mujeres se les proh\u00edbe aprender a leer o a escribir. Toda la informaci\u00f3n anterior a esta etapa ha desaparecido por completo de la nave, as\u00ed que solo nos queda investigar los eventos que llevaron a esta sociedad \"feudal\" al colapso completo.\n\nEn cuanto a las ilustraciones, cumplen sin m\u00e1s.

I personally love the art style. Many games have tried the whole you're a person playing the game, think Assasain's Creed, but Analogue is a prime example of a game that really nails it. I loved getting the whole story over several plays, it was very interesting to see how biased each viewpoint was, only reading or listening to one persons perspective would leave you with a flawed idea of the reality of the situation, which really adds to the realism of the situation. I'm not a fan of games that give you mind-numbingly vast amounts of notes or computer entries filled with clunky exposition and boring history, I feel that is best intuited by the player. But, I was pleasantly surprised to see that even though the game is built upon the premise of reading computer entries, it isn't a chore to read each one, I would get excited whenever I obtained a new one. Seriously, if you like story-based games you MUST get this, I still think about it even though it has been months and months since I played it.", "timestamp_created": 1519011495, "timestamp_updated": 1519011495, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40024601": {"recommendationid": "40024601", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075061111", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518441518}, "language": "english", "review": "12.2.2018. Game #14\n\nONLY IF IT\u2019S ON SALE\n\nI apologize for starting my review like this but it has to be said before anything else. I was about to give this game a recommendation without a second thought, until I looked at the price. I got this game as part of humble bundle and it was a joy to play (read) through it, but 10 euros alone for a game that\u2019s basically a short story is not worth it. I have read kindle books that were 5 times longer than this one and that cost 3 times less. So again, it\u2019s worth it, but only if it\u2019s on sale. \n\nAnalogue: A Hate Story isn\u2019t so much a visual novel as it is a book with scattered pages. The gameplay consists of a lot of reading and unlocking more pages as you progress through reading. Basically\u2026 it\u2019s like reading a short story. I really wouldn\u2019t call it a visual novel as visual novels usually have a lot more than this game.\n\nThis game consists of a lot of diary logs and letters (most of which you will have to unlock), a command terminal and 2 characters. It\u2019s not a lot even for a visual novel, however, it\u2019s entertaining enough that I can recommend it.\n\nWithout spoiling too much, the story is about you (a space explorer/salvager) who gets a job to board an old abandoned spaceship that used to be a home to a colony of people eons ago. All the people died a long time ago but some computers are still running and it\u2019s your job to salvage whatever\u2019s left on it. So you board the ship, turn on the computer and meet an AI. In the beginning there are only a few pages and you can\u2019t even salvage them since you are missing the administrator password. So what do you do? Well, you can read through the pages you have and piece together what happened. This is where the AI comes into play. The AI is a cute girl named *Hyun-ae who is willing to help you with your mission, provided you pay attention to the story.\n\nAs you read through the available pages, you can talk to *Hyun-ae and ask her about her opinion of the matter. This way she uses her abilities to dig out more journal entries and help you figure out what exactly happened on the ship you are on. You can finish the game as soon as you figure out what the administrator password is but, if you are like me, you will want to see everything until the end and get some closure before you are satisfied.\n\nThe story you read through the diary focuses mostly on the events between very rich families. In the beginning, it\u2019s very boring. You read about the daily lives of these two families who are trying to make it big in the world (colony) by using arrange marriages and political power. It becomes very clear that, despite this being the future, everyone lives like they are in the dark ages. The most overused clich\u00e9 about the dark ages is the treatment of women as objects. Somehow, despite it being the future, women have lost all credibility and are just treated as baby makers, cooks, and housewives. So, again, the story starts in a very boring tone. You read about one family, a little bit about the other family and how they are struggling to get heirs and how having daughters is a great dishonor but then everything changes when one character gets introduced: The Pale Bride. Unlike everyone else who was on board the ship, the pale bride is actually from a modern time where women were treated with the respect and by reading her diary entries you finally start to make sense of what is going on. If you are keen on finding out what exactly transpired in on the ship, you are in for a story filled with arranged marriages, politics, sex, lust and a lot of other dark elements. If you reach the end of the game, you will realize why it\u2019s called \u201cA Hate Story\u201d.\n\nJust to make one thing clear: if you don\u2019t like reading and don\u2019t want to read, this is not a game for you. In fact, it barely feels like a game. It feels more like a reading class where after every few pages, you discuss what you\u2019ve read with the class only to get more reading. Does this make the game fun? NO. However, does the game have an entertaining story to tell? ABSOLUTELY YES.\n\nDespite the insane price of 10 euros for a rather short story that you can read through in a few hours, I can\u2019t NOT recommend this game. It\u2019s a lot of fun piecing together what happened and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  In short, this is a great story.\n\nIf you are in a mood for a good story where you get to make some very light decisions and maybe get a few different ending, WAIT FOR A SALE, and get this game. For 10 euros, it\u2019s not worth it, but for maybe 5, it\u2019s definitely worth a buy.\n\nNext game: Angry Video Game Nerd Adventures", "timestamp_created": 1518443277, "timestamp_updated": 1518785748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40018442": {"recommendationid": "40018442", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062188469", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443747598}, "language": "english", "review": "This VN was the only reason I knew Korea wasnt just a shitty Chinese Knock off of Japan before I got there.", "timestamp_created": 1518414440, "timestamp_updated": 1518414440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462329", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39881185": {"recommendationid": "39881185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178407138", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517894354}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub09c \ucef4\ud4e8\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud558\ub098\ub3c4 \ubaa8\ub974\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb54\uac00 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\uba38\uac00 \ub41c\uac70\uac19\uc774 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5b4\uc8fc\ub294 \uac8c\uc784", "timestamp_created": 1517894415, "timestamp_updated": 1517894415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39852231": {"recommendationid": "39852231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019399866", "num_games_owned": 735, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422569642}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0432\u043e\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043b\u043b\u0430, \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043e \u0434\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0443\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c\u0435. \u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0443 \u0446\u0435\u043d\u044b.", "timestamp_created": 1517776111, "timestamp_updated": 1517838906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39759800": {"recommendationid": "39759800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198808094528", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517455438}, "language": "english", "review": "What.

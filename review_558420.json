The best parts, gameplay wise, come in the form of sections emulating the old Commodore 64 text adventure games, and although these can be slightly frustrating initially, when you know what to do but not how to phrase it, I'm willing to at least let that part slide as a faithful recreation of the frustration found in those old games.\n\nSo, now that I've got all my complaints out of the way, why do I recommend Stories Untold? Mainly because it has a great atmosphere and is a genuinely immersive and intriguing little game; evoking the same feeling as old Twilight Zone or Tales of the Unexpected episodes. Are the (untold) stories particularly amazing or original? Not really, but nor were they in the episodes of those old shows; what sold them was their atmosphere and suspense, and the same is mostly true for Stories Untold.\n\nThe big downside, in this regard, is that the game peaks way too early, with the first chapter of the available four being the strongest by a country mile. The game keeps a relatively good pace afterward, but never manages to recapture the heights of tension and intrigue the first chapter sets up, leaving you with an overall experience that's fairly satisfying but probably nothing that will stick with you for too longer after.\n\nIn closing, for two hours of mildly spooky entertainment I'd say it's a little bit overpriced, (\u00a35 for the full package would be nearer the mark imo) but if you're not put off by the lack of gameplay and are a fan creepypastas or stuff like that, you'll probably get your moneysworth out of Stories Untold.", "timestamp_created": 1521566830, "timestamp_updated": 1521566830, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40910223": {"recommendationid": "40910223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086995968", "num_games_owned": 1005, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 134, "last_played": 1521416864}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow!!

The short version is that the game is good, some of the puzzles are really hard/obtuse, some episodes are way better than others, and the ending completely changes the meaning of everything else you've seen in the game so if you hate twist endings without any creativity that were old after they were used the very first time hundreds of years ago, you might find this disappointing, but individual episodes of the game are better than others, and I can recommend the game on the merit of those segments alone.  That said I have a lot I wanted to say about this and I'd really like to just vent about this for a while, so here goes.  I do recommend this game simply on the fact that I enjoyed it until its very last episode.\n\n[h1] There will be spoilers in this review but they will be marked.[/h1]\n\nSee, I don't want to recommend this game because the fourth episode and the ending kind of pulls the rug out from under the rest of it.  And I don't know if that's enough to ruin a game just for one, albeit major, aspect of it.  You can easily enjoy the other parts of the game on their own.  And I did.  I honestly see myself replaying [i]The House Abandon[/i] at some point since that was honestly the most effective, straightforward part.\n\nThe puzzles were interesting and immersive - for instance, you're playing a text-based adventure game but it's not just a black-and-white screen, you're in an 80s' bedroom with a computer using a tape hooked up to a screen - your playing a game where your character's playing a game [spoiler] where your character's playing a game.[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]The House Abandon[/h1]\n\nEnding aside, it's unfortunate that [i]The House Abandon[/i] is the strongest part of the game since it's the first segment.  It's the most straightforward.  Almost everyone's played or seen a text-based adventure game, or at least heard of one, right?  You know immediately how it's going to work and it's just intuitive. If you know how Zork works you'll have a decent idea of how things work in here.  The twist of the episode is interesting, [spoiler] where the fourth wall starts to break and you control elements of the 'real world' from within the 'game.'[/spoiler] I would give this segment an 8/10.  It gets its idea across, and there are a lot of fun little background details that really set the tone for 'being up late in the 80's playin' a text game.'\n\n[h1]The Lab Conduct[/h1]\n\nI really liked The Lab Conduct, but it's less straightforward of a concept than playing a text based game.  It has it's own feel to it, for certain, and playing as a 'volunteer' for a shady, dangerous lab experiment is an interesting concept for a puzzle game, especially once the nature of the experiment is revealed and things turn up to 11 (or at least a solid 10).  Using the old text-based adventure game interface again is a let down, since we just saw it executed in the horror genre so well in [i]THA[/i], but again once the twist sets in, things change immensely, [spoiler] and you go from using an adventure-game-style text parser to process an alien organism's memories, to using that same input to guide it in real-time.[/spoiler]  6/10, solid idea, slightly wonky execution.\n\n\nHonestly, given I'm limited to Steam's binary yes/no review system, I can recommend the game based on these two chapters alone.  [i]TLC[/i] isn't as impressive as [i]THA[/i] but it gets its point across, albeit not as directly.\n\n[h1]The Station Process[/h1]\n\n[i]The Station Process[/i] is... an interesting concept.  It may be a bit flawed in it's execution, but running a numbers station in arctic temperatures while a storm rages outside and things start happening... It's a classic horror setting out of [i]The Thing/Who Goes There?[/i], or [i]The Shining.[/i]  The puzzles here sway a bit from the complex to the hopeless [spoiler](hope you like morse code!)[/spoiler], to a complete genre shift in it's last act.  Incidentally, while this story continues the implied overarching theme of 'aliens/hive mind invasions,' it's also where the real overarching plot starts to come through, in a way that's more obvious than in previous episodes, but like every episode so far it can also stand on it's own, though the obtuse puzzles seem to bring it down.  Notably, the microfilm is somewhat hard to read at times, making it a bit of a guess at times what letter it is you're supposed to enter.  I'd have to give this a 5/10.  \n\nBefore I completely get into ending spoiler territory, let me put it like this: the game's ending feels like a cheap twist you'd see in a bad fan theory or mid-2000s psychological thriller.  Any world building you thought was going on, any investment you have in these settings or stories, they don't matter. They're window trappings for a brain-dead simple morality tale.  This is the game's major flaw.\n\n[h1]Ending spoilers begin here and continue for the rest of the review![/h1]\n\n[h1]The Last Session[/h1]\n\nWhere it all falls apart - while the rest of the game is suggestive of some sci-fi/horror theme of alien invasions - is episode 4 - [i]The Last Session[/i].  Gameplay-wise, it serves as a sort of 'best of' of all of the previous story's puzzles, each one having a new twist for the ending.  For instance, we return to the setting and mechanics of the first episode but with a major twist/spin on it, telling a completely different story.  You're essentially quizzed on how well you could do in each previous section of the game with some minor exploration in-between.  And honestly, this is fine.  Throwbacks to old gameplay segments are a favorite of mine - the Robot Master rushes at the end of the MegaMan games, for instance.  \n\nThe story, however...All the buildup in the plot, with aliens and invasions and the implication that the world being overrun - is dropped for one of the most amateur plot twists in the book. In fact, the book probably has this twist in the chapter on \"Twists You Shouldn't Use Anymore.\" Pointedly, [spoiler] it turns out that the past three episodes of the game were all a part of the main character's 80s pulp-horror anthology TV-series inspired crazy coma dream as his damaged brain tries to come to terms with the horrible thing he did: driving drunk, causing a fatal accident for his sister and a stranger, both of whom he chose not to save in exchange for trying to hide his liquor on the other drive to avoid blame.  That's it, the big twist is that the whole game is a cautionary tale about drunk driving - not to belittle anyone who's been affected by it's horrors (my grandfather got hit by a drunk driver in the 90s and he still hasn't been the same), but I expected more from a game with such a neat sci-fi/horror buildup. [/spoiler] In hindsight, it doesn't totally come out of nowhere, looking back there are some clues, but it also doesn't have a lot to do with what's going on in the individual episodes at face value, either.  \n\nAll-in-all, I'd have to give [i]The Last Session[/i] a 3/10.  The gameplay throwbacks are nice, but some of the logic leaps are insane, and the gameworld destroying plot twist overshadows what is otherwise an enjoyable game.  The presentation remains great the whole way through, maintaining the feeling of it's 80's setting in music, visuals, and sounds.  It's not bad to look at, it's standard unity graphics I feel, and it captures the feeling it's trying to portray well.\n\nThe ending is a huge letdown and I'm honestly up in the air rather or not I recommend this game. Is it fair to dislike something based on one element of it that isn't revealed until the very end of the experience? I don't have a satisfactory answer for that, and up until the game revealed its twist, I enjoyed it.

How hard would it have been to just give the player a few options to choose from rather than leaving it seemingly open ended when it is, in fact, not at all open ended. After giving up on that I was forced to search for a guide online. Let me just say this, if your game is so vague and designed so poorly that only 10 minutes in you need to search for a guide, it is seriously flawed.

Sounds like my cup of tea, especially considering how much I enjoyed Lakeview Cabin Collection. I was excited to play this after seeing all its accolades and overall positive response, but I have to say I was disappointed with the end product.\n\nThere are four \"episodes\" in this \"anthology\" of point and click adventure games. Each one ties into an over arching narrative involving the main character. The problem is that the best one is the first, the House Abandon. It's moddy as hell, very creepy, and very effective. Although the scrolling text is FAR TOO SLOW. It can't be emphasized enough exactly how slow and eventually tedious the text scrolling becomes. There is for some reason no option to speed it up. Major, MAJOR oversight. I know they were emulating old school text based adventure games, but I could have done without the slow text. And this is a common problem, not exclusive to me since I played on a laptop that was not equipped to handle this game (severe input lag, low frame rate- thank God this is primarily a click based game but I'm not counting that as a point against the game since I am not well informed on computer specs). The mood of The House Abandon was effective enough that I pushed through to the end despite the slow text.\n\nI thought this would be horror themed, but it's really not. The middle two chapters are very much sci- fi themed, and the concluding one is a culmination of all the episodes. The middle two are okay and kind of intriguing, but it's the ending that made the game unravel for me.\n\nI won't get into specifics, but I am going to discuss the general plot of the game a bit, so be warned about spoilers ahead.\n\n[SPOILER] As I mentioned, the final chapter completely undoes the intrigue brought about by the preceeding chapters. It was a major let down. \n\nThe problem is that, in hind sight, there was no intrigue. With the way The House Abandon ended, I guessed what was going on with the protagonist, and I was right. I was confused by the science fiction chapters in the middle. But the final chapter gives the player a hackneyed, easy, and quite frankly stupid twist that left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This is in the very beginning of the chapter, but then the game continues on for far too long detailing the story's inciting incident. It renders the previous chapters utterly pointless, and also ends with, well, a non ending. Nothing is really resolved. It just ends. I'm not sure if the developers thought they were being clever with their twist, but like I said, I very easilypredicted what happened after finishing the first chapter. I was left at the end thinking \"so what?\" [/SPOILER]\n\nI love the concept of this. A point and click adventure game that uses different types of puzzles in each chapter (basically levels) to convey its narrative. And honestly, I wouldn't be averse to playing a sequel. But the only way I will play it is if the story is more interesting and/ or unique. As it is, it's incredibly disappointing given how good The House Abandon episode is.

La manera de interactuar y desarrollar la historia es a trav\u00e9s de m\u00e1quinas propias de la \u00e9poca. \n\nEs dif\u00edcil definir bien como funciona su jugabilidad, y creo que parte de lo llamativo de esta obra es saber poco o nada respecto a la historia y tambi\u00e9n a las mec\u00e1nicas antes de comenzar a jugar. Y precisamente, este \u00faltimo apartado es lo que a muchos les gustar\u00e1 y sorprender\u00e1, y a otros tantos aburrir\u00e1, pues a veces es complicado encontrar la manera de avanzar, y si no tienes demasiado paciencia y no te gusta la manera de interactuar con el juego, al final acabar\u00e1s dejandolo muy pronto. Sin embargo, si decides dejarte llevar, una de las cosas m\u00e1s sorprendentes es como cambia la manera de interactuar con los aparatos a trav\u00e9s de las 4 diferentes historias, y que la jugabilidad est\u00e1 directamente relacionada con la historia. Es genial terminar una historia, y ver que en la siguiente, a pesar de sus limitaciones, la manera de interactuar es bastante diferente al cap\u00edtulo anterior. Eso, sumado a que las historias est\u00e1n bastante bien, y que la historia final concluye todo de una manera muy interesante, Stories Untold se convierte en un juego muy redondo y bastante original. \n\nDe todas maneras, en este aspecto no es perfecto, ya que aunque la jugabilidad es bastante cambiante a lo largo de todo el titulo, hubiera sido interesante profundizar aun m\u00e1s en ese aspecto. S\u00ed, cada historia encuentra un tema diferente que tratar, y logra generar mec\u00e1nicas diferentes que concuerden con esa historia, pero aunque al principio sea un cambio sorpresivo, a la larga se acaba haciendo algo repetitivo. Tambi\u00e9n, una pega grande que le veo es que el juego est\u00e1 totalmente en ingles, voces y subtitulos. Si no tienes un nivel medio al menos, va a ser complicado jugar, ya que gran parte se basa no tan solo en entender textos en ingles, sino escribirlos. A veces se hace complejo entender algunos textos, y otras veces lleva tiempo escribir la palabra o frase concreta para avanzar.\n\nGraficamente es bueno, sobre todo en cuanto a los modelados muy bien recreados, texturas e iluminaci\u00f3n y efectos de luz. Por supuesto, tiene buena m\u00fasica ochentera minimalista y progresiva generada a base de sintetizadores y sonidos tipicos de la epoca, y un buen doblaje en ingl\u00e9s.\n\nTerminando, recomiendo mucho este juego, por apenas 1 euro se puede conseguir y por ese precio, es casi obligatorio comprar y experimentar Stories Untold, no te dejar\u00e1 indiferente.", "timestamp_created": 1517964350, "timestamp_updated": 1517964858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617834", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39893664": {"recommendationid": "39893664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022423272", "num_games_owned": 1196, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517943469}, "language": "english", "review": "20 minutes in and already feeling extremely uneasy and constantly look over my shoulder ... how can i not recommend this? :)", "timestamp_created": 1517943509, "timestamp_updated": 1517943509, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39851164": {"recommendationid": "39851164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168060710", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514175125}, "language": "english", "review": "i really enjoyed the game.while the puzzel sometimes had me pissed it was a really good story that captivated me from the start", "timestamp_created": 1517773100, "timestamp_updated": 1517773100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39837053": {"recommendationid": "39837053", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965834417", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517993287}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game.

La respuesta te sorprender\u00e1.[/h1]\n\n\"Stories Untold\" es dif\u00edcil de definir en lo jugable, as\u00ed que empecemos por el envoltorio.\n\nSe trata de una antolog\u00eda de relatos de terror, divididos en cuatro episodios que nos llevar\u00e1n entre media hora y una hora cada uno (dependiendo de lo que nos entretengamos o atasquemos). Con un opening ochentero total que nos recordar\u00e1 a cierta serie de moda, cada episodio tendr\u00e1 un desarrollo diferente, con giros al m\u00e1s puro estilo \"The Twilight Zone\". Por ejemplo, en el primero seremos alguien que vuelve a casa y se pone a jugar a una aventura conversacional en su viejo ordenador, en el segundo seremos los voluntarios para llevar a cabo un experimento, etc. Realmente quiero desvelar lo m\u00ednimo del argumento.\n\nEsto para empezar ya me parece original, ya que no me suena que haya muchos juegos as\u00ed, narrados en forma de antolog\u00eda dividida en episodios, y este sin duda ha logrado que me entren ganas de m\u00e1s. A pesar de esta divisi\u00f3n en episodios, el juego mantiene en todo momento una identidad propia y coherencia que une al conjunto en una sola experiencia que no querremos dejar de lado. Y es que, de nuevo como si fuera una serie, cuando terminemos un episodio no querremos m\u00e1s que empezar el siguiente, para ver con qu\u00e9 nos sorprende.\n\nAhora vamos al apartado jugable que, como he dicho antes, es dif\u00edcil de definir.\n\nDe alg\u00fan modo me atrever\u00eda a decir que se trata de una aventura conversacional rodeada de una interfaz gr\u00e1fica, aunque no siempre es as\u00ed. Cada cap\u00edtulo del juego se basar\u00e1 en la resoluci\u00f3n de puzles o en seguir unos pasos concretos para seguir avanzando en la trama.\nSiempre en primera persona, y en la mayor\u00eda de los casos con una movilidad muy limitada, deberemos ir manipulando los objetos del entorno, as\u00ed como introduciendo \u00f3rdenes escritas en el terminal de turno, para ir logrando avanzar.\nEstas acciones deber\u00e1n hacerse de manera muy concreta, y en ocasiones acarrean cierta complejidad que me hacen pensar que quiz\u00e1 no est\u00e9 hecho para todo el mundo. Y es que, sobre todo en lo que a escribir en un terminal se refiere, es relativamente f\u00e1cil quedarse atascado por no estar haci\u00e9ndolo todo exactamente como debemos. En cualquier caso el juego ofrece pistas e instrucciones en todo momento por el escenario para que sepamos c\u00f3mo debemos hacer las cosas, mi consejo es que os fij\u00e9is muy bien en todo por si se os ha pasado algo.\nEl lado bueno de lo anterior es que cuando conseguimos avanzar resulta muy satisfactorio, y verdaderamente nos sentimos recompensados.\nAunque la recompensa sea adentrarnos un poquito m\u00e1s en la pesadilla que es cada episodio.\n\nNo puedo recomendarlo m\u00e1s. \"Stories Untold\" es un producto original y en cierto modo arriesgado, y a partir de ya quiero m\u00e1s antolog\u00edas como esta. \u00bfPara cu\u00e1ndo la segunda temporada?", "timestamp_created": 1516820220, "timestamp_updated": 1516820220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39568044": {"recommendationid": "39568044", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979693740", "num_games_owned": 2819, "num_reviews": 124, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516744529}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite not particularly enjoying the ending (I really wanted it to be something else), up until that point, Stories Untold was absolutely gripping and a fascinating romp if only to get to the bottom of whatever the hell was going on.  While I don't want to give anything away, rest assured the end of the game makes perfect sense in accordance to everything leading up to it.  It's just somewhat of a let-down for me.\n\nThat being said, Stories Untold is a gorgeous game that takes the age-old text adventure and flips it on its old, wrinkly head to do something truly unique and marvelous to behold.  It is presented in a similar fashion to the Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, for you younger folks, in that there are 4 distinct episodes in the game that are seemingly/mostly unrelated except for a certain atmosphere and/or feeling.  All of it is set in the 80s (because of course it is) and each piece of archaic technology is so lovingly rendered that there's no way the devs (or at least the art department) didn't live through that era when games came in books and you had to program them into your machine yourself.  Each episode usually features some sort of text parser and if you're familiar with old Infocom text adventures, you'll blow through this in probably 2 hours.  I spent another hour achievement hunting.\n\nUnfortunately, this also means that the same old issues with text parsers exist - limited vocabulary, very specific sentences or phrases that the game is looking for, etc.  However, it is highly unlikely you'll get stuck because of a syntax error - a little observation and you'll figure out what you need to do next.  At first, the game takes on a supernatural sort of feeling with the first episode, The House Abandon (play the demo to try it) in which you are plunked in front of an old tape-loaded computer, playing an ancient game.  As episodes continue, things get a little weirder, but for the most part, you are always grounded in one place, interacting with monitors and keyboards so don't expect any bullet dodging or running from monsters here.\n\nWhat Stories Untold does well is subtle, but it's what keeps you in your seat typing away.  Each episode is presented with very little information given to you in terms of the plot or narrative.  Instead, things just start and you're constantly left wondering just what the hell is going on.  There's this constant hope that looms overhead that maybe, just maybe, the game is going to reveal something to you.  It's that constant feeling of something just out of reach that makes the game such a fascinating journey.\n\nI honestly can't say a single bad word about it.  No bugs, no glitches.  The game does exactly what it sets out to do and does it with such a nostalgic attention to detail that it was very hard for me to put down.  I loved every moment of it... well, almost.  There's no reason for you not to try the demo, so go on and do that.  Despite my disappointment at the end of the game, Stories Untold is simply more than the sum of its parts and should not be missed.\n\nSo what was it about the ending I didn't like?  (I do not recommend reading this part unless you've already finished the game)\n[spoiler]The writing was fine and the narrative was fine.  There's no way you could rip the ending out of the game and replace it without completely replacing the previous episodes.  I understand that.  My disappointment didn't come from execution, but only expectation.  House Abandon is so mind-bogglingly awesome in the way that it ends that I spent the entire game hoping that there was a supernatural element to the whole game.  This is exacerbated by episode 3 and its Lovecraftian tentacles dropping from the sky.  To end with \"herp derp coma\" seemed like a huge cop-out to me, as it is almost any time a narrative relies on \"it was just a dream\" as its twist.  Given that the three previous episodes only have hints and nothing truly explicit, I was so hyped up for the last episode, but almost immediately when it started, I knew where it was headed and was like \"Oh god, no.\"  That's all.  So yeah, I don't know what else could have been done, but the format is awesome.  I just wish the game had gone in a different direction is all, but that's just me.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1516745914, "timestamp_updated": 1516943524, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556650", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39563546": {"recommendationid": "39563546", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063572395", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517339995}, "language": "english", "review": "What a blast!

The puzzles vary slightly between each episode; there are four episodes in total. Each episode has its own puzzles.\n\n[h1]Why I recommend it:[/h1]\n\nI wish I could mark this game as \"recommended only if you get it for less than $5.00\". If you can get this game as part of Humble Bundle or on a great sale, it's worth it. It's absolutely not worth the full $10.00 price. Is it worth getting and playing? Sure. Just not at the price they ask for.\n\nOverall the game is very \"Okay.\" Not great, not awful, just Meh. An interesting experience, especially for fans of horror games.\n\n[h1]The Good:[/h1][list]\n[*]Interesting take on text-based and point-and-click puzzles\n[*]A unique spin on Suspense / Horror stories\n[*]It's a very short game, which I think works well for the episodic puzzle nature of it\n[/list]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1266072089\n\n[h1]The Bad:[/h1][list]\n[*]The price - this game is about 2-3 hours long, at [i]most[/i], and I don't think it's such an amazing game that it deserves a $10.00 price tag\n[*]I have one major gripe about the game: the difficulty of the puzzles in the 3rd episode - I did not want to decipher Morse code while squinting at the guide on the tiny screen. I immediately went and found a Steam guide because I was so annoyed with the entire puzzle concept for the 3rd episode. I also had some difficulty with the 4th episode because [i]I didn't know what the game wanted from me[/i] with certain commands, or that I was supposed to [spoiler]magically know that I had whiskey in the car and I was supposed to plant it in the other car. How the hell was I supposed to know that I had the bottle with me?![/spoiler]\n[*] My opinion about the story and episodes:\n[spoiler]The episodes are all connected together in one overarching storyline told (loosely) over each episode. The fourth episode ties it all together. I was severely disappointed by this format because I was happier approaching the game as four standalone stories. I think it would have been a more interesting experience to have four separate short stories instead of one longer story introduced very well in the 1st episode, barely brushed on across the 2nd and 3rd episode, then slammed in your face in the 4th in a poorly-done and ham-fisted way. The story itself isn't particularly good.\n\n I saw another review that described it as devolving into PSA about drunk driving, and I have to agree the drunk driving story takes away from the eeriness and cool sci-fi concepts of the first three episodes. I liked the random one-off alien story of episode 2, and the idea that \"things\" are attacking the planet in episode 3 (did anyone else see the giant tree-looking thing on top of the station?). The first three episodes felt ruined by the 4th.

I bought this game due to \"Rely On Horror\" recommending it. I've never played a text based adventure game in my life. The first 3 episodes are great but the 4th ruins the game. Here's my quick review:\n\n\n[list]\n    [*]Episode 1 shows you the text-based ropes and sets a spooky tone. Some really clever interactivity here.\n    [*]Episode 2 is infiinitely more confusing to navigate than Episode 1 but it has a cool story. I had to look up how to do the first actions to progress the game but the complexity makes sense for the plot.\n    [*]Episode 3 has really complicated puzzles/text entry. I had to look a few things up because I'm absolutely awful at [spoiler]deciphering morse code[/spoiler]. The story and sense of dread are GREAT! This is by FAR the best episode.\n    [*]Episode 4 negates any fun you had in the previous 3 episodes. I can't tell you much without spoiling it but I wouldn't have even bothered playing it had I known the plot of Episode 4. A few commands were very unintuitive and I had to look up what text I needed to enter. Here's a spoiler summary if you're interested in why episode 4 ruins the game: [spoiler]Not a single horror/sci-fi thing happened in the game. It was all a guy watching horror/sci-fi shows on tv in a hospital while recovering from a drunk driving car accident which got his sister killed. The only thing left up for debate is if it was actually him drunk driving or if it was the cops framing him. Either way, turning a cool horror/sci-fi plot into a drunk driving PSA is really disappointing. I've seen countless bad horror movies try to do this same damn \"NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED/IT'S ALL IN THEIR HEAD\" plot twist and it's just as disappointing every time. Had I known it was going to be this awful story telling trope, I wouldn't have bothered wrestling with the horrors of text-based gameplay.[/spoiler]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1515392844, "timestamp_updated": 1515393807, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534683", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39172415": {"recommendationid": "39172415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100646217", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515385184}, "language": "english", "review": "Puzzle-solving makes up a large portion of the game, blend of adventure and text-adventure.

Plot-wise, this is absolutely one of the cleverest and most intruiging games I have ever played, second in ingenuity only perhaps to Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald. Gameplay-wise, it left a little to be desired; many of the actions players need to take are unituitive and their answers aren't always clearly hinted at. Some of the controls are additionally wonky; for example, there are multiple points in the game during which you have to \"turn\" a dial to get to high numbers by pressing and holding the mouse. This mechanic was reliably irritating, as it takes a wholly unecessary amount of time to reach most of the required numbers. What's worse is that during these scenes, a narrator is CONSTANTLY harassing you to hurry up -- this despite the fact that it is LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE to complete the task any more quickly. \n\nThat being said, I found the game EXTREMELY enjoyable; I would guess that most people, like myself, played Stories Untold in a single session, lasting less than 6 hours total (and that's if you REALLY take your sweet time).

Now I played text-only adventures back in the eighties and they were frustrating back then but surely nowadays a game should be able to handle slightly different ways of saying the same thing. These two issues combine so that if you don't guess the exact phrase required, you have to wait while the slowly scrolling text tells you that it doesn't understand the command.

The earliest examples of this genre of gaming didn't even have GRAPHICS, for cryin' out loud! They were no more than words...on a screen...which you interacted with by typing MORE words on the screen. Crazy, right? \n\n   But it's true: there was indeed a time in our darkest past where, if you wanted any level of immersion in a game deeper than one white bar hitting a dot towards another white bar (hello, Pong!), you were pretty much stuck with your imagination doing ninety-nine percent of the work for you.\n\n   Let's face it: it was practically child abuse, by today's lofty standards.\n\n   Fast forward to the year 2017, and what's this? Some game developer calling itself No Code (a double entendre, I presume) releases a four-episode game called Stories Untold, which at least partially carries on in the spirit of such text adventures...before adding some significant multi-genred twists, and a substantially more varied and modern visual interface.\n\n   The most common viewpoint given in the first three episodes, at least, is that of the player themselves seated at an old-school desktop computer into which you can type commands, and for the first of the four episodes that's literally all that you can do. As the episodes progress, however, the player's interactions expand to other objects/machines about their workstation, which must also be fiddled with to make headway. \n\n   It's all quite clever, really; even if I ultimately found myself favouring the first and most \"traditional\" of the bunch, a spectacularly spooky number entitled The House Abandon.\n\n   I first played this episode as a standalone game/demo quite some time ago, at the behest of a friend who generally plays neither horror nor text adventure games. It was available for free on a game-sharing site, and my friend (who had only been brave enough to watch a YouTube walkthrough) thought it might be well up my alley. He certainly wasn't wrong; though I at first suspected he might have been, especially in his assertion that a hardened horror game addict like myself might find it genuinely SCARY.\n\n   A text adventure? Scary?! I may well have wondered what drugs or alcohol this friend of mine had been scoffing, if I didn't know him as an all-but-teetotaller. He even mentioned a few occasions when the girl he viewed in the video visibly JUMPED in fright at what the game threw at her. Haha, indeed, I thought. Young, hysterical girlies on YouTube is one thing, but I'm a man in his forties and a hardcore horror fanatic, darn it all to Hades. Sure enough, a slightly harrowing twenty-five minutes later, I was tucking my tail between my legs and confirming to my friend how very right he had been.\n\n   Unfortunately, this tone of terror gradually subsides as the episodes of Stories Untold progress, and the parser-based typing largely makes way for more familiar adventure game puzzling and even a bit of first-person wandering. It's still very well-done, and there's still a consistent aura of dread to proceedings; it's just a shame that the seat-of-the-pants intuitiveness of the first episode is replaced by no end of tricky code-breaking and pedantic instruction-following, placing the last three-quarters of the game in the territory of a more familiar and contemporary adventure-gaming style, as opposed to the sheer green-screen era goodness of the game's earliest moments. \n\n   Or, to put it another way: if you're as bad at puzzles as I am, you'll happily stumble your way through the first episode without needing to peek at a walkthrough, while constantly referring to one for all that comes after.\n\n   It's also a shame that the brilliantly enigmatic ending of The House Abandon is not only explained, but almost OVER-explained by the end of the four episodes. The storytelling still remains strong throughout, but a part of me can't help but feel that the attempt to \"link\" the four episodes together into a singular storyline was a somewhat misguided effort, and it may have been better if they'd just told four unrelated tales.\n\n   It's still an excellent game, overall, and can hardly be faulted for lack of invention. I'm certainly intrigued to see what No Code get up to next.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)", "timestamp_created": 1514801705, "timestamp_updated": 1514807773, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761697", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38926939": {"recommendationid": "38926939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198239199936", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514788969}, "language": "english", "review": "Text a bit slow to my liking, but otherwise this game is pretty cool.", "timestamp_created": 1514790389, "timestamp_updated": 1514790389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38916283": {"recommendationid": "38916283", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975194542", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516572572}, "language": "german", "review": "Arsch Geil!", "timestamp_created": 1514758169, "timestamp_updated": 1514758169, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38915223": {"recommendationid": "38915223", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009215388", "num_games_owned": 829, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514755075}, "language": "turkish", "review": "\"Stranger Things\" ile birlikte gelen seksenler temas\u0131 (ger\u00e7i bizde do\u011frudan \"Seksenler\" dizisi \u00f6nceden vard\u0131. ama konumuz bu de\u011fil) bu oyunda \u00e7ok iyi i\u015flenmi\u015f.\n\nD\u00f6nemin pop\u00fcler bilim kurgu ve gerilim konular\u0131ndan g\u00fczel bir potpuri sunan oyun k\u0131sa say\u0131l\u0131r. 4 b\u00f6l\u00fcm i\u00e7eren oyuna 1 esas ve 1 gizli b\u00f6l\u00fcm daha laz\u0131mm\u0131\u015f gibi geldi. \n\n\u0130lk b\u00f6l\u00fcm oyuna \u0131s\u0131n\u0131yorsunuz. \u0130kinci ve \u00fc\u00e7\u00fcn\u00fc b\u00f6l\u00fcm\u00fcn gerilim dozu ba\u015far\u0131l\u0131.

Pas en raison de d\u00e9faillances suppos\u00e9es mais en raison de l\u2019intention de son auteur ainsi que des choix qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour faire passer cette intention.\nDonc, oui, je suis d\u2019accord pour dire que, surtout dans les deux derniers \u00e9pisodes, il est assez difficile de trouver la bonne terminologie pour avancer.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de v\u00e9ritable puzzle non plus.\nMAIS\nC\u2019est un jeu et la recherche du bon terme et de la succession d\u2019actions correctes peut vite devenir une \u00e9preuve comme une autre. Une \u00e9preuve un peu diff\u00e9rente de celles auxquelles la plupart des jeux nous ont habitu\u00e9s. Personnellement, j\u2019ai pris la recherche du terme idoine de certaines phrases comme une d\u00e9faillance des machines, ce n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas pour rien si les appareils avec lesquels le joueur dialogue sont archa\u00efques. Les ordinateurs ont fait quelques progr\u00e8s depuis le langage Basic des ann\u00e9es 70, 80\u2026\nQuant aux puzzles, en effet, ils n\u2019en sont pas. Il s\u2019agit plus de s\u00e9quences o\u00f9 on applique des consignes. Dit comme \u00e7a, cela para\u00eet idiot, mais c\u2019est loin d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9vident parce qu\u2019on est projet\u00e9 dans un \u00ab\u00a0univers\u00a0\u00bb dans lequel on n\u2019a aucune clef, il faut les trouver en t\u00e2tonnant avec, toujours, la tension au ventre parce que \u2013 c\u2019est l\u00e0 un des points forts du jeu comme beaucoup l\u2019ont soulign\u00e9 \u2013 l\u2019ambiance est tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ussi. La musique, les sont ambiants et les effets graphiques font de chaque \u00ab\u00a0puzzle\u00a0\u00bb un moment fort. Sans compter qu\u2019il y en a un ou deux qu\u2019on peut qualifier de difficile\u2026 pourtant, on suit des consignes\u2026\nPour appr\u00e9cier pleinement tout \u00e7a, il faut s\u2019abandonner, s\u2019engager sans a priori. Ne pas comparer. C\u2019est \u00e0 cette condition qu\u2019on peut sortir de SU en se disant que c\u2019\u00e9tait une exp\u00e9rience. En d\u2019autres termes, c\u2019est comme aller voir un \u00ab\u00a0film d\u2019auteur\u00a0\u00bb (j\u2019abhorre cette expression\u00a0!) plut\u00f4t que le dernier film \u00e0 gros budget hollywoodien. Privil\u00e9gier la surprise au confort bien gras.\nLes \u00e9valuations que j\u2019ai lues ne mentionnent pas un des aspects surprenants du jeu\u00a0: chaque \u00e9pisode a ses sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9s en termes de gameplay et je trouve que lui apposer l\u2019\u00e9tiquette \u00ab\u00a0text-based\u00a0\u00bb est tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ducteur.\nJ\u2019en conclue en regrettant qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas (encore\u00a0?) de traduction car, m\u00eame si l\u2019anglais utilis\u00e9 dans le premier \u00e9pisode (la demo aussi) est tr\u00e8s accessible, ce n\u2019est plus vraiment le cas plus on avance dans le jeu (il devient technique et un peu plus \u00e9labor\u00e9) et cela pourrait frustrer les joueurs non-anglophones.\nEn tout cas, j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu une exp\u00e9rience bien singuli\u00e8re avec SU et je ne peux que recommander ce jeu \u00e0 tous les curieux.

It contains some really great writing and atmosphere.\n\nThe story starts out strong but eventually undermines itself with a twist which is less interesting than what was originally presented. The final episode is tedious as hell. It explains what's going on in the first 5 seconds, yet proceeds to drag you through an extensive exposition which just feels like going through the motions.\n\nThere are technical issues. The system requirements are very high for an adventure game, especially one which appears to be a text adventure. The text prints out very slowly on the screen with a typical laptop CPU. This game should have been optimised before release. \n\nThere are design issues. In text-adventure scenes, you have to wait for the same text you've already read to slowly print out every time you return to a location you've already been. There is no way to skip this animation. There is also no way to skip any cutscenes or dismiss any dialog. Compounding this, there is no save game feature - you have to play each episode in a single sitting.\n\nIn the final episode, the text parser becomes very pedantic about which keyword you need to progress. The designers did not try very hard to make it robust to synonyms. Therefore, this game suffers from an issue which has plagued text adventures since the 1970's - the player knows exactly what to do to progress, but the game frustratingly won't allow them to do it.\n\nThere are show-stopping bugs. There is a point in episode 4 where a required switch becomes inoperable if you hit it too early. But because the game revolves around switch and lever puzzles, it's not apparent there's even anything wrong. This bug has affected many people, according to the forums, yet wasn't fixed. I had to restart the episode over from the beginning. Twice. This sealed my opinion of the game.\n\nI enjoyed this game up until the final episode, where a combination of design oversights, dull writing and bugs infuriated me.

The presentation and attention to detail is incredibile, a work done clearly by people of superior talent. But after the first chapter a big \"meh\" resounded in my head, mainly for two reasons. First the parser was very poor, I was expecting a lot more in this regard and second the story itself, while somewhat original, in the end appeared to me no more than a spooky novel for teenagers. I decided to move to the next chapter anyway and luckly my first impressions were totally wrong. Everything is connected and is a part of a bigger scheme, as the story unfolds everything start to make sense and literally makes the player live a surreal and disturbing experience. Nothing must be taken for granted in this game and the ability to constantly surprise the player without cheap \"methods\" is one of its most amazing aspects.

They were short, tense, and just the right amount of interactive, and fascinating to boot. Unfortunately, the third episode was a fucking disaster, an exercise in pointless frustration. If you like squinting at a blurry microfilm and working out what to do next based on elaborate code protocols I can't stop you, but it absolutely broke immersion for me and by the end of the episode I didn't give a shit about the plot. By the way, you can hold the right mouse button to zoom, which they don't tell you in the game, and which only helps a little. Fourth episode provided totally unnecessary exposition on the first three episodes, and provided an overarching story that the game didn't need and that I didn't care much about. It mainly frustrated me some more. If you're going to get this game anyway, get it on sale and play only the first two episodes.\n\nOther qualms: a text-based game that doesn't account for alternative keyboard layouts, and doesn't let you change the keybindings for first-person movement controls. I had to switch to QWERTY for the first-person sections and then back to Dvorak for text entry. The game also doesn't respect basic conventions of text interfaces, like Tab switching text fields, so I had to move to mouse and then back to keyboard quite a bit while I was figuring out the puzzles. A weirdly specific final puzzle that requires you to [spoiler]not only click the tape recorder, but click a specific button on the tape recorder, while unable to read the button labels[/spoiler]. No way to save in the middle of an episode, so if you quit, you have to start over. And the cutscenes are unskippable.\n\nBasically a 4/10, 9/10 if you ignore the ending half of the game.

The game continuously gives you the stuff that keeps you going and makes you scratch your head in increments you can digest ;\n+ The developers didn't lean on the game being text-driven to excuse themselves from adding some twists on how the experience is presented to the player ;\n+ Pretty avant-garde overall.\n\n[b]CONS:[/b]\n- Often times a bit on the slow side ;\n- No Code lost a tremendous chance to truly break the 4th wall [i]in lieu[/i] of delivering a fully linear storyline (more on this below) ;\n- Virtually no replay value - something to be expected but not desired in games like this.\n\n_______________\n\n[b]Stories Untold[/b] is a text-heavy [i]puzzle meets visual novel[/i] game (or something). I was excited to play this game for the premise and went in knowing very little about what the game actually consisted in, as I've been noticing it to be the best way to experience short plot-oriented games. There's a total of 4 episodes to go through, each clocking at approximately 1 hour and providing the player a slightly different experience than the last one. Stories Untold isn't very ornate ; it's in how quirky it looks and feels that you'll find its beauty. But don't be fooled by the labels stuck to this game - although definitely a text-heavy game at times reminiscent of the 80's interactive fiction games, there's a lot more to look at than just text. That is, in fact, where this game managed to impress me the most: how it can seamlessly connect a text-based experience to a strong, eerie visual presentation. The thick atmosphere and the pace at which the cryptic plot is explored are some of the strongest assets of the game. Everything worked to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout the better part of the experience. \n\nHowever, No Code didn't hit the nail in the head in every aspect with this one. As previously implied, you'll spend a significant amount of time wrestling around with enigmas and puzzles, some of which can become a bit tedious. In my opinion this is a small hindrance in the flow of the game as it managed to keep me immersed during most of the time. The only real major issue I have with Stories Untold is how the game has everything within its reach to get us, the players, fully commited and involved in the narrative, as to ultimately reward the player and avoiding dooming him/her to that one single ending, but ultimately chooses not to and doesn't even acknowledge it. I understand what a linear story is about, but the feeling that you're playing \"against\" a dumb AI should never be present at a game as linear as this ; you shouldn't be given room to think it. Allowing the player to actively take part in the game's narrative would've also given the game [i]some[/i] replay value, which it gravely lacks. Thus, No Code missed the mark in terms of ultimately delivering the ultimate psychological thriller.\n\nAll in all, [b]Stories Untold[/b] is a pretty good psychological visual novel. For those of you wondering, there's no actual horror in this game. The atmosphere is heavy and eerie and there's one or two scarier moments but it's not much, really. At the end of the day, Stories Untold feels like Her Story meets Gone Home... with a dash of Stranger Things minus most of the teenage drama. And I mean all of this in a good way.\n\n7/10", "timestamp_created": 1513965041, "timestamp_updated": 1518328825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38541234": {"recommendationid": "38541234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059718256", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513961291}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly recommend it if you're looking for a slow paced thriller with cool 80s vibes.

Was it an idea for the developers to create more complex (in terms of frustration, not difficulty) puzzles by adding more interactive game mechanics, maybe. All puzzles are not too bad though. A good example is in the first chapter's parser. Dream like fluency did not break the immersion when you didn't have to stop and think for the correct command. Of the other chapters you can't say the same, since the parser only accepts only a certain command, even if others are grammatically correct and mean the same thing. A good example is when commands like \"unbuckle the seatbelt\", \"open the seatbelt\" and \"take off the seatbelt\" amongst others don't work and you need to write \"remove the seatbelt\". Man, it was just so annoying. Who else faced the same problem, I wonder. Lost in the translation might be a problem for him who is not a native speaker like me I guess.

It weaves a wonderful tale, meshing gameplay and story in a way that many developers dream of. The final act, particularly, is astounding. Production values and sound design are high, and I can recommend the game without too much hesitation.\n\nHowever, Stories Untold contains the most irritating aspects of adventure games. Often you'll find yourself typing various commands in at the prompt, over and over, without any of them being the ones that the game is looking for. Sometimes, most notably in a scene taking place at a party, it's entirely unclear what your character is supposed to be doing. In one particular instance, I was supposed to go into the kitchen from a hallway. However, the description of the hallway, even with additional details gleaned from using the \"look around\" command, made no mention of a kitchen. Another irritation was the usage of a microfiche in episode 3. Even after optimizing the focus, I was unable to make out many of the characters I was supposed to input into the computer. The game mentions in a tooltip that finding the right command is \"part of the fun,\" but I certainly wasn't enjoying myself.\n\nOne could make an argument that the adventure style of the game ties in with the story as a whole, and that might be a compelling argument.

Prima delle avventure grafiche c'erano infatti le avventure testuali (Interactive Fiction, qualcuno ha nominato ZORK?) che, tramite un parser, pi\u00f9 o meno limitato, portavano il giocatore a scoprire storie leggendo, come un libro ma interattivo, basato sulla logica. Stories Untold gi\u00e0 dai primi minuti si mette in mostra con tutti i suoi riferimenti nostalgici agli anni '80 dagli oggetti in scena alla colonna sonora, dallo stile grafico al logo del gioco stesso che richiama quello di Stranger Things. Il gioco \u00e8 diviso in 4 episodi che si susseguiranno a delineare una storia. Durante il primo episodio ci troveremo davanti ad un monitor e ad un computer che richiama incredibilmente lo ZX Spectrum; parte qui l'avventura testuale, non nel nostro monitor, ma in quello all'interno del gioco stesso e gi\u00e0 questo fa intuire la sua linfa da metagioco. Ogni episodio aggiunger\u00e0 meccaniche che l'episodio precedente non aveva andando a complicare ma anche a rendere pi\u00f9 variegata l'avventura. Non dir\u00f2 altro in quanto scoprirne il funzionamento \u00e8 parte intergrante dell'avventura e dire troppo potrebbe andare a minare l'esperienza, il piacere della scoperta. La durata totale dell'opera varia a seconda del tempo che metterete a capire come funzioner\u00e0 il gioco, 2 o 3 ore basteranno comunque per gustarsi il titolo appieno. L'arco narrativo si infittisce di mistero proseguendo nella storia con una scrittura degna di nota ed un doppiaggio altamente curato. Il titolo di NoCode \u00e8 un fantastico esempio di interactive storytelling, un coraggioso esperimento che dimostra che con la creativit\u00e0 anche un genere ormai morto pu\u00f2 essere riportato in vita.

Un racconto sulla responsabilit\u00e0 delle proprie azioni, sul senso di colpa e sull'accettazione dello stesso che porta alla riflessione una volta terminato il viaggio.

Twist ending in episode one was actually rather clever. Love that it actually is just a text game deep down with some visual enhancments. I love things like this. A taste of real gaming yesteryear. I adore the ideas and it does actually have you on edge, can't wait to play more.\n\nBrilliant, charmimg and very clever\n\nIt was all my fault\n\n____________________________________________________________\nREVIEW ON COMPLETION\n____________________________________________________________\n\nOkay cards on the tabe, i freaking love this! This Game was so good! This is my kind of game!\n\nNever really played text based adventures but it appealed to the hard core old school nerd in me. Getting into the game, i loved the retro look of it all, i kind of wished that it was just the House Abandon, not looking at it ON the computer screen if that makes sense? But that being said it was cose yet creepy at the same time.\n\nEpisode 2 and 3 were by far my favourites, where the story tellers actually try to convince you that you're actually seeing an Alien invasion (which was freaking cool) Episode 2 in the lab was more techcy were as episode 3 was more code breaky, and it resuted in me writing things down and then tapping away at the keyboard like a tech pro. These parts actually make you feel smart\n\nEpisode 4 was THE TWIST. And all in all, i liked it. VERY life on mars cross bred with stranger things. It's a love letter to the 80's with the music score to match. \n\nQuibbles. Episode 3 towards the end, while i enjoyed the puzzle aspect, i thought it was lifted straight from the early stages of Conarium. Whether by design or mere chance is anyones guess. \n\nEpisode 4, while i adore the idea of this is all in James' head while he slowly tracks back to reality, i do kind of wished they had carried on the alien invasion thread, that would have been nice.\n\nNow for the Critical bit.\nThis game really spurs you on, and drags you and holds your attention which makes the game very enjoyable and very playable.\nHowever! It has No replayability. Once you've played it, that's it. You know what to do, the game doesn't alter its approach and randomise settings and solutions, so as a reult this game has one play through to its credit which is a great great pity. I would love to play it again, but it wont be as enjoyable next time as i've already done what i need to do and know the solutions.\n\nOverall freaking awesome, glad i payed it", "timestamp_created": 1512256548, "timestamp_updated": 1512304838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38017141": {"recommendationid": "38017141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096719543", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510817531}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u63a8\u8350\uff01\u6211\u80c6\u5b50\u5f88\u5927\u4e86\uff01a1\u7a81\u7136\u90a3\u4e0b\u5f00\u95e8\u8fd8\u662f\u5413\u5f97\u6211\u51b7\u6c57", "timestamp_created": 1512254971, "timestamp_updated": 1512254971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37991362": {"recommendationid": "37991362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002098627", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512180965}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely one of those \"if you like that sort of thing, you'll love it\" experiences.

El tercero consiste en ir descifrando mensajes emitidos por una radio e incluso algo de c\u00f3digo Morse. Fue una experiencia muy tensa e interesante.\n\nEl episodio 1 tiene un notable manejo del suspenso, es un excelente inicio para el juego.\nEl segundo episodio me gust\u00f3, tiene un desarrollo din\u00e1mico y se pone intenso.

These segments range from text-based interactions, to performing experiments, to deciphering morse code (with a lookup chart available, of course). Many gameplay elements are similiar to those you'd find in a puzzle game, and I'd say gameplay was probably the best part of this game.\n\nThe story itself wasn't anything special (it didn't have to be) but the game tried to present it in a way that made it seem more interesting. I personally don't think it worked; I wasn't involved or invested in any of the characters (because, for one, there weren't really any characters presented) so I didn't particularily care about the outcome. I was actually enjoying the red herring plot more.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's a decent game worth picking up while on sale. It's style and presentation are great, and it tries out some interesting ideas, but full price cannot be justified by these things alone for a game that took me only a little over 2 hours to beat.

It has an authentic, light-handed 80s nostaglia vibe; it harkens back to the days of cassette tapes, text adventures, and alien conspiracy theories.  It takes place in 4 episodes.  Three of these episodes are different set pieces with a common thread.  It is not readily apparent what the common thread is, but it is substantial enough to feel as you progress. \n\nThe first episode is presented as a creepy text adventure being played by the protaganist.  The is a psychologicqal twist to it that puts you on the edge of your seat, on pins and needles as it draws to a concolusion.\n\nThe second episode is an alien conspiracy/sci-fi light scenario.  It has an X-Files flavor to it.  Again you play as the main character carrying out experiments of questionable nature.  You are left to wonder why your are doing this, and being pushed to continue... It leaves the player wondering what the connection is, if any.  It ends on a very alarming and suspenseful note.\n\nThe third episode takes place at a remote arctic weather station.   Questions start to mount as you are taked with decrypting and relaying coded messages for an unkown reason.  Something has gone very wrong and you are left to simply do your job as things unravel.  The conspiracy theorys and sci-fi elements come crashing back, and there is significant tension leading to the end of this episode.\n\nFInally, the last episode ties it all together.  There is no way to review the story here without spoiling it.  This episode also briefly revisits individual gameplay elements from the first 3 set pieces.  The game allows the player a chance to start making the connections before it is pieced together in front of them.  It is an uncomfortable, grim, and somewhat moving climax.  You may find yourself fighting the inevitable as you see it bearing down.  For me, the ending didn't quite take the direction I would have expected considering the previous set pieces, but that was OK.  The game doesn't give away what it is until this final episode when you realize what has happened and why you are doing these things.\nOf particular note is how powerful it can be when seemingly inconsequential details from the previous episodes suddenly become meaningul in the light of the final revelations.  I found the game to be very clever when it came to these small details which it intentionally does not attract attention to, but if you find yourself immersed in the mystery of each set piece, you will likely spot and question them yourself.\n\nGameplay is at your own pace.  There is a small amount of learnings to use the mechanics of each episode, but this element is not overbearing.  Some may find it tedious to a small degree, but this process has a purpose to the story.\nThe mechanics themselves are mostly simple point/click/drag , with some text inputs and some FPS walking simulation.\n\nGraphics are solid, as is expected from Unity.  Some portions seem to have an intentionally downgrapded quality to them, which can be attributed to story elements; or at least they can be excused under the guise of story.\n\nSound and music are good.  There is a solid early 80s synth vibe to the spacey music.  Voice acting ranges from the immersive feeling of the radio chatter at the polar station, to some almost typical deadpan British delivery.  Note that the deadpan delivery again can be attributed to story and may have been intentional.\n\nStories Untold is an experience.  It's also a short experience at about 3 hours to complete without a guide.  However, these 3 hours keep the story moving at a good pace and wrap it all up in a decent time.  Quality over quantity:  Stories Untold should leave a mark on you by the time it is finished.  After the game is over, the experience lingers as you reflect on all those clever details you either overlooked or dismissed as inconsequential at the time.  Like any finely crafted mystery, you can replay the story and really see that it was all right in front of you the whole time, but you simply had no idea.  It took time to put the pieces together and for the light to shine on the truth.\n\nIf you like psychological thrillers, creepy sci-fi horror with an 80s falir, point & click adventures, or emotionally charged stories, Stories Untold is a worthwhile journey.  Just remember to pay attention and question why, because the more you invest into the game, the more you'll walk away with when it's all over.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511717737, "timestamp_updated": 1511717737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37683878": {"recommendationid": "37683878", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982393545", "num_games_owned": 631, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507385606}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great experience, maybe not the greatest as a game, but it's more like an interactive story.

Existe um leve \"plot twist\" e o tema central \u00e9 algo com que qualquer pessoa possa se relacionar e, por que n\u00e3o, at\u00e9 mesmo refletir um pouco\n\n* O trabalho de vozes \u00e9 realmente muito bom (tem voz? Tem sim) Os dubladores s\u00e3o extremamente competentes\n\n* Jog\u00e1-lo com fones de ouvido e luzes apagadas \u00e9 70% mais interessante\n\n* Voc\u00ea vai encontrar elementos de horror / suspense no enredo, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 exclusivamente uma coisa ou outra (eu n\u00e3o jogo games de horror porque eu n\u00e3o tenho est\u00f4mago / coragem pra isso)\n\n* As 4 hist\u00f3rias s\u00e3o \u00fanicas e n\u00e3o consigo me decidir qual eu mais gostei: [h1] O abandono da Casa[/h1]   [h1] O experimento de Laborat\u00f3rio[/h1]  [h1] O Processo da Esta\u00e7\u00e3o[/h1]  ou [h1] A \u00faltima Sess\u00e3o[/h1]\n\n* A forma como as hist\u00f3rias s\u00e3o t\u00e3o diferentes, t\u00e3o \u00fanicas e ao mesmo tempo se complementam t\u00e3o bem. Adianto que o n\u00edvel de dificuldade \u00e9 bastante diferente entre elas\n\n* As hist\u00f3rias s\u00e3o curtas o suficiente para que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o se canse ou enjoe delas, mas...\n\n* O desafio / os puzzles. Este jogo n\u00e3o vai facilitar NADA pra voc\u00ea, mas ele \u00e9 absurdamente justo aos atentos, aos observadores, aos curiosos. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o vai precisar fazer dedu\u00e7\u00f5es \"sherlockianas\" ou ter um conhecimento vasto em alguma \u00e1rea da F\u00edsica pra poder resolver qualquer enigma - esteja atento, use a dedu\u00e7\u00e3o l\u00f3gica e mais SIMPLES porque T-U-D-O o que o jogo te der em m\u00e3os \u00e9 o suficiente pra que voc\u00ea avance com a hist\u00f3ria\n\n* N\u00e3o \u00e9 \"sumariamente obrigatoriedade ditatorial\" que voc\u00ea seja uma pessoa que se permita mergulhar de cabe\u00e7a nas hist\u00f3rias e afunde nas imers\u00f5es, mas vai ajudar bastante se voc\u00ea se permitir (bastante)\n\n [h1] Os pontos negativos: [/h1]\n\n** Infelizmente o jogo est\u00e1 em ingl\u00eas sem legendas em portugu\u00eas (infelizmente porque acho que mtos brasileiros sem o conhecimento da l\u00edngua adorariam jogar esta aventura em texto)\n\n** N\u00e3o h\u00e1 save manual e se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o andar [u]at\u00e9 o final[/u] de cada cap\u00edtulo antes de sair, vai ter que recome\u00e7ar tudo de novo (o capitulo em quest\u00e3o). O jogo s\u00f3 salva ao final de cada cap\u00edtulo. ACASO EU ESTEJA ERRADO POR FAVOR ALGU\u00c9M ME CORRIJA\n\n** Os cap\u00edtulos s\u00e3o curtos demais deixando um gosto de \"poderiam ter explorado esta hist\u00f3ria, maneira, ainda mais\" (L\u00e1 atr\u00e1s eu disse que isso era um ponto positivo, certo? A sucintez, a brevidade destas hist\u00f3rias \u00e9 um ponto positivo e negativo ao mesmo tempo dependendo do \u00e2ngulo analisado)\n\n** Pode acontecer com voc\u00eas (aconteceu comigo) de clicar em algo ou chegar a uma conclus\u00e3o de como resolver um puzzle e n\u00e3o acontecer nada na sua intera\u00e7\u00e3o / decis\u00e3o. Tente de novo. pode ser um pequeno \"\u00e2ngulo errado\" em que voc\u00ea clicou ou mesmo o tempo que voc\u00ea levou na a\u00e7\u00e3o. (Isso \u00e9 raro, mas aconteceu comigo 2 vezes)\n\n** No 3\u00ba (TERCEIRO) cap\u00edtulo POR FAVOR tenha em m\u00e3os [u] um papel e uma caneta / l\u00e1pis / caneta marcador / giz de cera / carv\u00e3o... [/u] qualquer coisa que sirva para escrever de forma confort\u00e1vel e r\u00e1pida porque o jogo N\u00c3O te avisa, mas algumas coisas que s\u00e3o ditas (use as legendas pra n\u00e3o se confundir / se atrasar) precisam ser anotadas. Quando vc pegar o ritmo do 3\u00ba cap\u00edtulo isso fica mais tranquilo. Precisei reiniciar o cap\u00edtulo 2 vezes porque perdi algo dito que precisava ter sido anotado (logo no come\u00e7o do epis\u00f3dio o que causou pouco transtorno \u00e9 verdade)\n\n\nEm suma digo que me surpreendi muito positivamente e mais do que isso me senti mexido com a proposta do jogo. Os puzzles realmente variam de dificuldade, a tens\u00e3o varia de intensidade e a trilha \u00e9 PERFEITA para este jogo. Valores em nota: [h1]8[/h1]\n\nPor que n\u00e3o 10?

I always disagreed with that, as by the time that game was at its end I was already committed to protecting Ellie and no one was going to stop me.\n\n\nThis game, though? I really did not want to finish it. Somehow this game really got to me, and the ending effected me in unexpected ways. What this game was going for one hundred percent worked on me. I can not promise it will work on you, and this review might feel a bit overhyped, but its how I felt playing this game.\n\n\nOn top of that, Act 1 was legitimately the scariest section in gaming for me this year, the year RE7 came out. And it didnt do it with graphics, or grotesque imagery.\n\nThis is a very hard game to review, since its basically *all* spoilers. But, heres the thing: Act 1 is the Demo. Play the Demo. I think this game is more than the sum of its parts, and the parts are good! Its more than what it seems. The game is broken up in to four chapters, but I feel like playing this game in chunks is a mistake. (Though if you cant spend three hours playing a game, they offer convenient stopping points, if that is a plus for you). And yeah, the game is a short ~3 hours experience.

Untold Stories comprises of four separate episodes, each utilising a mix of tried and tested mechanics in a refreshing and really unique way. Seamlessly blending point and click and text adventure game styles (among others) to build a really clever narrative.\n\nEach stand-alone episode/story is presented individually, separately named and they all have distinct variations in location (bedroom, lab, weather station and hospital) and play style. However, they are increasingly self-referential and this culminates in a climactic ending that is well worth the 2-3 hours it will take to complete the game, including 13 achievements on Steam.\n\nThe game starts at a desk with an old computer and a cassette loading text adventure game that you proceed to play. Later, it has you using some seriously old-school equipment to complete puzzles. This all adds to the nostalgia whilst always progressing the story, nothing feels unnecessary. The puzzles are well constructed and logical but some of the controls weren\u2019t immediately obvious. I spent a lot of time squinting at something illegible before realising I could zoom! I also found the text input required a bit too much specificity at times, but I always worked it out in the end.\n\nThe visuals reminded me instantly of Stranger Things, in that it manages to create a retro 80\u2019s aesthetic that doesn\u2019t feel overdone or contrived in any way. The environments are small but use clever lighting to add depth to the locations and are littered with items definitive of the era, all adding greatly to the sense of nostalgia.\n\nMusic was minimal but apt, accompanying sound effects that were used to help create some genuinely creepy moments. The dialogue was written well and convincingly acted, though this was only one storytelling technique used.\n\nNo Code did a fantastic job of making Untold Stories a truly unique experience, I haven\u2019t played anything else quite like it. What makes it really brilliant is the way it utilises every aspect of the game to tell the story and add to the narrative. No pixel, mechanic or moment is wasted and I admired how cleverly everything was amalgamated.\n\nAfter two playthroughs I can tell you that there is pretty much no replay value but the first sitting is definitely an experience worth having!\n\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this and would like to see my game reviews (and a bunch of other ramblings) in their natural habitat please visit my [url=www.rachaelbreartonwrites.com]blog[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1511249014, "timestamp_updated": 1511251481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520270", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36669403": {"recommendationid": "36669403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065695547", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512440140}, "language": "english", "review": "horror,exe\n\nsad.exe", "timestamp_created": 1511239649, "timestamp_updated": 1511239649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496454", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36667429": {"recommendationid": "36667429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046743901", "num_games_owned": 1627, "num_reviews": 85, "playtime_forever": 164, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510520337}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][i]Short Review[/i][/h1]\n[h1]TL;DR at Bottom[/h1]\n[b]Let me know what you thought of this review in the comments below![/b]\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1199655156\n[h1]Verdict : [/h1]\n[b][i]Less than scary, more than worth the full price[/i][/b]\n\n\n[h1]Short and Sweet[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1199655207\nFour episodes. Three hours. Doesn\u2019t sound like much on paper, but Stories Untold is one of the rare few games which can somehow manage to get away with having such short length, and there\u2019s a good reason as to why. Whereas many games think that it\u2019s necessary to pad the experience with half-baked content just to make sure it has a decent runtime, Stories Untold realizes that, while yes it\u2019s important to get your money's worth from a game, that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be short. Instead of stretching their content to fill an eight hour campaign, they chose to build a condensed, yet powerful, experience with a story that\u2019ll slowly unravel itself as you play. Not only does Stories Untold contain one of the best stories in any game I\u2019ve played over 2017, but they made sure to keep each episode interesting. Without spoiling anything, the first episode involves you playing a particularly interesting text adventure game, the second has you setting up tech for a lab experiment, and the third and fourth feature you relaying military signals using a complex codebook. Each of these in some way impacts the narrative as a whole, helping you to understand the story and make more sense out of it, which is really useful because the story is a touch confusing once everything is finally revealed to you at the end. There\u2019s little things too that add to the immersion in Stories Untold too, like on the first level actually getting to hear the mechanical keyboard your character is using, that make it all the more unique. There\u2019s definitely an argument to be made as to whether or not this is actually a game, or more of an interactive experience. I\u2019m leaning more towards the latter option, not for any particular reason other than that the game feels more like playing through a horror movie rather than a game, which honestly is one of the game\u2019s many strengths. There really isn\u2019t that much that I can say as most of the game, including mechanics, tie into the story some way. However, what I can say is that Stories Untold is the greatest mechanical and narrative experience that I have played over the course of this year, and is a definite contender for my 2017 GOTY.\n\n[h1]Scary Without Being Scary[/h1]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1199656663\nWhat\u2019s even more impressive about Stories Untold is that it manages to be a tense and uncomfortable experience without relying on jump scares almost at all. There\u2019s a few in the first episode, and maybe one in the second, but after that you\u2019re all clear. This is to its credit, few games are actually able to create an atmosphere that has you unnerved by things in the environment, rather than just being scared of the next inevitable jump scare, but Stories Untold does just that. There were multiple occasions, especially towards the end of the game, where I found myself tensing up, only to get through without actually encountering anything at all. The fear that you conjure up in your mind, a fear made of what-if\u2019s and could-be\u2019s, is terrifying more than anything else the game can create. So the game capitalizes on that, trying to make you think you\u2019re going to get jumpscared only for everything to calm down, and this happens again and again throughout the game. So no, from a normal horror perspective I honestly can\u2019t say that Stories Untold is all too scary per se, but that\u2019s because they don\u2019t need jump scares and screamers to send chills down your spine, they can do it with something as simple as footsteps.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nStories Untold is the greatest mechanical and narrative hybrid of a game that I have played over the course of this year, and is a definite contender for my 2017 GOTY.\n\n[h1]If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to leave a comment and join my Steam Curator Group at  [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9577715-Mudkips-Gaming/]Mudkips Gaming[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1511228593, "timestamp_updated": 1511228623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36651630": {"recommendationid": "36651630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016335415", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511203701}, "language": "english", "review": "3 hours worth of game and it's got better storytelling than most games with over a hundred million dollar budget.

Could be an Excellent game.\nShort, but very cool.  I loved what they did with the blend of old school text adventure and graphics.  My first computer was setup almost identically to how they had theirs setup, keyboard next to t.v.   Mine was Commodore 64 though.\nI started gaming with Zork so it was a bit of nostalgia to do text adventure, which was fun, but that's where the single problem with this game comes in.  Near the end, there is a point in the game where the obvious word choice for an action simply doesn't work.  It was like the 'Enter the curtain' moment in Zork.  It takes you out of the moment.  Every logical word choice alternative simply doesn't work and I still remember the frustration.  \nFor me it was only this one spot that took the game from Excellent to just good, because what ended up working, which I had to look up on the internet, was simply bad grammar... or poor word choice I guess... it didn't really make sense to say it that way and saying it the way any native English speaker would say just didn't work.  Iit really took me out of the mood to hit a brick wall based on word choice.  If I were the developer, I'd fix this part.  It was the only part of the game I had to get help and that was disappointing.  \nOverall, good story, I very much enjoyed playing the game, I got it on sale for $3 which I felt was a pretty good deal.", "timestamp_created": 1509892518, "timestamp_updated": 1509892652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36287740": {"recommendationid": "36287740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042635118", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509743609}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of those types of games that stay with you. That type of game that you love experiencing and when it's over you are overwhelmed by the feeling of wishing you could go back in time and play it again fresh.\n\n I felt like I was playing a new game instead of a new game with similar mechanics and gameplay as previous/recent games. The gameplay was so enjoyable that I wish every chapter were longer to have enjoyed that particular chapter's mechanics for longer. I promise you that there is not a single dull moment in this game. Even when nothing's happening you get to use your brain and get rewarded when you discover all the little puzzles that tie in to eachother by game's end. \n\nThe story was incredibly well-written also. Stories Untold absolutely kept me on the edge of my seat and I found myself trying my hardest to pace out playing each chapter so that it wouldn't end too soon. Needless to say that strategy didn't work out so well as I ended up finishing the game within a couple days or so. \n\nThis game is definitely worth playing through. New, exciting, well-made and memorable. This is the type of game I will be talking about to others. I can't say that I've had a game do this to me in... I honestly can't remember the last time a game has brought me to talking to others about it as this one has.\n\nIf you like 80's nostalgia, if you like thrilling perfectly-paced suspense and mystery with a big ole shot of horror. If you like a game that leaves you begging for more and trying to figure out what's going on only to perfectly wrap up by the end of the game in a way that leaves you sitting there amazed at how every little detail connects in every way.

Otherwise here's my review.\n\nThe first chapter of this game is the best. It's one of the most fun horror experiences I've had in a while. Atmospheric and eerie, I jumped out of my seat, had dawning realizations and at moments I dreaded having to reach out and type even another word. I loved it. The developers knew how to use this medium effectively and it really shines.\n \nThe rest of the game, while I enjoyed it, was simply not as scary. The concept of switching settings multiple times and always having some kind of computer interface to interact with was neat, and they did do a good job. It was immersive, sitting at a computer and getting lost in the instructions and atmosphere (it's as if I have a lot of experience doing that in real life :D). The little vignettes unfolding where interesting and I grasped at every little bit of information in those first few chapters. Part of me wishes there had been ten chapters, draw out the stories with subtle hints and give us more vignettes in various horror scenarios, because what they did was fun and interesting. It just felt like a big genre shift away from horror and into (admittedly decent) speculative fiction. Maybe another, scarier vignette would have tipped the balance back to horror? I don't know. I do know that while enjoyable, the rest of the vignettes don't hit the same high. I think #2 and #3 aren't too bad but brought down a little by #4 tearing you out of the immersion completely for the story's sake. I was left craving more of The House Abandon, some kind of escape the room game switching you between finding clues in a house and doing a text adventure on an old computer.\n\nThere are other minor complaints and most other reviews cover them pretty well. Frustrating mechanics, instructions not telegraphed clearly, the overall story gives a YMMV vibe. For me that stuff keeps it from being an amazing game, but I'd still recommend it, because it was a really nice experience to play through. It felt kind of like reading a horror short story anthology, and I wish there was more. I don't see this as a game someone regrets playing, even if that first chapter truly is the best.

It's unique in how it tells it.  A lot of it is text commands like, \"go outside\", \"use key\", \"look around\", etc. while your character uses a computer and the story plays out on the computer.  The game isn't just typing on a computer.  Sometimes you have to tune a radio, flip switches, and turn knobs.  Some parts let you walk around in first-person.  The setting takes place in the mid-80's so the environment and music is retro. It's not a super scary story but will have you on edge at times.  This isn't a horror game where ghosts and monsters come after you.  This is all about an interactive story that lets you play the main character.  It's not for everyone but if you like interactive stories, 80's themed stuff and creepy stories you should give it a chance.  I enjoyed it!  It starts out a bit slow but you'll soon find out that this game will take you for a ride.  \n\nI will admit, I had to use a walkthrough on some parts.

This game consists of four seperate chapters, each having a unique story. I think that the first chapter is the best tonaly by far, setting up some really tense atmosphere. Due to the nature of the text-based adventures games that it replicates it is mechanicly light. The second chapter is a bit more mechanicly deep but I think it lacks a little of the tone that chapter one has. Chapter three is my least favorite, due to a large difficulty spike in the puzzle solving. I think it really derails the momentum that the first two chapters had build up however that problem could be something that not all players will run into.

Mi \u00e8 piaciuto molto e lo reputo un gioco di grande atmosfera con una storia ben scritta e ben sviluppata. Sono 4 episodi da giocare in sequenza in quanto non si abiliter\u00e0 il capitolo successivo se prima non si finisce il precedente.  Il gameplay \u00e8 vario per ogni episodio. Si va da una semplice avventura scritta del primo capitolo, ad usare in sequenza dei macchinari scientifici secondo manuale, inserimento di password e codici secondo un ordine ben preciso e alla ricerca di oggetti per arrivare quindi a svelare i restroscena di questo bellissimo racconto Sci-Fi nel quarto e ultimo capitolo. Una nota importante: il gioco \u00e8 in lingua inglese e soprattutto nelle fasi in cui ci troveremo a rispondere e dare comandi rispondendo a situazioni tipiche delle vecchie avventure testuali sar\u00e0 consigliata una certa padronanza dei vocaboli (almeno quelli base: look around, go to, etc...) Nessuno nel gioco vi dir\u00e0 cosa scrivere e sarete voi a digitare la giusta combinazione di parole in relazione al testo che vi troverete a monitor. Quindi prima di comprare Stories Untold tenete a mente questa cosa altrimenti non riuscirete a proseguire se non leggendo dei walkthrough. Un altro punto importante e \u00e8 che all'interno dei vari capitoli soprattutto nel secondo ci saranno scene con forti bagliori a intermittenza di luce bianca e immagini molto veloci quindi mi sento di non raccomandare il gioco a chi soffre o \u00e8 incline a disturbi a causa di questi fattori.\nL'audio \u00e8 strepitoso e anche il parlato in inglese sottotitolato \u00e8 parte integrante del gioco e ben caratterizzato.  \nSi trova spesso in sconto ad un prezzo irrisorio ma lo consiglio pure a prezzo pieno perch\u00e9 sviluppatori con idee cos\u00ec originali secondo me devono essere sempre premiati. \nDurer\u00e0 circa 2 ore ma saranno ben spese!", "timestamp_created": 1509386971, "timestamp_updated": 1509387136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36132040": {"recommendationid": "36132040", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999385812", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509413683}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing and chilling and highly recommended.

Control and Gameplay : there are several game modes introduced here, but it's mostly about typing and point-and-drag-and-click type. Different gameplay will later introduced each time. No \"timed\" action, no need to fear of failing. \n\n2. Fun Factor : actually the less you know about this game, it's better. I recommend playing it blindly until you got stuck.\n\n3. Graphic : The almost photo- realistic image is great. VERY immersive.\n\n4. Replayability Value : almost zero, since this game offers only one ending. There is no mini- game section for the mini- games, too bad. I bet many people love the mini games they put inside.\n\n5. Sound : the usual BGM for visual novels of this kind. I rarely spot bad BGM on games like this, so I apologize from the lack of sound knowledge. But for effects sounds, etc., I think it's pretty on- point with the situation presented in the game. The voice acting is great too.\n\n6. Story : while it offers different story each chapter, it was too short for my preferences.\n\n7. Value for Full Price : to support the great developers out there, why not? But yaay I get it when it was on sale (again, sorry for supporting full- heartedly but paid half- wallety). I get the bundle version for OST, it's good too. \n\n8. Others : Play it at night, with headphone plugged in.\n\nTested with:\nAcer Aspire E1 -471G\n1366 x 768/ Windows 7/ 64-Bit\nIntel Core i3 2348M (2.3 GHz)\nNVIDIA GeForce 710 M (1GB VRAM)\n4GB DDR3 RAM\n\nVisit me on sundrypassiongal.tumblr.com", "timestamp_created": 1509221818, "timestamp_updated": 1513324434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36088947": {"recommendationid": "36088947", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128984782", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508995299}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Simplesmente fantastico, genial, lindo, maravilhoso, incrivel, surreal, eu n\u00e3o tenho como descrever esse jogo de forma diferente.\n\nEle tem um terror psicologico muito bem construido em todas as etapas, ele \u00e9 desafiador e incrivelmente viciante, cada minuto dentro do jogo te deixa ainda mais tenso e querendo saber o que significa tudo, ate chegar no final e BUM sua cabe\u00e7a explode com o que acontece, n\u00e3o vou dar spoiler, mas vale cada centavo, o jogo \u00e9 perfeito e tor\u00e7o para que tenha mais jogos do mesmo tipo.\n\n*Ele tem uma leve pegada de Stranger Things, mas n\u00e3o tem conex\u00e3o com a serie.", "timestamp_created": 1509221198, "timestamp_updated": 1509221198, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36084139": {"recommendationid": "36084139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210486055", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509244367}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u672c\u9760\u653b\u7565\u8fc7\u7684\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u6211\u53ea\u61c2\u4e86\u7537\u4e3b\u6700\u540e\u662f\u9152\u9a7e\u5bb3\u6b7b\u4e86\u5168\u5bb6\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u61c2\u5267\u60c5\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u5927\u4f6c\u5e2e\u5fd9\u7406\u4e00\u7406\u56db\u7ae0\u7684\u5267\u60c5\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u601d\u8def", "timestamp_created": 1509210499, "timestamp_updated": 1509210499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.443670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36082702": {"recommendationid": "36082702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198193842527", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509206992}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5413tm\u6b7b\u6211\u4e86\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u731c\u5230\u5927\u6982\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u5413\u5230\u6211\u4e86\uff0c\u706f\u9ed1\u90a3\u4e00\u4e0b\u6211\u5c31\u77e5\u9053md\u4e0d\u597d\uff0c\u521a\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6e29\u99a8\u7684\u6c1b\u56f4\u3002\u73a9\u5230\u540e\u9762\u624d\u7422\u78e8\u8fc7\u6765\u662f\u6050\u6016\u60ac\u7591\uff0c\u602a\u6211\u4e70\u65f6\u6ca1\u4ed4\u7ec6\u770b\uff0c\u4e07\u5723\u8282\u56fe\u4fbf\u5b9c\u5165\u4e86\u613f\u671b\u5355\u5b58\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u592a\u591a\u4e86\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u53ea\u6253\u5b8c\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u5173\uff0c\u770b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e0b\u653b\u7565\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u8fd9\u4e48\u8ba4\u771f\u67e5\u5355\u8bcd\u73a9\u6587\u5b57\u5192\u9669\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1509207652, "timestamp_updated": 1509207652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36072921": {"recommendationid": "36072921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113905191", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509187268}, "language": "english", "review": "A great PSA for drinking and driving", "timestamp_created": 1509187523, "timestamp_updated": 1509187523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36068420": {"recommendationid": "36068420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079157232", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509173900}, "language": "english", "review": "The story is interesting, most of the puzzles are really good, and I like the art in the game; however, I cannot bring myself to recommend this game (I'd give it a 6/10).

The mystery of every episode acculmulate and climax in the final epsode, but the episodes are well-strucutred enough to serve as standalone stories.\n\nThe only qualms I have about this game is the text-based system.

Even then, I sometimes struggled with trying to phrase things so that the game would \"understand.\" The ambiance of the ending was a bit ruined for me as I struggled for five minutes phrasing my actions.\n\nStill, Stories Untold provides an experience that no other game gives these days.

A horror text adventure that took 2016 by storm. A year later, we have an official Steam release with three other stories wrapped in mystery. They may have already made one great game, but can they keep it up for three more?\n\nThe House Abandon plays like any other text adventure. Though with a huge difference that might not look that substantial in the beginning. Instead of the screen equating your screen, you are instead seated like you are probably right now, at a desk. The computer actually containing the text adventure off to the left as your lamp shines on your keyboard and the lone photo frame directly in front of you. As you continue on through the seemingly innocent adventure of going back to your home that you moved away from, it quickly turns dark. The house you just went through is a twisted version of itself. And suddenly the text adventure isn\u2019t just a game on the old computer. This might not even be located in an ordinary house as small changes continue to happen right in front of you as the text adventure continues.\n\nThe first story is a text adventure, so the other three must be as well right? Nope! The second story, The Lab Conduct, strays away and puts you in the shoes of someone performing experiments on an artifact. With a mysterious voice guiding you to what you need to continue as instructions come into a computer to the left of you. The computer also holding information to help you know which equipment is where and the information about specific equipment. Not having much choice to deviate from the guy that is the owner of the voice as you try to set the needed equipment correctly and turn off unnecessary equipment. The tension ramping up with each experiment.\n\nI might have lied a little. After conducting multiple experiments, you do get back into a text adventure for a short time. Though, do keep in mind that before this, you are made to look into a bright, flashing light to advance multiple times. So if you are susceptible to this, you really should turn away from the game. You do get more story beats that are not entirely clear till you know the full extent of the story.\n\nThe next story is The Station Process. Once again, straying away from the previous story's gameplay to show different scenery and focusing more on codes. Stuck in a station placed in a frozen tundra with the only people that are conversing with you are not in the same building anymore. Everyone is isolated in their own station far away enough that going out is risking everything as everyone tries to stay in contact with each other through a radio. Trying to stay alive to not let the other be alone. Though, we can't all have what we want. You have an important role, you receive transmissions and in turn, you send them back. First required to get a passcode, which is attainable by going to the required radio frequency before continuing to send it back.\n\nThere is one small hurdle that may hinder you, the microfilm. The microfilm contains the required codes needed to input based on the code word. Little does the game let you to believe, you can zoom into, rotate, and focus so the microfilm can become easier to read. If the code word is \u201cChevron\u201d after searching for the page titled with it, the lines of code you need to enter is placed here. There might also be values set that needs to be replaced with the corresponding place within the passcode, as it might ask for the second number to replace 'a'. The difficulty ramps up at a good rate, passcodes soon needing a key to decipher and more values coming in. The situation ramping up as we can finally walk away and explore what lies outside. And as you can tell, this chapter holds hints for the overall story, and with the other chapters under your belt, you can easily make some theories on what the next chapter will reveal.\n\nLastly, the fourth and last story is The Last Session. Where everything comes together and all of the hints from the previous stories are weaved together. The truth finally comes out. Everything coming to a full circle as the game comes to a close. The ending will have a chance of disappointing you. With three stories building it up, it is only normal to think that something big is going to be revealed. And with the overall moral being really overplayed so much that there is a guarantee people will whine in frustration in a room. Though, instead, it does show a different type of horror than it leads you to believe. The type we all fear deep down. I can\u2019t spoil the ending for you, but it can definitely give you mixed feelings on it with how clich\u00e9 it is.\n\nThis would be far from being terrifying if the sound design was horrible. Luckily, this is not the case as the sound design is great. The clank of the keyboard, the whirr of a machine, and a radio tuning in brings up the tension in their respective stories. Bringing life to the world that is subtle, but combined with the story brings fear. Fear of what's to come or the actions you are forced to complete. On this note, the voice work is great as well. Perfectly fitting into the grim world we are given. These voices easy to latch onto, but are they more than we seem? Can we trust them?\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nStories Untold holds a mix of styles that mess with how the player needs to play. Going from a simple text adventure, to operating machinery, and lastly to entering codes and deciphering passcodes. Giving just enough information that you can get through all parts of the game with few hurdles while also giving out hints that only make sense when you go back and look. Even with the ending possibly being the one thing that can put a sour taste to the rest, everything before is great.

It is a four part episodic that tells a singular foray into mental health, forgiveness, psychosis and a few other mental tropes. I wish it wasn't! -- more on that later -- But I absolutely adore anthologies. I've seen everything from Hitchcock Presents to Twilight Zone to Tales From the Crypt to reading dozens of written versions, including comics. Digestable, microscopic horror stories is the way that I properly appreciate the genre as a whole (Lovecrafitan short/flash fiction is my standout favorite.)\n\nThat out of the way, Untold hit the mark a few times and missed in others. Ultimately given the price, that it can be completed in one setting, and that it can be unremarkably unsettling, I recommend it for the price given.\n\nPros\n\n*Well written, cohesive narration even if it wasn't to my taste. \n*Chapter 3 astounds as a wonderful little gem of pure, slow burn horror.\n*Interface and graphics are surprisingly polished at times, except for walking segments.\n*Music is wonderful. Reminds me of Stranger Things.\n*Game is at it's best in 2 & 3 when you are controlling puzzles, not writing your moves into a terminal.\n\nCons\n\n*Walking simulator aspects are almost amazingly bad.\n*Low-vocabulary and ridiculously short CYOA elements render them almost pointless.\n*Everything is too short, and the overall ending is a lackluster Sanitarium nod.\n\nChapter 1: The House Abandon\n\nChapter 1 is the demo to the game, and is also probably the nestegg which created this whole project. You sit down at an ancient little commodore spinoff and play a CYOA text adventure. It is very easy and routine, almost hum-drum, in controls. But the main issue I struck up with was that the vocabulary is so limited. Look around, Leave, etc are very specific. You can't say \"Look around me\" or \"Leave the Car\", you need to use \"Look Around\" and \"Exit Car\", etc. Besides for this, Abandon does a fantastic job of ramping up the tension as the little adventure continues and has a clever, although predictable, ending.\n\nChapter 2: The Lab Conduct\n\nIn what I originally felt was a playable SCP, I was happy to see so many systems and puzzles at my fingertips. Felt like a controlled surgeon simulator and I was excited to do more than just type. Unfortunately for me, and you, this chapter winds up being as linear as can be. Hell, even the manual is laid out in a way that gives you instructions one at a time in the proper sequence with which you'll be using the tools to fiddle with -- and eventually release -- the artifact therein. I won't spoil the ending, but what happens during the closing act of this Chapter is hairbrained nonsense that felt like a ripoff of a Star Trek concept and was bonkers in execution. Bright lights, loud noises, Shadows of Chernobyl Ending Cutscene style montages, etc. It was disorienting, clumsy, and frustrating and I just wanted it to end.\n\nChapter 3: The Station Process\n\nLet me get the negatives out of the way, the walking section sucks and going back and forth to the microfilm is frustrating. Two tips; one, you can zoom in and zoom out and adjust focus with the tiny thumb-sliders under the manual. Two, just look up the guide for when it starts beeping at you because you won't be bothered to figure out Morse Code on the spot for a game because it asks you to. \n\nThe tension in this chapter is terrific. The concept is stark and creepy, reminiscent of The Thing to me. You're a radio operator in the arctic and an extinction level event might have begun, and it's up to you to relay codes from your ferry station out to the world that needs it -- be it ships, military, civilians, etc. You can kind of guess and articulate what the codenames, lingo, and frequencies all mean with deduction as the story goes on. It's not a hard nut to crack, but it's a tense one. I just wish a few things were different here. First, a manual would have made more functional sense in a gameworld than the micro film. Some features the MF has aren't utilized, namely slides, and spinning the damn thing is never used and it just irritated me when it did do that via the dial. The walking simulator, and the obvious \"scares\", were also dumb. This story should have been tripled in length, filled with more lore, had more communication and expanded upon the feeling of impending doom a lot more than the slice it did.\n\nI also would suggest to the developers that right here is an organic time to play with your text adventure. Our mic was cut off, I was happily expecting to be able to type my replies instead to my friends and was wholly let down. \n\nChapter 4: The Last Session \n\nThis is an amalgamation of all the previous chapters and isn't quite worth discussing. It's kind of lousy, and my interest dropped off to a point where I just beat it to beat the game. \n\n-------\n\nMy closing comments are this. I am impressed with the atmosphere, delivery of new mechanics, visual polish, wonderful audio and above average writing. From a horror enthusiast, I will tell you this; the game needed more story, a more meaningful exploration of the text adventure system, Chapter 3 could be it's own game, and there is no reason to me why an anthology has to be cohesive.

Stories Untold caught my attention and I started to play it \u2013 and didn't stop until I had completed it. \n\nI'm old enough and ugly enough to remember the golden era of text adventures. One of my first ever games was the 1982 BBC Micro release of The Philosopher\u2019s Quest which both hooked me and flummoxed me in equal measures and is, without question, one of the games that turned me into the gamer I am today. (I never did get past the gorgonzola) When I began Stories Untold I gleefully dove into the old habit of \u2018using\u2019 \u2018pulling\u2019 \u2018opening\u2019 and attempting to look at everything even vaguely mentioned in the text and loved every second of it!\n\nThis game managed to be nostalgic, clever and original all at the same time, which is a hard balancing act for anyone to accomplish. The puzzles were straight forward and challenging in equal measure, with a couple being downright devilish. Add to that a really atmospheric soundtrack and some excellent voice-acting and you\u2019re on to a winning gaming experience and I would, unreservedly, recommend this game. \n\nIt does, unfortunately, have one (for me rather major) downside. Without giving away spoilers, you spend quite a lot of the game either having a light-source pointed at you or looking into bright lights, which were incredibly uncomfortable. Similarly there were a couple of times you were required to use onscreen manuals that contained the information required to progress and seemed to have no zoom function, other than a slight right-click which made very little difference. Just be warned if you suffer from photo-sensitivity of any sort this may well be hard going. The ability to move the point of view away from the light sources a little more would have been appreciated.\n\nThis was a gem of an indie game and I really hope the developers are working on more stuff, because I\u2019ll be right at the head of the queue to lap it up. Stories Untold was great and though I\u2019d consider it more \u2018thriller\u2019 than \u2018horror\u2019 it was definitely worth the price tag.

Great puzzles and just a really nice set of short story based experiences.  Lovely stuff.  \n- Probably my favourite story telling in games.  \n- Some comments regarding each individual part are below.  They contain spoilers.\n- [i]Part 1 - The House Abandon[/i]\n- Very short but quite effective twist on a short coming home story.\n- Less obscure than many text adventures of the past with limited commands but this makes it more enjoyable to me, searching for the right verb in these types of game is a pain.\n- Love the visual style and it definitely adds something to the game.\n- [i]Part 2 - The Lab Conduct[/i]\n- More obscure than the previous chapter in terms of solving the lab puzzles but everything you need is in the manual.\n- Nice segue back to the first chapters text adventure style.  There is again an additional layer of vagueness here but in this part I think it adds to the atmosphere.  You are after all dealing with what is presented as an [spoiler]alien mind and alien technology[/spoiler].\n- Very effective short story telling in this part and nice voice acting.  \n- [i]Part 3 - The Station Process[/i]\n- Love the puzzle solving in this part.  Using the old microfilm manual is cool, brings back all the annoyances from using these in libraries back in the day!

This stems partly from the game's wonderful aesthetic - a twisted 80s world whose underlying themes remind me more of Stephen King's [i] Misery [/i] than Men at Work. It's about time a game did more than just parrot retro tropes.\n\nThe Unity Engine works wonders (mostly), with gorgeous textures and lighting. Even set within fairly small spaces, Stories Untold still persuades the player that what they see is only a small part of a larger world. Interaction with the world is limited, but fits well within the scope of the game itself.\n\nThe audio is fantastic: the voice actors believable, the click-clacking of keys sublime, and the music a darkened nostalgia. This is a game that deserves headphones and the volume turned up.\n\nGameplay wise, more polish is needed. The text parser used in some chapters rarely accepts synonyms or similar words, which can become frustrating. I also experienced large stuttering in the final chapter, regardless of quality settings, but this didn't make the game unplayable. The way the player switches between in-game interfaces is clunky; it becomes faster to write things down.

If you are a die-hard of this genre, like a good horror story, or don't mind the lack of saves, then get it on discount.\n\nThis game is in 4 \"episodes\", if you play perfectly you could probably finish each in a half-hour. However the learning curve is steep. There is not much hand-holding in this game. Luckily there is a good Steam guide (had to consult at least once per chapter) and also some videos. There are a few hints offered when the game is paused or loading. Pay attention to these an it will save some frustration.\n\nThere are a combination of sound, text-parsing and equipment usage puzzles.  A little familiarity with text-parsing games (like Zork and other Infocom games) helps but is not necessary. Again, I had to consult the guide when I knew what to do but couldn't figure out *how* to do it. I enjoyed most of the puzzles, but again felt some were on the hard side. The screen aliasing makes some of the fine details hard to make out - I don't know if thus was deliberate or not to increase the difficulty of some puzzles.\n\nAnd this is where the lack of save function comes up. The only way to \"save\" a game is to finish an episode. For most other games I'd just save and do something else when I get stuck. Can't do that here. You can always pause the game and mabe hibernate your computer, but then you can't go to a different Steam game. If the episodes were shorter or easier, I could overlook this. There are several places each episode that could logically be save points. But I think this is enough of an issue that most people should be aware before buying this one that I'm barely down-checking this one, If I could give a neutral recommendation I would,\n\nIt's really too bad, since the graphics and voice acting are great, and the story is excellent. It hits many of the classic horror tropes, and does it well. Very few games have this many twists and unexpected turns, and I was on the edge of my seat quite a bit.

The use of 'day in the life' interactions with highly detailed and believable devices /objects is very immersive.  It created a great vibe and nostalgic feeling and added puzzle-like, but organic, gameplay.  It struck me that this would be marvellously suited to an evocative educational situation - such as a museum type 'living' exhibit.  It is genuinely entertaining, mainly because of the level of immersive detail, and I imagine a cold war exhibit done in this way could also be really quite thought provoking.\n\nBeneath the detail each chapter is a fairly short series of linear solutions to puzzles - but the genres are blended in such a way that your actions seem to carry on off the screen.  On occasion it actually does and such confounding of expectation (such as suddenly being able to look/walk around a space) are very effective when taken in context.  That the camera always has things just off view - that there are usually details in the background that may suddenly become the foreground - certainly keeps you guessing as to where the game world stops.and starts.\n\nAs a narrative experiment and a development of 'walking simulators' I would say it is a success.  At it's best feeling much more involved than simply being an interloper being shown things.  I certainly engaged with it - to the point where I felt something of genuine agency in the world and felt the pressure and discomfort of my 'character'.  It felt to me similar to audience participation in a drama piece - not sure what is ad-libbed and what is not.  In it's most memorable middle sections it's definitely that sort of playing.\n\nHowever, this feeling of having direct agency eventually caused a problem as the game progresses.  Your agency in the dreams and fantasies of the protaganist does not synthesise with the eventual fixed narrative of the 'true' events.  I don't know if I wished for the ability to change the past, some sort of Dr Who sentemental logic via timeywimey magic to save the world in a neat bow.  Such a mechanic was in Cryostasis, for example, interesting but not entirely succesful.  In Stories Untold, however, your spirit like presence in the world is ultimately shown to only to have any real place in the protagonists episodes of denial and fantasy, and you live out his exciting intrigues as their subconcious finds ways of avoiding and dening a reality that you have no real part in.  \n\nThis reveal is a slightly tedious and forced acting out too - by a mechanism no cleverer than simply withholding all other options.  Regardless of completing these actions in order to progress the section and move the game forward, I did not feel complicit.  I became more aware that I was frustrated by having to do what my stupid character had done - when I would have chosen to do differently.\n\nThe feeling of intrigue and dilema that I had felt earlier slowly evaporated as I disinvested.  This feeling could be seen as part of the psychological journey, with me experiencing the frustration of being made to face reality, moving past the earlier inventive attempts at delusion.  The point being - we must thow out the fallacy of attempts to 'solve' the painful memories as if it were a game if we are to be healthy.\n\nWithout a doubt my life within the game was in the fantasy and I was therefore reduced and removed, jettisoned with all the other fantastical elements, during the end sequences while the character recieves their just deserts and reclaimed an unhappy place in their world.  Just deserts that, ultimately, seemed nothing to do with me.  [/spoiler]\n\nIt is therefore overall a flat feeling I'm left with, a harsh smack of 'Casualty/The Bill/London's Burning' grade melodrama (British low quality TV shows) to knock the inventive escapism out of me like I've been naughty..  Sort of miserable at the level of getting home and finding the internet is down for a bit so no escapism for you, maybe kicking an imaginary puppy - oh you devil you, and then hearing that a great-great-aunt you thought was dead ages ago has actually died but you don't need to go to the funeral or anything so no biggie but you are aware that you are supposed to feel sad so you feel oddly morbid about it..  \n\nNevertheless - interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1507641945, "timestamp_updated": 1507646321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35612666": {"recommendationid": "35612666", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998829258", "num_games_owned": 760, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507622777}, "language": "english", "review": "The first episode of the game is near perfect.

The individual episodes give you elements of horror, sci-fi, and survival  genres, but ultimately this is a game of escalating psychological tension, in which you experience the protagonist's feelings of dread, anxiety, guilt, and powerlessness at the horrors unfolding in front you.\n\nAt least that's how it works when everything comes together. Stories Untold is presented as an anthology, and as is usually the case, not every entry in the anthology holds up equally well. The second and third episodes felt slow and sometimes frustrating as stand-alones; the second one compensates for this with a memorable scene and story, but the thid one is almost a total miss, combining the most tedious gameplay with the least suspenseful setting. It all pays off in the last episode though. I would have been satisfied if the game ended with a final stand-alone vignette, instead you get an astonishing final act that brings the seemingly unrelated episodes together and reveals the truth about the game's protagonist. \n\nThe music is sublime. The graphics, while rudimentary, still contain their fair share of haunting images. I imagine some players will find the game frustrating or dull, and if you like your horror games full of action and/or gore, this is probably not the game for you.

Initially only first episode is available and completing an episode unlocks the next one. The four episodes are apparently unrelated except that they all follow the basic premise of a character sitting and interacting with a computer screen, this mainly means typing commands or clicking on things. \nThe gameplay is really nothing special, but the gameplay is not the focus here, the story is. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t really say much about the story without spoiling it. If this looks like something you would enjoy, then don\u2019t read any more reviews, just buy the game. This really is the sort of game where the less you know going in the better.\nNow, this game isn\u2019t for everybody. I think it\u2019s the sort of thing you either love or hate. While I highly recommend it to fans of interactive fiction, if you are looking for innovative or challenging gameplay, look elsewhere. \nThere are also a few things I didn\u2019t like about it. First, at points it has the classic text-based game problem of \u201cguess what word the developer was thinking of\u201d. This is generally not a major problem but at one point I did have to consult a walkthrough because I knew what to do but wasn\u2019t quite sure what to type to make it happen. The other annoyance is that there is no saving. If you quit the game, you will have to restart the current episode from the beginning. This is not a huge deal because each episode is fairly short - just over half an hour each - but it is something to be aware of.", "timestamp_created": 1507546859, "timestamp_updated": 1507546859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35593365": {"recommendationid": "35593365", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964587505", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507469850}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Stranger things[/h1]\n\nGreat narrative and writing.

You really get in the mood while playing it, especially in the first and last episodes. I highly recommend playing it in the dark, alone, and with headphones.\n\nThe story itself is nice-ish. Nothing mid-blowing, but I liked it.\n\nNow about gameplay: almost half the game is played as a text-based adventure game from the 80s. It's super simple and there isn't a lot to do, or choices to make (the game is strictly linear). In the other half, you have to perform some tasks which remind me of \"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\", but with no time limit nor punishment for mistakes (so zero pressure). Because there is no difficulty, these tasks feel more like chores than challenges, and sometimes are simply annoying: game tells you what to do and you do it. Some other (shorter) parts are like a first person....walker? These parts are there exclusively for the sake of the atmosphere, and add little to nothing gameplay-wise.\n\nBottomline: this is a short story, told in an inventive and atmospheric way. The little gameplay that is present is unremarkable at best.\n\nI'm recommending it because it's a nice way to spend a rainy evening, spending little money (I bought it for less than US$ 2.00, so there's that).", "timestamp_created": 1507526841, "timestamp_updated": 1507527047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35589598": {"recommendationid": "35589598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273267787", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507525764}, "language": "english", "review": "---SPOILER FREE!-----\n\nThis is a game you do NOT want to spoil, so pick through the reviews carefully.\nThe narrative of this game was excellent and it comes together brilliantly in the end.

If you get too lost, there are some excellent guides to turn to, so don't get discouraged.  I cannot say more about the actual game without ruining it for you, but know that this is an experience worth having.\n\nThere is one con to mention.  The game is separated into parts and once a part is started, you have to finish playing through the whole thing or start it over again.  There is no save function during gameplay.  This factor was really annoying to me, but since the parts are roughly an hour long each, it's forgivable.

There's enough going on seperate to that to at least keep me interested, or at least willing to put up with the tedium to see what was next. What was next was (spoiler alert) it was all a dream, along with a bog standard, unity default first person section with appaling FOV, and some really poorly sculpted terrain. The interface was not updated here, leaving me with a mouse cursor\n\nChapter 4 is like a compilation of the worst parts of all of the previous episodes. You're essentially told the ending immediately, and the rest is just going through the motions. The worst offender is the revisit of the text adventure from chapter 1, where in most situations there is only one, very specific command you can type at each step, made more difficult to decipher due to the fact that no consistant commands have been established. Your presense is a formality, and stumbling to the conclusion is a very tedious exercise, killing what little tension and atmosphere there was to an increasing cliche story. \n\nDespite the amazing potential, I simply cannot reccomend it.", "timestamp_created": 1507499516, "timestamp_updated": 1507499516, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505349", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35583567": {"recommendationid": "35583567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285698867", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507497845}, "language": "english", "review": "A psychological horror story is common in the horror video game genre, however I have to argue that this game is set apart from the rest.

I honestly bought the game, expecting to put it in the backburner while I finished Evil Within, but I was hooked.

Yes you are looking at under two hours play time for the entire 'game'. This one of those purchases that it is difficult to give a definite 'thumbs up' or 'thumbs down' for, as what it does, it does really well, but it would hard pressed to call this a 'game'.\n\nEach episode is very different in flavour, but with the same core mechanic: that is you primarilary interact with the story by typing commands into a terminal, flavoured visually in some way with some 80's tech styling, and in later chapters you interact in more creative ways with this old technology. This is where they have done a great job: the attention to detail, visually and audibly, everything looks, feels and sounds, at least like a nostalgic and simplified, analogue reproduction of an era gone past. Here, however is where it differs from the 80's text based adventures it is based on - whereas a 'Level 9' text adventure might keep you entertained for weeks, Each Episode here will keep you entertained while your dinner is in the oven. They have a couple of gimmicks that might make you feel like you've experienced something unique, I won't spoil what they are, but suffice it to say, the terminal in which you type is in it's own 3D world itself, and each episode kind of explores the possibilities of where that could lead.\n\nAnd here is the problem of this game: it feels like a 'please hire us' concept demo. It's the kind of thing that you might see at a trade show or a 10 minute 'immersive experience' you might see at a science museum. There is no doubting that a huge amount of detail has been lavished on to these 10 minutes per chapter, from the graphics to the voice acting to the sound design, but really when the self-aggrandising, overly drawn out credits roll down after each frisson, you can't help wondering if the entire thing has just been a cyncial attempt to land them all a job in designing, you know, an actual game.\n\nThere will be doubtless many other hyperbolic reviews extolling how life changing this game is - it's not, but it does have a very impressive, but brief, perspective shifting gimmick - reviews I feel are more a product of our collaborative yearning for the computer game to come in to it's own as a medium, say compared to the film, the play or the novel; a cause I am rooting for as much as the next man, but come on, I demand more playtime for my money at this price (any price for sub 2 hours gameplay for that matter), clever gimmick or not, and hey, every other medium has been experimenting with these sorts of narrative shifts for years. \n\nAnd putting the same name, several times in the same credits is plain old narcissistic.\n\nGraphics 10/10\nSound 10/10\nVoice Acting 9/10\nImmersion 10/10\nGimmicks 10/10\nGameplay 6/10 (I didn't touch on this but there is A LOT of repetition)\nReplayability 1/10\nValue for Money 2/10\nLikelyhood of Developers landing great jobs and going on to do great things in actual games 10/10\n\nBUY/DON'T BUY = If you love seeing creative exploration of the genre and love indie games, and want it for the library, DENIFITE BUY; If you want a game to get your money's worth from and kill some time, AVOID", "timestamp_created": 1507497838, "timestamp_updated": 1507497838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35583060": {"recommendationid": "35583060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044640079", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507682899}, "language": "english", "review": "Good voice acting\nEnthralling story\nAmazing soundtrack", "timestamp_created": 1507496548, "timestamp_updated": 1507496548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35582624": {"recommendationid": "35582624", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988039425", "num_games_owned": 552, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507494291}, "language": "english", "review": "Stories Untold is a great short interactive horror experience.\n\nPros\n- Spooky AF.\n- Immersive atmosphere.\n- Doesn't rely on cheap scares.\n- Great writing and solid VO.\n- High production value.\n\nCons\n- Short but worth it.\n\nIf you're looking for a great short interactive horror experience then you can hardly go wrong with Stories Untold.", "timestamp_created": 1507494923, "timestamp_updated": 1507494923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35582418": {"recommendationid": "35582418", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967649646", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507494161}, "language": "english", "review": "It's short and text based, but it's a great game.

Mais ovni veut-il dire mauvais ou seulement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux hipsters ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 un master en arts audiovisuels ? \n      Au contraire : le jeu est un vrai chef d'oeuvre tant part son ambiance que part son gameplay tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cial. En effet parlons tout d'abord de l'ambiance. Elle est avant tout r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux fans de films d'horreurs des ann\u00e9es 80  -coucou l'inspiration bande son  made in carpenter ( oui certains diront que \u00e7a pompe stranger things mais rappelons que ce dernier \u00e0 les m\u00eames inspirations ). Cependant si vous n'\u00eates pas un grand fan du genre horrofique l'histoire suffira \u00e0 vous donner envie de faire le jeu car elle digne d'un bon M. Night Shyamalan ( une histoire de qualit\u00e9 qui demande de faire le jeu une deuxi\u00e8me fois pour saisir tous les doubles sens ). \n      Ensuite parlons du gameplay, v\u00e9ritable puissance et faiblesse de ce jeu. C'est vrai qu'au premier abord on peut trouver que  le fait de devoir juste \u00e9crire ce que doit faire notre personnage n'est pas des plus jouissif mais lorsqu'on rentre dans l'ambiance on comprend pourquoi le gameplay est ainsi fait. En plus, la phase que tout le monde semble retenir n'est en fait qu'un quart du jeu \u00e0 peine et n'est pas selon moi la plus prenante car malgr\u00e9 le fait que ce soit une entr\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re forte les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont trouv\u00e9 le moyens de faire \u00e9voluer le gameplay avec l'histoire, chose tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciable et demandant au joueur de penser diff\u00e9remment dans sa mani\u00e8re de jouer. Cependant comme dit plus haut, le gameplay peut \u00eatre per\u00e7u comme un d\u00e9faut car il ne pla\u00eet pas \u00e0 tout le monde et le fait que le jeu soit enti\u00e8rement en anglais le place tr\u00e8s difficilement dans la cat\u00e9gorie tout publique car il ne faut pas juste savoir lire un peu d'anglais, il faut r\u00e9ellement ma\u00eetriser la langue et savoir composer des r\u00e9ponses coh\u00e9rentes ( car exp\u00e9rience perso : je d\u00e9v\u00e9rouille une porte et une fois la porte d\u00e9v\u00e9rouill\u00e9e je veux rentrer donc je demande au jeu de faire rentrer mon perso dans la pi\u00e8ce mais ce dernier se trouvant toujours dans le hall le jeu ne comprend pas et me dit alors qu'il ne sait pas dans quelle pi\u00e8ce je veux rentrer et c'est l\u00e0 que j'ai compris que dans la partie texte il faut raisonner comme si l'on \u00e9crivait un livre et donc tout pr\u00e9ciser ). \n   Ainsi stories untold est malheureusement un jeu \u00e0 ne pas placer entre toutes les mains mais cela n'est d\u00fb qu'\u00e0 une barri\u00e8re linguistique donc un conseil pour les bilingues foncez sur ce jeu et si vous ne voulez pas l'acheter faites la d\u00e9mo ( ce que j'ai fait et qui m'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 acheter le jeu)  et \u00e9crivez \u00e0 votre tour un commentaire pour que ce jeu qui est pass\u00e9 inaper\u00e7u en France lors de sa sortie aie enfin la gloire qu'il m\u00e9rite !", "timestamp_created": 1507469731, "timestamp_updated": 1507469731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35572931": {"recommendationid": "35572931", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327697908", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507538101}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\u6a21\u62df\u5668+\u516c\u76ca\u5e7f\u544a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u3002\n\u53f8\u673a\u4e00\u6ef4\u9152\uff0c\u4eb2\u4eba\u4e24\u884c\u6cea\u3002\n\u5176\u5b9e\u8fd8\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u5c0f\u5931\u671b\u7684\uff0c\u540e\u9762\u51e0\u7ae0\u6ca1\u6709\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4fCH1\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u5c24\u5176CH3\u96ea\u5730\u8d70\u8def\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4f53\u9a8c\u6781\u5dee\u3002\n\u8fd9\u79cd\u6e38\u620f\u5e94\u8be5\u50cfTwin Peaks\u90a3\u6837\u8d35\u5728\u8d85\u73b0\u5b9e\u548c\u9690\u6666\uff0c\u524d\u9762\u7684\u7ebf\u7d22\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u591a\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981CH4\u518d\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u8ff0\u4e00\u904d\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1507469477, "timestamp_updated": 1507616559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35572424": {"recommendationid": "35572424", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977655058", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 246, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507467466}, "language": "german", "review": "So ... jetzt fange ich die Review zum dritten Mal an da ich nicht wei\u00df wie ich die Review ansprechend schreiben soll bei einem solch aussergew\u00f6hnlichem Spiel.\n\nEs handelt sich hier um ein klassisches Text-Adventure mit einer durchaus grusseligen Atmosph\u00e4re und einigen Horror-Elementen.

Der Umfang liegt bei ca. 3-4 Stunden - ggf. etwas mehr oder weniger je nach eigenem Skill.\n\nDa ich nichts weiter spoilern und deshalb nicht so viele Infos geben kann, m\u00f6chte ich abschlie\u00dfend sagen, dass es f\u00fcr mich eine sehr interessante Spielerfahrung war die ich so tats\u00e4chlich nicht erwartet h\u00e4tte.\n\nAbsolute Empfehlung deshalb von mir!\n\n\nPro:\n- 80's oldschool Soundtrack\n- stimmig Grafik\n- atmosph\u00e4rische Soundkulisse\n- klasse Story und generell gutes Storytelling\n- Spiel bietet deutlich mehr als man zun\u00e4chst meinen w\u00fcrde\n- DEMO verf\u00fcgbar auf STEAM\n\nContra:\n- an manchen Stellen wirklich extrem kniffelige R\u00e4tsel (dessen L\u00f6sung das Spiel aber immer bereitstellt)\n- gute englisch Kenntnisse notwendig (kein Problem aus meiner Sicht aber f\u00fcr manch einen Spieler vielleicht)\n- Umfang nur ca. 3-4 Stunden - diese aber sehr intensiv\n\n-----\n\nAlle Game-Reviews von mir in meinem [url=steamcommunity.com/id/skorkwb/recommended/]<< Review Bereich >>[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1507468327, "timestamp_updated": 1514676037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35572417": {"recommendationid": "35572417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050618180", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507706985}, "language": "english", "review": "excellent", "timestamp_created": 1507468317, "timestamp_updated": 1507468317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35571747": {"recommendationid": "35571747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001772969", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507466047}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0430. \u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u043e, \u043d\u043e \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043a\u0438\u0435, \u044f \u0431\u044b \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043b, \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0430\u0431\u0441\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0442\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0448\u044c \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f, \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0435.\n\u041a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0441 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0439 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0439, \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043f\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433. \u0412 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b \u0431\u044b \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1507466698, "timestamp_updated": 1507466698, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35571128": {"recommendationid": "35571128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160699260", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515306337}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e04\u0e38\u0e49\u0e21!!!

I thought they were awesome, and I sat down eager to complete the third chapter. Unfortunately this is where the game fell apart for me. The first issue I had was with the morse code section. The code played way too quickly for me and I couldn't differentiate between the dots and dashes. I ended up checking the forum for the solution. Then, for the other segments the clarity of the speaker is not great. It is hard to tell the difference between the person saying 13 and 30. Mike and Like. And the codes being spoken were hard to understand too. Even though I had subtitles selected on the options screen, there were no subtitles for when the code being spoken. I also found the microfiche hard to navigate. I could see there was a zoom in and out, a rotate and a blur adjustment, but I was unable to move the screen up and down and keep the information I wanted on the screen. Parts kept getting cut off and in the end I just felt so frustrated with it, that I gave up. \n\nI want to recommend this game. I enjoyed the first two chapters, and I am sure many others will too. But if you have any kind of visual or hearing impairment, then Chapter 3 might cause some frustration. And Chapter 4 is locked until Chapter 3 is complete.

Nun habe auch ich das Spiel geschafft und werde nun mal meine Erfahrungen berichten. \n---\nAls langj\u00e4hriger PC-Spieler sind mit Textadventures ja nicht fremd. Aber es ist doch eine ganze Weile her, seitdem ich das letzte Mal so etwas vor Augen hatte. Und musste ich mich erst mal daran gew\u00f6hnen, dass der (virtuelle) PC vor mir auf eine Eingabe wartet. Doch auf welche?\n---\nSo hangelte ich mich intuitiv durch die imagin\u00e4re Umgebung und kam ganz gut zurecht, da nicht hundertprozentigen Wert auf eine korrekte Syntax gelegt wird. \"go to location\" wird genau so akzeptiert, wie das kurze \"go location\". Und im Zweifelsfall hilft ein schnelles \"look around\", um sich noch mal einen \u00dcberblick zu verschaffen. \nSo liest man sich intensiv in die Geschichte ein und \"interagiert\" in der Spielwelt und merkt irgendwann, dass auch die reale (virtuelle) Welt davon beeinflusst zu werden scheint.....\n---\n....und an dieser Stelle werde ich inhaltlich nichts mehr preisgeben, denn das Spiel funktioniert n\u00e4mlich am besten, wenn man nicht wei\u00df, was auf einen zukommt und vor allem der \"H\u00e4?\"-Faktor, was die weiteren Episoden betrifft, ist ein wesentliches Element, das die Atmosph\u00e4re tr\u00e4gt und den \"Aha\"-Effekt am Ende ausl\u00f6st. \n---\nDie weiteren Epsioden werden der Reihe nach freigespielt und sie unterscheiden sich jewels in der Spielweise. Es ist hier weniger mit Intuition zu l\u00f6sen, sondern eher durch erh\u00f6hte Aufmerksamkeit, etwas Interpretation und einem Qu\u00e4ntchen Logik. Was alles soll und wie sich alles verbindet, kl\u00e4rt die finale Episode. Hier ist man wieder mehr am Probieren, bis man sich durchgehangelt hat. Einen qualitativen Abfall zwischen den Episoden konnte ich nicht ausmachen, aber das ist Geschmackssache. Jede ist eben einen Tick anders und das ist gut so. \n--- \nTechnik: das Spiel ist visuell puristisch, spielt in einer stark eingeschr\u00e4nkten Umgebung und setzt voll auf Stimmung. Diese wird vor allem mit der Soundkulisse erzeugt. Passend zum jeweiligen Thema der Episode gibt es die entsprechenden Hintergrund- und Umgebungsger\u00e4usche. Das Highlight hier ist aber der Soundtrack. Mich hat dieses ungute Gef\u00fchl, das wie eine dunkle Wolke \u00fcber dem Spiel h\u00e4ngt und das zu gro\u00dfen Teilen von der Musik ausgeht, sofort an einen Film von David Lynch erinnert. \n---\nKritik: das Spiel ist jetzt nicht ultra-schwierig. Die Zeitfresser sind hier eigentlich nur Falscheingaben, weil man entweder nicht genau genug gelesen oder eben doch mal falsche Befehle verwendet hat und vielleicht auch mal etwas raten muss. \nDas Spiel ist auf Englisch und da es textbasiert ist und hier und da auch Geh\u00f6r erfordert, sollte man hier einigerma\u00e9n sattelfest sein. Schulenglisch der Oberstufe sollte aber ausreichen und wer \"im Kontext\" verstehen kann, kommt auch schon sehr weit. Aber es ist sicher eine H\u00fcrde, die das Spiel auch anstrengender macht, als es eine deutsche Version tun w\u00fcrde.\nDie Geschichte an sich ist toll erz\u00e4hlt und mit Episode 4 dann auch schl\u00fcssig. Die finale Aufl\u00f6sung wird langsam und st\u00fcckweise aufgebaut, wodurch am Ende kein \u00fcberraschender Knalleffekt mehr entsteht. Es ergibt sich eben nach und nach das Gesamtbild. F\u00fcr mich eigentlich kein echter Kritikpunkt, da die Geschichte super erz\u00e4hlt ist.\nAllerdings ist der Wiederspielwert etwas mau, denn wenn man den Ablauf kennt, ist dieser eben stets derselbe. Ein paar vrsteckte Steam-Errungenschaften sind vielleicht noch ein kleiner Anreiz, aber das war es auch schon. \n---\nFazit: ein kleines, kurzes und kurzweiliges Spiel, das des Englischen m\u00e4chtige Spieler in maximal 4 Stunden durch haben d\u00fcrften und das am Ende eine runde Geschichte ergibt und durch eine fantastische Atmosph\u00e4re besticht. \nEs reiht sich in die Liste der \"Ausnahmespiele\" ein, zu denen ich j\u00fcngst \"Tha Vanishing of Ethan Carter\" z\u00e4hle, ohne jeodch das Konzept zu kopieren, sondern eine ganz eigene Mechanik aufzubauen.\nWer atmosph\u00e4risdchen Midnfuck mag, wird hier f\u00fcndig, sofern er die Voraussetzungen mitbringt.

It didn't take me long to play through it. maybe 4h or 5h, including going back to get some extra achievements I'd missed... All in all, I'd say it was excellently executed!\n\nSo, the game plays like a four-part miniseries.  Each 'episode' starts with a wonderfully professional intro, and is self-contained, although the later episodes do refer back in certain ways. The episodes feel like a 1970s / 1980s B-rated horror series that you'd find on a lesser-watched channel at 1am on a thursday night... \n\nEach of the episodes involves interacting with a screen, to solve problems, perform actions and so on.  It has a similar feel in some ways to \"Please don't touch\" or \"Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes\"...  A series of buttons, knobs, wires and so forth that you have to manipulate in a certain order...    However, unlike those two other games, this one has some fascinating effects and a bizarre storyline which comes together at the end.\n\nI don't want to talk about the specific contents of each episode, because each one is wonderful, and a brilliant surprise each time.  They're all subtly different but like \"KTaNE\", the things you have to do build up as the game plays, so you start off typing on a computer, and the last episode has a mix of FPS, some typing and some button-pressing.   \n\nThe voice overs, sounds, and visuals are all superb!  The atmosphere projected in the first few episodes had my heart racing.   The third and fourth episodes are just wonderful, with brilliant production values.  Switching between gzmeplay modes is really well done, and the FPS sections are wonderfully balanced against the point-and-click sections.\n\nThe game holds together briliantly, and really works for an alternative 'experience' game.      It does require you to use your brain, and there are one or two bits where you have to really puzzle out what you have to do next.  Unfortuntely there are a few little niggles whereby you need to figure out how the game works, before you can figure out what you have to do... And it's easy to miss a small button, or a blurry object, or not know you have to type a certain thing at a certain time.    By and large, though, it's relatively straightforward.\n\nA brilliant game, I really enjoyed every minute of it.

I have slightly imperfect vision, but it never stops me from playing any other game and, frankly, I don't think a hawk could see the material I had trouble with any better than I did.\n\nUPDATE (Oct. 8, 2017): I originally reviewed this game with a \"no recommendation.\" Changing that to a \"yes,\" but with some hesitation. It really is an original offering and that's hard to find in gaming these days. After the advice in the comments to the first version of this review, I repurchased the game and was able to move past the stopping point that gave me so much trouble. But it's still a bit where I think some will be frustrated, because it's not at all clear that you can do what solved the problem. The same thing happens again in the fourth chapter. That is, you can get past a tough scene, but the solution involves doing a few things that (in my case) felt kind of random.\n\nFor the price (about US$4 when I bought it), I'd say it's well worth it. But, if you get to a point where you feel you can't do something (as opposed to don't know what to do), find a good walkthrough (there are many on youtube.com) and give it a chance. There are ways to do all the things you need to succeed. (I know that's kind of vague, but I don't want to include spoilers. My point is that it seemed to me, a couple of times, that there was no way to know you could even figure out how to do what you needed to do.

That's incuding going back to get some achievments which took about 30 minutes and about another 30 minutes wording things specifically trying to get the computer to understand what I want it to do .\n\nSo it's a decent game, with a alright (in my opinion) story that you probably shouldn't pay full price for because of the play time.", "timestamp_created": 1507398127, "timestamp_updated": 1507398127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35549900": {"recommendationid": "35549900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198425605071", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507616896}, "language": "english", "review": "Its so interesting and scary\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1507395606, "timestamp_updated": 1507395606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35549686": {"recommendationid": "35549686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067306909", "num_games_owned": 307, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507393555}, "language": "english", "review": "This Adventure/Horror game might actually be the best game I've ever played. It's genius, perfect and it just drags you in. The interactivity of the stories and puzzles flows so well it's seemless, I felt tense at all the right points and the story went at such a perfect pace and gave twists and turns that put the Original Series' on Netflix to shame! Each episode tells it's own story, but they all link. This isn't a new idea for an interactive story but it's been done so well nobody will ever replicate quality ever again. Without spoiling it, it's hard to expalin how good it actually is, but I love box sets and Netflix original shows and this beats anything I've ever seen before. \n\nIf you're unsure on whether it's for you I'll run down some basics of the game. There are NO jumpscares, just a few loud noises and eratic light changes, personally I'm not a fan of them so I thought I'd clarify for those similarly inclined. The puzzles aren't hard, but you might want something to write notes on. It's not entierly a text and puzzle adventure, it does feature some exploration to show off it's fancy graphics which are really nice. Finally, this isn't very replayable but that shouldn't sway you buying it \n\nIf I could forget and replay one game, I would always say Fallout: NV, Spyro the Dragon, Resident Evil 2.

First of all, where\u2019s the horror? There was one creepy moment in the game for me during the last part of the first chapter when entering the house for the second time. That\u2019s it. The game it self is an old text based \u201chorror\u201d adventure game however the ability to actually adventure is very limited. The strangest part of the game I\u2019d say is the fact I just don\u2019t get why I\u2019m supposed to be scared. Cause creepy house? The end of first chapter makes no sense what so ever. It kind of reminds of me of the short horror stores in books made for kids back in the day. Except those were actually kind of good. \n\nGame Informer - \u201cA treasure trove of  \u201cMORBID?\u201d Delights\u201c?  Wtf does that even mean? The f-ucking game isn\u2019t scary\u2026.at all. It builds minor suspense, then ends. Nothing f-ucking happens. Imagine if you were watching a Friday the 13th movie, then you saw Jason for the first time. Then the credits roll. That\u2019s the game. It goes \u201cLook something scary?\u201d END OF STORY. LOL. What is morbid? The carcass on the table during the first chapter? Ooooh I\u2019m shi-tting my f-ucking pants here guys. Someone get Cartmans mom down here with a bed pan. The only enjoyable part was the second chapter. It had a lot of promise. As did the end of the fourth story. But it plays out like a bad episode of the outer limits. And not so bad its good. Just lame.\n\nI see people in the positive recommendations saying \u201cYou either get it and love it :D. or don\u2019t Duuurrhur\u201d I feel this game wanted to be to the Stanley Parable of the horror genre but instead it came out like Don\u2019t Shi-t Your Pants\u2019 fancy cousin. If  you\u2019re the kinda guy who liked the premise of don\u2019t shi-t your pants but were far too refined to actually play such a game and were looking for a more elegant version of don\u2019t shi-t your pants. A don\u2019t shi-t your pants for a man with discerning taste. Then this is the game for you. You either \u201cget\u201d Don\u2019t Shi-t your Pants and love it. Or you just don\u2019t. Its not for everyone. Mmmm yes. Indubitably.\n\nFor like three bucks, I guess I cant complain. Do your self a favor and just go to you tube and watch a play through. If you see that and say to your self  \u201cOMFG I have to have this!\u201d  Then apparently you get it. You get why don\u2019t shi-t your pants is brilliant.

I was totally gripped by the intellectually stimulating narrative from start to finish. This is undoubtedly one of the most intelligent and clever horror stories ever told in a video game format. I have a few main points\n\n[b]1. The episodic structure[/b]\n\nWhile there is an option to unlock all episodes at once, I highly recommend going chronologically. The mystery builds higher and higher with each it iterration, the suspense boiling until it hits a breaking point in epsiode 4. It's just one of those stories that makes you go \"Wow.\" This game left me with a feeling akin to seeing the credits roll after finishing a movie like Memento or Fight Club.\n\n[b]2. The Audio[/b]\n\n[i]Music[/i]\n\nThe music in this title is wonderful. The 80's retro synths will make you wish you were driving your DeLorean down a dark deset highway. The soundtrack is very reminiscent of the music in Stranger Things. Ominious, but engaging synths that are straight from an old Yamaha keyboard. The ambient music can also get very spooky at times, with the subdued melancholy piano right behind you at every step.\n\n[i]SFX[/i]\n\nThe sound effects in this title are really what makes it so incredible. From the very start I was already noticing that the execution of sound in this game would be what carried the narrative, and my presumption was correct. From every lightning strike, whir of a drill, and tik-tak of a keyboard, I was all ears. While most of the story is based around text, the finer things are buried within the sonics. A faint car crash, the beep of a heartrate monitor, no matter what it is, the title succeeds at making you think it's actually there in the room with you. The use of surround sound adds life and depth to the what would otherwise be a very simple walking simulator. This goes without saying - make sure you use headphones when playing this title.\n\n[b]3. Graphics[/b]\n\nBeing on the Unity engine, I wasn't expecting a whole lot in the way of graphics, but I was a little surprised. The textures are very clean, and the use of lighting, especially in epsiode 1, are very visually pleasing.\n\n[b]4. The story as a whole [/b]\n\nThe entire story is a very interesting foray into mental health, and the way the perception of reality can be altered based around that. I won't say much here as most of the gratification of this story is figuring things out along with the protag. One thing I will say is that the story is gripping and unlike may I see in games nowadays.\n\n[b]Closing[/b]\n\nI got this on sale for something like $3.50, but I would have gladly paid full price. Devolver Digital is one of my favorite devs/publishers, and No Code deserves nothing but praise for their unique and exciting spin on the horror game.", "timestamp_created": 1507352254, "timestamp_updated": 1507352254, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617678", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35533189": {"recommendationid": "35533189", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041924173", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 238, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507370666}, "language": "english", "review": "This the best game ever concived", "timestamp_created": 1507348825, "timestamp_updated": 1507348825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35533064": {"recommendationid": "35533064", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216537667", "num_games_owned": 1506, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507259046}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]First things first... the game starts with a warning for people who suffer from flashing light triggered medical conditions.

Sometimes there are real monsters to fear, sometimes you end up in their domain, sometimes you're struggling to stop them from running amok, and sometimes they're all in your head. I'm not going to spoil Stories Untold by indicating which road it travels, but I have to be honest that it's my least favorite one. And if it didn't do everything else so very, very well that might be a dealbreaker for me. Luckily, it still manages to be exceptional in every way except its story. Ironic, isn't it?\n\nStories Untold is a collection of four horror-themed vignettes built around interacting with old 1980s-era technology. The first, The House Abandon, is an old 80s-style text adventure played on an ancient, boxy computer. The second is set in a science lab with plenty of clicky, chunky audio/visual equipment to play with. The third is at a polar listening station where you must transmit coded radio messages. And the fourth vignette ties it all together very effectively. Each one works a creeping unease into your activities in different and clever ways, often by toying with your perspective as you mess with antiquated interfaces.\n\nThe real hook of Stories Untold is how you play it. Not content to simply give everything a thick 80s sheen of fake wood paneling and cathode ray tubes, your primary means of interacting with the game is via text parser. Not only that, but the computers you enter your text commands on are distinct entities within the game world. In The House Abandon, for example, you're playing through a text adventure on an old Commodore-style terminal. Instead of just showing the screen, the monitor, keyboard, desk, and seemingly extraneous details like pictures and clocks are all modeled around it.\n\nThese elements are not actually extraneous, of course, because the way this game gets you is in how your text parsing adventures affect everything around them. Your commands are obviously going to have different effects between a text adventure, scientific equipment, and code transmitters, but the story also unfolds around you as you go through the motions of your tasks. There are further forms of interaction as well which are used to great effect, and can inspire surprising amounts of dread in how they diverge from your safe typing up to that point.\n\nAs effective as the moments are in Stories Unknown, I would be remiss not to clarify that they are inconsistent in their pacing and effectiveness. The House Abandon is an incredibly strong starter and sets the tone for the game perfectly, but the scares trail off a bit from there. The second chapter lost steam for me pretty quickly, and while the third has an excellent buildup, the payoff was weaker than I expected. This is less a function of how the scares are planned and executed and more how they tie into the overall story, which for me detracted from everything that was going on.\n\nMechanically the game is perfectly sound, and for a text parser I found the term recognition mostly adequate. You're not going to have a ton of options at any point, so the game is mostly figuring out what command you need to enter to proceed. The third chapter in particular has you following a lot of coding instructions that feel like a play on how linear the actual gameplay is. Still, it forms a natural puzzle system where you can divine the next line to enter based on a little experimentation and observation. I only got stuck on one line at the very end of the game, only because the parser wanted me to specify the contents of a bottle instead of the bottle itself. Overly picky, but certainly not a dealbreaker.\n\nThe only potential dealbreaker is the story, and I wish I could expand on it for your benefit but it really is best experienced for yourself. That's really where I'd put Stories Untold, as a game that's worth experiencing so long as you're prepared for what may or may not come in the end. As much as I dislike the story I adored the retro aesthetic and the tactile pleasure of hearing keys clicking as I typed into the terminals. Obviously if the story lands in the right spot for you this is an excellent buy, but even if it doesn't this is a fine take on a dormant genre that proves text parsing can still carry a game.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

There are multiple different gameplay mechanics, that range from text adventure to point & click and to number puzzling. The whole game sets the player into a 80's atmosphere.\n\n[h1]The Pros[/h1]\n\nWhat I really liked about the game was at first the atmosphere and thrilling feeling it gave you. I have to admit I am not a fan of text adventures, I find it tiring and rather boring. And when the game started with exactly this mechanic, I was not very enthusiastic. But to my surprise it was actually really entertaining and also surprisingly creepy. The text adventures parts have been cut to just the right length, and were implemented very well to the modern gaming feeling. Also I liked that the game uses multiple different gameplay mechanics, that may be all rather simple, but the change of mechanics causes the game to not become boring so fast due to simple gameplay.\nThe story (stories?) are all really exciting, they can put you in place of the protagonist immediately, and most of the time you have no clue about what is actually going on until you almost completed the short story. I enjoyed this mysteriousness quite a lot. \nLastly, I feared already when playing the game for a few minutes, that the ending would be open for interpretation, so I tried to gather every little piece of information and turn it around three times to just find a connection that could become relevant in the end. But I have to confess that I was relieved that the game ends with a linear ending, which I think fits better to the game and was the right decision.\n\n\n[h1]The Cons[/h1]\n\nAlthough there are multiple different gameplay mechanics, some of them felt tiring nonetheless. It was not the text adventure, just to make this clear, it was really awesome. But the number puzzling was dragging a bit because it was so long, just as well as the point and click part, because you did not have to think almost anything and it did't push the story very much. Additionally, the game is no technical highlight. Graphics look fine on Steam screenshots, but in truth they are very washed, not optimized and very edgy. I think there is some potential for improvement. Other than that, the only thing I can point out as a Con is the playing time. I did not check the clock, but I cannot have been playing much longer than 2 hours. I really enjoyed these 2 hours, but I also wished the game would have lasted for a bit longer, left me a bit longer in the dark and tell me another mysterious story. A fifth episode somewhere in the middle would be a big improvement imho.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nAn atmospheric and gripping game with refreshing gameplay elements and an exciting story. It drags behind technically, and can become boring at some points, but for a short ride with this one you cannot make much of a mistake.

I spent close to five minutes trying to figure out one entry, and ended up going online to get past.\n- Too short. I finished the game in a few hours. I really wish there was a little more story.\n- Not horror? I was excited to see how scary this game would actually turn out to be. And I was disappointed. The first episode was fairly creepy, the second and third weren't scary at all, and the fourth was iffy. I saw the ending coming from about a mile away, so it wasn't satisfying in the least.\n- No music. The first episode has SFX only, no music. So I put on some spooky music on YouTube as I was playing.

This game has a great concept (a mostly text based horror game), which initially I enjoyed, as it was a nice change from the horror game norm. This lost its luster for me about 20 minutes into the game however, as typing the same sentence over and over again just to realise I had to word it differently became extremely irritating. This was, like I said, irritating, but manageable. \n\nThis brings me to my next point, which ultimately ruined the game for me: strobes, SUPER high pitch noises intended to \nsubconsiously instill fear in the player, and jump scares (this one is less present than the other two but still a pain). These three elements are present in almost all games in the horror genre, and in my opinion these are a cheap way to make your game scarier. Again, these three things, when used in small amounts, are manageable, but in this game, which is supposed to be a mostly text-based game, they are cranked up to 11. This gets really bad during one point in the second episode. I'll try not to spoil anything, but towards the end there is a puzzle that requires you to stare into a light while also typing something on your console. If you are like me, and didn't get it right away, this can turn into a solid 20 mins of staring into a strobing light while barely audible infrasouds scream at you. Long story short, by the end of this puzzle, you WILL have a migraine, and black spots in your vision (that is, only if you don't get a seizure). \n\nThis leaves you with the option of course to turn your sound off on your computer (which I did). Doing this however, leaves you without any audio cues, and honestly makes the game kind of boring, as it leaves you with a story you can play very slowly (eliminating all \"spookiness\"), and strobe lights.\n\nAll in all, this is a very short semi text-based horror game that relies too much on horror game clich\u00e9s, and is literally a physical pain to play. I would love to play this game more, but only if I knew I would be able to finish it without deafaning/blinding myself.

At first, it appears to be some sort of weird text adventure thing, though in a \u201cgame within a game\u201d sort of environment, as you are playing the game on a computer on a desk inside your computer.\n\nThe game has a very 1980s vibe to it, which isn\u2019t surprising, because it is set in 1986. It reminds me somewhat of the 1980s Twilight Zone, or similar shows; the first story immediately makes you realize that the game is going to be rather meta, but the game has a number of additional twists in store as you go through its four episodes.\n\nThat being said, I use the term \u201cgame\u201d somewhat loosely here; this is a strictly linear storytelling experience, and is almost entirely concerned with following directions rather than solving puzzles or interacting with the environment in any sort of meaningful way. Rather, this is more like an interactive made-for-TV movie, or perhaps miniseries \u2013 and it is about as long as one, too, clocking in at about 2 hours and 15 minutes to complete.\n\nWhile this seems to be a horror game at first, it is not the \u201crandom monster jumps out and scares you\u201d kind of horror, and while the first episode does a reasonable job of messing with you, the later ones become much less creepy, though all of them have at least somewhat worrisome aesthetics to them.\n\nAs the game goes on, increasingly more gameplay mechanics are added, and while the game never becomes complex, and you never really do much more than follow directions, the extremely limited adventure game text interface is actually limited to only a couple portions of the game.\n\nAll that being said, this is a very, very simple game. While this is not a walking simulator, this is still a very narrative-focused game with very little actual gameplay, perhaps more like a visual novel than anything else, though its interface is, if anything, most reminiscent of Don\u2019t Touch Anything in terms of being in a very narrowly confined space most of the time, with just one or two screens of actual \u201ccontent\u201d per episode (though the finale is more complicated).\n\nSadly, said interface is also clunky at times; the text adventure sections are particularly frustrating at times due to the fact that the interface is not always very smart about what you\u2019re telling it to do, and there were a couple points where I struggled to do what I was trying to do due to needing to find the \u201cmagic words\u201d so to speak.\n\nThe only other major problem with the game is the fact that, in the end, the story as it ultimately pans out isn\u2019t really nearly as twisty as you would have hoped based on all the other twists in the game. In fact, I was rather disappointed with the ending, as I was hoping that there was going to be one more twist, or rather, that what you were being pushed towards was not what had really happened, but was yet another lie. Alas, it was missing that extra layer, which I think might have added something more to the experience.\n\nAll in all, I feel like this was one of those things that tried, but didn't quite get there. If you\u2019re looking for gameplay, this is probably not the place to go looking. And if you aren\u2019t super enamored with dark stories with dark twist endings, this isn\u2019t likely to be up your alley either. If you like a 1980s vibe, though, and a darker sort of vibe, this might be something you\u2019d be interested in.

Porque lo he disfrutado m\u00e1s como una pieza experimental, para ver las posibilidades en temas de aventuras conversacionales para el mundo moderno, que como juego en s\u00ed. La historia est\u00e1 bien, resulta interesante, pero la sensaci\u00f3n de estar siguiendo las instrucciones para escuchar una historia 'en ra\u00edles' es demasiado fuerte y eso destroza, desde mi punto de vista, el posible inter\u00e9s general en la obra. As\u00ed que a tu propio riesgo si despu\u00e9s de leer esto te lo compras. \n\n\u00bfDe qu\u00e9 va el juego? Pues el juego recrea cuatro episodios de una serie de televisi\u00f3n al estilo 'Dimensi\u00f3n Desconocida' que aparentemente est\u00e1n desconectados entre s\u00ed pero que en el episoido final veremos que son parte de la misma historia (de hecho hay pistas en cada episodio, pero hay que estar atento). \n\nLas mec\u00e1nicas consisten b\u00e1sicamente en interaccionar con unas pantallas mediante clicks de rat\u00f3n (pulsar botones, activar palanquitas de encendido, etc) y en algunas partes realizar acciones a trav\u00e9s de una l\u00ednea de comandos al estilo de las viejas aventuras conversacionales. Esta parte fue la que m\u00e1s me gust\u00f3, sin duda, pero tiene trampa: aunque el primer cap\u00edtulo (que es la demo) es as\u00ed el resto del juego no sigue ese formato. \n\nEl juego est\u00e1 en ingl\u00e9s y hay que dominarlo para disfrutarlo. Eso no va a ser una sorpresa para nadie teniendo en cuenta que parte del juego consiste en usar un interface al estilo de las viejas aventuras conversacionales. Pero a eso debemos sumar que hay ocasiones en las que deberemos escuchar voces en off sin subt\u00edtulo (pese a que haya esa opci\u00f3n) que nos dicen n\u00fameros para descifrar claves. As\u00ed que la primera pared es el idioma. \n\nOtra cosa que odio es que no se puede grabar en medio cada cap\u00edtulo. Los cap\u00edtulos son cortos (se completan en unos veinte minutos cada uno, menos si sabes las instrucciones concretas) pero hay uno en concreto, el de las estaciones \u00e1rticas, que es un rollo de andar a mirar claves en un microfilm. Y la verdad es que es una pu\u00f1eta llevar tres o cuatro claves descifradas y que tengas que dejar por cualquier motivo la partida (por ejemplo que te llame alguien para ir a alg\u00fan sitio) para empezar de cero otra vez. Adem\u00e1s cada vez que empiezas un cap\u00edtulo te tienes que tragar la intro de la serie y las partes de voz (les llamar\u00eda cinem\u00e1ticas pero no lo son). Personalmente odio los juegos que tienen tan poca consideraci\u00f3n por sus jugadores, no costaba nada permitir grabar la posici\u00f3n.\n\nOtro problema es que, como dije al principio, es un maldito pasillo a nivel 'gameplay'. Me las promet\u00eda feliz improvisando cosas, experimentando... pero en realidad tienes que hacer lo que los programadores han decidido en el orden que lo han decidido, sin saltarte nada. Tiene su l\u00f3gica cuando termina la historia pero a\u00fan as\u00ed creo que hab\u00eda soluciones narrativas mucho m\u00e1s interesantes. Es muy frustrante la carencia total de libertad.\n\nAdem\u00e1s el 'parser' (la programaci\u00f3n que controla las instrucciones que entiende el juego) es muy malo. Entiende muy pocas cosas. No habr\u00eda costado absolutamente nada mejorarlo. Y lo s\u00e9 porque he trabajado y programado parsers de aventuras conversacionales (de ah\u00ed que me interesase tanto este t\u00edtulo). Hay una dejadez preocupante en la cantidad de sin\u00f3nimos, palabras y combinaciones que han dejado en manos del comod\u00edn 'no entiendo lo que dices'. \n\n\u00bfPero no dec\u00eda que lo hab\u00eda disfrutado? Pues s\u00ed, es cierto. Pese a sus cosas malas me aferro a las buenas.\n\nLas historias son interesantes. Tanto las historias sueltas, de los cap\u00edtulos de la serie, como la propia historia final. No son el colmo de la originalidad ni tampoco te voy a decir que te vayan a hacer estallar la cabeza, pero est\u00e1n bien constru\u00eddas y despiertan el suficiente inter\u00e9s como para querer jugar hasta el final. \n\nLa apuesta es arriesgada. Respeto eso. Trasladar la idea de las aventuras conversacionales a una \u00e9poca donde hay gente que amenaza con arrancarse los ojos si algo no tiene un framerate de 60 es todo un logro. Y me alegro que Devolver, como siempre, siga apostando por el mercado indie alternativo.\n\nEs una pena que el conjunto del juego no fuera como el primer cap\u00edtulo.

In classic text based adventures, they had to make it understand a wide variety of commands and give responses to them. If you found a lock and typed \"Smash lock\" it might tell you the lock wouldn't break or you bashed and couldn't dent it. Something to make you feel like you were really there, even if you didn't put in the choice they wanted. And in a psychological horror game, that immersion is vital. Instead, I recieved a steady stream of \"I don't understand\"s. And when the tension is highest is when the game gives the least leeway in your commands. The story might tell you an object is in another room, but ignores your attmpts to enter the room and instead expects you to know you can interact with the object.

Mal spielt man ein klassischen Textadventure, bei dem man die Komandos selbst eintippen muss, mal muss man R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen, und ein anderes mal ist man in der First-Person ansicht unterwegs.\nDabei wirken die einzelnen Elemente nie zwanghaft aneinander gereiht, sondern erg\u00e4nzen sich sinnvoll.\n\n[h1]Grafik und Sound[/h1]\nStark an Horror und Sci-Fi der 80er Jahre angelehnt, \u00fcberzeugt der Sound durchweg.

[/h1]\n\nStories Untold is a game that, at first, feels like a few un-related stories all wrapped in a 1980's visual styling. Tape decks, cathode ray screens and a healthy dose of VHS warping. The chapters each offer a different story: playing a text adventure game, helping an experiemental science scenario, an outpost in greenland and so on. \n\n[h1] So what do I do? [/h1]\n\nTo put it at the most basic, you're playing a game with a series of slow time events. Much like a quick time event, except you need to seek out the information on how you progress. Unlike a puzzle, which presents you with many possibilities the scenarios presented here each progress linearly. That is you only have one way to progress forward. In many ways, that makes this a walking simulator where you don't walk.\n\n[h1] Sounds boring, why would I want to play? [/h1]\n\nThe journey is the destination, as they say. The game is mostly comprised of a compelling story that draws you forward wrapped up in the atmosphere they build up. It's that narrative that keeps you locked to your screen, instead of being a game where you're honing your twitch abilities or puzzle solving skills.\n\n[h1] And yet, the game is rated quite positively. Should I play it? [/h1]\n\nThat depends on you. If you're interested in a solid story, then yes. If the idea of a game that's more about being interactive art appeals to you, then it'll do well.

I think I jumped into this game thinking it was something different.\n\nEpisode 1 was stupidly fantastic to me. Gripping story, awesome plot twist and genuenly spooky. I've never been a fan of text based adventures because I always thought they'd be too difficult to play. But I really enjoyed it, I never had too much trouble navigating the house, although I did want to be more thorough.. like looking in the fridge or trying to find the key to the utility door.. but it was a really awesome play.\n\nIt kind of reminded me of those old goosebump books, readers beware you choose the scare! where you could pick your own adventure by doing different things throughout your readings. It was always such fun figuring out differnet ways it could end! So I went back into episode 1 to see if I could get a different ending by finding that utlity key, alas, couldn't find it and ended up being the same ending. Thats alright, it was still a good story so I kept my hopes high for something just as good in the second episode..\n\nUnfortunately it fell a bit short for me- it really is my own fault for thinking it was a complete text-adventure. Some of the puzzles became not too difficult, but extremely tedious- I felt like in the first chapter I was so enthralled with the story and the pacing that I was excited to see what happened next. I kept pushing through the painfully dull \"click certain things to progress\" bits because I wanted to see if the next episode would be better. Episode 3 had me really interested in what was going on at the weather station but I felt a little held back typing in code that I kept having to look back at the monitor to memorise.. I ended up having to grab a piece of paper from my cupboard to write things down- it pulled me out of the mood a bit. The walking section of the game surprised me- I was bracing myself to be thrilled by a plot twist but ehhhh.\n\nI admit to actually just watching the last episode via youtube- because i honestly had lost alot of my hype for the game and wanted to see the ending, to see if the story was any good. I was left a little disappointed.\n\nTL:DR\nGame is visually awesome, opening of the episodes was snazzy.

I'll make sure to tag spoilers as I go, but jsut know that the entire game is a very satisfying esperience taken as a whole, as well as its parts.\n\nAs for the puzzles, there are two very specific points in the game [spoiler] Int he 4th tale[/spoiler] where I sincerely felt like I was grasping at straws to solve the puzzle. [spoiler] Specifically the first puzzle of the 4th tale, where the solution seemed totally unrelated to the clues, and also when the british spelling of 'mum' affected your ability to navitage puzzle.\n I also found myself trying a lot of words. 'unbuckle'? 'undo?', 'unfasten?', 'unclasp?'. Ugh what do british people SAY for this particular action??[/spoiler] During these times the excitement and the pacing did suffer. Puzzles are hard you want to challenge the player so they feel a sense of accomplishment for problem solving but you also dont want a solution that feels 'cheap', like no real clues were truly given.\n\nAnother thing to consider: this game is short. To me that was a plus, it was a substitute for going to see a movie, and we finished it in one night. I think you will too. This isn't bad. Honestly anymore I don't want to sink 100 of my valuable life hours into a game. 3 awesome hours is a-ok.\n\nThe story is absolutly top notch.

Here's why.\n\nI played the demo for Stories Untold a while ago, and was thrilled by the concept; a return to a classic text-adventure formula, enhanced by a few modern touches here and there made for a really unique horror experience. It's incredibly unnerving and engaging, especially in a genre currently bogged down with \"run around collecting keys and hiding behind boxes\" games (looking at you, Outlast). It's also certainly worth the asking price, even if just to support the concept itself, though I would recommend spacing out the episodes (of which there are only four total), so that you don't burn through the whole thing too quickly.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has a series of what I'd consider drawbacks, that after enjoying the demo so much, left me feeling more than a little dissapointed with the full experience. For starters, it doesn't look like much work was done to account for how the player might write certain commands; there were numerous occasions where I found myself fumbling  over trying to reword simple instructions, and being constantly met with the game telling me it didn't understand. Frustrating, but only a minor detractor, and arguably could up the tension for some people, if you've less of a temper than me.\nThe 'puzzles' themselves can also be more of a chore than a challenge at times, and seem to mostly consist of reading instruction manuals and flipping switches rather than actually figuring anything out, so you don't necesarily feel accomplished in completing them. The main offender here is in Episode 3, which has you reading instructions from a microfilm; even when hitting the buttons to 'focus' the instructions, I couldn't make out what was written, and I'm not exactly visually impaired. Chapter 3 had a really interesting premise, in fact ALL the chapters do, but I spent most of it just feeling frustrated. This is again true in the long, slow walking segment in Chapter 3. It feels really forced, as if it's just there for padding. By that point in the chapter, you can already tell exactly what's about to happen, so it just leaves you waiting for the game to hurry up, or throw something more interesting at you that never comes.\n\nThe overall plot is a mixed bag. I'll try to explain without spoiling things. The House Abandon (Chapter 1) is excellent, really creepy and full of intrigue; seriously, play the demo and I'm pretty sure you'll want to grab the full game, as I did. Unfortunately, I think that's really the best the game has to offer. The other chapters are far less interesting, and particularily dissapointing if you went in to them expecting a text-adventure like the demo, the full game simply isn't one for the most part. It just boils down to reading an instruction, and typing it in or pressing buttons; may as well be some sort of office job simulator at some points. The second episode is also a highlight though, in terms of story at least, and present you with a very different vibe to the first, and a very different scare. Even if the gameplay was poor, I was keen to keep going to see what happened next, and was interested to see how/if it all tied together.\n\nSadly, it all falls apart in the third act. You get another different and alluring premise, but then the gamplay starts and, as I've mentioned, it's the worst of the lot. After a few moments the story of this episode becomes very predictable, and honestly I'd hesitate to even call it a story, since next to nothing happens. By the time the final episode rolls around and you're plonked into the obvious setting that appears at least once in seemingly every horror game, I only kept playing for completions sake, and in the knowledge it'd only take me about 30 minutes. You're given a very dreary resolution (with a few clever exceptions, such as where the title comes from), and some of the more interesting parts of the game end up feeling wasted. Bizarrely, they return to the usually quite liberating text-adventure gameplay for the final portion, which is perhaps the most on-rails portion of the game. I was left trying to find other things to explore, or take other options, but the game just keeps saying 'no' until you reluctantly agree to finish the story. I understand what they were going for here, but it doesn't really feel in-sync with the crux of the story, the 'big twist'. It'd be interesting to take away player agency here if the character themselves had no choice, but instead your character's just a dick, and now you have to be one too.\n\nI would however, really like to commend the devs on the visuals and sound design. They nail the claustrophobia of being trapped at a desk, and this is particularily evident in The House Abandon (without spoiling, there's some REALLY creepy environmental stuff for a game that mostly has you looking at a screen within your screen). The game clearly wears its Stranger Things influence on its sleeve, and more to its credit I'd say; the 80s vibe is incredibly stylish and the nostalgia for old games and horror movies only amplifies what The House Abandon already does so well. It's really a pity they basically throw it out the window after that. Whilst the rest of the game still looks nice, the visuals and sounds rarley ccompliment the gameplay they way they do in the first episode, and never to the same degree.\n\nStories Untold should be rightfully applauded for trying some really cool new ideas in a genre in dire need of new blood. As a big horror fan, I really have to thank them for that, and really hope that they improve on what they've done here, because I really think it could lead to something very special. As it stands though, Stories Untold, feels more like an experiment, one that doesn't have it's kinks quite worked out, and from my view, includes some major mistakes that spoil the experience. ABSOLUTELY play the demo.

The games that described what you do, what you see, what you feel with text only and allowed you to experience adventures with simple verbs like \"look around\", \"go forest\" or \"open door\". Except, this title adds the visual element to it in a way that's meant to complement the horror theme of the strange stories it tells. It also doesn't limit itself to pure text adventure only, including elements more common to something like Myst and even some walking around sections. And ties itself quite heavily to the ever popular today late 80s aesthetic, and quite successfully, I must say.\n\nThis however, leads to some unpleasant side-effects as well. For example, the text adventure parts don't feel like what's a modern text adventure would be, but specifically those early, extremely limited in parser and verbs available adventures that expect you to do exactly what they want. The non-text adventure bits, while at times clever in how they build up to the eventual story revelation and evoke certain feelings, are sadly more tedious then fun. And the story actually feels less interesting than it could've been, although it does tie everything quite nicely and rewards attention. In addition, there is very unfortunate lack of any way to save mid one of it's 4 stories, requiring you to start from the beginning every time and watch a lot of unskippable stuff.

I fully recommend it with the expectation it is a 3.5 hour interactive narrative. \n\nIt takes the concept of text adventures to another level by framing it in a 4 part John Carpenter style 80s horror/thriller world. The first chapter starts off with you interacting with a Commodore style computer, staring into a faux-wood veneered CRT style monitor in a bedroom. The monitor shows it's age by the text bleeding with chromatic arberration (the offsetting of RGB channels), and the sound that comes from the archaic machine is harsh and chirpy. If nothing else, this game is a mood piece and love letter to the time period. The story provides plenty of twists and turns, with easy to moderate puzzle solving. The third episode is probably my favourite, as it gives you lots to do and offers up a small change that really drove home the idea of John Carpenter for me.\n\nAs far as the input on the text adventure goes, this one could do with a bit of polish, a lot of the time I found I got \"I don't understand\" as the response, when it should be assumed that things like \"enter door\" and \"open door\" sort of mean the same thing.

I recommend playing through the entire thing in one sitting, which I did (without any guides) in about 2h45m - so about the length and price of going to a movie.\n\nStructurally, the game has 4 distinct chapters, which appear unrelated at first but start to converge as the story progresses. The game begins with a fairly traditional text adventure but quickly introduces new puzzles and gameplay elements. The visuals, audio, voice acting, and plot are all well done and engaging.\n\nSome of the common complaints have to do with the text speed and parser during the text adventure portions. The text speed was a bit annoying, especially as transitioning back and forth between areas causes the game to repeat the same description - hopefully the developer will add a minor quality-of-life feature to allow users to hit the spacebar or something to instantly complete the text, but as it stands it was only a minor annoyance for a few minutes and not game breaking. Similarly, I didn't have much issue with the parser - it's fairly rudimentary, but as the game progresses less time is spent doing the text adventure stuff in favor of other types of puzzles.\n\nThe only significant issue I had with the game involves a section where you need to listen to and transcribe a series of numbers delivered in Morse code. If you're not playing in a quiet environment, have good headphones, or are remotely hard of hearing, this part can be extremely frustrating because the beeps and chirps of the audio are delivered so rapidly that it's hard to discern the dots and dashes.\n\nI'm unsure how much work it would be, but I'd encourage the devs to add an option in the game to slow the Morse code audio down to make the dots and dashes easier to differentiate and possibly add some kind of visual element (like a small light) that would blink on an off in relation to the Morse code audio. As it stands, if you have any of the aforementioned issues with either hearing or quality of your listening environment, you'll likely just have to look up the solution online.\n\nOne additional recommendation is that you play the game with pen and paper available. The third chapter (the same one that contains the Morse code bit) requires you to receive and retain strings of numbers and codes that are easier done if you have them written down.\n\nAside from those relatively minor issues, I absolutely loved the game, its setting, story, and presentation. If you've seen and enjoyed the show, Stranger Things, it's definitely a worthwhile experience that costs and lasts as long as going to a movie.\n", "timestamp_created": 1499039937, "timestamp_updated": 1499039937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33147654": {"recommendationid": "33147654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016909873", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499022773}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440\n", "timestamp_created": 1499022746, "timestamp_updated": 1499022746, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499570", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33139085": {"recommendationid": "33139085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149037095", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499010730}, "language": "english", "review": "A very clever experiment but not a very good game.\n\nThere's great art direction on display, voice acting is believable and there are moments where all the different gameplay elements genuinely work together to create a chilling atmosphere and put the player right in the centre of it all. \nUnfortunately, none of those individual gamelay elements are done particularly well.\nText adventure bits are very bad at recognizing commands.\nWhat little puzzles there are seem to be designed to test your patience rather than challenge your intelligence.\n1st person walking bits are weirdly clumsy and unresponsive.\n\nBut I could overlook all of that if it wasn't for the story. \nFirst three parts are quite intriguing, each for its own reasons.

(not story ones, but progression wise... ) Tl;dr at the bottom ;) [/b]\n\nThen episode 2 starts... and everything goes down. The textadventure is no more. You are clicking on stuff in the right order and you do nothing else than following a manual. Which is aweful cause you have to switch screens inbetween actions all the time. Then a super short textadventure part starts (that plays absolutely terrible compared to chapter 1 ) And you have to look constantly into a stroboscope light and get a headache of doom from it. (Or a seasure. This is probably the only game were you should really be aware of the epilepsy warning at the beginning!)\n\nChapter 3 starts promissing with an interesting setting, but also goes down immediately. You more or less do the same than in chapter 2. You are following the exact steps of a manual. This time it's just even more aweful, cause you don't have to click stuff, you have to copy text between two screens. And it's case sensitive... This chapter not even ends with a textadventure part, but with a even more boring task.\n\nThe fourth chapter... ruins it all. The first chapters give a great feeling of twilight zone esque occurences. But the devs decided to \"stay in reality\".

And because the world it draws you into is at times scary, surreal, and intense, the effect is unnerving. Part of the immersion comes from smart design choices; all four episodes take place in one location, usually interfacing with a terminal or some kind of equipment. You as a player end up mostly mirroring the character. You search your computer screen for clues as he's reading microfilm, or you're entering text commands as he's playing a text adventure. There are very few instances in the game where you aren't sitting in front of a computer, and so there's very little to remind you that the experience you're having isn't real.\n\nThe generally slick graphics and above average voice acting won't break your immersion either. All of this helps in experiencing a very unique story, told in a unique way. All four episodes are slightly different, and without giving too much away, you'll be playing through them about 1.5 times. The first time through, there are slight connections between episodes that seem like thematic tie-ins, and these connections simply add to a sense of dread and surrealism. The second time through, you finally get enough perspective to see that these thematic connections were surface level. All four episodes are hopelessly tied together, and what seem like partially seperated experiences are actually revealed to be small parts in something much bigger.\n\nThis leads to the only real negative I have about Stories Untold. Because the first episode (\"The House Abandon\") was created for Ludum Dare, and the rest of the game was created as a full release a year after, the first episode is not as well connected to the rest of the game as the other three. It almost feels like the frame story was created, and three episodes were created out of that, and then the frame story was modified to try and fit the first episode. That being said, this doesn't mean that the first episode isn't compelling (actually the second and fourth episodes are the weakest in the game), or that the story isn't able to wrap everything up in the end. It just feels like an episode with less connections to the universe than the others.\n\nStories Untold is so well-produced that it feels like an episode of the Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, and it's almost impossible that the creators weren't huge fans. If this is an homage to that kind of storytelling, then it's a loving one. This is a game that should be played by any horror fan, or anyone who appreciates the kind of stories that only video games can tell.", "timestamp_created": 1498484235, "timestamp_updated": 1498484235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32813302": {"recommendationid": "32813302", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976028334", "num_games_owned": 925, "num_reviews": 269, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498371082}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to like Stories Untold, but it's just not that good. There are four stories in total. The first one was interesting enough. The player is playing a spooky text adventure and stuff that is going on in the text game affects what's going on in the larger game world. It was short, but kept me interested to see what came next. The second and third stories felt like I was doing a science lab in school. The game rewarded the player for following instructions correctly. A lot of the game is either playing a simple text adventure or making sure settings on equipment are correct. It's obvious there's some thing bigger going on, but events that take place don't make logical sense. The first three stories seem unrelated to each other. It's not until the fourth and final story that everything ties together and the other stories make sense. But, this is also where the game completely falls apart. Without giving anything away, let's just say there's plenty of blame to go around. I didn't buy the narrative that is told at the end at all. It was boll0cks.

Everything from the music to the objects that you interact with have a genuine 80's aesthetic to them that just can't be shaken, and this ambience enhances the mood of the episodes, which are filled with horror and sci-fi elements.\n\nAs revealing any portion of the story would be to unveil the master craftsmanship behind the entire plot, let's leave it to be said that this is a title that you should experience for yourself. During episode one, \"The House Abandon\", you find yourself in front of an oldschool TV, complete with retro keyboard, playing a text adventure. It all starts out normal enough, but events soon take a macabre twist. Each of the four episodes have different settings and atmosphere, giving them a new and fresh feel during your first time playing through them. Most of the gameplay is made up of easy-to-solve puzzles, or instructions that are as simple to follow, especially during the second and third chapters.\n\nThe gameplay does leave much to be desired, though some players who find solving any puzzle a challenging task my find themselves more enthralled by Stories Untold. Rather than relying on jumpscares or frightening enemies, the real horror here comes from the unknown and the unseen. The first three episodes are excellent, but the fourth and final entry where everything comes together is ultimately what causes this title to fall apart; some may even refer to it as a cop-out ending to the anthology. It would've been best to leave the player guessing, and the horrors unrelated. \n\nFor its hour and a half of longevity, Stories Untold is a fairly sturdy and substantial horror game. It's not all text-based adventure, as some may think given some reviews and a good chunk of the first trailer, but the title would benefit from more of this type of gameplay. There's little to no replay value, so once it's finished it will just sit in your library for the upcoming aeons. However, if you enjoy yourself a good dose of chilling 80's inspired sci-fi horror, you will thoroughly enjoy the small amount of time that you get out of it.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1498271708, "timestamp_updated": 1513695186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 97, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.882320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32700807": {"recommendationid": "32700807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080446177", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505601124}, "language": "english", "review": "Incredible experience.

If it wasn't clear, there's no combat to be had in the game. Mostly by puzzle solving will you unravel each story, but don't turn away if you -really- want to try out this game over that. The clues are in the game and become readily apparent as you experiment with this and that, make sure you check help menus when they're presented, and if all else fails? Don't get angry. Walkthroughs exist, and if you are absolutely positively stuck at some part, don't feel like a failure for looking it up. Some things can get a lil abstract.\n\nI really can't say much without spoiling except to say, this game is short, sweet, and worth every dime.

From start to finish, I spent maybe 2.5 hours playing through the four episodes available. And yet, those 2.5 hours were some of the most unique and experimental in gaming I've played in years. It's not a title I'd recommend to everyone, but I'd imagine if the trailer, or word of mouth, has led you to reading reviews on Steam - you are likely going to enjoy what is on hand here. \n\nThe primary method of interacting with the game is via text commands as each section of the game eventually comes down to typing in commands. You'll spend lots of time typing in 'look around', or 'go to [location]' and reading the output from those actions via a computer terminal. However, each episode has it's own take on this interaction - from having you decode Morse Code, and using microfiche, to following step by step instructions in how to operate lab equipment. These allow each episode to feel unique while still feeling part of a larger whole.\n\nWhich, without spoiling anything, is mirrored in the overall story. While each episode tells a unique and unsettling story, they are all part of a larger narrative that explains why these particular stories were chosen to be told. It feels similar to watching a few episodes of the Twilight Zone - or watching a horror anthology such as Creepshow. Everything is seperate until you take a step back and look at the bigger picture. \n\nStories Untold also nails it's retro 80s vibe. As much as it tries to evoke 'Stranger Things' from it's opening theme - it earns that right based on how effective the rest of the games settings and mechanics are used. \n\nI really enjoyed my time with this one, and hope that we get to see more from the developer No Code in this vein of story telling.", "timestamp_created": 1497591941, "timestamp_updated": 1497591941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32401480": {"recommendationid": "32401480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071679220", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497409977}, "language": "english", "review": "Four episodes, each one apart from the other in both story and game mechanics.

LOOK AROUND. \n\nAnd one of the commands I TRIED in this area was START GENERATOR which did not work. The generator does not appear in the room, apparently, until you LOOK AROUND, and THEN it worked!

I don't care if it's 'part of the experience', the experience was trash. If you're trying to recreate the experience of playing one of these games back in 1979, only recreate the good parts please?

It's been pointed out numerous times that it's going for a Stranger Things vibe, and does seem to succeed, particularily due to the music. The graphics seem to be there for flavor and nostalgic flair, and they fulfill that purpose well. Alas, most of the graphics seem to exist for the credits. (And oh boy, do you ever get to watch those. There's no saving, and every time you start an episode, you have to sit through the same credit sequence.) There's also ugly aliasing everywhere, but it's not that big of a deal with the retro look. Then the problems begin.\n\nI haven't finished all the episodes yet, but I found myself exceedingly frustrated by the gameplay, and not because I don't like text adventures. On the contrary!\n\nIf you've played a lot of Infocom games or interactive fiction in general, you've probably grown accustomed to certain conventions. These include a certain style of movement with compass directions, abbreviated by their first letter. There's also (i)nventory and (h)elp, and there's generally no (u)se verb. Most importantly, you can play at your own pace; the text updates instantly, and the games often switch to a less verbose description for a room you've already visited. (With the possibility to see the original description with (l)ook.)\n\nNot so in Stories Untold. The parser is really bad and context sensitive. You have to wait for text to slowly roll into existence, and you always get full room descriptions. (Especially evident in the very beginning of the first episode. The description always starts with \"You pull up on the driveway...\" while you do that only once.) I went through the first episode pretty fast, since there wasn't much to do - had it been longer, it would have driven me insane with the forced waiting. The actual short story was OK, but the amount of writing left me wanting more.\n\nI thought the next episode would have improved/different gameplay, and fair enough: it briefly turned into an adventure-game-tech-gizmo-interaction fare, with the player following instructions. The first part here is reminiscent of \"Keep talking and nobody explodes\" which is nice. However, episode 2 also turns into a bad text adventure. Oh, and if you have to exit the game before finishing the chapter, you have to do all the tedious lab equipment twiddling all over again.\n\nStories Untold will probably find its fans, there's a lot of good stuff here. I personally can't stand the forced waiting, especially when it feels like padding, and style over substance. Text adventures got it right a long time ago, no reason to reinvent the wheel. The second episode's \"follow the instructions like a good monkey, in this generic lab setting\" wasn't exactly fascinating gameplay either. \n\nPerhaps the unnecessary waiting is an artistic choice, perhaps it's there to make the gameplay a bit longer to justify the price. But it's there. All in all, the game is promising, but fundamentally flawed.

The story ends up on a really disappointingly predictable note. \n\nI do really love the style of the game and the first three Episodes are pretty great, they do suffer from the problem of some of the worst sins of text adventures sometimes. For example in the second episode the only phrase that will allow you to progress is \"leave bed\" and none of the many other perfectly logical phrases that you could use will work. \n\nThat is a problem with text adventures, trying to guess what words and phrases the devs actually thought to put in the game. It is as annoying here as it ever has been since there are a few times when it kills the momentum and makes a simple task far harder than it ever would be. \n\nTo add to that is the problem that the third and fourth parts suffer from frame dropping and, in the case of the third episode, a crash to desktop. Since you cannot save during an episode for reasons beyond my understanding a crash means having to replay everything over again. \n\nOn the story front I won't go into spoilers and there are a few things that I really like about the story overall (The thing with \"I'm sorry I don't understand\" was pretty clever) but I guessed the twist near the end of the third episode so the fourth was just going through the motions. Even the little twist they put on things doesn't really do much for me. \n\nI can't say much more without getting into major spoilers so I will just say that I think guilt should have stayed on the first set of shoulders it was put on. That would have actually defied my expectations and given an extra twist of the knife. Instead the story did exactly what I expected. \n\nBut yeah, I do think this game is worth playing, there is nothing else like it out there and I am glad I played it.

There are no jump scares at all, everything is pretty PG-13; but the atmosphere, sound, and just overall creepy vibe I found to be very effective. Depending on how long you spend figuring out puzzles, you can beat all the episodes in about 4 hours. If anything, I wish there was more since what's available is quite good.\n\nBesides the synth music and 80s mystery vibes (and almost exact same fonts), Stories Untold has nothing to do with the Netflix series Stranger Things; there's no group of rascally teenagers or the like.

Though short, it is at times player-hostile. For a horror/thriller game, it's decidedly unscary.\n\n---\n\nIts greatest gaffe is including a large number of \"text adventure\" sequences that behave very little like text adventures. They don't respond to any of the typical text adventure vocabulary.\n\nFor an example, here's the first thing that happens in the game:\n\n> The house is grand, sat perfectly amongs the trees\n> In front of you is the front door, and the yard stretches the side of the house\n\nThe goal is to get behind the house.\nIn a classic text adventure game, you might be told 'the yard stretches around the house to the west', so 'west' would be your choice. This game doesn't traffic in cardinality, so you have to try something else\n\n> go behind house\n> go to side of house\n> go to back of house\n\nAll of these act the same as 'go to house', possibly triggering a new scene which you need to return from to try again.\n\nWhat's the correct solution? 'go to yard'. I don't know, game, from my reading of the description I was pretty sure I was IN the yard.\n\nIt seems like the code is just doing simple pattern matching, so anything with \"go ... house\" is treated the same.\n\nThe text \"parser\" ignores traditional text adventure history and instead only seems to respond to \"look at [x]\", \"go to [x]\", \"look around\" and \"use [x]\".

Probably.  But I'd rather spend an hour on each one and be sorry to see it go than be wasting my time and the developer's, when the next chapter is always so reliably enjoyable.

Not as amazing as part 1, but I felt the challenge level was still there and it was great having the reference points that you needed in order to complete the chapter.

Being punished for not writing everything down (and the morse code portion was just awful) I was quickly tossed into the \"SCREW THIS STUPID GAME\" category.  I wanted to try and feel better about the game, but this is where it all starts getting unhinged.  You're completely lost and left to your own devices with little clue about what is going on when you REALLY need it (a.k.a.- you should have written down the first portion of this chapter, and if you didn't, you were kinda screwed).  It set me off and I started to hate this game.  The immersion was gone, being drawn into everything was completely wiped out due to the lack of foresight when you can just simply type in the beginning potion you're given (trying to remain spoiler free as much as possible...hence the sort of vague portions here) and left to rot if you screw up.  By the time you reach the end component I was ready to not even attempt the fourth one.\n\nPart 4, The Last Session.  And now we're watching the train sail off into the murky depths of crap. because this is where the game took an unforgiving dive back into the festering bile pit and wallowed in it because it wanted to try and get something of value out of it all.  Gone was the immersion.  Gone was the fun factor. Gone was any semblence of fun and enjoyment.  Now you're in utter disappointment over the entire final 2 stories.  \n\nHad I expected them to be great games for the first 2, and terrible as hell for the last 2, I wouldn't have bothered with this.

There was so much within this little collection of stories that I adored, and yet it managed to squash all of my expectations in one fell swoop.  Stories Untold started off beautifully, a shining example of horror, suspense and mystery. Richly atmospheric and gloriously immersive, I was convinced this would be my new favorite indie horror; and through three chapters it was, but then it plummets off a cliff with its ham-fisted finale which completely soured everything that preceded it.  There was promise, SUCH promise, but all of it wiped away by an overly dramatic narrative that fits perfectly as a cheesy after school special.  I don't think that's what they were going for, but the irony is not lost on me.  I cannot remember the last time I have been this let down by a story -- it truly breaks my heart.\n\nDespite my disappointment with the overarching storyline, \"The House Abandon\" is a phenomenal piece of interactive horror that stands well enough on it's own.  A true homage to the 1980s text adventures, the chapter places the player in a Twilight Zone-like situation with a narrative that plays out in a very [i]meta[/i] way.  It's creepy fun and definitely worth its few jump scares. This masterpiece of horror is followed by \"The Lab Conduct,\" in which the player takes on the role of a lab technician as he is directed through a series of experiments on an unknown object.  The story goes from ominous to weird to all-out sci-fi crazy at the end, but it never loses any of its nostalgic charm.  Chapter 3, \"The Station Process,\" takes place on an arctic research station with a The Thing-ish atmosphere.  Although it's not as exciting as the previous stories, it's the most challenging in a very \"Please Don't Touch Anything\"-type of way.  Towards the end of the chapter, the gameplay breaks into \"adventure mode\" and has you wandering around in the snow performing simple tasks while the voice overs become more and more ambiguous. Unfortunately, this is were things begin going downhill.    \n\nAnd then the wheels come completely off with \"The Last Session.\"  I can't help but think that the devs were so proud at how cleverly they wove together the story in the 3 previous pieces of fiction that they felt compelled to bash you over the head with exactly how everything played out through their heavy-handed exposition, mostly to ensure you understood just how deep and amazing the game is.  Nothing is left to the imagination or interpretation. Everything that happens in chapters 1-3 is explained away, draining all of the mystery and suspense from what could have been an interesting collage of stories that hinted at something bigger than each individually.  What's worse, the groan-worthy plot twist makes the excellent build up feel hollow and contrived.  Playing through The House Abandon knowing exactly what each detail refers to makes me sick with the realization that these things are SO much less than they could have been.  So much less.\n\nDevastated is the only word I can use to describe how I'm feeling right now.  Experiencing the entirety of Stories Untold is like watching a loved-one kill himself in an idiotic and completely avoidable accident.  It tears me up to look back on the game now given how much I enjoyed the first three-fourths of it.  If only I could erase the final chapter from my mind, perhaps I can return to enjoying the others as a sort of vague horror compilation.  Maybe....maybe?  Nope, it's not working.

That half minute sequence is where the similarities end, however. Just thought I'd get that out of the way, as I've seen more than a few comparisons between this game and that show.\n\nSecond (sort of) disclaimer: I love short, weird little games that you can lose yourself in for an evening, and then never touch again. This is one of those games - expect to finish it in about two hours.\n\nThe game is split into four separate 'episodes', which you must play in order. Each one has different mechanics, but they're all played from a first person perspective, and mostly involve clicking on various things in front of you, or typing commands into a computer of some sort. And, of course, it's heavy on horror and mystery elements.\n\nThe first episode was originally released on its own for a game jam, and is far and away the best. You start off with absolutely no context, or idea of what to expect, and that's what makes it so great. Also, unlike later episodes, it works perfectly well as a standalone experience. And this brings me to the game's biggest problem - the story.\n\nI'm not going to talk about the story itself, but this paragraph will discuss some elements of the narrative structure, which could be seen as mild spoilers. So I don't blame you if you want to go ahead and skip the next paragraph entirely.\n\nThe first episode is great because it could easily exist as a self-contained, interactive creepy pasta. The mechanics are also genuienly fun and interesting. The second and third episodes start to hint at the over-arching story more and more, and the mechanics in these aren't nearly as fun. In fact, the main gameplay mechanic in episode 3 is downright tedious. Episode 4 brings together the mechanics of the previous episodes, and introduces a few more. But none of the latter episodes were as fun to play as the first. As the big picture becomes clearer, the game becomes a bit less fun. Now, I like when a story starts off full of mystery, and moves towards a clear, concise conclusion. And this does that, and does it fairly well. There are no loose threads at the end of episode four, nothing left to the imagination. But the problem is that the actual resolution is so unoriginal, and unsatisfying, that I couldn't help feeling that something a bit more abstract might actually have been more effective.\n\nOverall though, it's a great way to spend an evening. I would have happily played another four episodes of this.

The sound design is phenomenal, which you wouldn't think would be such a big deal for a text adventure game, but it was well worth the effort. The environment oozes atmosphere and detail, making such a 'dated' concept just a frightening as when it was at it's peak.\n\nIf there's one criticism I'd weigh; if you aren't familiar with text adventure games, some parts can be frustrating. Like spending 5 minutes on a single prompt only to realize you were wording your intent slightly differently than the game wanted so you couldn't progress. A problem that can make the more urgent parts of the game feel a little silly as you're fumbling with how you should form a sentence during a climactic moment.\n\nThat said, it's a fairly minor gripe that veterans of this genre will no doubt be fairly used to.

All it takes it is some really good sound design, subtle visuals, compelling story telling, and a really good soundtrack to put the player on the edge of their seat. This game kept me on edge the whole time.\n\nGranted, and admittedly, the horror value deminished a bit for me. That will happen to me if I sit down with any horror game for a long session, but there were a few unexpected moments that brought it right back up. Even though the horror started to fade, the intensity didnt. There wasnt a single moment where I thought to myself \"This is getting boring\" or \"I'm tired of this\". No. The whole time I was waiting for what happened next and it didnt fail to deliver in the slightest. \n\nThe soudntrack cover to this game calls it \"The Complete First Season\".....which I'm hoping alludes to there being more.

TL;DR at bottom!\n\nAt first begins a normal text adventure, which I was expecting. I love text adventures. But this came with a twist. They put time designing visuals and audio cues. Which really amps up the production quality. Even the slightest door creak, can make it that much more immersive. Whoever did the sound design, well done. SPOILERS AHEAD - It is not all that it seems, later on, as you progress. It gets a bit more challenging.  Towards mid/late game you find out more of the story and without saying too much about it - I want to say that I am absolutely mindfucked. And I love it. How common it is to say it was a \"such a twist\" moment. But regardless of that common phrase, it's something unexpected, and absolutely taking it to the next level in terms of quality. What began as a normal text based adventure, turned into an intelligent immersive text based game with an outstanding story behind it. Some might realize it sooner, some later, like myself (for story elements) which is totally fine. The game's pacing is good as well. Minor spoilers: What I find ingenious is that what I felt like \"Oh god I have to do *that* again?!\" or \"Ugh i have to go back around... look at that thing over there...\" or \"what did that say again?\" -- Later on, you'll realize all of those tedious moments, mattered. Things changed. Recalling those previous events showed a level of understanding for the player. I felt scared, sad, hopeful, and intrigued, to list a few emotions during the playthrough. Again, I want to point out how well the sound is. Recordings, transmissions, etc, the quality was amazing (of course, in my respective opinion). \n\nMY ONLY ISSUE - Is the length. I finished in approx. 2 hours. With only using help for the morse code bit. I did stumble here and there on a few parts, which is fine. Challenge is welcomed. I am only wishing I had more. More logs, more chapters, more information. If not on the same story arc, a new one should be created by  the developer, because they have made something outstanding in a market for text adventure lovers. \n\nWould I reccomend this game? I would DEFINITELY reccomend this to anyone who likes text based adventures! I read occasionally and enjoy \"choose your own text adventures\" and found this absolutely thrilling. \n\nFinal thoughts / TL:DR = Fantastic quality all around, only complaint: Want. More. \n\nWould I buy from this developer again? Yes! From someone who hasnt' heard of them at all. They have exceeded and went above and beyond my expectations (in terms of a \"text adventure\") - They showed that they can make something. And that something is of great quality. I hope there is more to come. I've said this already but seriously, the sound is phenominal, really made it immersive for me.\n\nedit: other thoughts from other reviews: add tweaking settings such as optional fps cap - add optional text speed adjustment - press space bar to show all text (rather than waiting, some were impatient, i thought it was OK) - Add in \"help\" text to those who don't understand commands /// seems like it would fix a lot of your negative reviews. \n\nhonestly can't believe some people would complain about entering text in a text adventure based game?!

Well, if it gets fixed, I'll pick it up again - but until then I cannot recommend this.\n\n[b]I'm saddened to write a negative review of a game that is this wonderfully crafted - but I have hope that this will be resolved at some point and I can change my vote.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1490447335, "timestamp_updated": 1490567559, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505232", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30717058": {"recommendationid": "30717058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103266141", "num_games_owned": 660, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490407885}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Devolver'den ne \u00e7\u0131ksa yenir laf\u0131m\u0131 onaylayacak oyunlardan biri daha.Oyunun konusuna girmek isterdim ama spoilersiz bir \u015fey anlat\u0131lmayaca\u011f\u0131 i\u00e7in en iyisi siz oynay\u0131n.Uzunlu\u011fu yakla\u015f\u0131k 3-4 saat, fiyat\u0131na fazlas\u0131yla de\u011fer.\u0130ngilizceniz iyi de\u011filse alman\u0131z\u0131 pek tavsiye etmem \u00e7\u00fcnk\u00fc text bazl\u0131 bir oyun oldu\u011fu i\u00e7in etraf betimlemeleri \u00f6nemli oluyor.K\u0131sacas\u0131 gayet ho\u015f, \u0130ngilizceniz varsa, bir de problemler i\u00e7in sabr\u0131n\u0131z varsa durmay\u0131n al\u0131n.Pi\u015fman olmazs\u0131n\u0131z.", "timestamp_created": 1490408224, "timestamp_updated": 1490408224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571429", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30715984": {"recommendationid": "30715984", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970961025", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490416067}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is superb.

There are some design flaws that tend to break the flow, but I\u2019d say that they account for less than 10% of the experience. While rather short at around 2-3 hours, the game does make up for that with unique takes on familiar gameplay elements and tropes and manages to tell an intricate and compelling story in a very interesting way. Some of the puzzles and challenges, while not time-sensitive, will ask you to invest a bit of your brain power in solving them and it all builds up to a satisfying pay-off. Stories Untold tries something new and succeeds at delivering something fresh in terms of interactive storytelling (emphasizing interactivity, rather than just narration).

While that impression wasn't exactly wrong, the game definitely blew my expectations away in terms of how it'd go about that.\n\nThe production quality is amazing, from the sound and music design to the art/graphics. Each episode felt very authentic for the genre it was trying to nail, and it made for a super immersive experience. The story-telling and writing were also spot on, which I wasn't expecting, but was very, very happy to have experience. That, combined with the game's meta, made for a very interesting time that I had a lot of fun with.\n\nEach episode felt unique, and the game eases you into more puzzling situations that use new mechanics, which was nice. The episodes were all a blast to play, too! The whole time, I was muttering to myself like a madman as I tried to walk myself through puzzles, or cope with what the game was throwing at me. Easily 40% of what I was muttering was, \"What the fuck?\", and I mean that in the most endeering way possible.\n\nOverall, game is a blast. It constantly sent chills down my spine and had me on the edge of my seat as I got closer and closer to the end of each episode.\n\nI did have a couple of gripes though. There were a few typos I noticed throughout the game. Nothing major, but it was there--some missing words or mispellings around; nothing that prevented me from figuring out puzzles. Second thing, is the game didn't lock my mouse in, so I would occasionally tab out when I clicked after my mouse drifted over to the second monitor.

At the beginning the mouse sensitivity was a bit too high and not customizable and achievements for episode 3 were not working but the devs reacted to the community's feedback and just released a first update which fixed all major bugs (at least those that I know of) and even implemented community suggestions like an additional graphics preset for lower end systems.\n\n10\u20ac for around 3 hours of gameplay seems to be a little much but looking at the game's quality and level of detail I would say it is worth it. \n\nAll in all it was a short but very intense experience, which I most likely will never forget and if you are into 80s style Stephen King horror you should definately grab this title.", "timestamp_created": 1489768984, "timestamp_updated": 1511426205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30567251": {"recommendationid": "30567251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059330591", "num_games_owned": 1404, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489702496}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "[b]AVISO: Recomenda-se um bom n\u00edvel de ingl\u00eas para uma melhor experi\u00eancia (B2 ou mais, na classifica\u00e7\u00e3o europeia).

O pr\u00f3prio in\u00edcio de Stories Untold serve de exemplo: \"Voc\u00ea est\u00e1 dentro de seu carro, em frente \u00e0 sua casa\". Caso voc\u00ea queira sair do carro ter\u00e1 de digitar \"Sair do carro\" (em ingl\u00eas, at\u00e9 o momento). \u00c9 assim que a hist\u00f3ria progride e se desenvolve.\n\nApesar de seguir a mesma f\u00f3rmula dos [i]text adventures[/i], Stories Untold introduz elementos inovadores ao g\u00eanero, ao possibilitar a intera\u00e7\u00e3o com o ambiente fora da tela atrav\u00e9s de uma perspectiva em primeira pessoa.\nEm que pese siga a mesma linha dos [i]text adventures[/i] no primeiro epis\u00f3dio, [b]os demais cap\u00edtulos s\u00e3o diferentes e mesclam esses diferentes elementos de diferentes formas[/b], instigando o jogador a interagir fortemente com o cen\u00e1rio atrav\u00e9s de a\u00e7\u00f5es como ler instru\u00e7\u00f5es em um manual, apertar bot\u00f5es, escutar instru\u00e7\u00f5es por r\u00e1dio, movimentar-se, entre outras (procurei ser o mais abstrato poss\u00edvel, as a\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o s\u00e3o t\u00e3o simpl\u00f3rias, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o quero estragar a hist\u00f3ria). Enfim, cade destacar que [b]o jogo n\u00e3o se resume a uma incessante introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de texto[/b].\n\nAl\u00e9m do clima de tens\u00e3o durante o jogo, o que mais me intrigou foi a harmonia da arte sonora com a gr\u00e1fica/textual. F\u00e3s de seriados como Stranger Things e livros de Stephen King ter\u00e3o um prato cheio. A uni\u00e3o de uma boa hist\u00f3ria e uma excelente trilha e efeitos sonoros permitem que voc\u00ea mergulhe em um mundo repleto de mist\u00e9rio, suspense, drama e terror, assumindo o papel do protagonista.\n\nO pre\u00e7o completo \u00e9 mais que justo pela experi\u00eancia proporcionada.

However I don't think it's accurate to call it a text adventure even though some episodes contains text based problem solving. Compared to the text adventures of old, like Infocom's, it's really much more simple and straight forward, so don't but the game expecting a new Castle of Terror or Leather Goddesses of Phobos.\n\nI must say that, even though the game is short, I very much recommend it. The creepy feeling of not knowing what comes next, or even why you're doing the things someone tells you to do, is seldom seen in games nowadays. Instead of focusing heavily on graphical quality and/or action, like many games today, this one focuses on the story and puzzlesolving. Some puzzles are quite tough, often because it's hard to see or hear and sometimes because they simply are hard. A word of warning though, if you don't like blinking lights you might want to skip this game because one puzzle requires you to look into a strobelike light to solve it. \n\nThe audio is excellent and the use of it caused a few jump scares.\n\nThe video quality is good but not like many other games today, although that might be the developers intention to get that 80's VHS look. It is surprisingly demanding on the computers hardware as I noticed considerable frame drops in some segments, and I have a GTX 980Ti which should run this without any problems. Poor optimisation I guess.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was actually the ending.

Its also like 3 hours long and has a really intriguing story.", "timestamp_created": 1489445125, "timestamp_updated": 1489445125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30497691": {"recommendationid": "30497691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024253308", "num_games_owned": 798, "num_reviews": 295, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489364864}, "language": "greek", "review": "\u03a4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03af\u03bf \u03b5\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf, \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03b3\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c0\u03c9\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd, \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b9 \u03b1\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf \u03c6\u03b9\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03bf \u03bd\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u2019 \u03cc\u03c3\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9, \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bc\u03c5\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2. \u03a4\u03bf \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Stories Untold \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b1 \u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c3\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd text adventures, \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ce\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\u03c2. \u0397 \u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03ae \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c9\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03ad\u03ba\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03b4\u03b9\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03bd\u03cd\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c7\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2.\n\n\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf www.ragequit.gr", "timestamp_created": 1489441091, "timestamp_updated": 1489441091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30492879": {"recommendationid": "30492879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029149077", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489129074}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Video analisando Stories Untold.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCv69P3GWe8", "timestamp_created": 1489421753, "timestamp_updated": 1489421753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30490523": {"recommendationid": "30490523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001833599", "num_games_owned": 581, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489705170}, "language": "english", "review": "I first heard about this game (or rather read about it) when I saw an article saying that this game was \"an interesting spin on old text adventure games\". This was back when it was only known as \"The House Abandon\" which was a demo at the time to show off the game.\n\nAnd boy, am I happy I picked this up when it got out.\n\nThis game breaths in new life into the text-based adventure genre that has, more or less, become a niche genre. \"Stories Untold\" is a 4-part text-adventure game (sort of), with each episode having its own story and plot. The game puts you in the shoes of the episode's protagonist, as you try to fulfill the objective of the episode, by using computers or other text-based interfaces.\n\nIf you're really giddy to try this game out before buying, you should download and play The House Abandon.\n\nMuch like old text-adventure games, the length depends on how long it takes you to complete a puzzle or trial-and-error your way through the game. In my case, I was mostly stumped around Episode 3 and early in Episode 4, due to a puzzle element introduced in Episode 3 that was somewhat hard to decipher (mainly due to audio issues I had on my end). Otherwise, the game (I found) was pretty straight forward. The game has a lot of neat mechanics and switches them up. I won't exactly spoil them, but it's some neat ways to play around with the text-adventure medium.\n\nNow, let me put down the positives, neutrals and negatives I've had with this game:\n\nPositive\n- Music and sound design is head-on! Going through certain episodes had me at the edge of my seat in fear.\n- Masterfully crafted plot.\n- Each episode keeps you coming back for more, to unearth the plot.\n- Well done mechanics that toy with the text-based medium.\n\nNeutral\n- True to the text-adventure medium, you'll hit either a lot or no \"sorry, you need to be more clear\"-messages. I got a little bothered when I kept trying to observe certain things, but the game would just go \"sorry, no can do\", even though I was sure I was clear enough.\n- The puzzles in Episode 3 are nice, but I had heavy issues during a puzzle that heavily relied on sound cues [spoiler] for the morse code  [/spoiler] amongst other codes later on.\n- Graphics settings are really lackluster, but I somewhat didn't mind. Mainly cause the game looked and ran relatively nice. Emphasis on \"relatively\".\n- Can't save during episodes. If you wanna save progress, YOU WILL HAVE to beat the episode you're at. I found this somewhat tiring during Episode 3, which I found to be (by far) the longest one.\n\nNegative\n- Once you've played through it once, there's really no point in replaying it. A one and done kind of game.\n- Framedrops during certain segments of the game. I usually didn't mind it, but when the requirements on the page don't seem to reflect what's needed to run this game in those segments, you'll either crash on a low-tier computer, or have odd and awful framedrops.\n- Not a lot of graphical options to allievate any issues related to the above issue.\n- Awful mouse sensitivity and somewhat buggy cursor. There's no options for the former, which made my experience during certain segments rather unpleasant.\n- A minor one: some achievements seem to be bugged (as of writing, Episode 3's completion achievement is bugged and unachievable).\n\nOverall, my total experience has been rather pleasant with some bumps here and there. With some additional polish (and a hopeful sequel), I could see this game become a nice return to text-based adventure games, potentially reviving the genre. I highly and proudly recommend this game, however do be aware that you should probably have a beefy system for the more intense segments of the game!", "timestamp_created": 1489412454, "timestamp_updated": 1489412592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30485494": {"recommendationid": "30485494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046110062", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 689, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518851711}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, love the text adventure, wish i could find more like these", "timestamp_created": 1489383407, "timestamp_updated": 1489383407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30485318": {"recommendationid": "30485318", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062747603", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 90, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489485033}, "language": "english", "review": "Theres something about this game that makes it amazing. \nFirst of all its the Nostalgia. the game is set in the 80s and the music is really good and the game and music is pretty similar to the hit netflix original \"Stranger Things\" really great game. worth it", "timestamp_created": 1489382380, "timestamp_updated": 1489382380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30484222": {"recommendationid": "30484222", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031619339", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489369536}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Stories Untold possui uma jogabilidade \u00fanica para os moldes atuais, visto que ele remete aos cl\u00e1ssicos [i]text based[/i] dos 80's, assim como as tecnologias daquela \u00e9poca.

It is better. The game contains four episodes that are unlocked after completing the previous one. They are different and have varying storylines that the player explores in various ways. Stories Untold is the horror game I needed in my life. Although it features minor jump scares and can be scary from time to time, its unique atmosphere kept me intrigued. While the episodes address different instincts and stages of fear, the complete game is full of metaphors and things that will make sense in the end. The game shows how blinking lights, few dialogues and strange noises can influence your reception of a text.\n\nThe House Abandon starts as a nostalgic textadventure. The soundtrack in the beginning and the minimalistic setting would have taken me back to the 80s, if I had been alive back then. Instead, I was reminded of TV shows and films. The game certainly did a good job painting a picture in my head that was soon to be destroyed and replaced by a nightmare. As I proceeded the situation seemed to become more hostile and I was eager to receive an explanation. I was waiting for a sign \u2013 another noise, a number, a picture of Jesus. Anything. However, the game surprised me an we, the game and I, were playing with each other in a manner that I have encountered seldom.\n\nThe Lab Conduct made me a lab assistant \u2013 or so I thought. The Sci-Fi setting reminded me of The X Files. Pressing buttons, adjusting settings and being unaware of the consequences of my experiments, things happened and I may or may not have been in Area 51. Up to this point, everything is unclear. All I know is this: Something is happening and I am not the one to give in. Stories Untold shows what text, blinking red lights and an alarm can do.\n\nThe Station Process takes place somewhere in Greenland. I am in a remote weather station. I can hear the other stations, but cannot respond. We receive suspicious data and I have to decode whatever it is that we hear. Morse Code, NATO alphabet and a few tedious other riddles make this episode the most enigmatic. You can feel the 80s here. The tension is rising, reports are coming in that lead to more questions than answers. Honestly, I have no idea what I am doing until I leave the cabin and head out into the snowstorm. In first person perspective I need to find generators. Some time later I find myself in front of my computer, amazed.\n\nThe Last Session is the final chapter that combines and concludes all previous episodes. Needless to say that this is all you need to know for now.\n\nStories Untold evoked almost every emotion that I am capable of feeling. It is a little masterpiece that frightened, entertained, and stunned me. It combines text with cinematic and gameplay elements that amplify the experience and create something, for me, extraordinary. In case it has not become clear yet: You should probably invest 9,99 Euro and 2-4 hours and play Stories Untold.\n\nRetrospectively, the game offers you plenty of hints and by the time you finish the third episode, you should have a vague idea of what it is all about. That is to say the game wants you to pay attention to details while deliberately suggesting something completely different.\n\nhttps://keingame.de/stories-untold-stunning-textadventure-with-80s-flair-and-horror/", "timestamp_created": 1488979685, "timestamp_updated": 1488979685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30387422": {"recommendationid": "30387422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003479630", "num_games_owned": 2321, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488961741}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly thought this game was going to be slightly different.

A well-crafted interactive story,\n\nPros\n+The atmosphere is amazing in Chapter 1, and was probably my favorite chapter\n+The puzzles weren't too dfficult to figure out once you 'got it' but they weren't too easy either\n+Not so unique story told in a very unique manner\n+The presentation is like Stranger Things meets Myst. Amazingly done.\n\nNeutral\n=The price is probably high for some, but I found it fair for what you get, and the quality of the story and how it was presented.\n=Some achievements are broken as of my writing this; a patch is coming.\n\nCons\n-The walking segments felt clunky, and there were a few places I got 'stuck' against the environment.\n-Some music is too quiet, and other parts are too loud\n-The microfiche in Chapter 3 was hard to read. While I understand the controls were there for a reason, I still found it difficult to read some bits that were 'degraded' looking.\n-Also in Chapter 3, the morse code segement flew by, and I got it wrong a few times simply because I heard wrong.\n\nTLDR: Stranger Things of video games.

Part point and click, part text adventure, Stories Untold is a compilation of 4 short stories with puzzle elements.\n Being that the majority of the game features your characters using a computer of some sort, you'll primarily be using a keyboard to get through each story. This is done either by entering menu hotkeys, inputting data, or by a simulation of text adventure games, which may give some of you a little nostalgia.\n As far as the text adventure stuff goes, unfortunately it seems you can't get incredibly creative with what commands you enter. Sometimes certain phrases you try will not be understood correctly and often you can't delve quite as deeply into the information as you might like. All that said, the text adventures can be very immersive, largely due to the way they are presented to you.\n As displayed in the screenshots, the in-game text adventures are often not the only thing to focus on. You can essentially leave the game and interact with whatever might be surrounding you by using the mouse. This is a joy to do as it's all very intuitive with simple point and click controls. Often your surroundings will help you with whatever is happening on screen, and discovering what can be manipulated and how you can use that to your advantage is something the game does very well.\n Horror-wise, it can be surprisingly creepy. Whether it be an eerie noise in the background, performing strange tasks or an unexpected response from a computer system, you'll have your fair share of tense moments.\n\n The game will likely take you around 2-3 hours to complete and isn't incredibly challenging, but for me, the unique way the game presents itself, the intriguingk, memorable stories and varied gameplay make it worth a purchase.\n\n[i]If in doubt, download and try 'The House Abandon' which makes up the first quarter of the game.

Things get particularly annoying when the game expects you to type a specific phrase which it showed you a few screens ago and there's no way to recall if you've forgotten it except by looking up a walkthrough or just restarting. There are also a couple points in the game when you have to play first-person walking sim with WASD+mouse and maybe it's just me but the lack of options for aim sensitivity / Y-axis inversion made those segments really painful.\n\nStill, the first episode knocked my socks off enough to warrant a positive review.

It felt very satisfying to figure these puzzles out.\n\nThen the fourth chapter came and threw that out the window. I spent most of an hour trying to get over this one teeny-tiny little detail before I went to a walkthrough, and got pissed at the solution. \n\n*SPOILER WARNING*\n\n\nDo NOT type \"Put BOTTLE inblue car\". You must type \"put WHISKEY in blue car\" because if you type bottle, it assumes you want to pour the bottle into the car, but if you type whiskey...well then you pour the bottle onto the driver and move on. Why only one word works, but the other doesn't, when both words have been interchangable to this point is weird and frustrating in itself. But then, the very reason one word doesn't work is the same reason the other word DOES work. That's stupid, and it feels like the text-based equivalent of pixel-hunting.\n\nThen, when you're back in the hospital, you have to press one of the buttons on the recorder, not the recorder itself. There is no interaction with the orb. You can pick up an object off the file cabinet, but I'm not sure what it does or what it even is. I still don't even know what button you need to press because the only one that's labelled is record, but that's not the one you press. \n\nI walked in, thinking I had to either hit a button on the recorder or do something with the orb. So, I clicked on the recorder, and nothing happened. Then, I clicked up the row of buttons, though I obviously missed the very button I was supposed to press. Then I wandered around for another 15 minutes before going back to the walkthrough.\n\nSo, if I hadn't gotten stuck there on that crap, it's a 10/10, easy.

The synth driven music, the early technology, everything. \n\nPROS:\nStory: The story told in this game is breathtaking, shocking and pays off very well. Being a writer, I'm a stickler for finding plot holes and picking stories apart, but this game gets a 10/10.\n\nGameplay: Not usually a fan of point-and-click adventures, but this brings a few different elements to the table. Everything was smooth, the text-based \"missions\" aren't difficult if you've done them before. Newcomers will pick it up quicikly. Gameplay as a whole gets 9/10.\n\nVoice Acting: I have to make a note of how well done the voice acting was. I don't know what it was exactly, but it made me feel like I was living in the 80s. Fantastic 10/10.\n\nGraphics: Very pretty game, and instead of relying on a lot of special effects and complicated character modelling, this game relys on atmospheric lighting and scenery. The sense of claustrophobia you get in some parts is overwhelmingly awesome. 10/10.\n\nSound Effects: Aside from the story, the sound effects are BY FAR the best part of this game. The sound of the keyboard clicking away (all keys properly assigned; enter, spacebar, etc.), the sound of the old tvs turning on and off, the sounds of the old tech and machinery. Over and beyond what I expected 11/10.\n\nCons:\nIt ended too soon. It only took me about 2 hours to complete the whole game, but for less than $10 and a fantastic story I really cannot complain. I just wish I could keep playing for 2 more hours!\n\nFinal Thoughts: If you're on the fence about picking this up (which I was for a few days), do yourself a favour (sale or not) and pick this game up.

Jump scares are used very sparingly, and always subtly and respectfully. Locking your perspective to a limited view in front of you forces the game to focus on audio and lighting cues to unsettle you, so I heavily recommend playing with headphones in a dark room. Hearing things happen around me and being unable to look around was a great move. I often felt the need to look behind me in real life to calm those nerves. Without spoiling, these kind of scares can only be executed in a video game. To me, this is horror done right.\n\nThe gameplay can be frustrating at first, especially if you're new to text-based adventure games. The only tutorial offered at the start is a line of text in the loading screen that can be easily missed. Acceptable text responses themselves are fairly limited, and the game sometimes completely misunderstood my inputs to do the opposite of what I wanted. Once you get a hang on the game's internal logic, though, gameplay flows at a nice pace.\n\nPuzzles between each of the stories are varied. You'll interact with hospital/scientific equipment, radios and occasionally walk around (though this comes with frame rate issues), keeping the text-based gameplay from feeling stale. Puzzles themselves mostly involve following instructions. While not being challenging, they do force you to consider your actions and take in the horror. \n\nAt some point, the horror gave way to the intrigue of the story. You can figure 90% of it out by the second story if you're paying attention, but the game continues to drip feed interesting revelations up to the 4th story, where everything ties together in a satisfying way. While short (~4 hours), it's complete and doesn't overstay its welcome. I'd recommend setting aside an evening to play it through in one sitting for the best experience.\n\nThe game is priced fairly.

Any monitor we had back in the day that flickered and bounced like that would have ended up on the trash heap.

Psychological horror! Losing your mind! Untold Stories brings 4 related stories to you that peel back the onion of the main character's mind in interesting and strange ways. You find yourself having to discover what happened to you. You are seeing nightmares at times where you can't tell if it is reality, or a subconscious nightmare. Is this really happening? Is this some sort of experiment on you? Have you discovered sci-fi beings that are there to help, or hurt you? Your mind goes through many scenarios in the four tales trying to figure out just what happened to you, and why your mind is doing this to you. \n\nStories untold is predominantly a text adventure game where you enter commands to tell the game what your intentions are. There are parts of the 4 stories, however where you do interact with the mouse, and even sections where you walk in first person for most of the episode. This doens't mean that you do very little other than type. A couple of the stories contain some pretty interesting puzzles in them. Working in a lab using equipment to study something. Another has you working with a radio and deciphering codes with a manual. They are all logical and can be figured out, but they do make you think a little bit about how to finish the tasks, especially when you work with the radio. I found these puzzles fun to work with.\n\nI played this straight through in one sitting. It took me about 4 hours I would guess. I found the atmosphere to be excellent, with the music and sounds bringing a feeling of dread and fear at many points during the episodes. The episodes all work together in some way to tell one story about the main character. You puzzle it together fairly easily, and the ending isn't left open for interpretation. While I am not sure I am fond of the ending that much, the journey was good enough to make me think there was more at play than what the end result would come to. \n\nIt is a bit of an experimental game, but it has no bugs I found, and everything is professionally done. Having much of the story told as text actually increased the tension for me rather than being able to see everything in front of me. So in that sense I liked the format quite a lot and would play more games like this.

That was the point where the game lost everything. There was no imagination, just endless waves of radio puzzling and morse code crud. There's barely even significant lines until near the end of it.

In the limited times you get to explore your surroundings, the game\u2019s fps maintains at about the mid 40s to 60s which is an unacceptable count for a game like this on a gtx 980ti. Also as a side note, can we please stop labelling graphical presets as beautiful and fantastic. There\u2019s no sense of scale there or description of what each preset entails and I think a simple, low medium high and ultra will suffice. \n\nStory and Characters\n\nStories untold tells its tale in 4 segments that last about 30-40 minutes each. It\u2019s first story begins with a young man returning to his family\u2019s house and what seems like a normal text based adventure starts to rear its horror filled head when the boy discovers an old computer. \n\nAs he begins to play a game on this computer, strange things start to happen and a much more gruesome and chilling depiction of the game\u2019s recent events are laid out. By the end, we have more questions than answers but at that point, it\u2019s time to move on to the next segment. Now each story puts us into an entirely new setting and we rarely get the time to connect the dots before we\u2019re sucked into whatever objective we have at the time but the game\u2019s overall plot relies on the underlying mystery that links these 4 stories into one nightmare.  \n\nSure, there are a few nuggets of information that hint at this link but it\u2019s not really till the last third of the game when it\u2019s explicitly pieced together. While overall, the story isn\u2019t anything spectacular, I think this is a game to be played for that experience of not knowing all the answers just yet and just kinda letting your mind think of all the possible explanations. The game certainly gives you plenty of them with the expansion of the narrative\u2019s overall scope and it did an excellent job in managing that scope to its relative play time. By the end of it all, the plot points were covered in a satisfying manner that gave previous actions new meaning and it was definitely a story I looked back on fondly. Definitely one worth playing in a single sitting. \n\nGameplay\n\nEach segment of the game uses classic text-based gameplay mechanics where a monitor tells you the scene and you in turn, type out actions your character to take and it\u2019s good to know that none of them play out in an overly obtuse manner. So long as you stick to common actions like \u201cgo to\u201d, \u201cread\u201d, \u201copen\u201d, and \u201clook around\u201d you shouldn\u2019t really have any problems figuring out what to do next. It\u2019s unfortunate that the game doesn\u2019t incorporate more modern terms like the phrase \u201cflip switch\u201d to do the same thing as \u201cuse switch\u201d but that\u2019s a minor complaint at best. \n\nWith that said, some segments also feature other types of puzzle solving that fit into its setting, so things like deciphering morse code or conducting experiments are also on the table. Again, none of these feel unfair EXCEPT in the last segment where they come back without their instruction manuals meaning there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll fumble around trying to remember how to solve a particular issue. Otherwise, gameplay for the most part is a simple yet effective channel of progressing the narrative.  \n\nPresentation\n\nVisually the game is mostly great with one or two hiccups. I absolutely love the way the background changes as you discover new things in some of your text adventures and the game varies the overall setting of the different segments enough to keep things from getting stale. It uses the text well to set up a word picture through its description of not only where you can move but also the sounds and smells that assault your senses as you navigate your way through the rooms.  All of this amounts to a pretty good horror atmosphere that will keep you on your toes without relying on the tired out tropes like jumpscares right up in your face. On the other hand, texture quality could be improved upon and the game could really use better antialiasing but that\u2019s mostly only a problem when you have the ability to freely walk around the map. \n\nNow alongside these scenes is ambient background music in the form of synthwave that\u2019s present just enough to fill the silence but also soft enough to leave room for the real atmosphere changer that are the sound effects. These effects really are the main reason you\u2019ll play the game with the lights on, from the startling crackle of a lamp to the abrupt ringing of a phone. They do well to keep you on your toes while letting your imagination be your own worst enemy here and when working together with the visual changes you experience throughout your playthrough, they do a great job in immersing you into the horror experience.  \n\nConclusion\n\nStories untold will likely be complained about for its short play time in relation to its 10 dollar price point and while I think there\u2019s a discussion to be had there, most of them neglect to mention what the game actually accomplishes in its 3 or so hour time frame. To me, this game provides an unoriginal but ultimately interesting story with a satisfying end, alongside classic yet simple gameplay mechancis. Mix all of that into an amazing horror experience that keeps you fearful at the idea of a threat instead of a tangible one, and I think it makes for 10 dollars well spent. This is a game that does not overstay its welcome as so many other horrors do, instead understanding its limits and playing to that limit.", "timestamp_created": 1488409855, "timestamp_updated": 1488409855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.422856", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30268847": {"recommendationid": "30268847", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077096715", "num_games_owned": 607, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488349029}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent game with a creepy atmosphere and fun puzzles to solve.\n\nYou start out inside of a house and you discover an old computer you turn on that computer and start playing a text adventure game. \n\nAt times figuring out the proper word to use to continue can be a bit challenging but it never leaves you stuck for very long.\n\nIt bring's a new spin on old text adventure games and does it very well.\n\nI sat on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was happening next.", "timestamp_created": 1488409266, "timestamp_updated": 1499643423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455904", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30268621": {"recommendationid": "30268621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002400485", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488403293}, "language": "english", "review": "Stories Untold is a stylish, narrative-driven horror game that at its best subverts its framing and uses game genre conventions to intelligently merge gameplay with plot development but at its worst can be repetitive, unpolished, and make players physically sick.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about Stories Untold is how its electronic soundtrack, sleek visual style, and 80's tech/nerd nostalgia remind me of the Stranger Things TV show. This aesthetic is one thing the game gets 100% right throughout, even if it's heavily borrowed from Stranger Things. I especially love the TV series-like introduction sequence that begins each episode. The sequence is very well done and appropriately sets the mood for what's to come.\n\nThe game itself is divided into four sections, each with its own theme and play style. Most of the game is spent either interacting with an in-game computer terminal or operating in-game machinery through a point and click interface. Computer terminals are used to play text-based adventure games, read instructions for operating machinery, and to input puzzle solutions. Machinery is controlled by pressing buttons, flipping switches, moving sliders, and turning knobs. There are also a couple short segments with first person WASD + mouse environment navigation.\n\nThe game is at its best when it subverts its framing and uses genre conventions to place the player in the role of its protagonist. An early example of the game subverting its framing (warning, spoilers) [spoiler]is in the first section when the player discovers their father's gift is the exact computer and game they are currently playing in the game's frame room.[/spoiler] My favorite example of the game using genre conventions to merge the player and protagonist (warning, massive spoilers) [spoiler]is near the end of the fourth section when the game begins expecting a very fine level of detail to operate the car. For example, instead of accepting 'drive home' or even 'start the car', the game expects the player to first place the key in the ignition, then start the car, and then release the car's brake before pulling out of the driveway. When the player inevitably misses one or more of these steps, the game smartly uses the failure to point out how James is so drunk he can't manage to turn the car on properly and accentuate how he should not be driving Jennifer home.[/spoiler]\n\nUnfortunately, the game is not perfect. While the game's narrative is compact and well designed and the gameplay shows shimmers of greatness, the mechanics at times feel rushed and incomplete. All of the mechanics and puzzles are fun when the game introduces them, but apart from the text adventure segments they quickly became less entertaining the more they are used. For example, it was really cool the first time I twisted a knob to set a piece of machinery to a certain frequency, but I got tired after twisting knobs to set frequencies for two hours. A lot of the mechanics, especially those used in the third and fourth section, were used too many times without enough variety and grew stale. The first person navigation in particular is poorly implemented and doesn't fit with the rest of the game. As other reviewers have noted, the mouse sensitivity for these sections is too high and it is hard to control without wildly swinging the camera around. And even while the text-adventure portions of the game are entertaining, they do not provide any real challenge. They are more like interactive text cut-scenes than puzzles.\n\nMy biggest complaint with the game is there are sections which may make players feel physically uncomfortable or sick. The game begins with an epilepsy warning and the warning is well earned. There are several points in the game where the player is forced to look at an intense series of bright, rapidly flashing lights in order to proceed. While these sequences are supported by the narrative, the developers should have come up with a way to achieve their narrative goals without subjecting players to potentially harmful rapidly flashing lights.\n\nOverall, Stories Untold is a great narrative-driven horror game that updates the text-based and point-and-click adventure game genres for a new generation. What the game lacks in depth it makes up for with ambitious ideas, substance, and style. Despite the difference in tone and genre, the way Stories Untold subverts expectations and actively uses its gameplay to convey narrative reminds me more of The Stanley Parable than any other narrative game I've played since. I hope future games build on the style and mechanics pioneered by Stories Untold and provide a more complete fleshed out experience, but I still highly recommend this game. You should play Stories Untold if you like narrative or horror games, especially if you can get it on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1488407928, "timestamp_updated": 1488408030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30268296": {"recommendationid": "30268296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052705161", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510526919}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME!

I failed to get the game to undestand what I was saying a few times but it wasn't that bad, though I kind of wish that the text moved a little faster or appeared all at once so you wouldn't have to wait so long for the text to appear before you could type anything. It wasn't that big of a deal, though.\n\nThe one part I didn't particulary enjoy was episode 3 with its clunky controls, blurry images and broadcasts I had a hard time making out, particulary the morse code bit.

You apparently have to type very specific phrases to advance the story. I can't seem to figure out the phrases i'm supposed to type. Got a note from my dad, typed in what my dad said should do verbatem, and still nothing, tried thinking of every variation of that phrase, still nothing. And the other stories wont unlock until you finish the one i can't figure out. Cool beans.......\nEdit: Wow i'm getting alot of guff about this. Sorry i stand by my opinion, how can you tell me there is only one acceptable phrase to use in any given situation. Sorry that when I read something that DESCRIBES THE AREA I'M STANDING IN, I DONT THINK TO TYPE \"look around.\" Why would i assume i need to look around more when i'm in an area that has been perfectly described to me? \"you enter your bathroom, you see the toilet and sink,\" but you have to type \"look around\" to have the toilet paper described to you, even though i just made eye contact with the toilet and the toilet paper is standing 1 foot away from him (probably cuz they're dating now). Why should me typing \"look for generator\" \"locate generator\" \"search for generator\" \"use generator\" \" DESTROY GENERATOR\" be different then \"look around,\" typing that then leads me to the generator sequence, where my only option is to turn it on anyways, bravo you've created this pointless extra text, that is only arrived at, and is completely crucial to the story by typing THE ONE specific phrase, after you have already entered the area the generator was supposed to be located at. I'm just saying, it doesn't allow for very much variation. For example in the car, it suggested you look in the glovebox, if it didn't suggest that, you more then likely wouldn't have said, \"open glovebox,\" (I garuntee 99% of you didn't try to search the trunk of the car, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SUGGEST THAT) so why when it tells me to find the generator, i go into the back yard, it says nothing about you see a generator, until you type the phrase \"look around\". Sorry I feel like it shouldn't have such a lock down on what the potential phrases can be, and maybe be a little more consistent on your \"puzzles.\" Like why mention the glove box but leave the generator thing a mystery? Why not make us actively think to search this other persons car, but  when we are already in an area looking at something we have to type \"look around\" to actually see it?  \nAnd sure, maybe i'm just stupid, but at least leave the others stories unlocked so i can try my stupidity on those, why lock me out of the entire game because I didn't know to type the specific phrase you wanted me to type.\nlol, the scene right after you turn the generator on:\n\nlol, walk in the door, says, there is a light switch. \ntype: flip on lightswitch\n\"we're sorry we dont understand what you mean\"\ntype: use lightswitch\n\"we're sorry we dont understand what you mean\"\ntype: flick on lightswitch\n\"we're sorry we dont understand what you mean\"\nthen type \"turn on light switch,\" and literally it says YOU FLICKED ON the lightswitch, after i just used that word choice.... \nPardon my language, but how the fuck are you gonna use words in the response dialogue that describe my actions, when I CAN'T EVEN  USE THOSE WORDS TO RESPOND TO THE INITIAL CONFLICT.\nIf people are talking about light switches, and yes it is the main topic of discussion for many people in this day and age, they are often throwing around the words flick and flip, why not just make the response possibilities a bit more open. I mean your response system should be set up to just look for a the few key words that are important with the lightswitch statement. I mean clearly the light was already off, so \"use lightswitch,\" should have turned it on, right? I mean it should be if anything, looking for the key words of \"light\" and \"on\" why does it matter how i say it, if those words are in a 3-5 word sentence, and one of my only potential actions at that point in the game is turning on a light (the only other would be to go back outside), its pretty obvious that I am indeed trying to turn the light on. Its not like when i walk in the option was there to turn the light off EVEN MORE. So any thing/phrase said about \"light\" or \"switch\" should have turned it on anyways.

The text adventure segments mimic a 80's Spectrum computer, but the game is very crude compared to actual text adventures from the Spectrum era. It knows nothing at all about synonyms, it understands none of the conventions of the genre (for movement, object inventory, or getting required information from your surroundings), and puzzles are not actual puzzles but a bunch of 'guess the word' block walls that usually rely on you remembering some detail about your surroundings that sometimes you won't be able to get again. Any 1983 text adventure from a real Spectrum completely destroys this game in both a technical and gameplay level, not to mention any of the modern quality interactive fiction you can play today.\n\nThe point and click segments are not much better. The puzzles are uninteresting, and rely mostly on you trying to make sense of small, blurry print, or distorted voices saying something that resemble English numbers (there is a subtitles option, but it is useless, as it works only on flavor text). Hopefully you have English as your native language or a very good hearing.\n\nIt is also an extremely short game that you'll finish in a single sitting, and a short one.\n\nThere are some things the game does right, though. The story is great, and the way the four apparently undisconected stories are tied towards the end is a genius move. The graphics are really great, and the renditions of 80's equipment and computers is very, *very* realistic. I experienced a few graphical glitches, but the game worked fine most of the time.\n\nI find it really disappointing that the amount of love given to the presentation and the original idea didn't follow through to the implementation of the actual game elements.

In the episodes I've played thus far (the first 3), the atmosphere is unsettling and spooky with beautiful graphics helping to set the tone.  Speaking of tone, this game unashamedly mimics the style of Stranger Things, both in terms of visual and audio style, but it works REALLY well.  Playing the game feels a lot like being in an escape room, if you've tried those.\n\nThe first episode is close to a classic text adventure, albeit with a more simple vocabulary.  Without revealing too many details, the later episodes have you actually interacting with the environment around you in addition to the terminal.  In the second and third mention for instance, you'll constantly be adjusting dials, pushing buttons, and referring to references, in addition to typing on the terminal.  Compared to the first episode, these later episodes focus less on the old-school text adventure and begin to add in more mixed media content.\n\nThe only negative point for me so far was a difficult puzzle in the third episode (if you're getting out a pen & paper, you've probably seen it)  The puzzle itself is very fair, it's just difficult if you don't have the right skill to complete it.  I'll leave it at that.\n\nThe atmosphere is spooky and unsettling, but not super scary.  There are a few video/audio flashes but nothing I'd qualify as a jump scare.  There are no graphic depictions of gore in the episodes I've played so far.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game if you like story based games (think Gone Home) that are more about experiencing the content.  I'm not sure if there are multiple endings to the episodes but generally, this is going to be a short, high quality one-time adventure for most people.  If you're on the fence at all, please search for 'House Abandon' on itch.io and you can download the first episode for free.

GIVE ME MORE!\n\nSummary:\nTerrifying, interesting, Inception level twists. The individual stories are a bit short but the collection is great. Hopefully the beggining of a comeback for text adventures!\n\nFull Review:\nFinally someone has taken the idea first seen in Call of Duty: Black Ops and realised its full potential!!!\n\nNot only does Untold Stories allow text adventure fans the chance to play new and interesting text adventures with the benefit of atmospheric graphics, sounds and music, the game creates a whole new mind-bending genre of text adventure where you are within the world of the story as it unfolds around you.\n\nThe realisation that I was in the house in which the first story was happening and the fact that I could hear and see what the character was doing was a big enough surprise, but to then find out that HE could see and hear what I was doing created one of the greatest twists I have ever seen in any game or movie. \n\nWhich brings me to my next point; YES, IT'S SCARY! I've played many text adventures and while the horror adventures were fun they were more intresting for their puzzles than their scares. NOT THE CASE HERE. I feel as though the developers were conscious of the fact that many text adventure enthusiasts would be sceptical of a horror text adventure and consequently decided to make it utterly terrifying by making it seem like a normal text adventure at first, then slowly introducing the new, terrifying elements. I'm pretty certain that for this, The House Abandon will probably be thrown amongst the high ranking text adventures for its groundbreaking revitilisation of the genre (hopefully).\n\nThe proceeding chapters, however, are no less innovative. I won't give any of it away as I've already somewhat spoiled the first episode, but I'll just say that the twists and turns in the other episodes are just as impressive and shocking.\n\nThe art quality equals that of the story telling. The music is extremely effective and the voice acting is also great.\n\n\nThe only issue I feel is present in these adventures is their length. NOW LET ME BE CLEAR; for \u00a36 the four episodes in the game collectively more than make it worth the cost. However, the great fun in a text adventure was being able to come back to it every evening and continue your adventure, sometimes weeks and that's not counting the replays. Unfortunately these stories can be completed in 30 minutes. \n\nI've not replayed any of the episodes yet, so I can't say whether or not there are alternate paths, storylines or endings, but I feel pretty sure than in at least one of them there is more to the story than I experienced. It will be dissappointing if this isn't the case. \n\nOverall, this is perhaps the most exciting game I've played in nearly a year, and has made me so excited to see new text adventures of different genre's and size that could be made this way.\n\nHopefully, this will be the rebirth of a legendary game genre.", "timestamp_created": 1488243439, "timestamp_updated": 1488243439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543147", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30229912": {"recommendationid": "30229912", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002757537", "num_games_owned": 764, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489710255}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]Stories Untold[/i] is a short atmospheric game that mixes text adventures of old with more modern puzzle solving elements.

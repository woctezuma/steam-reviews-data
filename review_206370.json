Instead, we get an admirable and fun game.\n\nSupport for 4K! Keyboard support!  Non-janky controls! But most importantly, instead of another Mario clone, we get what Spores first stage blended with a 2D puzzle platformer.  \n\nControlling the blob is a lot of fun as you hoover up various objects, which in turn makes you grow big enough to surpass various obstacles.    The look and feel of the game is very well polished - most low effort indy games lack this polish and janky controls ruin the experience.  No so here. \n\nOnly two real criticisms for this - the TV screen overlay is distracting, while it adds to the aesthetic, after a while it's just in the way of a clear sceen.   Secondly the choice of controls is a bit off - the apostrophe key for the attack?  Doesn't work well.   Customisable controls would go a long way, but the quality of the game experience overall lets us gloss over this.  \n\nIf you have to play a 2D platformer, this is one of the better examples.",

A questa domanda cercano di dare una risposta i ragazzi della Drinkbox Studios con Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack. Sequel di un titolo rilasciato in esclusiva su PS3, Mutant Blobs Attack riprende completamente il sistema di gioco del precedente capitolo cercando di svecchiarlo e di renderlo pi\u00f9 appetibile al grande pubblico.\n\n[h1]Trama[/h1]\nLa trama del titolo \u00e8 molto semplice: un blob rinchiuso all'interno di un laboratorio, riesce ad uscire. Questo libera tutti i suoi \"fratelli\" dando inizio alla conquista del mondo che si concluder\u00e0 solo quando riuscir\u00e0 ad inglobare al suo interno non solo la Terra ma l'intero Sistema Solare. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIl gioco presenta un gameplay a scorrimento sia orizzontale che verticale che si andranno ad alternare in base alla conformazione della mappa in cui ci muoveremo. Il gioco \u00e8 suddiviso in 5 macrozone: College, Citt\u00e0, Luna, Terre Desolate, Base Militare e Metropoli le quali a loro volta si dividono in 4/5 livelli pi\u00f9 un livello bonus che si sblocca con il progredire della storia. Il nostro blob dovr\u00e0 farsi largo tra le varie mappe del gioco inglobando al suo interno sempre pi\u00f9 oggetti al fine di aumentare la sua massa e quindi poter ingurgitare oggetti sempre pi\u00f9 grandi. Le ambientazioni sono ben caratterizzate e ognuna presenta delle caratteristiche particolari in base alla zona in cui ci si trova. Il blob avr\u00e0 a disposizione delle \"capacit\u00e0 speciali\" (che si sbloccheranno avanzando nel gioco) che gli permetteranno di superare i vari ostacoli che incontrer\u00e0 nel suo cammino: potr\u00e0 sfruttare il magnetismo per attaccarsi ad alcune superifci oppure utilizzare la telepatia per spostare a suo piacimento oggetti che gli permetteranno di avanzare nella sua conquista del Mondo. \nAll'interno del livello saranno nascosti due \"amici\" del blob e al termine del livello verr\u00e0 dato al giocatore un punteggio che varia in base al numero di oggetti inglobati, il tempo impiegato per completare il livello e il numero di \"amici\" ritrovati; in base al punteggio ottenuto si potr\u00e0 ottenere o una medaglia d'argento o una oro. \nIl gioco permette l'utilizzo della tastiera e del muose per giocare tuttavia io ho preferito l'utilizzo del controller in quanto i tasti predefiniti del tastiera rendevano il gioco pi\u00f9 complicato e meno reattivo nel caso di enigmi che dovevano essere risolti in velocit\u00e0. \nDivertente \u00e8 il fatto che si \u00e8 cercato di dargli un tocco da Z Movie ed all'interno dell'ambiente di gioco troveremo una quantit\u00e0 spropositata di rimandi ad altri giochi, oggetti o fenomeni della cultura pop degli ultimi anni. \nAl termine dei vari capitoli, all'inizio del gioco e alla fine del gioco vi saranno delle cutscene, tuttavia non porteranno grandi spiegazioni alla gi\u00e0 semplice trama.\nDal punto di vista della difficolt\u00e0 il gioco \u00e8 semplice, tuttavia in alcuni punti pu\u00f2 risultare davvero molto frustrante sia a causa della lentezza del blob sia a causa dei comandi poco reattivi che, se in situazioni pi\u00f9 tranquille lavorano bene, nelle situazioni pi\u00f9 concitate possono portare ad errori e quindi ad eventuali morti. \n\n[h1]Punti Negativi[/h1]\nIl gioco \u00e8 molto, davvero troppo corto: se non si tende ad ottenere il 100% degli obiettivi si pu\u00f2 completare in meno di 2 ore altrimenti, completaro al 100% richieder\u00e0 solamente 6 ore le quali comprendono eventuali morti o tentativi di ottenere la medaglia d'oro in alcuni livelli. \nEssendo un porting da PS Vita, i comandi non sono molto reattivi, soprattutto quello del salto, e molto spesso ci si trover\u00e0 a rifare lo stesso punto pi\u00f9 di una volta proprio a causa di questa lentezza nella risposta dei comandi. Parlando sempre dei comandi, ho trovato davvero molto scomodo il fatto di utilizzare la telepatia attraverso gli stick analogici poich\u00e8 molto spesso mi ritrovavo a fare azioni completamente differenti rispetto a quello che in effetti bisognava fare. Questo mi ha portato ad utilizzare il mouse per usare l'abilit\u00e0, tuttavia anche in questo caso l'ho trovato un metodo molto scomodo in quanto dovevo togliere le mani dal controller per utilizzare il mouse. In questo caso si vede benissimo che \u00e8 un porting in quanto, questo tipo di azioni, veniva fatto attraverso il touchscreen della PSVita e quindi le azioni potevano essere svolte in maniera pi\u00f9 intuitiva.\nUn altro punto negativo \u00e8 sicuramente la musica: ascoltando con attenzione si potr\u00e0 notare come le tracce che compongono la colonna sonora saranno sempre le stesse e se, in un primo momento possono risultare piacevoli, alla lunga diventano molto monotone e si preferisce mutare il gioco per poter giocare con pi\u00f9 calma. \n\n[h1]Conclusione[/h1]\nTales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack \u00e8 un ottimo platform che sfortunatamente soffre di problemi legati all'input dei comandi che risultano poco reattivi e quindi, in un gioco dove la reattivit\u00e0 la fa da padrona, potrebbe causa non pochi problemi a coloro che si approcciano al titolo. Tuttavia consiglio di acquistarlo, possibilmente sfruttando i saldi, poich\u00e8 \u00e8 un gioco poco longevo che si presta molto ad essere giocato nei ritagli di tempo.", "timestamp_created": 1493334927, "timestamp_updated": 1493335129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31206665": {"recommendationid": "31206665", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120015380", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492460666}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of fun for a simple game, with some challenging moments - particularly when trying for gold medals while being chased by lazers!  but definitely worth a playthrough", "timestamp_created": 1492461202, "timestamp_updated": 1492461202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31200361": {"recommendationid": "31200361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103279298", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458923461}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0428\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 ;D", "timestamp_created": 1492439238, "timestamp_updated": 1492439239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31079158": {"recommendationid": "31079158", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991176602", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491920581}, "language": "english", "review": "A much better game when it's being a puzzle platformer/Rosie O'Donnell simulator than when it requires you to rush through areas on a timer or you need to do precision platforming (or both).

The military tries to stop or destroy the blob, but what fun would the game be if they pulled that off?\n\nWhile the story is rudimentary at best, Mutant Blobs Attack manages to create a fun, light-hearted, but still slightly dark-comedic atmosphere. The backgrounds of levels are full of references to other games, movies, and internet memes. Some work better than others, but they\u2019re trying to create a humorous tone in a game where a silent, gelatinous protagonist attempts to devour every living thing on earth. The fact that they did it without being too morbid is something of a success in and of itself.\n\nLike any good platformer, it features a couple of collectible types: blue dots that really only affect the end of level score, and the afore-mentioned blob friends. The other blobs, two per level, are often hidden away or behind some nasty trap, making them a bit tougher to collect. \n\nYou are never held back for not collecting enough dots, or missing any of the blobs, but they bring a nice little challenge and some replayability to the game.\n\nThe two main mechanics besides basic platforming in the game are size and magnets.\n\nYour blob will absorb office supplies, garbage, food or whatever else it comes across, increasing its size and allowing it to get over or through larger and larger obstacles. It\u2019s very similar to the early part of Katamari Damacy stages, where you really aren\u2019t worried about the final size of the ball, but more about how to get big enough to absorb whatever obstacle is keeping you holed up. \n\nIt works well for Mutant Blobs Attack, and while your starting size adjusts from level to level for\u2026 story reasons, it does a good job of matching the feel of the level. Not that realism is the primary goal here, but it would feel a little weird sneaking around a lab, trying to escape unnoticed as a four-foot tall, spike-covered blob. The later levels featuring the blob taking on the military and townsfolk running in terror are a real treat, and a fun way to wrap up the game.\n\nThere are also zero gravity segments where the blob can shoot a jet of fire out of\u2026 wherever blobs shoot jets of fire, in order to maneuver around. These sections still revolve around absorbing junk and avoiding lasers and other platformer-standard traps, but break up the pace a bit. A nice touch.\n\nThe other big mechanic I mentioned earlier centers around the blob\u2019s magnetic abilities. Fairly early in the game it gains the abilities of an electromagnet of sorts, either drawing itself toward or repelling itself from certain metallic objects, which are always conveniently glowing purple. It works well and has you looking at all four edges of the level for how to get where you need to go, as opposed to simply jumping from ledge to ledge.\n\nThis game started life as a launch title for the Vita, but it doesn't suffer for it. Many launch titles feel rushed and awkward, but Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack manages to feel comfortable in its own skin. Everything just\u2026 works.

In fact you can\u2019t eat anything bigger than your own body, then you will eat smaller things and then growing to eat what before could not. The levels are progressive and clearly demonstrate how the Blob grew. At each stage it is a little higher. \n\nThe art of the game and a lot of fun and fitting to the theme comedy / fiction '40 ages. The animations are very fun and also remind us that new flash style that dominates some cartoons today. The design is economical but very well spent. The background is a show itself: there are many references and jokes with famous games of all ways. I laugh many times. It\u2019s a game that makes you smile! There are also references to classic movies like King Kong and Godzilla. \n\nThe sound of the game is based on animated effects and fit very well into the design. The songs are very appropriate and remind us of the films of the 40/50/60, and those movies gremlins.\nThe gameplay is very well balanced and the mechanics are appropriate and varied. Some stages have vision aerial, other side vision, there are times when there is no gravity and movements are like jets of a space ship or bus. The levels are like puzzles and you have to solve to progress. There are little blobs that you have to catch, your friends. \n\nIn short, it is a platform game and you have to play it.

Then I saw the reviews and thought, WTH?  I'm glad I did. This is a great, annoying, frustrating, just one more try type of puzzle game.\n\nI wouldn't pay full price for it, not that it's not worth it, but it is fairly often in bundles and when you can get it for under a $1, the fun / $ ratio is amazing.\n\nAt the time of this review it was 100% positive in the last 30 days.  I so want to down vote it since no game deserves 100%; but I can't, it's just a fun game.\t\n\nIf your not into side scrolling puzzlers, this may not be your game.  But it is a play this for 10 minutes and come back for more when you need a break type of game.\n\nWhat's my issue with it? \n1) No demo ... that said I believe ALL games on steam should have a demo. \n2) No editor.  This could be such a annoyingly fun game with a editor / workshop.   \t\t\t\t[/th] [/tr]\n\n[/table] \n\n[h1]5\u00a2 Review [/h1]\nPro:\nGraphics\nControls\nGood Puzzles\n\nCon:\nNo Editor ... this game screams for a workshop or level editor\n\nPush:\nNo Demo\nFrequently in bundles\n\nOverall: 5/10 -1 no editor, +1 graphics, +1 controls, +1 multi-Os, +1 often in bundles = 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1463977359, "timestamp_updated": 1463977814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22998234": {"recommendationid": "22998234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056680830", "num_games_owned": 393, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496771120}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the perfect example of what I would call a \"podcast game\"; a game that you can play without paying too much attention with satisfying mechanics", "timestamp_created": 1463314394, "timestamp_updated": 1463314394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22827903": {"recommendationid": "22827903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218213168", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 269, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462626529}, "language": "english", "review": "There's nothing more satisfying than growing into an enourmous blob and consuming the galaxy.\n", "timestamp_created": 1462547142, "timestamp_updated": 1462547142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22800613": {"recommendationid": "22800613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090925480", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 318, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437399870}, "language": "english", "review": "Blobs :3.", "timestamp_created": 1462394968, "timestamp_updated": 1462394968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22570085": {"recommendationid": "22570085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257365479", "num_games_owned": 930, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459369775}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice casual game, graphics & controls are smooth, quite short though, around 5..6 hours.

Conquering an area is followed by a little newscast vignette, showing those yet to be consumed in increasing stages of panic. Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack creates the feeling of playing an old horror movie complete with dust-cracked edges (just like the CRTV you'd have to watch it on). The bonus levels delve further into this 'blast from the past' aesthetic by mimicking older game experiences. The change of play style that the bonus levels offer is also a welcome change of pace from the series of similar set pieces positioned around the very basic goal of growing larger and moving to the right. \nThe game has a keyboard and mouse control scheme that is more than functional, but clearly it was designed around a console as a controller offers greater precision. Oddly enough, there is still one mechanic that the mouse served better for which makes the ability to switch between the two control schemes on a whim an absolute boon. The point system is similarly flexible as it presents an incentive to be meticulous and thus makes things more difficult without punishing players that choose to take an easier way out.

This setup sometimes encourages you to explore, and sometimes you may have to solve a small puzzle to get stuff to absorb.\n\nThis game does have challenges though, you may have to avoid being hit by Army helicopters or tanks, or you may have to precariously avoid spikes, or you may sometimes have to outrun lasers, while performing other tasks, such as collecting objects to absorb or rotating something to pass.\n\nAnother mechanic are the powers, you can have Rocket Boosts, which offer air mobility, sometimes to collect out of reach items or escape a laser. You also have magnetism, which helps you attach to surfaces and avoid obstacles. Then you have telekenesis, which let's you open up paths, move objects, or launch yourself.\n\nThe music in this game kinda gave me a Rayman Origins feel at times, I have no idea why, but it was enjoyable to listen to. The graphics vary in style, one minute, you can go from an 80's/90's style to a pixellated style.\n\nThe game overall is kinda short, even if you try to get all the achievements and 100% the game.

The fact that the main character is a blob is pretty much where the similarities end though. Gish has a more elegant design, you control a physical object in all ways possible, angular momentum, rigidness, roughness etc and the whole gameplay was around that. Here things are more traditional. The controls are similar to any platformer except your character is a soft body. But this is a good thing! It means this game is doing its own thing, and succeeding, in my opinion.\n\nMutant Blobs is a very casual game that presents just enough challenge so you don't get bored. And most of the level design tries to throw fun things at you, I like that. Stuff that doesn't really qualify as a platform challenge or a puzzle, but it's still pleasuresome to do, like run through corridor eating stuff or get sucked into a pipe and watching the blob flow (reminiscent of Sonic loops and tunnels).\n\nI love how the game looks. The cutscenes are funny.\n\nThere is a gimmick where you grow as you play the game, but it's usually just cosmetic (hence the term gimmick).\n\nNot much more to say.

As you get bigger, the world starts looking a little bit smaller and you go from absorbing crumbs to helicopters. The movement is wobbly but flowing and the puzzles aren't something you'll get stuck on.\n\nThe problem is that you've played this before. It's a physics-based, platform game with the odd puzzle thrown in for good measure. You start at one end of the level and you have to get to the other by unlocking doors/gates. You run, jump and use movement powers to get by. The fact you get bigger doesn't add much to the gameplay as you never 'feel' bigger as the levels zoom out and the blob's size seems to fluctuate between levels. For example, I spent most of the game going from 2m to 7m tall and back again until the last chapter where you sudden become 50m tall. \n\nSo it's all been done before and the main gimmick of the game isn't enough for it to be all that fun. Not to mention that the game is extremely short as I managed to finish it in 2 hours (each level is about 5 minutes long).

You're a Big, Green and Growing Alien Blob. Yet You're Still Cute.[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Genre: 2D Physics Platformer\n[*]Developed & Published by: DrinkBox Studios\n[*]Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux, PS3, Xbox 360 and PS Vita.\n[*]Business Model: Base Game\n[*][i]Copy Purchased by Myself[/i] \n[/list]\n[b]Overall Gameplay Thoughts[/b]\nTales from Space: Mutant Blob Attacks is a side-scrolling 2D physics platformer where you take control of an ever-growing alien blob that consumes everything in its path. The main mechanic of Tales is the blob, which rolls around consuming objects and people in the level. This allows the blob to grow bigger and get past a series of obstacles on each level. It\u2019s certainly a different mechanic from most platformers though I mostly have a neutral opinion on it. It works for this game. This is not a one-hit-die platformer so you can take multiple hits before popping. You\u2019ll heal at checkpoints scattered about the level. The blob can also jump, smash to the ground as well as use telekinetic and magnetic powers to get around. All of which will be used to get past a series of increasingly-difficult series of obstacles. This helps keep the gameplay different each level. The main campaign is a decent feature of 24 fairly challenging levels. Every five or so levels are set in a differently themed area, featuring backgrounds with army bases, the moon and college dorm rooms. It\u2019s cutesy and littered with references to other games, YouTubers and movies. The story itself is very limited, with some cutscenes only vaguely describing what\u2019s going on. \n\n[b]The Platforming[/b]\nIt\u2019s not my favorite kind of platforming. There\u2019s a bit too much trial and error challenge for my liking as you try to get past obstacles using the game\u2019s physics. I often found myself stuck in an area due to my own ineptitude and the game\u2019s challenge. It doesn\u2019t demand pixel-perfection such as the Giana Sisters but it does demand your attention. The twenty four levels almost outstay their welcome for me they do have a decent enough variety to keep them from being boring. I did find some of the telekinesis parts a bit overly frustrating though. However, the bonus levels that had you controlling the blob from a top-down perspective were pretty neat. \n\n[b]PC Settings[/b]\n2D Platformers don\u2019t need much to get by. But Mutant Blobs Attack has what it needs and then some. Music and Sound sliders are here. Controller vibration can be disabled. There\u2019s a \u201cCPU Performance\u201d slider that goes low or high which will be useful for low-end rigs. A decent amount of resolution options, full screen and v-sync are here as well. Anti-Aliasing can be enabled/disabled. Otherwise, the game was very stable when I played it and I didn\u2019t notice any issues. Music is a...weird quirky tune that fits in with the 50s aesthetic they went for. I\u2019m not a fan of the 50s era aesthetic but it does work here. A controller is recommended for the best experience but keyboard and mouse is usable. \n\n[b]Final Thoughts[/b]\nI personally didn\u2019t enjoy my time with Tales from Space: Mutant Blob Attacks. This genre hasn\u2019t been appealing to me much lately and Tales doesn\u2019t change that. [u]But[/u], if you do like platformers, Mutant Blob Attacks is definitely worth getting. The platforming is very solid with plenty of variety for such a short title. Additionally, the charm it displays is hard to ignore. I\u2019m not usually a fan of the 50s aesthetic but it works for this one. If you want something that\u2019s cutesy yet still challenging, I don\u2019t think you can go wrong with this game. \n\n[b][url=http://kingisaaclinksr.com/2015/06/07/a-paladins-steam-review-tales-from-space-mutant-blob-attacks-youre-a-big-green-and-growing-alien-blob-yet-youre-still-cute/]Read this and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[/url][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1433709513, "timestamp_updated": 1449778004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522293", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16246785": {"recommendationid": "16246785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008813387", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435694201}, "language": "french", "review": "Un jeu de plateforme tr\u00e8s sympathique.

While there are puzzles to be found in this physics platformer, none pose more than a few minutes of challenge to figure them out, as the main draw is simple catharsis of consuming the planet. There is a bit of challenge to be found in the secondary task to find your friends (and eat them), but most can be found fairly easy and only occassionally serve any real challenge. Making this sound like a bad thing is rather foolish of me, as this game is meant to be enjoyed for what it is. Given how this is pre-Guacamelee Drinkbox, I loved seeing their roots and their love of reference-filled billboards clearly has been an ongoing gag of theirs.

It boils down to a short-but-sweet casual experience that will entertain, slightly challenge, and not frustrate. \n\nThe game is extremely light-hearted and is very casual.  The levels are pretty short and simple.  That being said, I really enjoyed the level design in this game: you have to pay attention but you don\u2019t really have to [i]think[/i].  It\u2019s a nice experience: it mildly challenges (mostly only if you\u2019re going for the gold medals), has plenty of checkpoints, and there are no overly frustrating parts.  As someone who prefers casual games to frustrating ones; I can say I really enjoyed this.   If you are someone who enjoys punishment from their games, you may want to look elsewhere.\n\nThere is no real story or anything, but it doesn\u2019t need a story.  There are a few catoon-esque cutscenes.  The cartoonish art style and the music are a perfect match to the gameplay.  The platforming was smooth for me; I used a controller and was never frustrated with controls/response.  It is a short game, and is pretty easy to 100%.  As you progress, there are a handful of platforming mechanics that are mixed around to keep thinks interesting.\n\nTo surmise: [b]Mutant Blobs Attack[/b] is a casual platformer with mild puzzle aspects and a cartoon finish.  A short-medium length game that is pretty easy, yet very entertaining.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1421898759, "timestamp_updated": 1449516418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14062964": {"recommendationid": "14062964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114833143", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 580, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430842237}, "language": "english", "review": "eat everything can make you bigger and bigger\n\n\ni love that game", "timestamp_created": 1421654327, "timestamp_updated": 1421654327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14062736": {"recommendationid": "14062736", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023645303", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415671209}, "language": "english", "review": "Tales of a big asshole: wonderful rainbow romp is probably terrible.

That said, the art design is great, creating a fun and interesting visual look that takes what could easily be a bland looking game and pushes it above other budget titles. The developers found the look that worked for them and took full advantage of it.\n\n+/- Controls are fairly basic but control well. Rarely did I ever feel that I failed because the game didn't respond to my inputs correctly. Basic platforming is fun and responsive, but while the game adds some variety to basic gameplay, never really grows beyond its basic premise.\n\n+/- Puzzles and minigames give you some breaks from traditional platforming. The minigames are well done, if way too easy, as they re-imagine the game as an 8 bit top down arcade game.

Whereas the later could be described as the ultimate chill game full of wacky Japanese humor, this is more of a traditional puzzle-platformer based around using your weird mutant blob powers to avoid ever-present death. \"Eating\" is only present as a way to bypass roadblocks in your\u00a0quest to get from point A to point B.\n\nFirst of all, check the amount of time I've spent into this game and divide that by two: that's a good estimate on the amount of time\u00a0you'll invest. I'm a completionist who spent way too much effort\u00a0trying to complete some of the more frustrating jumps,\u00a0hence why it's over five hours. Check with\u00a0other reviewers if you don't believe me:\u00a0[b]Tales from Space: When Mutant Blobs\u00a0Attacks[/b] is quite short, undoubtedly the shortest game for me to complete in my library. Compounding\u00a0this problem is how little there is for you to do: apart from the\u00a0jumping around and a dive move, you only have [u]three[/u] gameplay mechanics. Shoulder buttons control the Magnetize and the Telekinesis powers, and on certain stages you gain rocket powers.\u00a0The game is imaginative enough in finding enough challenges for these abilities but compared to other products\u00a0from [b]Lunchbox Games[/b] (and particularly\u00a0[b]Guacamelee[/b]), this seems incredibly limited.\n\nEnjoyment of the actual product is a mixed bag. On one hand, I [i]really[/i] want to congratulate the person in charge of the physics engine. From the\u00a0soft physics of your mutant blob to the inertia produced by your rocket travels to the orbiting of magnetic bodies,\u00a0everything [i]feels[/i] great. If there's a failing, it'd be in the actual platforming. 97% of the time it works fine (if not a bit floaty); it's that last 3%, the jumps required for some of the hidden blob\u00a0friends that are simply bullshit. It's so frustrating looking over the solution online, know what you have to do, then fail repeatedly because the theory doesn't follow practice. I'm not going to downvote a game for a couple of bullshit jumps but it needs to be said that some platforming depends on ridiculous\u00a0edge-of-platform running jumps that simply don't work, or a\u00a0\"magnetized-bouncy-super-high-jump\" technique... Yeah, this review doesn't\u00a0make it easy for the prospective\u00a0buyer to understand so let's just leave it at \"bullshit jumps\".\n\nThis game is both easier and more frustrating than [b]Guacamelee[/b]. Those who've played\u00a0the lucha libre Metroidvania will get to\u00a0reexperience the furious shoulder button pressing extravaganza\u00a0needed\u00a0to bypass treacherous areas\u00a0all over again.\u00a0Puzzle-wise you have your blob use its telekinesis powers to move platforms around, the solution to which shouldn't take more than a few minutes to discover.\u00a0There's very little replay value because the game offers so very little in the first place:\u00a0[b]Tales from Space: When Mutant Blobs Attacks[/b]\u00a0has the least amount of Achievements in my library and\u00a0only offers a leaderboard in terms of additional content.\n\nI never paid any monies for this product, having won it off the Steam winter auction at a little over 1000 gems.

The blob utilizes all that it is capable of, including its platforming skills and low viscosity in order to maneuver through various areas of different shapes and sizes. It even later uses magnetism and telekinesis to manipulate terrain. The game provides over twenty-five levels spread through six areas to play through. (This level count includes a number of minigame levels, which are notably shorter than main levels.)\n\nThe game is satisfying to play. Despite the fact that the blob never talks or expresses thought, players will still connect to the amorphous creature - its progressive growth, guided by the player, makes the player feel somewhat like a parent to the creature. Further satisfaction comes from being able to easily devour objects which were insurmountable in earlier worlds. Bright colors and a bouncy soundtrack layer the game into being a cartoon-like experience. This shouldn't be conveyed as a turn-off to older or more mature gamers; rather, it should simply mean that the game is lighthearted.\n\nGameplay functionality varies between game modes. The majority of levels, the side-scrolling platformer sections, are effective. Controls are tight and responsive, leaving the majority of blame for damage on the player. Wall-jump mechanics are a noted exception, though this does not hinder core gameplay much. Airborne sections of the game are less effective. The propulsion systems on the character are too imprecise for slight movement, which when combined with obstacles that require finesse to maneuver around leads to frustrating experiences in this mode. The third game mode, the top-down mode, functions well, and its visual differentiation from the rest of the game just makes these sections even more pleasing than they already are.\n\nFor how much fun this game is, it will not last. The whole game can be completed in around three hours. Additionally, the game is quite easy throughout. For the few sections which provide ample difficulty, players will receive a notification from the game with a tip - even further simplifying the game, despite being a useful mechanic. The single-player campaign is the only mode in the game - having some sort of multiplayer mode, whether that be in the form of competitive races, a vs. mode, or co-op levels, would have increased the longetivity of the game significantly. Some replayability comes from retrying the levels to earn gold medals or find the two blob friends that are hidden in each area, but with only 24 levels the experience could become monotonous for some players. With such an easy difficulty and a cartoony interface, younger players may find the best experience with this game.\n\n[i]Mutant Blobs Attack[/i] is a great game that's been reduced to a good game. With such little material contained in the game itself, gamers should consider whether their money is spent better with a lengthier experience. For what this does contain, though, it is a gratifying adventure that will stroke the supervillain in players and will entertain throughout its duration.

Korken verhindern, dass man weiter im Level fortschreitet ohne eine gewisse Gr\u00f6\u00dfe erlangt zu haben, die sich jedoch scheinbar v\u00f6llig willk\u00fcrlich zu Beginn eines neuen Levels \u00e4ndert. Das irritiert mich. Wozu dann \u00fcberhaupt nach allen essbaren Gegenst\u00e4nden suchen? F\u00fcr die Punkte? Wen interessieren die schei\u00df Punkte?\n\"Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack\" ist sicher nicht das schlechteste Spiel der Welt und ich kann mir vorstellen, dass es eine Menge Leute m\u00f6gen. Das ist ok. Denen werde ich keine Geschmacksverirrung attestieren.

I liked the level of creativity involved, but my main gripe with the game is it is very short and overall pretty easy.  There are some frustratingly difficult parts while the rest of it is a breeze.  But, there are always ways to further challenge yourself if you want to.\n\nThe blob you play as is a little too conveniently powerful.  There should be penalties to some things you eat, and your special abilities should occur due to things you eat.  Instead, you just always have them.  The only incentive to eat in this game is to become bigger and for score, otherwise, there's no point.\n\nThe artistic style and music is definitely interesting, but I wish there were more songs.  The way the game scales everything as you get bigger is a nice touch, but you are considerably downsized every time you start a new level.

The plot is as simple as the mechanics: absorb everything! From pretty much the beginning, you are on a constant quest for things smaller than you so you can grow. You start out eating paper clips and hamburgers and end up with tanks and even larger things (no, I won't spoil it). It's basic fun, really. Especially when humans start noticing you and try to stop you.\n\nStill...though it has some not-too-easy segments, the overall isn't very challenging. Aside from the basic search-and-absorb and a slam down attack (if you want to call it that), you have magnetic powers that attract or retract you. It has some moments (think Mario Galaxy), but IMHO not really enough to carry the entire game. I played through it in 3.5 hours and kept playing mostly for the (hilarious) cutscenes, the billboards with winks to other games and the music (which is great).\n\nOverall...I'd say it's about 7 out of 10. It probably doesn't help that I've played this after Guacamelee gold (which is Drinkbox's later game), which has stuff that I found missing here (like a boss fight here and there...and more a sense of growth in abilities).

You control a blob, I don't think he, she or it is given a name at any point, but for the purposes of this review I shall call him Steve... Steve DeBlob. Though as far as I know he isn't any relation to the blob from De Blob, that platforming, paint-'em-up classic, though I could be wrong. Instead, Steve DeBlob is a translucent, green blob with one eye who rolls through various 2D environments overcoming obstacles and gathering up ever bigger items to increase his size as he exacts his revenge against his human captors, and ultimately humanity as a whole. Sort of like a cross between Katamari Damacy, the underrated Puddle and that movie where the guy goes mental and kills everybody... you know the one I mean, right?\n\nBoth the platforming and puzzles are fairly easy affairs to begin with, maybe even a little tedious in their initial simplicity, but the difficulty level is judged almost perfectly as it ramps up at a steady and satisfying pace over the twenty-four levels. New elements of gameplay are gradually added to the mix, like the ability to move select platforms around with the cursor or being able to attract and repel Mr. DeBlob from certain structures, which nicely expands the range and complexity of puzzles that are thrown at you. But still, with little punishment for failure and a very forgiving checkpoint system, the majority of players won't be massively challenged for the most part, except maybe if you're a completionist intent on collecting everything, unlocking achievements or troubling the leaderboards, and depending on which of these players you are you'll likely make your way to the end in about four to six hours.\n\nBonus kudos has to go to the end game, though. Most of the time your reward for completing a game will be a fancy cutscene wrapping up the story, but here it's done a little differently. There are six chapters to tackle, with the first five incrementally increasing in difficulty, but by the sixth it shifts gears and becomes much easier while focusing everything on a different aspect rather than challenge... FUN. By the beginning of chapter six you've more or less beaten the game since you've made your way through the hardest parts and have essentially become a badass that can just stomp and roll your way through the stages with relatively little effort. So instead of having to endure one final, ultimate obstacle to prove your mastery of the game, your reward in place of a cutscene is to enjoy your power as you decimate everything in your path. It's a great way to end your time with any title and I really wish more games would follow this design, especially with the very last stage being a particularly great pay-off for all your work, and with the cherry on top being the sweet asking price, there's little excuse to not go and make friends with Steve DeBlob right now.", "timestamp_created": 1387048904, "timestamp_updated": 1387048904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7990622": {"recommendationid": "7990622", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105299280", "num_games_owned": 651, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1387375369}, "language": "russian", "review": "If you want eat everything and be a giant monster - this game for you!", "timestamp_created": 1386659030, "timestamp_updated": 1386659030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479628", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7987685": {"recommendationid": "7987685", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079340344", "num_games_owned": 695, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 780, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1390882819}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute game-hard with the keyboard-great humor and a must for puzzle platform fans...just use a controller...my game game is on you tube and I actually was able to beat this one-so yeah-great cute game that held my interest long enough to finish.", "timestamp_created": 1386632999, "timestamp_updated": 1386632999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7968783": {"recommendationid": "7968783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088230633", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388033679}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u521b\u610f\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5403\u4e1c\u897f\u6765\u53d8\u5927\u5f88\u6709\u60f3\u6cd5", "timestamp_created": 1386509430, "timestamp_updated": 1386509430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7960434": {"recommendationid": "7960434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060373382", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1051, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461616258}, "language": "english", "review": "Very entertaining. you can spend a good 40 hours having fun watching yourself (the blob) grow from eating popcorn and nails to... devouring the UNIVERSE!

I think you know where this is headed... \n\nFor starters, Mutant Blobs Attack is very well designed. The art style is truly awesome, a cartoony world in a 1950's horror movie setting, most likely with a wink to Steve McQueen's (hilarious) The Blob. Combined with small cutscenes in a similar style, this side of the game is genuinely funny. The soundtrack is catchy and fits well with the chosen aesthetics. \n\nThe level design is excellent, its never too hard to figure out where to go next. With 24 levels in 6 zones the game provides plenty of variation, with an enjoyable mini game in each of these zones. The puzzles are no brain teasers but do provide a nice shift from otherwise continuous platforming. The gameplay in general is fairly straightforward, but every level has another approach or gimmick that took away every sense of repetitiveness. \n\nWhile in general Mutant Blobs Attack is not very challenging, once you go for the gold medals and finding every secret there's a whole new level of difficulty for those seeking a challenge. The checkpoint system is rather brilliant, avoiding that even the harder parts of the game become frustrating. The controls are decent, with the exception to wall-jumping, which is a little dodgy. \n\nConcluding, Mutant Blobs Attack is a truly funny game that excels to great heights if/when you also decide to challenge yourself. It's not perfect, but its definitely one of the best platformers I've ever played. And for its price, you really should not ignore it. \n\n+ Hilarious visual presentation\n+ Fitting soundtrack\n+ Challenging if you let it be\n+ Smart checkpoint system\n+ Never becomes too repetitive \n\n- Dodgy walljumping mechanics\n- A wee bit on the short side\n\n\n8.5/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1383594835, "timestamp_updated": 1383594835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7563600": {"recommendationid": "7563600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037504112", "num_games_owned": 298, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419293891}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

It also packs in more indie game references than possibly any before it, which had me grinning the whole way through as I saw my favorites reimagined in very amusing ways. What's more, none of this comes at the cost of great levels or mechanics. Although it shows obvious influence from games such as The Maw and Katamari, Mutant Blobs carves out its own niche in the platforming genre with consistently clever design that feels wholly unique. Again and again it defied my expectations which is by no means something I say often.\n\nOther than a handful of times I had to wrestle with the controls, there is virtually nothing I dislike about Mutant Blobs Attack.

On his way to do so the blob automatically absorbs everything that is smaller than him and so he is getting larger and larger and is able to absorb even more.\n\nOver the course of the game you gain new abilities like smashing, telekinesis, magnetism and sometimes you can even fly around. Combined with the six different themed world stages and the never stopping growth of your blob the game never gets to repetitive besides it simple basic gameplay idea. The puzzles in the game are fairly easy what I did not really mind. The platformer part on the other hand is a bit tougher mainly for one reason. Besides the blob being a blob, and therefore precise movement can be a bit tricky, the controls are unusual. I have read some complains about them, because the game contains parts where you have to use the mouse. People playing the game solely on keyboard or gamepad have to shift over what can be annoying (Edit: This has been changed since the initial released and the game is playable with gamepad only by now). Personally I played the game one hand on the keyboard and the other one on the mouse. This combinations works pretty well. And even if you die you will start by one of the nearby checkpoints. Normally you should pass each passage with less than five times dying except you are trying to get the gold medals or you are collecting your blob friends.\nThose unusual controls are a left over from the porting because the game was made initially for the PS Vita. Another leftover are the mini-levels which are a lot easier in the PC version but still fun. The graphic is cartoon-like and colourful and fits the theme of the game. The music is nothing special. It does not really stand out but it does not annoy you as well. The game took me eight hours for completion of all achievements and replaying some of the levels for getting better times in the leaderboards. And for that the price tag is really fair.\n\nAll in all [b]Tales From Space: Mutant Blobs Attack[/b] is a really, really fun and colourful game if you can forgive some sometimes clunky controls and you do not mind the repetitiveness of the basic gameplay idea.

The goal is to grow your blob to epic proportions by rolling over objects, vehicles and yes, humans. There are 2 fellow blobs hidden around the levels and every now and then you'll unlock a bonus level. The graphics are amazing, they're really stylish. I simply love them. I like how the levels have you starting off as a small blob (so everything around you appears big) and every new level you unlock shows the world getting smaller (ie, you appear bigger). Airplanes, for example, look like toys later on.\n'So, iIs this the best thing ever ?', I hear you ask. No, unfortunately the controls are awkward at times. You basically use the keyboard for all your movements, but every now and then you have to use the mouse too, to slam through objects and things like that. It works, but not in a good way.

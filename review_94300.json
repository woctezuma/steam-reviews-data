Stiff characters stand perfectly still most of the time, with very little scenic animation support, if any, outside ambiant particles such as smoke or fireflies. Coupled with the lack of voice overs, this lends the game a remarkably static impression.\n\nDespite the charming visuals, all rooms in initial chapters share the same square angles and overly basic layout, as if every simple scene was designed to fit in a tiny shoe box.\n\nOver the extensive 7 years of development, the game's creators clearly gained experience in their craft and finally mastered the style in the last half of the game. This also means that the first 3 chapters are consequently rather dull in comparison.\n\n[u]Chapter 1[/u] serves as a basic introduction to the game's settings, main character Victor and classic gameplay mechanics.\n\n[u]Chapter 2[/u] suddenly becomes freaky as the game slowly begins to reveal its plot and the meaning behind its title. These first too chapters felt unspectacular to me.\n\n[u]Chapter 3[/u] suffers from a bad case of picking up anything in sight for no valid reason other than it might come in handy later. Victor performs mundane errands for numerous clones nearly the entire time, including some straining puzzles, though nothing illogical. The story still isn't very compelling so far, gameplay is entirely linear.\n\n[u]Chapter 4[/u] is where the game finally takes form and turns genuinely good. With more interesting puzzles, it now feels like an authentic adventure game. This chapter presents original ideas, such as a special wall in the dream section where players can rearrange the order of rooms.\n\n[u]Chapter 5[/u] wastes little time in the real world and sends players directly to the good bits. Unfortunately half of it is a dry sci-fi world that features a clever but overused character scaling mechanic. The second and arguably much bigger \"half\" is great, however. The player is now handling multiple quests simultaneously, centered around a larger environment and more detailed characters.\n\nFrom hereon the game also proposes a much needed diversity of textures and materials in the scene compositions, more dynamic camera angles and better lighting. Looks great!\n\n[u]Chapter 6[/u] turns into a very imaginative introspective exploration, and feels nothing like the previous five chapters. It lets you revisit most of the previous locations, though not many of them turn out to be really useful. This chapter also makes astute reuse of previously introduced mechanics or solutions.\n\n[u]Chapter 7[/u] proposes a short epilogue to the latter chapter. It presents potential for an extremely difficult choice but offers none to make, ending the game in a disappointingly passive situation that feels somewhat unresolved.\n\n[h1]Positive[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Some intriguing dialogues and story beats\n[*] Original art style and premise\n[*] Significantly improves over every chapter\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Creepy looking characters (good or bad, depending on taste)\n[*] Some straining puzzles, though nothing illogical\n[*] Not a family-friendly adventure (some unexpected moments of relatively intense gore and sexual matters)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Negative[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] No voice overs\n[*] Lack of animations\n[*] Buggy Flash-based engine produces frequent freezes at startup\n[*] Dull first half of the game\n[*] Clunky old school UI (no continue option when returning to the game, must manually load save)\n[*] Annoying scream during dream transitions disrupts the mood\n[*] Disappointingly evasive game ending\n[/list]\n\nAs an avid dreamer and adventure gamer, I expected this game to be a perfect match for my taste. Instead I met a slowly evolving budget production that only partially fulfilled my curiosity and felt like a student project for the first half.

But the cardboard-and-clay-style is worth mentioning at length. Because TDM's highly unique style is not just a gimmick, it also enhances every inch of the games dream-focused plotline, making it a game that is both otherworldy beautiful and right-out dreadful and terrifying.\n\nHowever, sometimes the game is a bit off - some dialogue and plotting can feel a bit lacking, as well as some minor bugs breaking the immersion somewhat. \n\nA few puzzles can also feel a bit too obtuse and unforgiving, which is a shame, considering that TDM also packs some of the absolutely BEST puzzles I've seen in a recent adventure game. At it's best, TDM uses it's ominous dream logic and creates some immensly satisfying brain teasers that are both perfect within the story and interesting and fun to solve.\n \nAll in all, TDM is a game that starts out as something I figured for a clich\u00e9ed dream story, but soon evolves into a literal existential nightmare, filled with twists and turns that will haunt you for a long time to come.

The whole thing is built up of clay figures and backgrounds, spruced up further with bits of paper, moss, fabric, twigs, leaves, and other materials, which gives it a unique and kind of nostalgic look, reminding you of classic claymation. Amazingly, it's built up in Flash. I've experienced the occasional glitch where dialogue text repeatedly pops up, sometimes white screens where the game apparently crashes, and some bad slowdown on certain heavily layered graphics, but mostly it's extremely stable.\n\nYou play as Victor Neff, a young guy who just moved into a new apartment with his pregnant girlfriend, and discover something crazy. I'll avoid saying more than that, as the story takes many surprising turns. It took a bit of playing for me to gauge what kind of story the game was going for - the static clay figures look a little grotesque, and I was expecting a more cartoonish plot. Instead, the game gets quite serious, even dark at points, and tells a fairly mature tale. A good deal of it reminded me of I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, another excellent adventure game.\n\nIt's a very challenging adventure game. A few times now, I've had to look up online help to get further. The game lets you switch hints from the main character on or off, but even switched on, it can get very difficult to figure out. Still, never unfairly so.\n\nIf you miss point and click adventuring, this game should provide you with a great many hours of gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1507994661, "timestamp_updated": 1507994661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35715911": {"recommendationid": "35715911", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970811669", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1632, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507981641}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Una obra maestra del g\u00e9nero con puzzles no excesivamente dif\u00edciles y con una historia profunda, elaborada y surrealista.

I purchased this almost exclusively for the artistry alone so I'm willing to overlook any sort of mechanical flaws; real or perceived (I don't perceive any though). I love this game so far. It's unique and for anyone who knows about claymation, it takes FOREVER.. so kudos. The game has this mysterious element to it that - so far - is not over the top. I *want* to know what happens next. I credit the storytelling and interactive dialogue. The walking may seem cumbersome if one is expecting typical smooth motions of a point-and-click but remember it's the process of this type of animation. \n\nETA: Finally finished this game. FINALLY. Toward the end, it was more of a chore than it should have been. The story collapses as you get into the side quests of various dreams. I felt as though the integration and use of those elements could have been better, more smoothly executed. The artwork also kind of suffers at the end, as well; a bit disappointing as that's what initially drew me in. \n\nThe puzzles were great; I enjoyed those quite a bit (just not in the last chapter). There is unexpected \"nudity\" and disturbing content toward and at the very end. If you're a woman, more than likely the ending is offensive on some level. If you're a man, creeped out. Regardless, a very wtf moment for everyone. [spoiler]Traversing the vag[inal] canal of one's own mother is not something that should ever be explored on any sort of level; contemplative, literal or metaphorical.[/spoiler] The story would've done fine w/o that oddball inclusion. There is also \"gore.\" I'm putting quotations around the terms as this is claymation and you'd have to admit to limitations in creating that kind of element using that particular medium.\n\nHaving said all of that, there is another disturbing moment but one that you kind of feel coming throughout the game.

The main protagonist is stop-motion animated clay, the backgrounds are all handcrafted from a variety of materials. It takes some getting used to but it really grew on me. \n\nThe music and sounds are very well done and enhance the atmosphere of the game. There's no voice acting, you have to read the dialogue which sometimes is a bit tedious but on the whole is well written and not too long.\n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nAlso unusual and sometimes weird, heh. \n\nYou just moved into a new appartment with your pregnant wife and you soon realise that something's not right. What starts out as a bit of a detective story slowly turns into something more sinister. You are definitely no hero but you are trying to do the right thing even if that has sometimes unintended consequences. \n\nIn my opinion, the last part of the story is the weakest and it would have been better if the game had ended with the 5th part but YMMV. But up to that part it is interesting and darker than usual in adventure games. This is not a happy story, not suitable for children (there's death and other rather disturbing things).\n\n\n[h1]Puzzles[/h1] \n\nHard but not unfair. This is no game for newbies to the genre. The individual chapters are not linear for the most part, you can \"work\" on several puzzles at the same time and sometimes there are several ways you can solve a puzzle.\n\nThere is no in-game help, no hints besides what other people tell you and no hotspot viewer, although the latter is not too important since there is no pixel hunting in this game. I never got stuck because I overlooked something. I did get stuck a few times, though, and twice so severely that I had to stop playing to sleep over it. For the last three chapters, there are no walkthroughs available, so be advised, if you get frustrated easily this is probably not the game for you. \n\nThe puzzles in chapter 5 are outstanding. Very mild spoiler: [spoiler]You can change your size in this chapter which allows for some really interesting puzzle designs.[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nVery simple, just point and click. You drag items from your inventory (appears at the top of the screen) to where you want to use them. I would have liked the option to double click exits to move through screens or at least to run faster. Instead, you move with one speed through the screens which slows the game down considerably in some areas, especially chapter 5 which requires you to run around a lot. \n\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\nI liked this game quite a bit. A lot of work went into the backgrounds and it shows. The puzzles are hard and you often have several to solve at once, the developers did a very good job here. The finale to the story was a bit weak, in my opinion, but the overall story is captivating. The game is well worth its full price if you look at my game time but there are frequent sales as well. \n\n[b]I recommend this game for adventure game veterans who are willing to take their time with this game.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1502041701, "timestamp_updated": 1502042069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34059704": {"recommendationid": "34059704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164165649", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502987486}, "language": "english", "review": "A masterpiece of a game.Everything in the game was hand made with motivation.Making you think with brilliant puzzles.\nFrom 2012 still being updated to this day.", "timestamp_created": 1502024112, "timestamp_updated": 1502024112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517544", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34048378": {"recommendationid": "34048378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072033658", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 880, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505676821}, "language": "english", "review": "*This is a review of the full game*\n\nBeautiful and emotional point-and-click adventure with some of the best and most charming dialogue I have seen in recent years. The game is filled to the brim with creative puzzles that are sometimes almost too clever for their own good. It starts out a little bit sluggish but becomes very exciting as soon as the plot starts to kick in. Visually the game is stunning, especially the environments deserve notable praise. The characters, in my opinion, maybe looked a bit too crude to be immediately likeable, but they quickly grow on the player emotionally as the story progresses. The dialogue is immersive and well-written, rich with both clever comedy and emotional baggage. The sound quality is a tad crude but is well-implented and extremely effective in serving its purpose.\nThe game has classic point-and-click gameplay but also succeeds in providing uniquely creative and smart puzzles that are sometimes so clever that players will probably overlook the solutions that are right under their noses.\n\nChapters 1 to 4 get a five-star rating from me. Well-designed puzzles and enough balance in difficulty and effort not to be slowed down quite too much. There's a beautiful build-up in tension of the story during these first four chapters and there have been moments where I felt the game really reached out and spoke to me emotionally. It would be an understatement to say that a lot of big corporately financed AAA game studios could learn a thing or two from Anders Gustafsson's magnificent writing and narrative design. \n\nChapter 5\nAlthough this chapter is probably the richest in content and length, this is where the quality of gamedesign goes subtly downhill, with some areas (like Mr. Willard's dream) being very uncommunicative to the player as to which actions to pursue next. For me, this led to frustrating hours sluggishly walking from screen to screen trying to solve puzzles that were already finished for the time being. This is also the first chapter where the game becomes a bit less linear and expects the player to backtrack between different dreams, without explicitly communicating it to the player, which seemed a bit counterintuitive at the time.\n\nChapter 6\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there is just way, way too much backtracking in this chapter (coming from a person who loves backtracking-heavy genres such as metroidvania games). The game demands that the player revisits the same characters over and over and make them repeat the same things in different words over and over only to receive the tiniest of breadcrumbs leading to the next clue. Once you've finally got all the 'breadcrumbs' you have to put them in a certain order in a very far-off place, without having any clear indication as a player whether your setup is correct or not, leading to potentially endless hours of backtracking. At this point, regardless of my emotional and time investments so far, I would have put this game down if it weren't for the \"Quick Travel\" option and a walkthrough by my side.\nIn retrospect, this whole chapter kind of irked and confused me. The story abruptly becomes more abstract and philosophical. By the time I had reached the finale of the game, I had become so out of touch with the game world's inherent logic and 'reality' that I couldn't tell whether aborting a duplicate fetus with an adult mind was a good or a bad thing to do in regards to the context of the story and characters. The ending also striked me as rather dark and sad, and I hope that the rumours of a possible alternate, happier ending are true. Ultimately, I might just have been a bit worn out at this point and felt that the same charm and beauty of the first four chapters seemed a bit absent in the final chapter.\n\nFinal verdict: \nDespite the disappointment I felt with the final chapter, I would not have wanted to miss out on this gem of a game. Anyone with a disposition for visually beautiful and unique games with deeply emotional narratives should not miss this one!\n", "timestamp_created": 1501974453, "timestamp_updated": 1501974453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33983533": {"recommendationid": "33983533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122631732", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 988, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501725593}, "language": "english", "review": "The first thing I want to say about this game is that it's clearly a labour of love. It has a wonderful, unique art style and great overall puzzle design. But what I'm most surprised about is how much I enjoyed the story. I went in cold and didn't know what to expect. My only clue about the aesthetic was the moody, svankmejer style claymation. And indeed the game has dark, foreboding and creepy moments - that are excellently done. Because they are interspersed in a tale that surprised me with its maturity and understatement. While at the same time being full of creativity and wonderment. Long story short, the writing is good! \n\nAnd frankly good writing is more rare than you'd think. Since the Lucasarts hayday, most point and click adventures have tended toward goofy, shticky humor that makes me cringe as often as not. This game has a story it wants to tell and does so in a believable way. \n\nThe puzzles are solid. Mostly right in the sweet spot of being thoughtful but not frustrating. I've played a lot of point and clicks. The Dream Machine follows the unspoken rules of puzzle design to give players zany ideas that still make sense in context. It's a little light on hints, but your goals are clear. \n\nThe art design should be made into a coffee table book. It is unique and gorgeous. Just like the game as a whole!  Also a shoutout to the sound design for adding the same unique yet familiar ambiance that the visuals have. \n\nListen, I'm a jaded gamer. I wasn't expecting much when I picked this up on sale. But after finishing, I know it's one of the classics of it's genre for this era. I've played enough to know that true classics are few and far between. \n\nSo put it on your wishlist, and buy it when you have the dough. On sale or not, it's worth the ticket price.

Sometimes would stop in one place and try to guess what material they made certain things with. Also, really loved the soundtrack.\n\nWhen I bought it, I was a bit worried that maybe they put all their energy into making a visually appealing game with clay and other materials (because that was a big selling point for them), but didn't put much effort into the story. However, the story was GREAT! And it was quite a long game too, which was pleasant. So many twists and turns, sometimes really unsettling and creepy parts, which I loved. Generally, the theme of dreams, getting into people's dreams, is just such and interesting one - there is so much you can do with it!\n\nThe puzzles to me seemed classic for point&click games: some logical, some not quite.

Sometimes it's because they're too awful, sometimes because I know how I feel about them early on, and sometimes because they're just not for me. But I made a point to finish The Dream Machine and I'm very glad I did, because what happens in that final chapter feels like the real game, with everything that leads up to it a long prelude in retrospect. That's not speaking ill of the early chapters, mind you, that's giving the impressive final act the recognition it deserves.\n\nVictor Neff has moved into a small apartment building with his pregnant wife Alicia. They're trying to prepare for their new arrival, but a chance discovery by Victor reveals a dark plot lurking within their home. The titular dream machine holds the power to invade dreams to nefarious ends, and Victor gets wrapped up in a struggle against it that has greater stakes than anyone could imagine. What starts as a quest to rescue his neighbors becomes a battle for life and understanding of the secrets of existence.\n\nThe stakes are sky high here, which makes the decision to portray them in clay and craftwork all the more remarkable. The Dream Machine does a pretty good job of hiding what its characters and backdrops are crafted from but this comes at a cost, usually with a lack of detail or animation to cover for the shortcomings of budget stop-motion animation. Don't expect a lot of expressive movement or dense scenes to explore, but expect plenty of atmosphere from everything you encounter. Even pleasant scenes are given a sinister, off-putting feel by the black-eyed stares of people and waxy sheen on common objects. And you'd better believe this aesthetic is used to full effect when needed.\n\nIt's the tone of The Dream Machine that's most noticeable about it, starting off rather innocuously with breakfast and chores, and then dropping hints at darker things and strange plots. By the time you're dream-hopping through unfamiliar landscapes the atmosphere has turned plenty creepy, and this unease ramps up exponentially to the conclusion. Throughout it all the characters involved will take the incredible events unfolding around them in stride, adding to the appropriately dreamlike feel of the whole affair. This mastery of tone is what keeps the game deeply affecting even when wrestling with puzzles or wandering about wondering what to do next.\n\nAs expertly as the dream motifs are used here though, you won't need to worry about any loopy dream logic to the puzzles. You'll find a fair number of items as you point-and-click your way through your quest but most have perfectly reasonable uses. The hardest threads to follow are when characters ask you favors or instruct you to handle something, because the solution usually involves some improvisation outside of the expected solution. I got stuck on a few puzzles for awhile, such as trying to find a substitute for tomato juice for a drink and locating bait for a fishing rod I didn't realize I needed. You may very well need to consult a walkthrough from time to time, because while the puzzles make sense they don't always make it clear how to do what you realize you need to do.\n\nThat would normally be a knock against an adventure game but the puzzles in The Dream Machine are extremely clever, and sometimes the difficulty comes from how clever they are. You'll come across a few gimmicks that are used to incredible effect, like one where you can rearrange rooms in a house and another where you can shrink or grow yourself. It's entirely possible you've seen these in other games but I promise you they weren't used as well as they are here. That uniqueness makes them harder to solve but seeing where the puzzle and associated plot go are more than worth the hassle.\n\nNow, the plot is probably the strangest part of this game, and also what makes it so brilliant in the end. I gave you the opener up above, and it should be no surprise that this hook leads you to explore the dreams of the building's other residences. In general the chapters of the game are divided by dream, with each resident having a different theme to their dream realm. That means most of the game is occupied with working through the puzzles of a realm until you reach the goal and somehow free something up in the real world to allow access to the next. There's a clear progression here that feels like a proper quest, with little to distract from going through the motions.\n\nAll that changes in the final chapter. Suddenly the game takes a sharp philosophical and metaphysical turn, ejecting the clear reality/dream divide and dredging up a whole mess of pathos for your avatar Victor. It was off-putting at first, and not in the appropriate way that the art style is. I wondered if the final chapter had even been made by the same people, the gulf was so great. But then the puzzles started back up, even more involved and clever than before, sending me through colorful new areas and revisiting old ones. It built to a conclusion kicked off by a shockingly unpleasant scene, one that can hardly be called a happy ending but is maybe as perfect for the game as is possible. A lot of symbolism and subtext I hadn't really noticed before came to light and I started to reconsider how I felt about the game as a whole. As in, I started to wonder if I loved it instead of just liked it.\n\nIt's a lengthy journey of ten to twelve hours, and not all of that is going to be smooth sailing. You might have trouble connecting to the strangely alien characters at first, or you might get stuck on one of more involved puzzles each dream tends to have. But the foundations are solid and the atmosphere is great, and I assure you it all builds to something that's worth experiencing if you have the stomach for it. Fans of games that challenge them on many levels will find their match here, between the clever puzzles and the volatile story. I didn't think I was one of those fans, but as it turns out, The Dream Machine showed me a great many things I did not expect.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

It was put together in stages over several years, and it has the resulting depth and breadth that other games of this type rarely do. The handmade visual style is unlike anything I've seen in this type of game, and has a vivid, reach-out-and-you-can-touch-it solidness to it.\n\nOne thing worth stating upfront is that THIS GAME IS NOT FOR KIDS. I mention this because I'm a fan of the Amanita Design games that have a similar 2-D approach, like Machinarium, Botanicula and Samorost 3. Those have some spooky elements, but mostly they're kid-friendly as well as having challenging puzzles for adults. Dream Machine goes WAY farther into a dark, grisly, sometimes horror-tinged realm -- and I think it is exclusively for adults.\n\nThe plusses of the game are many. I was surprised that the creators were able to sustain long-form storytelling over the entire series. Every little element in the early chapters is of-a-piece and builds toward the puzzles as well as enhancing the story over the full course of the game. It's extremely cohesive and cumulative in how it unfolds.\n\nThe puzzles and Zork-like adventure aspects of this game are very satisfying. There are only a few puzzles that require structural analytic thinking (like trying to figure out how to arrange transistors in a box to get the right amount of current). Rather, most of the puzzles require direct observation of the locations and situations, with logical solutions that reward you for paying attention. You will need to retrace your steps sometimes to really LOOK at things, but the game designers don't hide anything in obscure places. Everything you need is upfront, as long as you're paying attention and thinking things through. \n\nI love it when games like this have that sense of FAIR PLAY, where they give you JUST ENOUGH but NOT TOO MUCH to figure things out. Dream Machine strikes that balance very well. Some of the puzzles might require you, aptly enough, to sleep on them for a bit, but that's about all. (I got stuck once due to my misunderstanding of how a laser beam was directed at a wall, so I looked for a walkthrough, but saw too much and felt like a jerk for spoiling the fun for myself. After that, I was happy to solve the rest of the game on my own, even though I almost got stuck later -- something to do with a character asking me to make a sandwich....)\n\nOn the NEGATIVE side: The aspect of the game I found most irksome was the text. Though well-written and sometimes very witty (as with the phone calls to God scene), the constant click, click,click of the dialogue between characters approach tedium at times. The designers seem to have learned to keep things brisk over the course of the game, and I felt like dialogue wasn't *quite* as obnoxious in the latter chapters. Since the game doesn't have any voice-over acting, but just text, at least you can click through as fast as you like. Still, I wish they had given you an option to get a single-screen display of all the dialogue on the 2nd pass, instead of having to click-click-click-click-click each time.\n\nAll in all, this is one of the most surprisingly ambitious and \"Wow I can't believe how much game is packed into this game\" experiences I've had with a low-cost, 2-D, indie game purchase. No regrets, it was worth the time and money, and I felt like I got to experience an original, well-constructed, creative-risk-taking story in the process.", "timestamp_created": 1498372678, "timestamp_updated": 1498372678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586522", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32749327": {"recommendationid": "32749327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006849221", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 1569, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496518662}, "language": "english", "review": "Play this even if adventure games aren't your thing.

In fact, if I was writing this about the first 2 chapters, I woud've been hopeful. \"So much potential\", I'd write, \"such an interesting premise!\" But no, the full game, after 7 years in development, is an utter mess that gets more teious and boring to play the further it goes.\n\nFirst two chapters establish the premise of a strange horror mystery dream thriller sci-fi tale with not particularly good writing, but one that fits the mood and stop motion looks. Game doesn't really have a very strong focus on puzzle solving, moves at consistant pace and establishes an intersting setup.\n\nChapter 3 is where things start falling apart. Game enforces more teidous walking back and forth, asks for obscure puzzle solutions and doesn't present a particularly interesting story, but at least it moves the premise forward. Chapter 4, on the other hand, feels like a step back in the right direction and apart from more poorly designed puzzles at times, feels like the concept developing and game design of the game evolving.\n\nAnd then Chapter 5 happens and everything comes to a grinding halt. Game stumbles and falls flat on its face, pace killed completely, initial setup almost all but forgotten, tone sent completely off the hinges. And if you manage to suffer from Chapter 5, you're greeted not with a return to form, initial promise fullfilled and game logically concluded, but with a mess of self-discovery, pseudo-psychological \"smart\" sequences, scene borrowed from Kubrik and an ending quote from Radiohead. I suppose, it's easy to forget what you were doing in the first place in 7 years of making of the game, but maybe doing something almost seemingly unrelated to anything before, isn't a good answer.\n\nIt's not a particularly fun adventure game, with really tedious \"puzzles\" starting in the last chapters. It's not a good story, because the storyline falls apart somewhere after midpoint and it's not particularly well written. And it's very definitely not worth time it requires to suffer through it all.

The exact same environments can be used without any jarring shift in graphics thanks to the claymation, too. I bought it early on and waited for it to be finished before starting, which is good because the game never offers a recap of what came before.\n\nLet's start with the obvious: The Dream Machine looks incredible, even with the annoying black bars at the sides of the screen. A tremendous amount of love went into making this, and it shows. Plus thanks to the premise, the setting of each chapter changes drastically, which keeps things memorable and fresh from start to finish even if the worlds you explore lack the fullblown surrealism of actual dreams.\n\nThe downside of the beautiful claymation is that it's difficult to see which objects you can interact with or not. There's no button to highlight all the hotspots you can check out, so your only option is to move your mouse along the screen and wait for things to light up. Worse is when a smaller component of a whole is what you need to find. Let's say you're supposed to click on the handle of a bicycle. If you scroll over the bike the entire object will light up, which disguises the fact that the handle yields a totally different interaction when clicked. It's needlessly frustrating, especially when the problem could so easily be circumvented by the main character giving a hint like \"the handles on the bike are loose.\"\n\nSpeaking of the main character, he's really not a strong lead. Victor has no job, no ambitions, and no apparent hobbies other than perhaps music (which you would never know if not for the guitar in his apartment). You can choose to play him as someone mostly kind and helpful, or be a complete jerk at every available opportunity. If this had noticeable consequences on Victor's behaviour in the scripted sections it might be interesting, but they seem to play out the same regardless. Even Victor's descriptions of the things you click on lack personality: \"There's nothing remarkable about it.\" \"It's a chair.\" \"I used this X to Y.\"\n\nChapter 6 makes a last-ditch effort to provide him with a blandly generic backstory, but by the end of the final chapter I still didn't have a clear idea of who Victor *was*, which detracted significantly from the ending\u2015an ending which seems to offer an obvious opportunity for a final, meaningful choice if he is indeed a player surrogate, but instead shuttles you down a predetermined path.\n\nThe game's main plot is tidily written. It fully embraces the fantastical aspects of its story, playing out largely like a mystery/horror with unpredictable twists. The silly, stilted dialogue of Chapter 1 fades away in lieu of genuinely fascinating concepts and characters who are, if a little one-note, still a memorable addition to the worlds you explore.\n\nThere are occasional lapses where Victor re-explains something he just told someone in a different interaction, or  where one of his previous actions is mysteriously ignored. For example, at one point you set an angry mob on a character who rages at you for the betrayal; go back in a few minutes and he'll politely welcome you into his home as a friend. In another instance you spend quite a lot of time talking to a group of men who have been searching endlessly for a certain place, often to the point of madness. Once you find it, you can backtrack to talk to them...but there's no way to tell them about what you've found. Little details like this would have made the world so much more convincing.\n\nThe ending is certainly not the worst I've seen, but it was too abrupt to emotionally resonate with me. It took maybe ten minutes then boom, game over. After a night of racing to the story's conclusion I was left feeling underwhelmed. (It didn't help that the game crashed right in the middle of the climactic scene.)\n\nTL: DR: The flaws are minor, but there were enough of them to taint my enjoyment of a game that's otherwise beautiful, original, and set in a compelling world.

In the end, I could have bought the whole game on Steam for under $14 instead of $30 and never had to wait 6 years to play the game. Maybe that is what I should have done but who knew that up front.

But now that the game is finished, I realize this was totally unnecessary. The Dream Machine is a god damn masterpiece. And you can tell this from the very beginning. I fell in love after being gifted the first chapters, and went on to immediately buy the next 3, then eagerly waited the final chapter. I was lucky to have come across it towards the end, and only had to wait a year. Others have waited over 8 years for its completion. And the devs (all 2 of them) kept the fans updated through the whole thing. \n\nIt was well worth the wait.\n\nThis point n click is fucking gorgeous. The sets blow me away. Every new scene I entered I spent the first few minutes just guessing what everything was made of. I think about how much work it must've taken to put it all together, and its just so impressive. Every chapter gets prettier and prettier. And that final one is just astounding! Some scenes are sweet, and even more are creepy. And I was physically uncomfortable more than a couple times. It was fantastic. Stop motion animation, made with all kinds of stuff like clay, paint, broccoli, pubes. It's really cool. The game looks great. \n\nAnd that was just the art! There's even content behind that pretty face! The story was beautiful, and twisted, and at times very sad. It dives deep into a dream world with dark realities and harsh truths. There is no voice acting, you have to read. This is a big plus to me, cuz sometimes bad voice acting can ruin a good story.. But the music and the ambience set a perfect tone, and sculpt ominously soothing voices to imagine as you read. \n\nAs far as gameplay, the interface is very comfortable. Walk speed, and text speeds all adjustable, so you can click through the dialogue at a casual pace. Some puzzles were a bit challenging, but nothing a little more exploring couldn't solve. Many times you can find multiple solutions to a problem, or discover clues that lead you nowhere. But never in an annoying way. I thought exploring was very rewarding. Even when it didn't actually matter. I am told this is called \"having fun\". I had a lot of fun playing this game. \n\nI would highly recommend. Don't even wait for a sale, just get it. The devs deserve it. Its probably grossly underpriced anyways considering how much time has gone into it. A serious labor of love. \n\nThanks for reading, and THANK YOU DEVS for the awesome experience.

My favourite chapter was probably chapter 5, but mostly only Selma's dream.\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who likes claymation, doesn't mind grim material (not really horror), gory parts (it sounds worse than it is, plus it's clay, so...), likes an interesting story/premise, and enjoys point-and-click adventures.\n[b]Even though it's not my fav, I'd give this game a 7/10, for all of the great visuals.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1495084805, "timestamp_updated": 1495084975, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31815104": {"recommendationid": "31815104", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081405652", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495075109}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing game!

An enormous amount of work clearly went in to making this point and click adventure and it pays off thoroughly.  But be warned, save often.\n\nFirst off, the art is great. It is all hand crafted stop-motion models which are beautifully detail and adds quite a bit of surealness to the experience.  While there are times the animation feels a little sparse, there is never a time were backgrounds feel half done. Every bit of this game has a lot of care put into its visuals.\n\nThe story is exceptional, well themed and conceived.  It compares our inanimate selves actively dreaming to the concepts of birth and death.  The story maintains well thought out themes of reverse aging, passiveness vs assertiveness, dreams and freedom. Further, the story goes to very dark places at times. It can be gory, creepy, sexual, blasphemous, incestuous, and even delves fully into abortion. Be aware the darker plotlines are unavoidable so if they are not to your taste, you should avoid this game.\n\nThe game play is point and click adventure and it does it very well. Interestingly, there are at times multiple solutions and even small side plots you could optionally visit.  For example at one point you need to fetch some food for a character, different kinds of food can be acquired from different sources and prepared in different ways, all are accepted.  That is a charming bit of extra work that you do not often see in point and click adventures.\n\nBut there are some down sides, the game pacing and linearity isn\u2019t consistent.  The first chapter is insanely short, while the last few could take quite a while.  Moreover, some sections of the game play more like a visual novel where you just keep clicking through dialogue; a big part of chapter 6 is like this and it really pulls you out of the game. \n\nBut the biggest failing is the bugs, during my play through the game crashed 8 times with no warning.  The crashes weren\u2019t even repeatable, just random.  Luckily, the auto save is decent enough, but if you hate replaying, save often.  The more disconcerting bug happened when an event was supposed to trigger that would have killed my character but didn\u2019t.  I was left thinking I solved the puzzle, and aimlessly wandered about for quite some time before I realized something was wrong.\n\nSo despite the bugs, the game is fantastic. It is dark and creepy, but done in a way that is artful and well balanced with the story and themes. Give this one a try if you are not afraid of story that takes you to places you might not want to think about.\n", "timestamp_created": 1494805093, "timestamp_updated": 1494805093, "voted_up": true,

Like when you start watching Doctor Who because you have nothing else to do and end up building full-scale TARDISes for your cats, knocking four times every darn time before entering a room and telling your friends how much you\u2019ve grown as a person watching it. But to be honest, no point and click adventure game has done this to me in quite the epic scale as The Dream Machine has. And having grown up with an older sibling with access to Leisure Suit Larry and Monkey Island, that is saying something.\n\nSo after half-heartedly convincing myself to try it, I almost startled a bit when I found myself laughing at the introduction to chapter 1. I mean an authentic laugh, not the face people make while typing \u201clol\u201d. The game continued to surprise me with what unfolded to be an incredibly beautifully made little world full of amazing detail and a unique artistic style. And while it was cozy within its little walls, with its jazz and ambient music, I found it to be packed with possibilities for exploration.\n\nSo the playdoh-dollhouse really brought the childhood memories on their way. But what really gave me that sense of \"this feels like the first time I've ever played a PC game\" and \u201cthis is the way I actually see things when I don\u2019t think about it too much\u201d, was how well the shape and sound of the game were complemented with its storytelling and dialogues. The dialogues, because they showed a truthful yet non-judging and loving understanding of human nature. And the storytelling, because it managed to remain relaxing and innocent throughout the game while at the same time consistently mounting in suspense and surrealism. And in more than one instance one has to flatout admire the way it shows things in such a truthful manner that is rare in computer games: that people sometimes do things that seem dark and morbid, but then they are genuinely sorry and apologize; or that the elderly lady from next door with her teapots and doileys at some point of her life did have a sex life, such as it was.\n\nThe makers of The Dream Machine have taken all those little impressions of life that are usually limited to be experienced in the privacy of our heads, and shaped them into something that can be shared - not as a clever book on psychology, but as a wonderfully made game everyone can enjoy.

I'll try to keep this brief while still getting my point across.\n\nThe Dream Machine, with all its current chapters is simply one of the most creative, underrated gaming experiences I've had well... ever (at risk of sounding like a suck up to the game's developers or something). It's got a pretty original plot considering the heavily-explored topic of dreams and entering dreams. You play as Victor, who just moved into a new apartment with his pregnant wife, only to find out a series of dark secrets leading up to Victor essentially having the fate of humanity in his hands.\n\nThe game's possibly most wonderful part is its aesthetic, with painstakingly-made sets made of clay, cardboard, and other such materials and a nice, dark soundtrack to enhance the atmosphere of the world further. While again avoiding spoilers, I'll say that the settings, especially in the various dreams, present varying, beautiful environments that all take full advantage of the ability to highlight the psychological state of the person having said dream. I feel like I'll spoil something if I say too much, but I'll probably have to get back to fixing this review a bit more with more reasons to buy it. It's a delightful game overall and I reccomend it wholeheartedly! Definitely my pick for the Steam awards \"I played it before it won an award\" award, due to its shockingly-underrated nature.\n\nAs an edit, playing the final chapter was riveting. One of my only problems with it was that Vincent seemed to grow to accepting of all the weirdness happening around him, but then I realized that it was more or less exasperation at the fact that he's been dealing with reality-bending and harrowing stuff for days (no spoilers, but he experiences and witnesses some violent or deadly things), and it would only make sense for him to essentially say \"Okay, this is happening now.\" I refuse to spoil anything that happens, but it takes FULL advantage of how weird dreams can get and takes every last opportunity to show how the Dream Machine is trying to impede Vincent on his journey. And the ending... that ending was amazing. I, again, refuse to spoil anything, but I still strongly reccomend this game to anyone who likes the art, point and click gameplay, or even just story driven stuff. People who appreciate any artistic aspect of gaming as a creative medium are going to find at least something to love about this, and I still definitely reccomend this underrated goodness very highly!", "timestamp_created": 1480291583, "timestamp_updated": 1511666717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27868205": {"recommendationid": "27868205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103207562", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498772783}, "language": "english", "review": "The \u201cI Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award\u201d Award", "timestamp_created": 1480272087, "timestamp_updated": 1480272087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556825", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27822652": {"recommendationid": "27822652", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262374327", "num_games_owned": 719, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494610149}, "language": "english", "review": "Just add this to the list of things that prove that video games are art.\n\nThis game has some of the most intriguing, gorgeous, adorable (and in many instances disgusting) designs ever contructed.  The art style is like if the film \"Mirror Mask\" were made into a game.  And the plot is just as gorgeous and surreal.  \"The Dream Machine\" is like the ultimate indie game.  \n\nYou play as Victor Neff, a self-proclaimed \"handsome\" man, who has just moved into a strange new flat with his pregnant wife, but things get strange very quickly when your wife notices the landlord acting really weird.  I will not spoil any of the plot.  It is a game you must see to believe, but if you can believe it, there is in fact a Dream Machine in the game.\n\nMany players who have received this game negatively because of the short nature of the first two chapters (which can potentially both be completed in under two hours combined) are wrong in assuming because of this, the whole game is very short.  It is not, in fact.  By chapter 3, the length of each chapter exceeds 2 hours (the fifth chapter took over 3 (almost 4) hours to complete as was by-far the longest and most complex).  And yes, each chapter's puzzles are more intricate and complex, making the difficulty just right for players who need to adjust to the weirdness levels this game pushes out. And also remember, a short game is not a bad game.  There are point-and-click adventure games that can be beaten entirely within a half-hour, but they are brilliant.  So if you find yourself getting through \"The Dream Machine\" very quickly, do not equate that with it being a bad game.\n\nThe first two chapters are there to get the player's feet wet with how this game is going to present itself.  It's really surrealistic, thus it needs to demonstrate how the puzzles are going to work and the imaginitive ways to solve them.  (Hopefully, without spoiling much, I will give you an example.  In Chapter 2, there is a character that you have to talk to but he doesn't speak clearly at all.  The problem is one of his vocal cords is bent. The solution is to remove the cord and bang it with a hammer until it is straightened. Then the character will speak clearly).  Hopefully that was a good example of how unconventional the puzzles are in the game.\n\nAnd the puzzles are very well implimented.  There were times, however, when it is so unclear what to do, clicking everything on everything becomes a method to get through the game.  I only found this problem on Chapter 5 (which was a huge chapter with a lot of map screens).  The level was much darker than the others making it a bit difficult to see items that needed to be picked up and characters were not clear in what they needed from Victor making it difficult to understand what to do, though I do know the developers are still updating the game very regularly fixing this and that, so the problems with Chapter 5 may very well be fixed in a couple of months.\n\nThe atmosphere in the game is brilliant, with a slow build to the weirder things (the ending of Chapter 5 was by far the strangest thing) with subtle music and an even mixture of a serious tone from the characters mixed with a humourous tone.  There were two parts that had me laughing out loud: a part with these pumpkins, and a part with a knight in armour.\n\nThe artwork of the game is something to behold.  Looking at each screen on the game and noticing the tiny details the developers put in give the game an extra dose of appreciation.  They clearly care about this game (especially since it's been in development for almost a decade).  Regardless of people disliking the game because they think it's grotesque, I think it's beautiful and I truly wish there were more games (let alone stop-motion films) in this style.", "timestamp_created": 1480250840, "timestamp_updated": 1480251142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27802039": {"recommendationid": "27802039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286740960", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504475909}, "language": "english", "review": "Very beautiful, unique game with a wonderful storyline.

L'atmosphere est intrigante et m\u00eame d\u00e9rangeante \u00e0 la fin.\n\nLe chapitre 4 est de bonne facture, peut \u00eatre m\u00eame plus difficile que les autres car comme on est pas vraiment guid\u00e9 c'est \u00e0 nous de bien interpr\u00eater les indices que l'on trouve (ou peut \u00eatre suis-je un peu lent \u00e0 comprendre) et de faire des tentatives pour comprendre les possibilit\u00e9s qui s'offrent \u00e0 nous. L'histoire se poursuis et le passage dans le r\u00eave fait m\u00eame un peu froid dans le dos, c'est presque g\u00eanant d'observer ce qui s'y passe.\n\nDans le Chapitre 5 les d\u00e9veloppeurs arrivent encore \u00e0 pousser un peu plus loin leur maitrise : plus long, plus vari\u00e9, toujours aussi bien fait... L'intrigue est prenante et l'ensemble est m\u00eame d'une bonne difficult\u00e9e. Il est clair que l'on peut attendre le dernier round avec impatience. Bravo.\n\nPris dans son ensemble c'est v\u00e9ritablement un tr\u00e8s bon jeu d'aventure pour peu que l'on s'immerge dans l'univers propos\u00e9. il ne faut pas se laisser berner par la simplicit\u00e9 et la bonhomie du d\u00e9but, le jeu \u00e9volue au fil des chapitres en terme d'ambiance et de casse-t\u00eates.\n\nLe jeu n'est pas en Fran\u00e7ais et il y a pas mal de dialogues (sous forme de textes, pas d'audio), pour ceux qui ont du mal avec la langue de Shakespeare, passez votre chemin pour l'instant.", "timestamp_created": 1480158959, "timestamp_updated": 1480281439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507995", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27605203": {"recommendationid": "27605203", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983045052", "num_games_owned": 626, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484471093}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting puzzles.

You will get stuck when you think you've tried everything, and even turning \"hint mode\" on won't be enough (as the \"hints\" it gives you are practically useless). \n\nThere are still a few things that need to be fixed, for example full-screen mode oftens crashes or runs slowly so I haven't been playing full-screen.

And for a game that's so visually impressive it's a shame I can't appreciate it fully by having my screen covered with it.\n\nI still recommend, as the visuals are SO interesting and beautiful (and creepy!!).

And if chapter 1 & 2 aren't good enough, the next chapters will probably keep you playing this game. Back then, when I finished chapter 3 and need to wait for other chapters, I was afraid that chapter 3 is too good, and that I would be disappointed when chapter 4 released, but in the end, I wasn't: Chapter 3 is already really good, but chapter 4 is better, and chapter 5 is even better than chapter 4.\n\n[b]Puzzle:[/b]\nThe puzzle isn't too hard and is logical, well sometimes it becomes really difficult, but totally makes sense.\nSome people complaining that sometimes you can't examine an object until a NPC told you to do it, but to me, that's what make the puzzle better: You need to actually read and understand what's going on in order to process, blindly clicking around won't get you anywhere.\n\n[b]Atmosphere:[/b]\nIt isn't a horror game, but somehow it gives you the chills, I always like that part of any story.\n\n[b]Dialogue:[/b]\nDue to the fact that there isn't any voice actor, the dialogues won't fade away unless you click on game screen. It's great for someone who isn't good at English like me since I can't read English really fast, on this game I can slowly read and understand every bit of what the characters are saying.\n\n[b][u]What I don't like about this game:[/u][/b]\nChapter 6.

(e.g.:) Missing sensible characters, correct choices don\u2019t align with player\u2019s intuitive thinking on the problem, game lacks the atmospheric depth and detail that make it immersive, and they often include overreaching or predictable plot elements that fall somewhat flat when played. \n\nThis game dodges those pitfalls like a champ.  The storyline is novel-worthy - the immersion, tone, and general charisma of the game are superlative, while managing to strike a delicate balance between elements of adventure, horror and comedy. The (very) innovative and well-executed use of claymation lent profoundly to the overall ambiance and tone of the game. \n\nWell-tailored, organic dialogue coupled with a streamlined and easy-to-use interface make the gameplay seamless.  Normally trading action buttons for a one-click method can trivialize the puzzles or can make the puzzles almost too abstract in an attempt to provide some challenge, but this (pleasantly) was not the case.  The developers tuned and paced the game well by balancing the simpler puzzles with more conceptually challenging ones, to the extent that brute force never feels like the only viable tool in solving the problem at hand. \n\nI don\u2019t like to compare the newer adventure games to the genre-defining point-and-clicks of the 90\u2019s, but in terms of the game\u2019s ability to engage and captivate you as the player, it\u2019s secured a spot in my personal hall of fame next to games like King's Quest, Monkey Island, and Day of the Tentacle.

This is a game that demands that the urgency of the plot be forgotten from time to time in favor of stopping to take in the sights. However the novelty of its art style isn\\'t the only thing The Dream Machine has to offer. Some of its puzzles are absolutely brilliant and though a few did seem to come out of left field, none felt absurd or out of place. A single mouse button takes care of all player actions making the controls very accessible, but also equally restrictive. Frustration is often born of not having enough tools to come up with a variety of possible solutions or to tell the game what you would like to do, and this is a hole The Dream Machine tends to fall into. \nThe game is very much a work in progress. It\\'s still somewhat buggy and is missing its concluding chapter, but it is very playable even without those finishing touches. The individual chapters are a bit short, but they are priced to their playtime, so it\\'s hard to complain about that.

The final chapter was perfect and I can honestly say that I am going to miss this game. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1458785966, "timestamp_updated": 1496362226, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519261", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21814205": {"recommendationid": "21814205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110373845", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 636, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457964786}, "language": "koreana", "review": "'\ub4dc\ub9bc \uba38\uc2e0' \uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud0c0\uc778\uc758 \uafc8\uc18d\uc744 \ud574\uba54\uba74\uc11c\n\ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294\uac8c\uc784. \uc27d\uac8c \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uba74 \uc778\uc149\uc158.\n\n\uc190\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c1\uc811 \ube5a\uc5b4 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \ucc30\ud759 \uc138\uacc4\ub97c \ub9cc\ub4e0 \uc791\uac00 \ucde8\ud5a5\uc774\n\uc70c\ub798\uc2a4\uc640 \uadf8\ub85c\ubc0b\ucc98\ub7fc \uadc0\uc5fd\uace0 \uc544\uae30\uc790\uae30\ud55c \ub9db\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294\n\uae30\uad34\ud558\uace0 \uc6b0\uc911\ucda9\ud558\uace0 \uace0\uc5b4\ud558\uae30\uae4c\uc9c0 .. \ud55c\ub370 \ubc30\uacbd\uc774 \uafc8\uc774\ub2e4 \ubcf4\ub2c8\n\ub354 \ube44\ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uc624\ubb18\ud55c \ub290\ub08c\uc744 \uc900\ub2e4. \ub4f1\uc7a5\uc778\ubb3c\ub4e4\ub3c4\n\ud558\ub098\uac19\uc774 \ubb34\uc12d\uac8c\uc0dd\uacbc\uace0 \uac8c\uc784 \ub0b4\ub0b4 \ud750\ub974\ub294 ost\ub610\ud55c\n\uc6b0\uc6b8\ud558\uace0 \ubabd\ud658\uc801\uc774\ub77c \ubd84\uc704\uae30 \ud558\ub098\ub294 \ub05d\ub0b4\uc8fc\ub294 \uac8c\uc784.\n\n\ud37c\uc990\uc758 \ub09c\uc774\ub3c4\ub294 \ub098\ub984 \uacf5\ub7b5\uc5c6\uc774 \ud480\ub9cc\ud588\uace0\n(\ucc55\ud1305\ub294 \uc5ec\ub7ec\ub9f5\uc744 \uc62e\uaca8\ub2e4\ub2c8\ub294 \uad6c\uc131\uc774\ub77c\n\uc6b0\uc120 \ud574\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud560\uac8c \ubb54\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ud638\ud574\uc11c \uc880 \ud798\ub4e4\uc5c7\ub358..)\n\uc624\ube0c\uc81d\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e4 \ucc30\ud759\ub369\uc5b4\ub9ac\ub2e4 \ubcf4\ub2c8\n\uc774 \uc7a5\ub974 \ud2b9\uc720\uc758 \ub2e8\uc810\uc778 \uc5ec\uae30\uc800\uae30 \ub2e4 \ub20c\ub7ec\ubd10\uc57c \ud558\ub294\n\uc554\uac78\ub9ac\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc740 \uc5c6\ub294\ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4.\n\uadfc\ub370 \uac00\uc7a5 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc774 \uc7a5\ub974\ub2f5\uc9c0\uc54a\uac8c \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc591\uc774 \ub9ce\ub2e4.\n\uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uadf8 \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\uac00 \ub2e8\uc21c \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac \ud30c\uc545\uc6a9\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c,\n\ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc77d\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294\uac8c \uac8c\uc784 \uc9c4\ud589\uc5d0 \ud544\uc218\uc801\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0\n\uc601\uc5b4\uac00 \ubd88\ud3b8\ud558\ub2e4\uba74 \ud29c\ud1a0\ub9ac\uc5bc \uc774\ud6c4\ub85c \uc9c4\ud589\uc774 \ubd88\uac00\ub2a5 \ud560\uc815\ub3c4.\n(\uc774\ub798\uc11c \ud55c\uae00\ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc5c6\ub098\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2f6\uc5c8\ub358..)\n\n\uae30\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uc601\uc5b4 \ub300\ud654 \uc774\ud574\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc774 \uc548\ub418\uace0\n\ub3c5\ucc3d\uc801\uc778 \ud3ec\uc778\ud2b8\uc564\ud074\ub9ad \ucc3e\ub294\ub2e4\uba74 \ucd94\ucc9c.", "timestamp_created": 1457876466, "timestamp_updated": 1506266273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769436", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21808718": {"recommendationid": "21808718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129282197", "num_games_owned": 880, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457856436}, "language": "italian", "review": "ma che cos\u00e8 questa merda", "timestamp_created": 1457856471, "timestamp_updated": 1457856471, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.381755", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21525524": {"recommendationid": "21525524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071087524", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495049545}, "language": "english", "review": "I really, really liked this game.

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. \n\nOne Hour Reviews #50 - The Dream Machine\n\nBefore I started my series of reviews, I hadn't really played much in the way of adventure games.  But, it's been nice seeing a resurgence in this genre, and now I've had the opportunity to play through several adventure games.\n\nGoing in, I didn't know anything about The Dream Machine.  So playing it felt a little like going to a movie that you didn't see the trailer for, and you don't even know what genre of movie it is.   And I'm glad I did that because I feel like I've just watched the opening act of a mystery, so not knowing anything ahead of time definitely added to that sense of mystery.\n\nI won't spoil anything about the story, other than to say I enjoyed the first chapter, which I just had time to finish in my first hour of play.  The story kept me engaged enough that by the time I noticed the time my playthough was nearly over.  I think this is one of the better compliments you can give a game when it has that ability to suck you in.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself seems fairly typical for a point and click adventure game.  It involves a lot of walking around, doing some pixel hunting to find points of interest, and picking up things that you'll need to use later.  Pretty much everything I could pick up I ended up using on something, and often in ways I would not have expected.  Besides the \"use this item on this thing\" type of puzzle, I also played a different kind of puzzle that involved turning knobs on a machine.\n\nI did occasionally have some trouble lining up my mouse cursor on the right pixel to pick something up, but it didn't happen often enough to be really annoying.  Also, when you move the mouse to the top of the screen, a bar will pop down with your inventory, but sometimes this interferes with you trying to point to something at the top of the screen.  Other than these couple of minor annoyances, I didn't really run into any problems with the game.\n\nBesides the story, I also enjoyed the art style.  Most of the adventure games I've played have an animated, cartoon like art style.  But this game has a claymation inspired art style which really sets it apart.  I can really tell a lot of work went into the art for this game.  The characters look great, and so do the backgrounds.  Everything has this hand crafted look to it.\n\nI'm not sure if the following chapters are any longer to play, but I could see some potential concern about the game being relatively short (for what you pay for it).  There are 6 chapters total (but the 6th is not out yet).   I wouldn't be surprised if the follow on chapters take a little longer than an hour to get through.  For me personally it's not an issue, as I think the game is worth the price, and would happily recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1456005869, "timestamp_updated": 1456005869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21234400": {"recommendationid": "21234400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117336885", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500928946}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Hell yeah i would recommend this game.

I figured it was just another standard P&C to slog through when I had nothing better to do. On a whim I started playing though, and boy, was I wrong.\n\nI don't think I've been this impressed by a P&C in a very long time. It has its flaws of course, but I can unwaveringly and wholeheartedly recommend it to any lover of P&C puzzle games, especially experienced players looking for more thoughtful challenges (some of which put even Daedalic's better puzzles to shame). \n\nIf you're already intrigued, do buy and play this game. If you're still on the fence or want to know more of what you're getting yourself into, keep reading. Skip to the end for a sum-up.\n\n[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]\n[b]General Format[/b]\nFrom the very start, [i]The Dream Machine[/i] sharply breaks from the by-now-expected P&C conventions: long cut-scene intros, expositional voice-overs, difficulty modes, Captain Obvious tutorials, sparkly \"active zones/items\", and recharging hint systems will not be found here. (There's a vague \"hint mode\", but it's off by default.) There is no hand-holding. You are thrown directly into the water (somewhat literally) and expected to figure it out for yourself. Yes, the first short section does function a little like a tutorial, but it's still one you must navigate on your own. While this kind of no-HUD, no-hints style may seem potentially difficult or off-putting to some people, it's actually nice to see a game that doesn't patronize the player. In other words, it \"speaks to you like an adult\", and duly expects you to think like one. That's incredibly refreshing.\n\nIt also does not follow the clich\u00e9 format of \"random female protagonist solving a mystery she's only vaguely connected with\". I'm all for female protagonists, but it's still nice to see variety once in a while, as well as a protagonist more invested in their own storyline. \n\n[b]Presentation/Style[/b]\nI've always loved games that take advantage of more unique graphic styles, particularly stop-motion. In this case, some aspects of the clay and cardboard style take a bit of getting used to (the characters don't really have facial expressions, for example, or even eyeballs), but it still creates a very pleasant and memorable feel. Anyone out there who remembers the 1996 game \"The Neverhood\" will definitely notice a similar charm. A more contemporary example would be something like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/421880/]Plastiland[/url]. There are no animated sequences or cut-scenes breaking up the flow or art style, like you'll find in a lot of modern games. Clay and cardboard is the omnipresent playing field, and apart from a couple of longer dialogues to click through, the player has control of the protagonist from start to finish - even while transitioning from one chapter to the next.\n\n[b]Storyline[/b]\nThis has to be one of the most in-depth and convoluted (in a good way) storylines I've encountered in a P&C in years. Physically delving into the \"collective unconscious\" or \"dreamscape\" is not a new idea, but the [i]reasons[/i] you venture through them are unique. In addition, the decisions Victor is presented with throughout, whether straightforward, questionable, or bizarre, are ultimately what shape his character and slowly allow the player to sympathize with his personal situation. Victor/the player has very clear emotional and realistic reasons for being proactive in the story, as opposed to the passive \"outsider\" feeling one gets from games with a nonchalant and uninvolved protagonist. \n\nVictor and the other characters may not be very deep as far as personality, but interactions are scripted quite well, essentially turning each character into an archetype anyone can relate to - which is significant, considering the lack of facial expressions.\n\nI was also impressed with the number of times situations or aspects of the story genuinely shocked or touched me. Without giving anything away, the slow realization that occurs at the end of Chapter 5 literally made me gasp. That level of emotional immersion is very rare in my experience.\n\n[b]Puzzles[/b]\nThe puzzles are where [i]Dream Machine[/i] sets itself apart. They involve in-depth thinking and down-to-earth, \"realistic\" logic, instead of \"try every item in your inventory and hope something works\". One of the better initial examples that illustrate that stark difference is the second puzzle involving the hammer and anvil. Yes, it requires a bit of real-world knowledge, but the sense of accomplishment once you pick up on that is extremely satisfying. Some puzzles (like the hammer one) have an obscure hint within the dialogue to point you in the right direction, but most of the time solutions simply require exploration of the environment and good 'ol brain grease. Young Edie's advice in Chapter 4 is a particularly tricky dialogue hint, but pretty darn clever in the end. Another example of \"realistic\" thinking involves the second cube in Willard's dream in Chapter 5. It's such a simple solution, but players these days are so accustomed to [i]over[/i]thinking puzzles that it's easy to miss the obvious round-peg-goes-in-round-hole stuff.\n\n[b]Length[/b]\nEach chapter takes a good amount of time to complete. Even taking idling into account, it took me over 9-10 hours to complete all 5 chapters, which is really good compared to the 2.5 to 3 hours you can squeeze out of many cookie-cutter P&Cs. It's more on par with the length of the better Daedalic games, like The Whispered World or The Dark Eye series.\n\n[h1]The Not So Good Stuff[/h1]\nMy main gripe is with a handful of puzzles. Their common aspect is that you must return to a specific location you previously visited at least once, because something there will have changed that significantly furthers the gameplay (a visual cue or new interactive object), but you are given no indication that you need to revisit that location. You're left to randomly search areas and play \"spot the difference\" from memory. That isn't fun. One of the worst offenders is [spoiler]the near-unreadable cipher that appears in the front office[/spoiler] after you complete Morton's chapter. Solving that puzzle also requires knowledge about another room you probably forgot about, because you used it once already. It's a lot of needless running around unless you keep notes. And don't even get me started on the recipe book and door code in Chapter 3. Clever mechanics, yes, but waay too obscure. I don't like resorting to LPs when the rest of the game is so satisfying to solve on my own. (Note that following a walkthrough can spoil a lot of the \"surprise/realization\" aspects of the story, so a decent amount of patience for the majority of puzzles is recommended.)\n\nThe fusebox puzzle in the apartment was also one I had to look up. I may be in a minority here, but that wire layout made no sense to me (and I've played many similar puzzles before).\n\nFor such a polished game, it was a tad strange to see some obvious spelling errors.

The tutorial segment is extremely cleverly put together and really sets the tone for the whole game.

Nothing ever released has ever looked like this. It is clay and cardboard and little sets that were hand built and shot. So freaking cool.\n\nThe game was built by a small team, and based on reviews, it seems like it has had it's fair share of bugs. I saw none of them. The team has been on top of them, as evidenced by the regular updates and the fact none of the very minor glitches I saw affected the gameplay in any way. They were too minor to even mention. I have seen worse in AAA games. Development team cares about this game, and when I played, it was solid for all five chapters. \n\nThe story is unique, fun, and engaging. The main story is simple, but the complexity of the dreams is where the magic happens. There are characters even within the dreams to interact it, and their responses to the very... well, odd dream circumstances they, as figments of a dream, are in, is spot on. I find all the dialogue to be very well written and thought out. The developers avoided much of the repetition you normally see when trying to put the square key in the round keyhole. This shows a lot of care and thought when even such minor details as \"Item doesn't fit\" type messages were considered and customized for most every circumstance.\n\nThe difficulty level is just right for the average adult or the clever teen (might be a bit scary for kids!). The puzzles are varied, and challenge you to think about things you have seen in your adventures and to combine them with new knowledge and items you aquire. It isn't just going room to room to solve a puzzle in each one, you are challenged to think about how the items in your inventory can interact with each other, the environment, other people, and help you achieve the task at hand.\n\nI would have missed this game if a friend didn't gift me an extra copy. It has not gotten the attention it deserves. Don't miss this game if you have stumbled across it. I can't wait for the final chapter!

They are what I grew up with, and at the end of the day, it's the format I'm most comfortable with.  I've spent my time in WoW, and I loved it, and I recently spent two full working weeks worth of time beating the Witcher 3's storyline, and all of these are great experiences.  None of them can take me back to my childhood, the kernel of my gaming self, like a solid point and clicker.  And this is one of them.  This is an excellent point and click adventure game.  That's all it is, mind you, it's nothing more than that.  It's just what it's advertising -- and in its genre, it is absolutely superior.  The story is compelling, even for an old guy like me, the mechanics are fine, and the puzzle strength really isn't that hard if you're willing to stick with it.  \n\nYes, we only have walkthroughs for the first two chapters.  Thats ok.  Play around a bit and you WILL figure it out, and it will be way more rewarding than just reading through a walkthrough and beating the game in a few hours.  I promise, you can do it.  Remember when we had to order a hint book from Sierra back in the 80s, and by the time we got it, eight weeks later give or take, we figured out the puzzle?  There's no need for a hint book here.  Just keep at it.  And you'll feel a lot smarter when you figure it out all by yourself.\n\nThis game explores a thing that a lot of people have said a lot about, especially while in an altered state, the Dreamscape.  Ah, the Dreamscape, the Holy Grail of all game creators.  Quite possibly, the next bastion of virtual reality, if we really pick the thing apart.  Go read this review again on an energy drink or two.  If we had some sort of device that would let us fall asleep and log in while dreaming, lets be honest, that's another 6-10 hours a night we'd get to game.  That's all I'll tell you about the plot.  You don't need more.  Play the game.

Derri\u00e8re chaque petit d\u00e9tail, une chaise, un pot de fleur, un tapis, on imagine des mains de grands enfants en train de modeler leur petit monde avec passion, et c'est ce que j'ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 dans ce jeu (entre autres). http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=394604560 Dans ces deux premiers \u00e9pisodes on d\u00e9couvre Victor Neff, le personnage principal et sa femme en plein emm\u00e9nagement.

Ici il vous faudra \u00e9laborer une recette pour entrer dans les r\u00eaves des habitants de l'immeuble et visiter le r\u00eave de votre vieille voisine, Eddie. Vous serez amen\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre une \u00e9nigme tr\u00e8s bien pens\u00e9e \u00e0 base de photographies pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 la sauver. J'ai bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 ce chapitre et l'on sent que les \u00e9nigmes deviennent de plus en plus complexes et vous demanderont de faire preuve de beaucoup d'observation et de logique.\n\n[b]Chapitre 5[/b] :\nLe meilleur chapitre jusqu'ici \u00e0 mon sens ! Les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont vu tr\u00e8s grand pour celui-ci : les tableaux sont plus nombreux et la dur\u00e9e de vie \u00e9lev\u00e9e.

As a result, I\u2019ve been buying such games whenever I can get them for a very low price. Of the ones I\u2019ve played, The Dream Machine definitely ranks near the top. Your character, Victor Neff, has just moved into a small apartment building with his pregnant wife. He soon discovers something ominous happening in the building, and must travel through the dreams of his neighbors in order to stop it.\n\nOn the surface, the story does seem rather simplistic, and it is, to an extent. However, each dream you visit has its own story, and it is in these mini-stories where the game truly shines. These dreams range from bizarre, to sad, to creepy, and everywhere in between. There seems to be much more of an emphasis on showing, rather than telling. Simply traversing the dreams of your neighbors is enough to give you insight into their personalities. \n\nAnother point of note with this game is that it is all crafted by hand, with clay and cardboard being the mediums of choice. The environments are, simply speaking, beautiful, and realizing it was all handmade gave me an even greater appreciation for the game. It also adds to the creepy atmosphere of the game, as many times characters are made to be rather grotesque in appearance.\n\nGameplay is your standard point-and-click style. You explore the environments, picking up items and using them to solve puzzles. The puzzles vary in difficulty, with some being quite easy and others being obnoxiously difficult and lacking in any sort of intuitiveness. And while the puzzles can be frustrating and take a while to solve, it is never so bad as to be game-breaking in the slightest.\n\nTL;DR: The Dream Machine is one of the most incredible point-and-click games I\u2019ve played. The atmosphere is truly unsettling, the environments are delightfully surreal, and the story is surprisingly engaging and had quite a bit of depth. The puzzles can sometimes be frustratingly difficult and there is no voice acting, but the good far outweighs the bad.

This is actually what happens. \n\nChapter 1 of the game serves as an introduction to the main character, Victor Neff, his wife Alicia, and the new apartment building they have moved into. The Neffs are pretty endearing characters \u2014 they can be snarky, but they also show genuine affection for each other, and I like Victor's haircut a lot, if it could even be called that. There's also a lot of flavor text in this opening chapter; I'd go as far as to say there's a unique line of dialogue for every incorrect item use and attempted combination, and the majority of them are quite funny. The chapter ends at a rather odd point (I'd describe it as a cliffhanger with no dramatic tension) but since the first two chapters come bundled together it's not too bad.\n\nChapter 2 introduces the Dream Machine itself, its background, and the dream diving mechanic I presume will be used throughout the rest of the game. To be honest, the dream explored in this chapter is kind of dull \u2014 it's a few screens of cloudy rockland that, while soothing, isn't as fantastical as I'd like to see in a game that focuses on dreams.\n\nChapter 3's dream takes place on a flying cruise filled with tons of Victor clones. While the concept sounds interesting, it isn't really utilized to any extent outside of one puzzle, making it seem more like a cost-cutting measure than anything else. This is also the chapter where I started to feel that the unique flavor text was forgotten or cut for time, because most of the lines for incorrect actions were along the lines of \"that won't work.\" It was rather disappointing to try out quirky combinations only for the game to not care as much as it used to. At the very least the ending was fairly touching. This is the last chapter I finished thus far.\n\nThe clay-cardboard aesthetic the game uses is quite pleasing to the eyes. The environments are modeled with intricate detail and the character models are what I'd call creepy but cute. The sound design is great too; for the most part the music in the game is atmospheric background noise I'd certainly call \"dreamlike,\" but there are also musical stings at times which really add emotion to events like turning a book page to discover something terrifying. While there isn't any voice acting, there is a text-to-speech option that can be turned on which uses the exact same voice as the one for Mumble and I personally find that hilarious.\n\nUnfortunately, it must be said that the engine this game uses is terrible. The Dream Machine runs on Adobe Flash, which has been used for other games like The Binding of Isaac and Machinarium, but it simply does not work as well here. Character animations, instead of being made of sprites like in those games, appear to be made from video clips that, at least on my end, take like a half-second to load each time they happen. This includes basic actions like walking, so every time I clicked to make Victor move the game would hang for a moment before he trots off. It just doesn't seem as smooth as it could be, and it doesn't help that on several occasions the game bugged out and failed to load the next scene, causing me to have to quit out and reload to around five minutes earlier.\n\nOverall, I lean slightly in favor of recommending this game, at least for now. It can be plodding at times, and the puzzles can be both too simple and too obtuse, but I like the environments and the plot has kept me interested enough to see how it will end.", "timestamp_created": 1420087623, "timestamp_updated": 1420087623, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13750123": {"recommendationid": "13750123", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012670485", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 1134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420075733}, "language": "english", "review": "*Completed Chapter 5*\n\nPhenomenal point and click adventure, one of the best I've ever played.

When I purchased this game in December of 2012, I paid for a complete game and wholly believed that delivery of a final product would be imminent.\n\nFour years have elapsed since my purchase and the final chapter has yet to be released.*  It's been two years since the release of any new content and six years since the introduction of the first chapter.  Not only hasn't the game been finalized, but the developer can't even provide an estimated release date for the final chapter.  They have, however, posted some news recently--I've been happily informed that they are enjoying themselves in Switzerland and getting drunk off absinthe.  Seriously, that's what they said.\n\nNow I may not know a lot of things, but there's one thing I am sure of--I'm not a bank, I don't give loans to people so they can develop products at their leisure, I don't take part in crowdsourcing, I never buy Early Access, and I definitely would not have purchased this game, or any other game, knowing that it would be at least four years until I experienced its conclusion.  I would not buy a game that I would play for 3 hours, then put down for several years, only to pick it back up again, smack dab in the middle of the story, just to play for another 3 hours.  Who the fuck, in their right mind, would knowingly hand their money over to someone so they could do that?  No one, that's who.  No one would--it's absurd.  Now, knowing that I would never consciously do such a thing, I can only conclude that there has been some amount of deception involved concerning the sale of this game.\n\nI may not have asked when the final chapter would be released, but I did not have any reason to believe it would be at least 4 years until that occurred.  Being a linear point-and-click adventure game, with each chapter only a few hours long and having no replay value, it really doesn't make any sense for someone to sell this type of game piecemeal if there was going to be several years between each chapter's release.  I think it's quite reasonable to assume that this game would have been fully developed within a short span of time--several months, perhaps a year at the most.  Early Access did not exist at that time and I had no reason to believe that Steam was in the business of selling games that were at the beginning of a 6+ year development cycle.\n\nBased on my experience with this title, I will never make the mistake of purchasing another incomplete, [i]episodic[/i] game again and I will definitely not be supporting this developer, by any means, in any of their future endeavors.\n\n*The final chapter was released yesterday, May 12, 2017--five years, five months since my purchase.\n\n\nFor reference, here are the chapter release dates and the time that had elapsed between them:\n\nChapters 1 and 2 - December 2010\nChapter 3 - October 2011 (10 months)\nChapter 4 - August 2013 (1 year, 10 months)\nChapter 5 - November 2014 (1 year, 3 months)\nChapter 6 - May 2017 (2 years, 6 months)\n\nTotal time since the first chapter's release: 6 years, 5 months\nAverage time between chapters: 1 year, 7 months\n\n\nThis review was edited on May 13, 2017.", "timestamp_created": 1410818457, "timestamp_updated": 1494795421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726696", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11941481": {"recommendationid": "11941481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116971759", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464196582}, "language": "english", "review": "I fel ripped off with this game, its only gives about an hour of gameplay for both chapters combined, the story line is pathetic, and the repetivness of so-called portals is just annoying.

Talmente speciale che si merita un parere ancor prima che la serie finisca. Siamo al quarto dei sei capitoli che formano la fantastica avventura di The Dream Machine, e alla fine di ognuno di essi ti senti sollevato e spaventato allo stesso tempo. Sollevato, perch\u00e9 sei riuscito a cavartela tra rompicapi vari (ma comunque sia abbastanza intuitivi, e che richiedono solo uno sforzo un tantino sopra la media per essere risolti); spaventato, perch\u00e9 non vuoi avvicinarti alla conclusione di questo viaggio unico nel suo genere. The Dream Machine travalica il senso comune di avventura grafica, perch\u00e9 trae il suo punto di forza da ogni singolo elemento di ogni singola area di gioco: ognuna di esse \u00e8 viva, respira della magnifica semplicit\u00e0 della clay motion, ti ingloba tanto da farti sentire quell'odore pungente di argilla con la quale ti sporcavi le mani alle elementari. E ancora le musiche, un ambient onirico, emozionante, unico, indispensabile per completare i diversi quadretti brulicanti di vita dei quali il gioco si compone. E ultimi, ma non meno importanti, i personaggi. Ogni singolo personaggio \u00e8 come se fosse un nostro conoscente di vecchia data. Il protagonista, Victor, con il suo fare fatalista, sempre tranquillo anche nelle situazioni pi\u00f9 assurde ed impensabili che affronter\u00e0, \u00e8 uno specchio neutro e cristallino di ogni gamer. Ma le emozioni le senti, le sue e quelle degli altri compagni di avventura, in un mondo dove non c'\u00e8 bene o male, ma soltanto trascinanti gorghi emozionali dentro le insospettabili vite di piccoli pupazzetti di argilla, sfogliate fino al nucleo stesso della loro anima attraverso rompicapi pi\u00f9 o meno originali. Un gioco davvero, ma davvero speciale. Coinvolgente, emozionante, a tratti ironico e sarcastico, ma anche oscuro e inquietante, The Dream Machine entra nel mio cuore assieme alle altre avventure grafiche \"particolari\" come quelle dell'Amanita Design, con le quali condivide le perfette atmosfere musicate, ma che in pi\u00f9 porta con s\u00e9 una sceneggiatura e dei dialoghi suggestivi e mai noiosi.

The puzzles also advance in difficulty, and while they are occasionally hard, they are mostly logical, and generally feel well worth the effort.

I was taken by the look of it and I am a fan of point-and-click adventure games. I'm still very happy that I stumbled upon this game.\n\nThe artwork is amazing and adds a depth to the game that complements the story very well. The few animations that are present feel natural for the artstyle even if they aren't perfectly smooth. I can appreciate the time that goes into creating each scene in this game.\n\nThe story has been very captivating thus far. It builds up very well and I feel very anxious to continue the story after each chapter. Although it would be nice to have audio instead of full text, it is very easy reading with short clips of text instead of walls.\n\nThe actual gameplay is pretty generic for a point-and-click adventure game with puzzles and a fair amount of walking from room to room using simple clicks for mechanics and a few drags to piece things together. For a real story-driven adventure game, though, I can deal with simple mechanics that allow for greater concentration on the puzzles, story, etc.\n\nThe developers are working hard at keeping the game updated and fixing any known bugs or issues. Fortunately, I haven't come across any issues with the game, myself. They've been constantly refining and adding to the game so it's likely better to pick up a copy later in development. It has been released on more and more platforms as the game ages.\n\nThe only real qualm that I have with the game is the extremely slow release of the chapters. When I purchased the game, I believe chapter 3 was just being released or had just been released. The release date for chapter 3 was October 31, 2011. To put the delays into context, chapter 4 was just released August 6th, 2013. I'm never one to mind waiting for a delay on a release for a well-refined product but that was a bit extreme. Fortunately, the developers have mentioned a release for chapter 5 in just months instead of years. Here's hoping. A miserable part of waiting so long is you have to revisit places and puzzles you've done in previous chapters; however, the game is quaint enough and easy enough to follow that forgetting shouldn't be a problem for most.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game. The price isn't bad and it does go on sale on Steam. There is a demo available on the official website that allows you to play the entirety of chapter 1 through your browser. I'd say that the demo, at least, is a must-play. http://www.thedreammachine.se/", "timestamp_created": 1401667156, "timestamp_updated": 1401667156, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10316396": {"recommendationid": "10316396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055789798", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 2991, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505687492}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a pretty good point and click puzzler, with a bit of a creepy vibe.

The developer's were able to capture that very rare \"spark.\" While it may be a little short (I really took my time and it took me an hour per chapter), it is one of immense quality. Overall 9.5/10.\n\nThe Longer: \n- Gameplay: \nIt is your standard point-and-click adventure game. You are given a small story or situation and you have to solve puzzles to progress. My only real complaint, which isn't much of a complaint, is the sudden advancement in difficulty. In the first two chapters, I didn't really come across any problems/difficulties. The third chapter was really hard! You'll understand when you have to make a certain drink. \n\n- Music: \nI loved the soundtrack. It matches the situations and environment very, very well. It ranges from the caretaker's creepy jazz song to minimalistic ambience to Silent Hill-esque rhythms.  \n\n- Story: \nThis is easily one of my favorite stories that has come from recent gaming. Without giving too much away, it begins as a simple tale about a couple moving into a new apartment. Soon, it evolves into an (without exaggeration) epic adventure involving the dream world, a science project gone wrong, and horror. \n\n- Graphics/Environment: \nThe clay animation was a really smart artistic choice. It helps to add a fresh perspective on the genre. The environments are all interesting and enchanting. The characters are... scary looking. \n\nTo the developers, I sincerely enjoyed your game.", "timestamp_created": 1392570083, "timestamp_updated": 1392570083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663218", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9110272": {"recommendationid": "9110272", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971300161", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1400437743}, "language": "english", "review": "This game crashes a lot for me so make sure and save it *frequently*.

Something is amiss, however, and soon you learn that you'll have to take it upon yourself to stop a sinister plot where your dreams, and the dreams of all the apartment residents, are being infiltrated by your land lord and his out of control contraption. The graphics are marvelously creepy, being claymation, and the soft ambeint music and horror-like storyline set the scene for a truly challenging adventure that will have you immersed for hours. \n\nGame play wise, I will say that some of the puzzles may be easy to solve in a few minutes, and other may take hours, or even days, depending on your thought process and how you deal with puzzles. There are puzzles for all types of people, so while I certainly don't suggest that you cheat, it's always fun to team up on this game. Some of the game play can get slightly monotonous while you're stuck, which can be frustrating. (But such is the bane of adventure games.) There were also a few times where I thought I was supposed to be trying to solve a puzzle to unlock something, but it wasn't time for that in the story yet. Still, when things become clear, it's easy to sit down and focus on the puzzle intently.\n\nThe story line is creepy and unsettling. It is not a full out horror tale, but at times it can be graphic and disturbing. It also moves slowly towards the disturbing, and as you get further into the plot it becomes stranger. \n\nThis IS the sort of adventure game where you may need to keep some scrap paper beside you in order to jot down notes and figure things out. If you are not into complicated adventure games, then this is not for you.

La historia es una mezcla de terror - ciencia ficci\u00f3n - onirismo, donde unas veces destacar\u00e1 m\u00e1s un aspecto y otras veces otro.

The Dream Machine is possibly the best point and click game I've played since Diablo 3. (oh, me!) But seriously, it has great animation and level design, which I think was the selling point of this game, and it has very well thought out dialogue and scripted events that make you guess instead of ASSUME like you would in most other linear games of the same type. It's not predictable - like you can't scroll drably through a converstaion with an NPC and say to yourself, \"Okay, so he's going to tell me to do XYZ so I can go to point A and waste all of my time, etc etc.\" The storyline is very sporadic and almost spontaneous, it seems, at some points, which (I don't know about you guys) tends to keep me around - variety is a good thing. Also, very subtly creepy which is why I bought it. TDM is one of those PAC games that you finish and you, all of a sudden, feel inspired to write a short story along a similarly themed avenue. Anyway, it's good game, worth the 4 or 5 pennies it costs compared to Call of Shitty: Modern 360 No-Scope Double Headshot. So buy it.

It's a surreal point and click done with real models that give the game the feel of it taking place in a 3d diarama. Only the first three chapters of supposed five are out now. The developers are rather coy about if/when the next ones will be made. It's a shame because the story is just picking up by the end of chapter three. Definitely wait until the game is finished before buying.\n\n2017 update now that the full game is released:\nWow! The Dream Machine is amazing! The game starts off slowly, but ramps up to be some of the best point-and-click adventuring to be had anywhere. And the ending was jaw-dropping. I can't believe they went there. The whole story is kind of crazy from the start, but the last level and especially the ending were bonkers. This game provides an ample challenge too. I had to cheat more than usual to finish. So, chapters 1-3 serve as essentially the first act of the story; setting things up. This part was just ok, and featured the worst level, imo, the cruise ship. Beginning with chapter 4, however, the story and puzzles start to get really good. The protagonist has to rearrange his neighbors memories of her apartment in order to progress in the level. Since a lot of the game takes place within dreams, there's a lot of dream logic incorporated to solving puzzles. It was a lot of fun pushing myself to think in more abstract ways. The finale requires using a lot of the different solutions from earlier puzzles in new ways. I don't dare reveal any specifics from chapter 5 on. It just needs to be experienced. The game takes a long time to finish too. It took probably 19 hours total from start to finish. When the first few chapters were released many years ago now, the diorama photographic quality of the levels and models was visually novel and interesting. However, since then there have been many games to incorporate this visual style much better. So, the visual style comes across as just kind of generic now, with the human characters looking like ugly dolls. But, still, the overall aesthetic is decent. If you're a genre fan, you must play this.

This time, it turns out that the girl and the wolf are the good guys and the grandmother is the bad guy.  Several unique factors make [i]RED[/i] stand out from its source material.  For instance, the protagonists are 3 separate personalities in 1 character...a human girl (with her mother's shotgun), a wolf girl (with her bare claws), and a hybrid girl (with her father's scythe).\n\nNow...the important factors, this game IS short and if speedrun on easy, it should take you about 7 minutes....though playing on Normal may take you about 30-40 minutes (I hate that bridge...).  There ARE in-game achievements, but no Steam achievements...making the achievement factor rather meaningless.  It is also important to note that it is not possible to take snapshots given that Steam Overlay does not work with this game, further evidence that points to this game being made in RPG Maker.\n\nThe artwork of this game...is simply awesome.  I love it!  Characters are well-animated and look great, as does the background scenery.  The feel of the character's personality feel genuine and engaging.  The designs for all the characters are great as well, ranging from charming to sexy!  How this game was released for free is beyond me, but I commend this 3-person development team of Chinese college students for their project.  Well done!  Well done, indeed!\n\nIf I have any complaints about this game, it is that this game is rather button-mashy and it's rather difficult to dodge mid-run on the bridge, making control really confusing and cumbersome.  There are a few typos here and there (English), but it's not anything that makes the game unplayable or any less enjoyable.  This game is also tragically short, but it will keep you occupied for an hour or less.\n\nOverall, I loved this game and highly urge other players to take a look into [i]RED[/i] if they're looking for a game to try out.  Achievement hunters will find themselves sorely disappointed by the achievement feature, but casual gamers will enjoy this new take on an old story.  A good lesson in the class of \"achievements aren't everything\".\n\n9.5 / 10  This game's making me see [i]RED[/i] and I LOVE IT!!!", "timestamp_created": 1515984145, "timestamp_updated": 1515991777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546436", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39197127": {"recommendationid": "39197127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317780083", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "last_played": 1515463697}, "language": "english", "review": "An extremely short but pleasant game.

It has a lot of potential. However... It's too short! It's only about 30 minutes to beat on average! Even Extreme mode only took me about 40 minutes! Anyway, some spoilers ahead, so if you don't wanna see that... Come on, it doesn't take that long to just look at the direction the thumb is pointing. If you're OK with that, read on.\n\nFirst off I gotta say, this game looks gorgeous. The hand-drawn animation looks great, although it feels a little stiff at some spots, but it's very minor, and I can let it slide. The bright red that pops up often looks great against the dark green and brown background. Every hit looks satisfying.\n\nThis game has a very interesting mechanic that allows you to switch between Red's three personalities - the default personality, Red, who wields a scythe, Vermillion, who has a shotgun and a motherfucking cannon, and my favorite, Camellia, the wolf-anthro-human-thingamajig. She doesn't have a weapon, instead fighting with her claws. Each of the three characters have their own health bar, but that's not really used outside of bosses, because...\n\nThe game is pretty easy. Died twice on normal mode, both times thinking I had to dodge the boar on the bridge. Didn't die once in hard. I only had trouble in extreme difficulty, specifically in the mirror boss fight, where I died around six times, and at the final boss, I think I only died twice. You may have noticed that I have only talked about bosses. That's because the stages that aren't bosses are a cakewalk - I'm sure you actually have to put effort to lose those. Every other enemy leaves a health pickup. And those small enemies die really quickly, probably three or four hits will take any of them out.\n\nThe story itself isn't exactly mindblowing, but it's a cute little thing that put a smile on my face on my second playthrough. Beat the game yet? Told ya it was short. Anyway, the reason I specified the second playthrough, is because when you get the normal ending, the game gives you a hint - more like gives you exactly what you need to know - to get the best ending. It isn't subtle at all, but I'm happy it's simple and doesn't ask you to crouch next to a a random wall for like half a minute without pressing anything else. (Looking at you, Castlevania 2!) It's a very minor change, but it's adorable. When I saw what was happening, I thought I was going to be depressed for the rest of the day - glad I wasn't.\n\nThe controls are good. A bit stiff with the jump arcs, but it's nothing major. It may be the engine holding it back, half the time. Oh yeah this game is made in RPG Maker and that's just mindblowing. I, err, may have used the dodge/block button way more than I actually needed to. I just like blocking hits perfectly. It also allows you to counter hits easier, so yeah, that's pretty useful if you ask me. It bugs me that there's no evident controller support, but if it makes it any easier for you guys who are used to WASD movement, you CAN rebind keys! Personally, I set my controls to WASD to move, K to attack, J for special attacks, L for blocking, and 1, 2, and 3 to change into Red, Vermillion, and Camellia respectively. Now, the reason I said Camellia was my favorite earlier... She's fast as all hell. Seriously. I love how fast her attacks can get, and her aerial special attack is a spike, straight from Smash Bros. I love it.\n\nEach of the different personalities have their own health bars, which means if you're running low on health with one, you better be either: 1. Really good at blocking perfectly. 2. Switching to another personality right this second, 'cuz that's not automatic. I feel there may be some inspiration from fighting games like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 (that one's the only one I actually played so SHHHHH), but I like that it's actually tied into the story how the one character can swap into another in the press of a button without changing her position at all. You aren't just shown the three personalities working together, you experience it firsthand. And it makes the true ending that much sweeter.\n\nBuuut, I'm pretty sure I'm dragging this out WAY longer than I should. The game has potential. I would love to see something like this, but expanded. And in another engine. I've heard RPG Maker is pretty... Limiting. As in, it's only made to play a specific goddamn genre. I still can't believe this game, well, exists.

Nuff said.\n\nActual review:\nGreat game, the first time i played it i picked Extreme difficulty (My table hates me), it took me about an hour to defeat because of all the bugs and unfair moments I've met on the second boss;( [spoiler] your mirror. [/spoiler]\nI truly recommend you this game, awesome for how short it is, truly enjoyed the boss battles ( [spoiler] Even tho i went extreme difficulty on my first time playing it. [/spoiler] ), just don't go on extreme difficulty right away like i did, if it's your first time playing, try normal mode first, it's the opposite of what i did, and my mind and table want to murder me now.\n\n\nMy opinion:\nSo much fucking bullshit happened to me while fighting the first boss ( [spoiler]Mirror[/spoiler] ), like: Boss covering every time i use my ability, boss moving when my ability activates, and many more.\n\nTo devs:\nThe strength of the first boss is insane (atleast in extreme difficulty), the only way of defeating him is going ranged and keeping a good distance from the boss (unless you manage to master the fighting (like i did) and master the dodging (like i did)), because It's impossible to stop the boss's combo, once she begans, she takes half of your hp away, and when it stops, you have to dodge away in 0.5 otherwise the boss does her combo again, it's pure pain.\n\nGood strategy for final boss:\nUse your third stage to dodge around and get fast attacks on the last boss, especially his third form ( [spoiler]The one after the egg[/spoiler] ), whenever you see her lifting up her front legs, dodge behind her and continue your attacks, do that everytime she does it, and you have a 100% win, even on Extreme difficutly.\n\nMe:\nExtreme dif.f finished in around 40 minutes\nEasy diff. finished in less than 10 minutes (with the second ending)\n\n\nGreat game.", "timestamp_created": 1491676952, "timestamp_updated": 1491741635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.414330", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30731432": {"recommendationid": "30731432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120936315", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501112923}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "SHORT, BUT WONDERFUL GAME.

I rather enjoyed the  several 20-30 minute play throughs i did, and i believe there is alot of potential in this game, if it continues to get updates and more content.\n\nThroughout the game you will encounter different flaws such as the translations not being fully acurate, and maybe even a little cheesy and quite weird at some points. The combos can be a bit clunky at times. While there is a little variety, theres just not quite enough to make it a more fluent experience. However that could also just be me being crap at this sort of game. I also think they could have put a bit more effort in the characters names, and by this im not realy talking about the main character Red, i mean others that are in the story, more notably green and brown. Also there is no voice acting, but that isnt so important in this type of game i would assume.\n\nOk so that's basicly all the flaws i found with the game, except for the menu and lack of settings, but thats kind of expected in this type of game. Now lets get into some stuff i think are going well with the game.\n\nYou play as Red. A unique character that i think is a very strong point in this game. She shares her body with two other personalities, vermilion, and Camellia. They both have their own unique combat style and looks, and personalities.\n\nWhile the story is a very simple go from point A to point B, it actualy still has a pretty deep story jammed into the 20-30 minutes. You will find out the backstory of your own character and even several others. You will also come across several different monsters that all look magnificent, and bosses with their own attack patterns.\n\nThe game looks amazing with stunning environments filled filled different plants, and various things to find by pressing the space bar( This is how you unlock the 2nd ending, you have to find a specific item).\n\nThe sounds in the game are well put in, including the music. I didn't feel that it was so repetitive that i would want to turn of the sound. Like many other games out there.\n\nWhile there is no steam acheivments, and the developer has stated there are no plans to add them, there is acheivments in the actual game. The achievment option will appear in the main menu along with the challange mode after finishing the game for the first time. The challange mode is basicly just vsing the bosses over, while they are scaled in difficulty, and speaking of difficulty, there are several options to choose from. Easy,Normal,Hard,Extreame. I only managed to play on normal, and i found it pretty easy. But as soon as i turned it up to hard, i couldnt even beat the first boss, so there is deffinetly difference in what you pick.\n\nSo overall i think the game has potential and i would like to see more of it. The secret ending wasnt so good for me, becuase of how it handles the main characters. But that doesnt spoil it for it for me, it was stil entertaining.\n\nThis is my first review so it's probably not done right, but oh well.

The story explains why things are happening and its nothing so deeper, the characters are simply and the controls as well. \nIn general, this is a funny and simple game. This game is short, but incredibly charming for what it has. the combat system was very well developed and the main 3 characters that you could switch between all had in-depth and well thought out combos and abilities. the bosses were also nicely made, even the boar at the beginning had rather interesting attacks and every character had a style i could really appreciate. I also found the story to be really cute and endearing. as for the developers i'd have to tell them great job and to keep up the hard work. A short, but very good game. \n\nAt first, when i saw they are going to do a real-time fighting game in RPGMaker, i thought: \"it's gonna be slow due to custom scripts, that's what always happen\". But they managed to optimize it to such degree that on Windows 7 it runs smoothly and without any frame drops. Moreover, it's a real fighting, with combos, move interruption, combo counter, etc.\n\nStory is predictable, but nice anyway. English translation contains affordable amount of mistakes, it never took me more than 10s to figure out what they meant.\n\nOverall 9/10.\n", "timestamp_created": 1486690273, "timestamp_updated": 1486690273, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29805296": {"recommendationid": "29805296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197937466", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486657548}, "language": "spanish", "review": "este juego esta.. bueno, es una hitoria muy corta donde todo puede que sea predecible hasta el final, a la hora de jugar es corto tambien pero entretenido en distintas dificultades.", "timestamp_created": 1486658946, "timestamp_updated": 1510428219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29799453": {"recommendationid": "29799453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155923418", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486639587}, "language": "schinese", "review": "30min\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u73a9\u51fa\u7684\u662f\u771f\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u522b\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u771f\u7ed3\u5c40\u5f88\u559c\u6b22\uff0c\u5dee\u70b9\u4ee5\u4e3a\u771f\u7684\u53ea\u80fd\u5b64\u72ec\u4e00\u4eba\uff0c\u5dee\u70b9\u60f3\u5bc4\u5200\u7247\u7ed9\u5199\u5267\u672c\u7684\u4e86 \u3002\u603b\u4e4b\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u597d\u6e38\u620fdesu", "timestamp_created": 1486639797, "timestamp_updated": 1486639797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29787084": {"recommendationid": "29787084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106804284", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486579258}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un buen juego para pasar el rato.Es corto y tiene una historia decente", "timestamp_created": 1486579310, "timestamp_updated": 1486579310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29725291": {"recommendationid": "29725291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125147874", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486583874}, "language": "english", "review": "Enjoyable game, and even with my way of playing these kind of games (which can be compared to a monkey smashing at a typewriter) I managed to beat all difficulties without having to try again and again.

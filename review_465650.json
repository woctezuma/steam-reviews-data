This game isn\u2019t exactly my cup of tea since I\u2019m not as invested in baseball as the next guy, but I do appreciate challenging strategy games. Out of the park 18 is a baseball managing simulator, akin to games such as Football Manager, which will require some prior knowledge of the sport. \n\nThe level of detail that went into this game is quite outstanding, given the fact that it covers games as far back as 1871, and it even covers various leagues outside of the MLB. With this level of detail, you can expect near infinite outcomes for your games (like the Rockies actually playing well for once).The game can seem a bit overwhelming at first with all the information that\u2019s on screen, but thankfully the developers themselves have made a series of videos that explain all the basics. With all that out of the way, now it\u2019s time for the pros and cons. \n\nAs far as pros go, this game will really make you feel like a real manager for a professional baseball team, and you\u2019re given far more freedom beyond managing your own team (yes, you can even control the other team). You can even select an option to prevent the owner from firing you (nice job, security), so you\u2019re free to do whatever the hell you want without any form of repercussion.\n\nAs far as cons go, there\u2019s hardly anything bad I can say about this game aside from some minor nitpicks. The UI can probably use some fine tuning, but this is probably as good as it\u2019s gonna get, given how much information and options you\u2019re given. Loading times can also be a bit sluggish, but again, this is probably as good as it\u2019s gonna get. \n\nTo sum it all up, the game is a power fantasy for hardcore baseball fans, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely worth a buy if you\u2019re a fan of the sport.", "timestamp_created": 1515017570, "timestamp_updated": 1515017696, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38992014": {"recommendationid": "38992014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119666487", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5078, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1168, "last_played": 1515452245}, "language": "english", "review": "Help", "timestamp_created": 1514935082, "timestamp_updated": 1514935082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38943973": {"recommendationid": "38943973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035094232", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4764, "last_played": 1516426877}, "language": "english", "review": "Endless depth, which is terrible because I'm not getting anything else done in my life. \n\n\nHighly recommended to people with self-control.", "timestamp_created": 1514828164, "timestamp_updated": 1514828164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38938537": {"recommendationid": "38938537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002101477", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514816325}, "language": "english", "review": "I didnt enjoy the game at all.I didnt feel my choices had any real bearing on the outcome.Alot of the outcomes feel pre-determined.I lost 3 out of 4 games by walkoff homeruns,telling me if I didnt score to end a tie in the later innings,the computer was going to find a way to win.No long rallies,most runs scored were by homeruns by myself and the other team.Way too many injuries to the same players as others have stated.I had the same catcher injured 3 games in a row and he was playing only because I lowered injuries as far down as possible.I am used to games such as MLB THE SHOW,thought I would like this as I am a baseball fan and stats junkie,but its not fun having no real control over what and where what pitch is thrown,or being in control of the batter.I thought it might be a fun change of pace,but that wasnt to be.I requested a refund.", "timestamp_created": 1514818246, "timestamp_updated": 1514818246, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38935252": {"recommendationid": "38935252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119602506", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 888, "last_played": 1516421564}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub0b4\uac00 \uac10\ub3c5\ud574\ub3c4 \uc800\uac70\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc798 \ud558\uaca0\ub2e4! \ud558\uc2dc\ub294 \ubd84\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ucd94\ucc9c\n\n[+]\n\uc544\ub2c8\ub124? \ub77c\ub294 \uac78 \uae68\ub2ec\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\n\n[-]\n\ub354 \uc774\uc0c1 \uac10\ub3c5\uc744 \ube44\ub09c\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4...", "timestamp_created": 1514811991, "timestamp_updated": 1514965851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38933083": {"recommendationid": "38933083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334814046", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17860, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2010, "last_played": 1516098964}, "language": "english", "review": "A baseball simulation at its finest.

MLB the Show is more up your alley if that is what your looking for. This is a simulation. The graphics honestly are plain but to understand this game you need to understand that does not matter in the least. \n\nWhat you have here is something any serious baseball fan who knows the sport should be playing. What it lacks in graphics it makes up for in simulation gameplay which is done almost to perfection. There no other game that even comes remotely close to this game that I am aware of. \n\nThe game is simulation and you can make it pretty much easy as just being a manager of a team and thats all. Everything else will be done for you. Or you could go other route be GM/Manager/Commish while keeping up with your minors to the extent you would your major league team all at the same time. Even hiring staff for every staff position is here. Then you have everything in between those extremes. Myself I play as GM/Manager while I let computer play out my minor league games while I judge who gets promoted/demoted/signed/hire staff. Even playing a single game it's up to you. Do you want to just manage and let the players play? Would you rather play your players in deciding if they walk someone/make contact for double play/or go for strike out or would you just let the game do it's thing while you make the calls after next batter is up. FURTHER even... You can go pitch to pitch mode or just tell pitcher what to do for \"that\" batter then decide on next as game plays out. \n\nThe AI can play (and do fairly good job of it) part of the game you may not enjoy. I have sat for literally 20 minutes though weighing pros and cons of a trade. \n\nThat's just sample of what all the power ya have in this game. I'm not even going into create a league, play historic league, international league, etc etc.  It's honestly amazing game. \n\nI cant sing this games praises enough lol. Two issues can think of though. Kind of annoyed females cant be GMs or Managers with Face Generation (seriously I got a beard? What am I a dwarf?) and if you know nothing about baseball and are wanting just arcade type experience stay away from it. \n\nBUT!

Kein Bock auf den 40-Man-Roster ? Kein Problem. \n- Passe die Verletzungsh\u00e4ufigkeit der Spieler Deinen eigenen Bed\u00fcrfnissen an\n- Passe die Genauigkeit der Spielerbewertungen durch die Talentsichter an oder schalte alles ab und spiele \"Stats only\"\n- Spiele z.B. im Jahr 1986 in dem sich die Statisken z.b. an dem Jahr 1934 orientieren\n- Willst Du das Babe Ruth zuf\u00e4llig irgendwann in Deinem Baseballuniversum auftaucht als 17-J\u00e4hriger ? Kein Problem. \n- Willst Du das zuf\u00e4llig neu generierte Franchises in Deinem Baseballuniversum auftauchen ? Kein Problem. \n\nSchwierigkeitsgrad auf die eigenen Bedr\u00fcfnisse anpassbar :\n\nWer es sehr leicht haben will in OOTP18 der l\u00e4sst sich von seinen Scouts immer 100% genaue Beurteilungen \u00fcber die Spieler zukommen und w\u00e4hlt ein Team wie die Los Angeles Dodgers die \u00fcber schier unendliche Finanzmittel verf\u00fcgen. Zwar wird man auch dann nicht jedes Jahr Meister aber fast.\n\nWer es schwieriger haben will der w\u00e4hlt ein Team bei dem das Budget jedes Jahr knapp bemessen ist, z.b. die Tampa Bay Rays, und versucht dort Talente zu entdecken und \u00fcber den Draft zuk\u00fcnftige Superstars zu verplichten und zu f\u00f6rdern in der Hoffnung eines Tages die Fracnhise zur ersten Meisterschaft zu f\u00fchren. \n\nWer es ganz knackig haben will der schaltet alle Ratings ab und macht sich selbst zum Scoutdirector und muss herausfinden wie gut ein Spieler ist, allein anhand der Beurteilung von Statisikten. Sp\u00e4testens hier ist OOTP18 kein Spiel mehr sondern eine Wissenschaft.\n\nNegativ :\n\n- Der 3D-Modus ist von der Grafik her grottenschlecht und ein einziges WIP (Work-in-Progress). Die gute Nachricht ist : Er ist \u00fcberhaupt nicht notwendig und sowieso nur ein zus\u00e4tzlicher Zeitfresser.\n\nFazit :\n\nOOTP18 ist ein phantastischer Baseballmananger der an Komplexit\u00e4t nicht zu \u00fcbertreffen ist. Neulinge werden enorme Einstiegsschwierigkeiten haben aber wer sich einmal zurechtgefunden hat wird dieses Spiel lieben und kaum noch davon loskommen. Es gibt immer etwas zu tun und man steht st\u00e4ndig vor neuen Herausforderungen. Gerade dann wenn die eigenen Stars immer \u00e4lter werden und in ihren Leistungen abbauen steht man vor der Entscheidung ob man einen Rebuild einleiten soll oder nicht. \n\nGerade die Rebuild-Phase ist in OOTP eines der spektakul\u00e4rsten Ereignisse \u00fcberhaupt. Die alten Stars gehen und neue Talente kommen. Schaffen es die Neuverpflichtungen die eigene Franchise wieder zum Titel zu f\u00fchren oder hat man sich verplant und man sitzt nun auf ultrateuren Spielern die leider keine Superstars geworden sind und sehnt sich nach den alten Zeiten zur\u00fcck ?\n\nOOTP18, geilstes Spiel ever !!!!!  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512306497, "timestamp_updated": 1512306497, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38023291": {"recommendationid": "38023291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264273877", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1532, "last_played": 1515891973}, "language": "english", "review": "High Quailty Baseball game for everyone to enjoy.

If you like sport management games, you're going to love this one. This game has better trade mechanics than any other game I've played. It also has a non-repetitive realistic feel to it.\n\nThis game is basically just a recreation of OOTP 17 with a couple new things up its sleeve. Basically all the changes they made to the game were aesthetic, so if you don't care at all how the game looks, get OOTP 17 for sure. The one really nice aesthetic feature in this game is the 3D representation of what's happening on the field. It isn't much more than a few chess pawns running after a white dot, but it gets the point across and it's really helpful to stimulate my imagination.\n\nThe one notable addition that is not aesthetic is the fact that you need to warm up your relievers. I love this element of the game as it makes feel more like real life.\n\nOverall, this game is balls to the walls if you're the type that likes sports managements.\n\nAlso, how I've learned to play many seasons in a relitively short amount of time is that I start a game and immediately simulate it until the 7th inning. Then, if it's close, I finish the game play by play, and if it's not, I'll just similute the rest of it. This is how I've played 17 seasons, won 2 World Series on two different franchises in roughly 130 hours between the two games.

A lot of information to gather and digest, which I find as a plus. Easy to locate what you are looking for in your league. I enjoyed going through the rule five draft, winter meetings and international signing period. It really is a fun enjoable time building a team up. I'm looking forward to the many years with my Mariner team. \n\nWhat i don't like about it: Trades need to be set to low. If any higher than it feels like the CPU is just wheeling and deeling like there's no tomorrow for their team. This can be true just not for all major league teams. I also don't like the personalities and expections of some of the players. They are not realistic. I can understand some not wanted to be demoted to Triple AAA but so far i have had too many upset for minor things I would say.\n\nOverall, I think it is worth 20 dollars and the value for that 20 is huge. Only minor issues with it and nothing game breaking yet.", "timestamp_created": 1511338638, "timestamp_updated": 1511338638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36687023": {"recommendationid": "36687023", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966904631", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512325355}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to get into, I manage the games in the first and last month and sim the rest. I started in single A, and now im a manger in a AAA league in the year 2024. \n\nPros: \n\nIf you want to sim all games and see where you end up, you can do that, the AI seems to figure out a decent lineup, and pitcher rotation. If you want to play every game and manage your lineup and  Pitch each at bat, you can do that. I'm more of a sim right now, but in the future when I get a feel of the game better, I may go full play through.\n\nAll the stats available, stats that I haven't even heard of. \n\nBeing the GM or the manager of the club, or you can be both. If you don't feel you're making enough progress with your club, you can readily change to maybe a small major league team if your current team isn't promoting you.\n\nGreat game to play while listening to podcasts.\n\nCons: \n\nThe AI of the major league team makes some weird moves during the season. My Ace pitcher went from AAA to the majors, and then sent him down to single A. You'll be lucky to see the same people on your team for 2 years. Your team does as well as the major league team GM feels like giving you.\n\nNo finances in the minors, cant sign low level free agents(that I've seen), can't set the price of a hotdog, can't expand the stadium.

Perhaps even Owners could offer take it or leave it offer. As for hiring personnel, we should be able to pursue bench coaches with an offer if we wish to offer them a management position on the ballclub.. as well the hitting/coaches in minors into a management position if they are interested in that. If a manager on a club gets fired, as in real life, the current clubs hitting/pitching/bench*/training should be able to pursue other offers on another team or choose to stay with the current club as it happens in real life.

Jumping in as a relative newbie to baseball, but relatively well-versed in sports management games (Football Manager, Eastside Hockey Manager etc), I found OOTP tough early on. There's very little hand-holding, but both the developers and fans have put out a plethora of great tutorial-type videos, explaining what is going on and how to make sense of it. Once it clicks, OOTP 18 is as extremely addictive as 17. (I should probably point out that most of my hours are offline.)\nThe breadth of gameplay options - slowly working through seasons as a manager, or burning through one in roughly an hour wheeling and dealing your way to a World Series as a GM - is complemented by the scale of clubs to manage and leagues to work in: fictional, present day and past. As a Football Manager player, the latter of these interested me especially. Being able to do-over certain seasons with past players can be great fun. Similarly, the game is extremely freeing: if you want to simply build a team of All-Stars and see how they fare, you can prise players away from teams through options like Commissioner mode. If you want a stiff challenge where you can't 'cheat' the AI in trading, there's the new Challenge Mode. However you want to play, OOTP tries to cover it, and the attention to detail is absolutely staggering.\nThough not as flashy as big-budget sims like FM, Out of the Park's 3D visuals and FaceGen is nice enough. 18 is perhaps not worth it if you are an owner of 17, or not into baseball: unlike other sports sims I've played with only a passing interest in the sport and enjoyed, OOTP needs a level of interest in baseball to really be fun.

If you like FM-style sports management games, this is the best of the bunch.\n\n- Realistic presentation. The roster, trading system, strategy, injury timing etc seem very realistic to me.\n\n- Masterful AI.

Nice try with Justin Turner's look. Would prefer realistic pictures of the players to inject more realism into the game.\n\n- What's the difference between a 'save' and a 'backup' though?

Leider ist viel Vorwissen gefragt, wer sich nicht intensiv mit dem Sport besch\u00e4ftigt wird nicht viel mit dem Spiel anfangen k\u00f6nnen. Dazu ist das ganze Spiel nur auf Englich verf\u00fcgbar.\nMan hat die M\u00f6glichkeit zwischen verschiedenen Spielmodi.\nZum einen hat man die M\u00f6glichkeit eine Karriere zu starten und bei einem Team anzuheuern.\nAu\u00dferdem kann man alte Serien und Partien nachspielen.\nWer will kann auch seine ganz eigene Baseballwelt mit neuen Ligen gestalten.\nAlle Spielmodi sind sehr umfangreich, auch deswegen weil das Spiel von der MLB lizensiert wurde. Somit haben Trainer und Spieler echte Namen und realistische Attribute.\nNach 70 Stunden habe ich mittlerweile immer noch nicht alle Modi und Funktionen ausprobiert.\nAlso hier ein ganz klarer Pluspunkt f\u00fcr den Umfang und den guten Managementaspekt, wobei man f\u00fcr das Spiel sehr viel Einarbeitungzeit ben\u00f6tigt.\n\nDer Sound:\nMusik ist im Spiel kaum vorhanden. Sounds sind nur w\u00e4hrend eines Spiels zu h\u00f6ren, sie geben dem Spiel etwas mehr Atmosph\u00e4re.\n\nDer Look:\nDer Look des Spiels besteht in der meisten Zeit aus vielf\u00e4ltigen Men\u00fcbildschrimen.\nW\u00e4hrend eines Spiels hat man die M\u00f6gkichkeit zwischen verschiedenen Ansichten zu w\u00e4hlen.\nMein Favorit ist die 3D-Ansicht, welche sehr nett gemacht ist. Es gibt kleinere Grafikfehler, ich empfinde diese aber nicht als sehr st\u00f6rend.\n\nFazit:\nWer eine recht lange Einarbeitungszeit in Kauf nimmt, bekommt eines der besten Managementspiele der letzte Jahre. Das Spiel besitzt einen unglaublich hohen Suchtfaktor, auch bemerkbar wenn man mal wieder einfach nur stundenlang durch die vielf\u00e4ltigen Statistiken st\u00f6bert. \nF\u00fcr Baseballfans ein Geschenk, das das Warten auf die neue Saison erleichtert, f\u00fcr alle Managementfans vielleicht einen Blick wert.

I wanted to inject a new team for my local market into the historical season that was my favorite of all time and though it took me some fiddling in the new game screen I was able to set it up and it works just as you'd expect.\n\nIt's not going to win you over with graphics; the UI can be arcane; and some knowledge and love of baseball is a requirement to even consider it.  But if you're okay with these things this game is a deep, fun and rewarding experience.", "timestamp_created": 1508086091, "timestamp_updated": 1508086091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35736266": {"recommendationid": "35736266", "author": {"steamid": "76561198428366969", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4907, "last_played": 1516462857}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc7a5\ub09c\ud558\ub0d0?\uc2e4\ud589\ub3c4\uc548\ub418\uace0 \ud658\ubd88\ud574\uc918\ub77c \uc6d0\uac00\ub85c\ud558...", "timestamp_created": 1508040001, "timestamp_updated": 1508040001, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.341379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35735746": {"recommendationid": "35735746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082990606", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515309722}, "language": "english", "review": "heyy thats pretty goooood", "timestamp_created": 1508038026, "timestamp_updated": 1508038026, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499682", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35708422": {"recommendationid": "35708422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057173557", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 75207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1697, "last_played": 1516395967}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing since Ootp 14.

The interface does take some time to adapt to, but once you do, you'll already be hooked on the game.  The game presents multiple challenges to overcome, on either the manager or general manager track, and there is nothing quite like putting a team together in the winter and watching it evolve over the season.  You have to manage injuries, slow starts, rising minor league stars, and aging veterans; you have to keep your attendance figures up and your fans happs as you spar with miserly owners, micromanaging GMs, and the public at large.  You do all of these during the course of the full season, and you watch with agony as you go through each game, getting closer and closer to September and (hopefully) October.

I recommend THAT game.\n\nIn OOTP 18 they messed up the way the screen size auto-adjusts at first launch, so you have to do it manually. That would be no problem but when you do it manually it messes up the FaceGen (because you surely want to play on full 1920x1080 but that option makes the screen resize--as it should--and when it does it messes up FaceGen). The devs keep telling people it's them, but it's not \"them\", \"you\", or \"me\". It's the devs. They messed up and they don't know where.\n\nI went to Google and I fiddled with the initial game setting options regarding FaceGen and that sort of worked. So now my team has pictures yet new pictures that are made appear in the profile page but don't appear on \"hover over\" anywhere else unless you have sex with them, or so it feels like it, I suppose I could just ask it to make ALL pictures and be done with it but I see no need to have Minor League pictures and I'm not into fixing their problems. This part worked just fine in OOTP 17.\n\nThe old problem of a custom made character's fielding stats (all of them) abruptly changing from 250 to 200 is still present (even at change set to 1). You have to check your custom made character every in-game month and then save outside the save location (you need a backup you can throw into the current save game location just in case it borks up on you). This is in Commisioner Mode and you should play that way if you want to fix odd things that WILL happen. You should also auto-save every month.\n\nIf you don't care about FaceGen or the 3D (which is really poorly implemented--they could do the 3D better in 1986) then the game is okay. But this game IS about the FaceGen AND the 3D so just buy OOTP 17. The FaceGen is actually better in OOTP 17. It works as intended. You don't need what the devs call 3D.\n\nOOTP 18 is just a slightly modified verion of OOTP 17 and made only for profit while the devs tackle the problem of how to make 3D more than just matchsticks moving around the field. And those matchsticks sometimes make catches while the voice says \"it drops in for a hit\". The Devs have always been good and \"on top of things\" but they bit off a bit more than they could chew here. They still try to help though. I give them credit for that. I suggest they actually buy the game on Steam on a high end PC, install with Steam and see what happens.\n\nI have both games. OOTP 17 is the MUCH better game (unless you don't care about FaceGen). But the FaceGen is still better in OOTP 17.\n\nNote: Given the amount of positive reviews it's possible that some or even most people will have 0 problems with OOTP 18. And yes, I did reinstall, restart, and ran Steam in Admin mode and had sex with the FaceGen settings. And yes, the game itself works just as well as OOTP 17 but my FaceGen is a bit off, which is not the end of the world. By all means buy this game if you wish to support the Devs. It's just that OOTP 17 works the same and FaceGen works as intended.

I untick the trade alert messages because it is just spam. \n\n- Lower scout accuracy in challenge mode, I think normal accuracy makes it too easy to pick better players than the AI. Even the low settings seem a bit too accurate. The low settings seem to overrate players, but those players are still close to their predicted ratings. \n\n- More intelligent AI draft choices, as a successful team consisently going deep in the playoffs I was able to keep my minor league system top tier through the drafts. This was over a 30 year span, I was hoping to face a little more adversity or need to make moves to bolster my minor league teams. My top choices were consistently left on the board in the rule 5 draft and first year draft. \n\nI will say though, during the international amatuer signing period, the AI does a good job recruiting the better recuits in this class, I think it is because the draft pool is limited. \n\nAs it stands the game is still the best sports game on PC, with a few AI tweaks and improvements OOTP 19 will build upon an already incredible franchise.\n\nOH and one more thing, in the 3d mode it should show which pitch the pitcher threw + velocity instead of just the velocity.", "timestamp_created": 1500630479, "timestamp_updated": 1503794578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33675254": {"recommendationid": "33675254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079766353", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509078296}, "language": "english", "review": "This is all I have wanted when playing sports games throughout my life.

I sigh genuinely thinking about that.\n\nPablo Sandoval legging out \"doubles\" on base hits to right, (3x in a 3 game series, the dude might have done it once his entire carrer, and thats possibly with the RF falling over.) and balls landing right where the character spites are in 3D engine shows them at but not being an error is confusing and frustrating to the point I wrote this as a negative review.\n\nIt's frustrating. this game has just about everything I'd want, but the mechanics of the sim seem extremely odd. You can have HOF caliber fielders not gunning down the slowest baserunners in MLB history taking extra bases..... just really disappointing. \n\nIf they maybe add a mechanic, or make it so outfielders actually try to gun down baserunners more, I can genuinely give this full endorsement. It's just been obnoxiously frustrating to see outfield craziness almost every game via the 3D engine, and the more placid outfielding by guys with max arms. I just... can't having a 4.5 and 5 star outfielder's defens basically not showing any signs of mattering within the game engine if i want to play through the games/manage vs a straight sim.", "timestamp_created": 1498779355, "timestamp_updated": 1499482761, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499248", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33010887": {"recommendationid": "33010887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030828870", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504568136}, "language": "english", "review": "New to the OOTP franchise and I really love the game so far.

Will your 1st rounder pan out, or be a bust? Track their performances through your farm system and promote/demote them at the right time! Or hire an assistant GM and let him take care of the kids, while you focus on the big league side of things.\n+ 40-round draft. Your scout will help you rate the prospects on a 10-grade scale (ranging from 0,5 stars to 5 stars), but there's a lot more to it. Taking your time in the late rounds to filter out the best of the \"non-prospects\" can really pay off! \n+ International Complex with up to 50 players, and an authentic International Amateur Free Agency every summer. \n+ HIGHLY customizable game. I play mine \"vanilla\", standard game, standard settings except small adjustments to the AI to make it a bit harder. But it's possible to change basically everything. You can even create your own baseball world, with your rules! (even promotion/demotion!)\n+ League evolution (can be turned off with a checkbox): MLB constantly changes, and so does it in the game! The league can expand, change rules to active/secondary roster, change DL times, lower or raise the mound, increase or decrease years that teams control players. In my last OOTP17 game, the league decreased team control down to the minimum, making players arbitration eligible after their first season, and possibility of unrestricted free agency after only 4 seasons. It created a very interesting challenge. \n+ Authentic rules regarding everything (that I can think of at least). Arbitration, Rule 5, Waivers, Free Agency - it's all in there!\n+ Quick simming: You can play a season in half an hour, or you can play a season in 80 hours managing every at-bat. All up to you!\n\nCan't say much about:\n? Trading. I've heard the trade engine has gotten better and better (it's tough to program an AI to evaluate trades as well as a human would). I restrict myself to only use the \"Shop around\" feature, which basically asks the teams of the league what they\u00b4re willing to give me for a certain player (always 1:1 trades) with Very Hard trading difficulty, and AI Heavily Favor Prospects. If you really wanted to, I'm assuming it's possible to abuse the trade engine to create a monster team though. But just do what I do! Don't! ;)\n? In game managing. I've always played as GM only, and let my manager take care of the games. From what I've seen though, it's possible to call for just about anything as the manager. Hit&Run, Steal, Bunt, Take Pitch, Pitch Around, IBB - it's all there. You can even call for your pitcher to hit the batter. \n\nCons:\n- 3D Engine.  The 3D engine is fairly new, and has definitely been improved since it was first launched. But it definitely has flaws. The graphics are sort of like Football Managers first 3D engine, and some plays just look weird. I had a guy hit a laser line draw into the left field wall, that bounced all the way back to the shortstop for a 6-3 Groundout. \n\nIf you're going to use the 3D engine, please understand that it's just a cosmetic representation of the play, and may NOT  actually be what happened. The above AB's outcome was a standard groundout to short, but the 3D engine picked a stupid way to represent that. So the 3D engine doesn't break your games in any way, it's just \"a skin\" on an already decided outcome.\n\nI kind of enjoy the 3D engines flaws, as you at least get a good laugh out of it every now and then. But if you don't like wonky plays, stick to the text play-by-play.\n\n- It's brutally realistic, and thus can be tough for newcomers to either the franchise, or just baseball in general. I'm swedish, with a long background from other sports management games (mainly Championship Manager and later Football Manager) and had a very rough few first hours back when I was new to baseball. I'm very happy I stayed in the game and learned, as it's very rewarding, very addicting, and baseball a truly amazing sport.\n\nIf you're new to the game and/or the sport, I would encourage you to go to ootpdevelopments.com/board or reddit.com/r/ootp to read some guides.\n\nIt is possible to learn everything about baseball while playing OOTP, but be prepared to spend some time on Google.\n\n\nOverall: Best sports franchise game on the market. Highly addicting, realistic to the extreme, and so, very, very rewarding.

The depth of this game and the content are out of control. MLB licensing has given this game a real boost in terms of its overall legitimacy. Is it immersive and fun to play? It absolutely is.\n\nHaving said that I can only give it a 3.5 at best right now. It seems that there are just way to many carry-over problems from previous versions. However, OOTP 18' really has great potential and should not be discounted simply by what I am about to tell you.\n\nI'm not going in to length here but just a few of the things you can expect if you purchase this game as it is today...issues upfront.\n\n1) Injuries are absolutely out of control. And I mean out of control, this is not a new problem and anyone who has owned this game at any point will happily tell you that. Your injuries will ALWAYS be more significant and devastating than your computer opponents. I jokingly call this game, 'Injury Simulator 2018', for this reason. You will build what seems to be an immaculate team often to find yourself rampaged at some point. Worse still, the AI seems to repetitively use this mechanism to thwart your potential deep runs in to the playoffs. Sometimes you find yourself laughing because at just the right moment, your whole pitching staff will succumb to long term injuries and you think to yourself, 'go figure'.  \n\n2) An aside to the first issue,  it appears to me - at least surficially - that in some or many cases even despite the previously mentioned point, that you can have a team that is built to win a championship and for whatever reason continues to underperform. This for me is the most frustrating aspect of the game. The track records of players going backwards combined with a proper injury history should result in a reversion to the means for many players, statistically speaking. Often this is not the case, you get guys who have performed a certain way their whole career who come to your team and become chronically injury prone and/or underperform. This does not just go for veteran players either. My philosophy is that you get the right coaches, sign players who are only young and durable (I take Toronto so I emphasize rebuild while remaining competitive), Build a pitching staff seven deep and balance every starting hitter with an opposite fill in player. The AI at this point will ultimately use injuries as a balancing mechanism to prevent you from making the playoffs most years regardless of the team you have formulated.\n\n3) You will find some of the in-game mechanics less intuitive and responsive than they perhaps should be. Graphically, there are some glitches that occur (balls get stuck under walls in certain stadiums I.e. Houston, causing P-B-P delay, players chasing after balls that should be fielded by other players etc.). Mechanically, in- game errors especially passed balls still remain an issue. Generally errors tend to be skewed towards your team and in particular in big games. Not major issues and could be easily fixed but inconvenient. The experimental P-B-P should never be activated at this point as it causes each game to go in to the one hour zone. Plus the less than enthusiatistic tone of the computer bot announcer nullifies the excitement of the experience. Will be refined in the future but not too good as it stands.\n\n...\n\n---> All said the game captures the uncertainty of the sport better than any other simulator, albeit in ways that may perplex and frustrate you constantly. \n\n---> And the developers are willing to listen to the community to enhance the gaming experience for all of us, which I have total faith that they will do.\n\n---> Through it all, even though success is INCREDIBLY elusive in this game, it sure is rewarding when things come together. \n\nSo, should you buy it? Well, do you love baseball? Are you cool with a growing experience, a learning process, a responsive team of devs who really do want to make this the best sports simulator on the market?

I still love the game, and can't say enough about how much better this is than anything 2K could ever come up with, but it just feels different. If you let your manager pick the lineups in GM mode, then you have no control over the lineups, to the point where I had a good long reliever being used as a starting pitcher instead of an actual starting pitcher, and having Carlos Beltran, my DH, batting first. I can't think of any situation in which you would want your old, veteran DH to bat leadoff. And the gameplay feels a bit off in some aspects. It's not bad, but it feels different, though I just cannot place my finger on what it may be. However, the interface is fantastic. The design of the game is brilliant. It allows you to take control of a team, and manage them, and it does it right. It does management so much better than any other game I've ever played. When this year's version came out, I was ready to throw my money at them, simply because it's a well made game. The only thing that would make it better is if simulation felt a bit more, well, real. This is a stretch, I know, but if the amazing guys could go into databases like Brooksbaseball, and other sabremetric sites, and compile all that data for each hitter and pitcher, and put that into the game, that would be unbelieveable. And another thing that could be great is if you could download the stats for players from a place like Baseball Reference throughout the season and have each players abilities calculated off those stats, now that would be the cherry on top for me. That last one. If we, the users, could update the stats of every player with a simple download as the season progresses, that would be phenomenal. I'm pretty sure it;s the one thing people have wished for in a sports game since the beginning of time. Or maybe just me. But the idea of being able to just push a button and having evrybody adjusted to how they've been doing in the MLB would be ridiculously awesome. Actually, that's really the only thing more I could want from this game. That. Other than that, it's a fantastic game that will occasionally leave you frustrated, but for the right reasons.

He quickly went to AAA - but his \"ratings/potential\" (not stats but how a scout would view his worth from 20-80 scale) never really moved.  His batting was ok but he was a great defensive player so he had that going for him.  They were ok but that was all.  Then one of my MLB outfielders went on the DL.  I needed to call up a AAA guy.  I had 2 that had already been there but just didn't do well.  \nI had a feeling to just give this guy a shot, especially because my MLB player that had the job before the DL was a decent batter but sucked in the field.  I figured at least anything hit to him would be an out. \nWell that happened and more.  This guy started to hit.  But not out of the world type hitting.  His average is currently around .290 (good but not spectacular) BUT he drives in runs like nobody's business.  In critical situations with RISP the guy is just clutch.  Nearly every time.

I noticed two significant changes from OOTP16 (last version that I owned).  First, the 3D view of the game.  Pervious versions that I played was basically text-only with minimal graphical reflections of the action.  This addition is a very nice touch and aligns with the play-by-play text that is presented.  Since I tend to play all the games (not sim), I have enjoyed this feature much  more than I would have thought.  Another little nuance that I thought was great is after a completed game, there is a nice recap of the game along with player \"quotes\" and a probability of winning line as the game progressed.  The other significant change that I found is the new \"challenge mode.\"  Although this does not fundamentally change the game, you can now compare your results to the other OOTP18 players out there.  Challenge mode restricts a couple things in the game (e.g. player editor, long-term simulation), but does enable your score to be recorded against other players.  These two changes were worth getting OOTP18.  \n\nFor those that are unfamiliar with the series, OOTP18 is a baseball game for all of the armchair GMs and Managers that are out there.  This is the third iteration that I have played (OOTP16 and OOTP10) and the game continues to evolve very well.  As with the pervious couple of versions, OOTP has the MLB and Player's Association license.  As a sports fan, you always wonder about how you would remake your favorite team into a dynasty and now is your chance.  You start with the ability to manage a MLB team today or any year from 1871.  You may also choose one of several International Leagues that are available.  From day one, you can delegate authority to the AI or control everything.  From the GM perspective, this includes player and staff contracts, free agent signings, major/minor league roster moves, drafts, trades, and organizational budget allocations.  From the manager perspective, you set your pitching rotations and lineups.  At that point, you can dive into playing each baseball game or sim through the days.  All the statistics from MLB history is available and its fun starting from scratch in 1871 to learn about the early pioneers in baseball.  The other great thing about the OOTP series is the ability to create your own fictional leagues, uniforms, and designs with the large user-mod community.\n\nThe bottom line is that this game is a must have for people who love baseball.", "timestamp_created": 1495363624, "timestamp_updated": 1495363624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589985", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31858147": {"recommendationid": "31858147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125056522", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495404588}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic game for every stat nerd and baseball fan.

It is very deep, with a lot of different statistics and tables that allow you to see every little detail of every player and every team, psychological model with distinct personalities that can have very different impact on your chemistry, yet very adjustable, and you can delegate simply everything to the AI which is more than capable. But what really sets this game apart from virtually every other one is ability to play every single team from 1870s, with real players, real stats, and real rules. There is a huge difference between a team from the 19th century, the deadball era, and today. Each period has its own rules, and each will play very differently. \n\nTo sum up - this game should be the example for Sports Interactive. Make your Football Manager like this, and I might even consider buying it again.\n\n[h1]What works[/h1]\n1. The deep system of statistics and personalities that make every player unique.\n2. Team chemistry which makes your players interact and work together, with results based on their personality. Some people are nice and make it fun, some will disrupt your team, and a few ones are great leaders who can make a huge difference. Choose wisely.\n3. Customizability - you can customize everything in this game - easily create your own leagues, stadiums, players, personnel, rules, and edit whole countries, without the need to buy in-game editor or some other *** as in Football Manager. Commissioner mode gives you a lot of power, and you are really in charge. Want to create your own award? Done. Add your player to the Basseball Hall of Fame. Done. Create a third Major League? No problem. \n4. Really good AI that is quite capable and fallible like a human. \n5. Game seems very realistic. Outcomes of games are believable and baseball is as unpredictable as in real life.\n6. Your club's owner has his own personality, goals, and a different vision. Act accordingly or else... you're fired.\n7. There are literally thousands of clubs to choose from, including many historical ones. You can play Major League team or a minor one - your call.\n8. The game is very stable, but also offers you a backup feature, so you won't lose your precious database after several decades of playing. \n9. It's baseball so you will literally play almost every day which means even more fun in one season than in soccer.\n10. Other modes are also fun - you can for example play as New York Yankees from the times of Lou Gehring and Joe DiMaggio against 2017 Boston Red Sox or 1960 Milwaukee Braves. You can even play with real players from any period playing together. Lou Gehrig, Ty Cobb, Mike Piazza and Sandy Koufax in one team? No problem. \n11. Face-gen system is amazing and customizable. You can for example choose how many percent of your players will have beards and then how popular each of the beard styles will be, with dozens of them. You can even make them black-white or sepia to be compatible with your era. It's probably the best system in any manager game.\n12. Developers are real baseball afficionados and made everything work wonderfully great - if you will it, it is no dream.\n13. Despite hundreds of teams the game runs pretty fast for me. \n\n[h1]What doesn't work?[/h1]\n\n1. There are still some minor bugs, especially with minor leagues in the 1920s, but those are beint patched quite efficiently and developer support is good.\n2. Game could definitely use some built-in real pictures and 3D models of stadiums (at least major ones) - bur then again, you can find them on the internet and on Steam Workshop.", "timestamp_created": 1494288831, "timestamp_updated": 1494288831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.695748", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31627723": {"recommendationid": "31627723", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044922379", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496327717}, "language": "english", "review": "If you love everything about baseball, this might be the greatest game you'll ever play.

I think to make this review different and add something worthwhile I'll compare it very briefly to Football Manager.\n\nWheras in FM the main gets more complex every year, adding aspects to the role of a manager that no real life manager would ever deal with. \nFor instance a Premiership manager who deals with what a right back in his under 19 squad does in training on a Wednesday afternoon  - to the point they have had to create a second game (3 really) with \"Touch\" and \"Handheld\" being lighter and probably more realistic analogies of what a manager - a single person in the organisation - actually does.\n\nOOTP adds depth but NOT complexity. The game has for many years been split in two Manager and General Manager with the option to do both if you want, but never to confuse the roles in the way FM seems to confuse manager and coach (and trainer and physio and marketing director and media manager and boot boy and....). The amount of micro managing in OOTP is still pretty high, (though this can be varied with game options) but it's also pretty consistent. It's the game engine that adds the depth - not just piling on more responsibilities onto one man in the way FM does.\n\nThe problem is the way FM feels when you lose and you HAVEN'T micromanaged down to the Nth degree. Like \"I could have dug deeper and done something to prevent that) - and in that way madness lies. I've played a 6 hour session of FM before now and in that time the club played 9 games.  Then you get sick of the time it's taking -  turn on all the auto options, the club loses 4 out of 5 games and you think \"I'd better go back to spending almost an hour prep on each game doing stuff that no RL manager would ever even consider doing - just to prevent that happening again\". For me that's when FM feels a lot more like a crazy time management job than a game. I tinker with aspects and sit there thinking \"Who in the hell does all of this IRL?\"\n\nIn OOTP I never feel like that. My remit is clear\nImportantly\n\nin OOTP your success as a GM or M are based on your performance in that specific role. You can be a great manager getting the best out of a poor club or some poor decisions made by the GM - and vice versa. The game acknowledges your own success in your own specific role without making you think you need to jump a fence and take on extra \"plate spinning\" responsibilities and do the work other members of your organisation should be doing. FM will be adding \"Emmersive boot shining and shirt ironing\" responsibilities for premiership managers next - just to add depth to the game... no thanks. That's not what a manager does - that's what a game developer does when he thinks they HAVE TO add more \"STUFF\" every year\n\n\nSorry I think I've made the point :)\n\nSimming?\n--------------\nSimming - Almost every OOTP player sims by week or month or even by season. Perhaps playing \"inning by inning\" or\" at bat by at bat\" just in key games here and there. Baseball is about long lasting trends of players. A rookie might take 2 seasons to develop - and needs playing time at the appropriate level to do so. Your owner might set you a goal to win the division or pennant in 4 years and expect you to do pretty poorly as\"rebuild years\" are a real thing in Baseball that are accepted by almost everyone - even the fans. It's a very different sort of game though back in 2006 they looked pretty similar\n\nIf you love Baseball this is THE management game management version of the game - with  MLB The Show (sadly only on PS4) being the arcade version. If you love text based sims (spreadsheet sims) then this rivals or beats FM but actually plays quite differently\n\nOf course I recommend it.

I now no longer play fanatasy sports of any kind.  Honeslty, I'm trying to get me old FB league to move to this.  The game is so deep and there is so much to do.  You can do it all or you can hire people and assign them tasks to take over.  I started with a fictional league based on the teams that existed (but not the players) and league structure from when Ken Griffey Jr. Presents MLB was made for the SNES.  That was the first great baseball game I ever played.  I kept the structure with no wild card, but my league my eventually adopt one.  I wanted the Pirate's GM job at first, being from PGH but it wasn't available.  So I took over the White Sox and held a league inagural draft.  I did pretty well and within 5 seasons I won the Series.  I immediately (and I mean before the parade), jumped ship to Pittsburgh, who coincidentially I had just beaten for the crown.  \n\nOne of the best parts is that I find myself following both teams,  After the move I wondered if I had sold out the CWS for my one ring before I went to the team I wanted to really make great.  Turns out I didn't even make the playoffs in PGH but the CWS went back-to-back WS champs.  I felt a sense of accomplishment for that though only the shadow of my influence was left there.  Regardless, I was rooting for them.  I also find myself rooting for players, be they guys I took a flyer on or guys I had to let go.  Following careers and debating HOF qualifications in my head for this league has been an absolute blast.\n\nIn my opinion, the game is better than just a spreadsheet manager type game.

Went to finish my registration, but no more token option, and it won't take my password presumably because I never finished the initial process. Tried to change my password, but nope, can't do it more than onece a day. Like a bad comedy. Even when I don't switch to another a program the screen saver comes on, and as soon as I move the mouse - the game disappears. The game is still running, but just not displaying. At all. Which means I have to force close it. I've tried to switch to windowed mode, but that does not seem to be a workable option - it goes right back to full screen.

First the good, I love the improvement in the 3d mode, the game flow is exciting,fast pased , full of action and it's really cool hearing the crack of the bat so crisp and the crowd upgrade is the best I've heard in any sim I've played the crowd seems really connected to the game and not just a lame yay loop that most games put in. The game flow is great, the Stats as usual great, The tounament mode although i am very happy to see it needs work. At first I did not understand that you have to create a league before you can have a touney? WHy? I don't see why you just can't hit the Tournament button and add your teams select what format you want and go. Why so complicated? Also, why no double loss elimination? That is a classic tournament mode and should be in there for folks that like a short tourney. Also, I bought the game on steam so I could get the discount plus the Hockey manager and it did not connect to my OOTP 17 ? How can I get them connected? 17 has real pictures and team colors already together , On 18 I have to start all over! Another problem I'm having is where are the add ons? on the OOTP 17 page the add on link is right on the home page !  Making it nice and easy to DL the latest pics ,ballparks etc. On OOTP 18 I can't find it. The thing that I do not like at all is fictional players and roster changes without my permission. on 18 even though I hit the allow no AI changes button and I control all teams button players were lost aand or ficitonal players added. That has to be fixed. I know your probably working on fixes so I will be patient but, these things need to be done.

My review for 16 stands, for the most part. I haven't had owners die like addicts during a posioning epidemic nor have I had anyone retire due to a carrer ending calf strain either. However, either play this like a management sim and never play the baseball side of the game or do not buy this game.

Great job,dev staff! Even the crowd movements, while somewhat rudimentary, are a nice improvement over OOTP17. Additionally, in 3D mode, the player sprites are a decent improvement over the chesspiece-like sprites in OOTP17.\nMy only \"con\" would be that,after a few hundred managed games with OOTP17, and now a dozen or so in OOTP18...still NO FOUL OUTS ever! I think this is wierd and supposedly the staff is looking into this. That's IT. That's my only \"con.\"\n-The MOD folks do a great job modding the 3D stadium advertising, the player facegens and adding player photos,etc. So what the game doesn't have (and frankly the player facegens are pretty darn good), you can easily download!\n-Here's THE BIGGEST \"PRO\" for me, a long-time baseball PC-simmer: where ELSE can you get EVERY HISTORICAL SEASON EVER PLAYED...included in the game? \nLook, I LOVE APBA; I still do; along with APBA Baseball for WIndwos v 5.75, and still visit that game from time to time. I always will; it's been a part of my life for 40 years. But having to purchase each season seperately and not having a 3D option is their biggest drawback. THIS game, OOTP, has every season, current or past, all the current ballparks, and if I want past ballparks I just have to d-load them from a MOD site. \nAnd did I mention you can manage, GM, or just watch games with current majors AND minors, with real rosters? Manage a game overseas...yours for the taking. Even weather patterns.\nNOTHING is left out.\n---The learning curve in OOTP admittedly is slightly steep, but not much. It's only because there are SO many options.\nIf you haven't purchased OOTP ever, for goodness' sake BUY THIS NOW if you're a baseball sim lover like me.

Fun, strategic, and incredibly deep, OOTP 18 is a step above all previous entries in the series.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there aren't misteps.\n\nA major one is how there is still no major tutorial mode. While at first this game seems like a \"Point and Click simulator\" the reality is that this is a deep and complex series of menus, some of which are incredibly cluttered and hard to understand without expirementing or prior knowledge. If there was an optional mode or at least a \"How to play\" menu, I think it would reduce the pain of newer players settling in.\n\nChallenge mode is new to OOTP 18, and it is awesome. Removing any chances of cheating, making you use all your knowledge of the game to build up a championchip contender. However, with this mode, some things are made heavily abundant. The major one being that TRADE A.I. IS HOT GARBAGE. In challenge mode, the A.I. is set to the hardest settings, which is natural, given the name. However, what results is a trade market heavily dominated by weaker players, with those players being offered for your best. (I.E. Boston Trading Babe to the Yankees for prospects) It's silly, and made worse by the fact that you can't pull that back on them. Want to run a Braves franchice? Good luck with the heavy contracts of Bartolo Colon, Nick Markaksis, R.A. Dickey, and Matt Kemp, which take up over half the total payroll, and are at maximum, 3 STARS OUT OF FIVE! That is bullcrap.\n\nBesides those misteps though? Everything else is excellent. 3D mode is improved to feature small little animations to represent players doing things, and even minor quality of life things like celebrations of walk off hits have been added. It's nice to see the devs putting in the extra effort. Most everything else is either kept from past versions, or slightly updated, but I'm not a huge technical guy.

A new version every year.  I typically get the new version every other year unless the new version has something that I just have to have.

The 90's and 2000's were filled with some great baseball games, but they were dependent upon you being able to hit \"X\" at the right time.  OOTP's early offerings were the first in decades to take the MicroLeague Baseball approach, giving you full control over both existing historical teams and leagues as well as the creation of your own fantasy teams and leagues from any era.  Better yet, they're completely stat driven, with the most \"in game\" influence (if you want) being your job as manager.\n\nOOTP 18 has taken the baseball sim to incredible heights.  They've built upon a core that was already strong and have refined the interface without making it unfamiliar.  Earlier versions had some quirks but they've done a great job of streamlining things in '18.  I especially love the option for animations, as this really brings back great memories of the original MicroLeague Baseball.  While I doubt we'll be able to predict an inside-the-park home run by watching how fast the batter comes out of the box, where the ball is headed, and how fast different fielders are moving to their positions (a MicroLeague classic), the animations should be a nice touch.\n\nTL;DR ...

Coupled with the already fantastic text-based play by play, the game is super easy to follow.  However, my favorite part is not actually playing out the games but watching the brand new 3D highlights of a game after it has been completed.  It is almost like watching the game recap on the MLB Network as you can follow along and go through the whole game in just a few minutes.  There is an option to turn off the scores on the game sim screen.  I like turning them off, simming the day out and going back and watching the highlights.

At first it was a little daunting but after spending a little time on the forums and learning what to set how I wanted it, I became much more comfortable with it. I off-loaded things I didn't want to tackle just yet to my other staff and was able to grow at my own pace. Graphics sort of remind of little Nintendo Wii people but this game isn't about that. It's more about managing players, teams and game situations. I still miss my MVP 2005 but this will definitely hold me over until someone, hopefully, releases a new BB sim for PC.

I have over 1000 hours played in both 15 and 16, and am at about 400 hours on 18. While I like this game, and it is the closest thing to a baseball simulation (as opposed to other 'Madden-style' games that are just arcade games appealing to gamers and not really baseball enthusiasts). The biggest problems with this game seem to keep getting pushed forward into the next iteration, they never fix anything. The devs just update the years players, add some near-useless flash, and put it out as if it's any different from the games you have already bought. Example: Challenge Mode, the 'new' addition to 18. It is virtually unplayable, as the injury level set is so over the top it's laughable. Yes, injuries are part of the game, and injuries force you to provide depth to your roster, I get it. My team was so devastated by injuries my first season that I made sure I had 8 SP for season 2. 2 of them went down for the year in spring training, and 4 more were out at least 4 months by the 6th game of the season. Yes, 6 of my 8 SP were gone before the first week of the season was complete. This isn't an anomaly, either, it's typical. In 3 seasons I never had one single SP start more than 22 games. And my two aces averaged 8 starts a year. The injury levels for challenge mode (the one 'new' thing they added) makes it unplayable. The other problem with this game (that never gets fixed) is that the players have ratings that are supposed to represent their skill levels in various catagories, these skill levels mean almost nothing. You are just as likely to get some scrub pitcher without a pitching skill over 60 throw a shutout or lock you down as you are having Kershaw or Kluber do it. Got an 80 contact, 75 power and 75 eye rating? has this player hit 290 with 35 homeruns 8 years in a row? Doesn't matter, he will hit .189 with 12 home runs for you, because in this game, the ratings don't really matter, it's virtually random who plays well in  this game. I suppose this makes the game unpredictable and replayable to them? I don't expect the players to be exact copies of their previous stats, but I do expect the excellent players to actually play somewhat close to excellent, even if they drop off a little. When you add in all of the passed balls (like 3 a game) wild pitches (also 3 or 4 a game) and HRs by the Dee Gordon's in the clutch against the Kenley Janson's, just to make the game more interesting (and less realistic). While this game bills itself as a simulation for  baseball fans, it plays considerably more like an arcade game produced by math-guys who look at stats and think they know baseball. The game looks right, the box scores look realistic, but the game plays like a video game designed by sports hating nerds who have absolutely no clue about baseball outside of box scores.

For the past decade I've been playing the Paradox grand strategy games like EU4, Vic2, CK2 and Hearts of Iron. These games offered depth, rational AI, and a vast, unrestricted set of choices. It was refreshing during a time when mass-market gaming had been placed on rails and all objectives spelled out for the player.\n\n I was unsure at first about playing a sports management simulator and honestly doubted how different it could be from the career/franchise modes on every other mainstream sports title. I was surprised to discover a game that is possibly the most nuanced, well-designed and rewarding games I have ever played. The way OOTP has recreated the balance between short and long-term goals while staying true to the promise of realism (both in the AI behavior as well as the stats you see at the end of every season) is borderline unbelievable. You control everything about your team franchise from top to bottom including lineups and depth charts to minor league personnel/staffing decisions. Or you can offload it to the AI if you'd rather focus on something else. The scouting system is customizable, but by default is informative without being hand-holding. Managing prospects through trades is fun and interesting. The trade system itself is challenging but not unfair. The AI recognizes the value of team control, long term costs, the value of prospects and idea of dumping good players because they have terrible contracts. Like most things in the game, the difficulty of this subsection of the game can be modified to suit your fancy. The only criticism I have is that the default injury frequency (classic) is simply too high. Setting this to \"low\" seems almost mandatory, and like everything else is a changeable game setting.\n\nDuring the past few years I've spent hundreds of hours in Total War, CK2, Vic 2, Hearts of Iron 3/4, EU4, Ultimate General Civil War.

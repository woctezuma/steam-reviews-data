Er hat seinen Job wirklich gut gemacht. Die Story ist gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils clever konstruiert. Die Grafik ist zwar einfach, aber relativ Stilvoll , wenn man Pixel mag, au\u00dferdem kann man sich dennoch gut in die Geschichte hineinversetzen. Auch der Sound tr\u00e4gt dazu bei, gibt ne ordentliche Soundkulisse und gelungene Musik. Die Puzzles sind eher simpel, das Spiel setzt mehr auf die Story, was ich aber auch bevorzuge, da ich nicht zu lange von konstruierten Puzzles aufgehalten will, aber sie sind vorhanden. (im Gegensatz zu manchen Tell Tale Adventures ;))\n\nDie Spielzeit ist mit ca 3 Stunden zwar nicht sonderlich lang, aber Preis / Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis passt nat\u00fcrlich locker und ich pers\u00f6nlich bevorzuge mal an einem Tag ein kleinen Indie Titel durchzuspielen. Bereut hab ich es auf keinen Fall , f\u00fchlte mich gut unterhalten.\nEinziger Kritikpunkt den ich hatte, die Story ist eigentlich relativ d\u00fcster, aber hin und wieder gibt es schr\u00e4ge Monkey Island Ideen, was meiner Meinung nach etwas die Spannung nimmt. wenn man aber wieder daran denkt, dass es ein Cartooniges Spiel ist,  kann man das auch akzeptieren.

Tambi\u00e9n se va desterrando aquel mal vicio de la prensa de darle un valor supremo a la parte t\u00e9cnica del producto, siendo el aspecto visual el m\u00e1s tenido en cuenta, con diferencia. Hoy en d\u00eda Internet nos proporciona tal cantidad de informaci\u00f3n que un videojuego no solamente entra por la vista, sino que nos puede llegar a interesar incluso por las buenas cr\u00edticas de quienes ya lo hayan jugado. Probablemente sea este el caso de The Last Time, de Big Cow Studios, que dista de ser un portento gr\u00e1fico; ni por asomo se acerca a la categor\u00eda de los mejores ejemplos del pixel art actual. Sin embargo, la cantidad de elogios que se pueden leer en su p\u00e1gina de venta en Steam suponen un motivo suficiente como para que el juego merezca cierta atenci\u00f3n. Ya saben: Cuando el r\u00edo suena, agua lleva.\n\nThe Last Time es a primera vista una aventura gr\u00e1fica tradicional, con conversaciones entre personajes e interacci\u00f3n con los objetos mediante el uso del puntero del rat\u00f3n. Por lo que respecta a su funcionamiento, podr\u00eda ser un juego de lo m\u00e1s com\u00fan entre el resto de ejemplos del g\u00e9nero. Donde difiere en relaci\u00f3n a la mayor\u00eda de ellos es en el desarrollo del argumento, que de forma inhabitual importa mucho m\u00e1s que la resoluci\u00f3n de los puzles. Sin revelar mucho de la historia, s\u00ed puedo adelantar que trata de una trama policiaca en la que tomamos el papel de un agente urbano ingl\u00e9s, que una noche se ver\u00e1 envuelto en un asunto peliagudo mientras patrulla junto a su habitual compa\u00f1ero. Aunque el tratamiento del relato sea el habitual de un thriller, encontraremos frecuentes toques de comedia y humor negro, adem\u00e1s de algunas secuencias propias del g\u00e9nero de terror, consiguiendo h\u00e1bilmente una combinaci\u00f3n impactante.\n\nEste es el objetivo buscado por Daniel Black, autor del juego; conmover al jugador, m\u00e1s que proponer un reto mental. Los rompecabezas constituyen en este caso parte del decorado: No componen la historia, sino que solamente forman parte del veh\u00edculo para desenvolverla, de modo tangencial. Para ello, adem\u00e1s de la inteligente combinaci\u00f3n de g\u00e9neros que mencionaba, se usan los di\u00e1logos ramificados, tan propios de las primeras aventuras gr\u00e1ficas. En cada conversaci\u00f3n se nos ofrece la posibilidad de contestar, escogiendo entre una serie de respuestas de distinto tono y que definen nuestro \u00e1nimo, nuestra disposici\u00f3n en el papel del personaje que representamos. Aunque el tronco fundamental de la historia sea el mismo, independientemente de las respuestas que escojamos, el transcurso de la misma s\u00ed variar\u00e1 en funci\u00f3n de nuestras elecciones. Por tanto, la reacci\u00f3n de los personajes en el futuro y la resoluci\u00f3n de algunas escenas depender\u00e1 en gran medida del gui\u00f3n escogido. He notado, adem\u00e1s, que las frases intentan abarcar varios enfoques diferentes de la situaci\u00f3n, por lo que normalmente siempre encontraremos una respuesta que se ajuste bastante a nuestra forma de hacer las cosas, sea cual sea \u00e9sta. El trabajo realizado en el gui\u00f3n nos lleva a jugar una historia lineal, pero moldeable seg\u00fan nuestro gusto y con la permanente incertidumbre de qu\u00e9 rumbo tomar\u00e1, siendo as\u00ed muy gratificante.\n\nComo dec\u00eda, los rompecabezas no suponen la parte m\u00e1s importante del juego. No son numerosos y ni siquiera tenemos un inventario en el que almacenar los objetos recogidos. Las soluciones, relativamente sencillas de resolver, se encuentran siempre en el mismo escenario en el que se plantean los problemas. La decisi\u00f3n de no ralentizar en exceso el desarrollo de la trama con b\u00fasquedas farragosas me parece acertada, dada la intenci\u00f3n que realmente busca el autor, priorizando el efecto que una narraci\u00f3n fluida produce en el jugador. Los primeros minutos se suceden as\u00ed con maestr\u00eda, cobrando inter\u00e9s a medida que vamos situ\u00e1ndonos en el meollo de lo que nos quieren contar, logrando que empaticemos con el protagonista y que nos sintamos intrigados por el misterio detectivesco. Sin embargo, llegados a cierto punto de la historia, el autor empieza a cometer errores. Aparecen algunos personajes de car\u00e1cter desdibujado, desliz \u00e9ste perdonable por s\u00ed solo, pero tambi\u00e9n varias soluciones argumentales que rayan lo inveros\u00edmil, por su simpleza o por el desacierto de no saber mezclar la farsa teatral con el drama.\n\nQuiz\u00e1 la primera situaci\u00f3n chocante no desentona demasiado, pero a medida que se van sucediendo otras por igual, incluyendo un chiste soez m\u00e1s propio de un episodio de la serie Family Guy que de un drama, el conjunto de la obra pierde la solidez y el \u00edmpetu que mostraba de inicio. Mi impresi\u00f3n es que The Last Time logra salvarse por la campana debido a su corta duraci\u00f3n, pues se acaba en menos de dos horas. Analizando su recorrido, me doy cuenta de que solamente han transcurrido unos minutos desde que he empezado a dudar de su val\u00eda hasta el final de la aventura. Aunque no es el tiempo suficiente como para arruinar por completo una estupenda aventura, su precipitaci\u00f3n me decepciona y me plantea una vez m\u00e1s la siguiente pregunta: \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 hay autores con talento que acaban errando con soluciones pueriles? Aunque no s\u00e9 cu\u00e1l es el motivo concreto del se\u00f1or Black, ya que tengo mis dudas, s\u00ed me gustar\u00eda que los guionistas y desarrolladores en general hicieran un ejercicio de introspecci\u00f3n, pregunt\u00e1ndose cu\u00e1les son sus referentes culturales y si son los correctos, si sirven como base para alcanzar la magnitud de lo que ellos mismos quieren llegar a contar.\n\nMi opini\u00f3n al respecto dar\u00eda para otro art\u00edculo, que no es el caso, as\u00ed que centr\u00e1ndome en el videojuego tratado, puedo concluir diciendo que The Last Time es una entretenida y valiosa aventura que, a pesar de mis reparos por lo ya dicho, vale la pena experimentar. Resulta meritoria la decisi\u00f3n del autor de salirse del cauce habitual de la aventura gr\u00e1fica, buscando intencionadamente que el jugador se sienta impactado y reflexione sobre las decisiones tomadas, la amistad, la madurez, las relaciones humanas, sobre la vida misma incluso. El divertimento, aunque corto, tiene tras su finalizaci\u00f3n un regusto a\u00f1adido. Raz\u00f3n m\u00e1s que suficiente para los menos de cuatro euros que cuesta el juego.", "timestamp_created": 1487587288, "timestamp_updated": 1487587288, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29729928": {"recommendationid": "29729928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080206272", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486331519}, "language": "english", "review": "Although the game looks simple with it's pixel design, the game was extremely fun to play and had my heart racing at certain parts.

Sit down with some food, a soda, and 2 hours of free time for one of the best indie games you've played in a loooong time.", "timestamp_created": 1473475966, "timestamp_updated": 1473475966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25434072": {"recommendationid": "25434072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032371075", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473523470}, "language": "english", "review": "After looking through some new games, This one was the only one that actually looked good and intriguing...I thought it was just gonna be a detective game between 2 cops who just solve crime together.\nThe choices in this game roughly end the same way but in a different style..\nI absoulutly loved the humor and story showed throughout, The characters werent likable but proved to be an important part, as this game teaches you that you might make mistakes and blame yourself...But as you go 40 years later as an old man still regretting that, you realise it wasnt yourself to blame...I LOVE THE SOUNDRACK. This game feels more like an interactive movie which I love about it..the only thing I hate was the fact that this game is 2-3 hours long. \n\nI definitely recommend it to those who are about adventure and investigating point and click sorta games.\n\n8/10 would get Darren killed again", "timestamp_created": 1473463774, "timestamp_updated": 1473465025, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25434021": {"recommendationid": "25434021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073685294", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473463096}, "language": "english", "review": "Very interesting game.

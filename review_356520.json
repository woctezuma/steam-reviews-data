Conozco gente que por el mero hecho de que sea gratis ya desconf\u00edan, ya sea porque probablemente sea un PayToWin, o porque sea un moj\u00f3n. De esto tengo que decir que es ninguna de las dos opciones.\n\nComo catalogarlo es algo complicado ya que tiene un poco de todo. Su principal aspecto es la atm\u00f3sfera, alimentada por el desconocimiento. El no saber qu\u00e9, c\u00f3mo ni por qu\u00e9 le da al peque\u00f1o escenario algo de misterio, y el sentirte encerrado. Tambi\u00e9n una pizca de terror, ya que hay situaciones y/o sonidos que son bastante espeluznantes, adem\u00e1s de que cuando te vas dando cuenta de la historia se va tornando bastante creepy el asunto. Tambi\u00e9n se le podr\u00eda catalogar como Point and Click o Aventura Gr\u00e1fica, pero al final esto es como una receta de cocina. Realizas un escenario con buena atm\u00f3sfera y vas a\u00f1adiendo peque\u00f1os ingredientes a la mezcla. Una buena mezcla\n\nEl aspecto gr\u00e1fico es lo que probablemente haya echado a m\u00e1s gente atr\u00e1s. Al fin y al cabo, no es nada m\u00e1s que un peque\u00f1o escenario con solo y exclusivamente pol\u00edgonos 3D con texturas. No hay modelado ni biselado, ni bordes suavizados. Pero al final estamos hablando de algo opcional (Excepto para algunas personas)\n\nLa ambientaci\u00f3n sonora es bastante buena. Juegos con una canci\u00f3n o melod\u00eda sonando durante todo el rato se hace bastante cansado y repetitivo. Soluci\u00f3n, poner m\u00fasica en momentos clave. Momentos tristes o misteriosos, y les qued\u00f3 muy bien. Los efectos de sonido no estoy seguro si son de esos de libre uso, pero viendo que en algunas partes del juego se dicen algunas palabras, incluyendo el final, le da bastante originalidad.\n\nLos logros acompa\u00f1an muy bien al juego. No son muchos, para no estresar al jugador, pero tampoco escasos, como los t\u00edpicos p\u00e1sate el juego y punto. Si eres una persona curiosa, es bastante probable que los hayas conseguido todos menos uno de una tirada. Pero si no es as\u00ed, no te preocupes. 3 se consiguen durante el transcurso normal del mismo, 2 requieren un poco de exploraci\u00f3n y curiosidad, y los otros 2 son los dos finales distintos. Una vez consigues un final el juego te invita a completarlo otra vez, d\u00e1ndote cuenta de m\u00e1s detalles y as\u00ed ver el juego con otros ojos al saber ya el transfondo. Esto es buen dise\u00f1o de gui\u00f3n, se\u00f1ores.\n\nNo tengo mucho m\u00e1s que decir sin hacer spoilers. Realmente lo recomiendo y no toma m\u00e1s de una hora completarlo. Es intuitivo y muy bueno, y la verdad es que me encantar\u00eda ver Port of Call en HD, ser\u00eda un juegazo por el cual pagar\u00eda.

Suffice it to say that the game has an intriguing premise and an interesting story that kept my interest throughout (even though, like other reviewers have mentioned, the twists are fairly easy to guess). \n\nThere's no action, you simply wander around talking to people and solving light puzzles. The graphic are very primitive and simplistic, but somehow it only adds to the style and strangeness of the game. Speaking of which, the atmosphere is where \"Port of Call\" really shines: the world the game creates is oddly immersive, beautiful and haunting - which is especially impressive considering the low production values, near-lack of voice acting and minimalistic sound design. The overall vibe is surreal and eerie, with occasional hints of creepiness.\n\nSo to conclude, \"Port of Call\" is a lovely little free-to-play game that is more than the sum of its parts.

I found it for free on the Steam store and decided to just give it a go. It didn't seem like it was going to be a long game, and the achievements all seemed relatively easy to pick up.\n\nI loaded the game up, went to play it and found myself pretty bored quickly. I didn't go about it correctly so I just closed it after popping one of the first achievements on the game and then didn't come back to it for a day or so. After finally finding a walk through that told me I had to talk to the Captain of the ship when you first go onto it, I reopened the game and went about it.\n\nWhat I found was an incredibly well thought and well plotted out short story. This game really made me think a lot about things that most people don't think about. When the game finished, I was left just blinking at my screen, digesting what had just happened. I was left wanting more from this game, wanting to discover even more about the characters in the game, but unfortunately, this game is pretty open and shut within itself, so there really isn't anything more they could do to expand on this universe.\n\nOne thing I did find rather aggravating was the fact I had to go through the whole game twice to get the two achievements at the end - there's no saving mechanism - but this makes the Loot achievements much easier to get. Even though it was a really quick game to get through (it only took me under half an hour to go through it twice and pick all the achievements up) this was still relatively annoying, especially if you're pressed for time.\n\nThe only problem I had with this game as a whole, however, was how it seemed quite laggy and it would jump around a little bit. This game really should have run much smoother than it did on my laptop, and the little jumps in the environment and constant lag when my character moved just really got on my nerves. That is something that really needs to be fixed because boy oh boy does that get annoying quickly.\n\nOther than these two things, this game is really enjoyable, really thought-provoking, and I would definitely recommend this to everyone!

The way it is now, it feels a lot like a piece of a game. The story is interesting, but I figured out what the twist would be on the second passenger, when you aren't supposed to find out until the end of the story. I'll explain in more detail in the paragraph below, spoilers aplenty. It's also very short, and not in a \"it's a short story\" sort of way, it felt rushed, like it had a lot more story to tell than time and parts had been cut out. It's not a bad game or anything, and I feel like you can't complain about a free game anyway. I enjoyed it for what it was, a quick story with enjoyable characters and well written dialogue. You can't really go wrong with a free game. Unless it's [i]Let the Cat In[/i].\n\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of how Port of Call spoils itself.\n\n[spoiler]There are two main twists in Port of Call, one is that everyone is dead and this is a boat to the afterlife, and the other is the identity of the player character. The first twist isn't much of a twist, it's very obvious from the beginning what's going on but the game drags it out as a big reveal at the end. Now onto the second twist. The first passenger you speak to, Lily, explains that she died while playing hide and seek with her brother, Marcus. The second passenger, Horace, says his daughter had died and he was left with his son. Hmm, I sure do wonder if these two are related. As Horace...disappears in a blinding flash of light? I don't know, it makes more sense while playing. As he does that, he says something like \"Thanks Marcus\" and there goes the plot. You're Marcus, that's the end of the story. But the dang character doesn't seem to have the smarts to think his way out of a paper bag though, so he doesn't have a clue. He then goes to talk with the third character, Alice. She drones on and on about how she's looking for someone but doesn't know who, alludes to Marcus, yeah yeah whatever. Onto the boilerman, who makes it sound like some amazing and dramatic twist that WOW everyone is DEAD and the people you met are your FAMILY and you're MARCUS but in reality you already knew this, you knew everyone was dead before you even got past the title screen, let's be honest. If the twist was hidden better I would have liked this a lot more. It's got charm to it, but I couldn't correctly enjoy the story it was trying to tell. And I never want to talk about the Lavender Crayon again.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1500332329, "timestamp_updated": 1500333424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546870", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33571225": {"recommendationid": "33571225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198261003989", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500157595}, "language": "english", "review": "The first thing I have to say is wow, the story is very touching and sad in a way.

The controls are very simplistic and standard for a first-person game so it is very simple to jump into the game without having to learn an obscure interface or control scheme.  Despite its short length, the game comes with some replayablility with two possible endings as well as seven Steam Achievements to collect.  However, these achievements can be obtained in no more than two playthroughs creating little incentive to play the game again after getting all the achievements and both endings.  I still do, however, highly recommend the game as due to the short nature of a playthrough it is an excellent game to show a friend.\n\nThe game opens rather abruptly to the player character on a dock in the middle of nowhere and a mysterious ghostly woman looking out into the endless ocean.  The player has no memory of how he arrived at this place or who he even is. Upon turning around, the woman vanishes and the player is being told to board a ship by a strange ferryman.  Turning around again, the ship suddenly appears and can be boarded and the game begins.  The player must discover who he is and why he is on the ferryboat, completing tasks given to him by the ferryman.\n\nThe story itself is very simple and, at times, predictable, and though the player has options during dialogue sequences, these choices affect nothing in the game, but add a sense of choice for the player.  Are you a horrible person? A sympathetic person? Do you want to make the little girl cry, or comfort her? It gives an artificial feeling of having an impact on the world in the game, and this is not a bad thing. It can give the player the feeling of wanting to play again, perhaps, and make different choices.  Be the good guy in one playthrough, and the bad guy in the next.  There is a level of satisfaction regardless of whether the choice has any real impact on the game or not.\n\nThe first thing the player will notice about the game is the clearly stylised design. The graphics are incredibly simplistic, though unique enough to be charming.  The characters in the game (save for the ferryman and the player) wear strange masks that distort their faces.  Not only is this a style purposely chosen for the game, but it does play a part in the story.  The minimalism can turn off some players because there are little to no textures on objects, the colour palette is rather dull, and the characters are a bit ugly.  However, the drab nature of the design builds the bleak atmosphere the game intended on having.  Though some of the design choices can be seen as lazy, they can just as easily be seen as artistic choices intentionally made to fit a style.  Given that this game is free, the art design works for what it is.\n\nLastly, the music is superb, a bit too good for a free game.  It\u2019s slow, bleak, and feels like a sad shanty.  The full game soundtrack is available, and I recommend it.  The mood it creates is perfect.  The music makes the player feel like a slow, dark, sad ferryboat is going through a slow, dark, sad ocean for a dark and sad purpose.\n\nThe game succeeds in being what it intended to be, and it was good enough I would have paid money to play it.", "timestamp_created": 1499660412, "timestamp_updated": 1499696639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It may be better to go in blind, but everything I describe you will learn in the opening minute or so. [/b]\n\nPort of Call is a short, free walking simulator that presents a nice story about death, and learning to accept it. It's nice atmosphere and short story offer a fun, if not somewhat dark, time. Basically, you start on a dock, then head to a ship, and collect tickets for the ferryman. There are four people with a ticket, each with their own story to tell. As time passes, you start to unravel the story and realize that there is more going on than meets the eye. From a technical standpoint, this game works great. Graphics are minimal, but the hard edges and color pallate make for some nice looking level design. I was also impressed with some instant loading times and a small physics engine. I also didn't encounter any glitches. Overall, this was a fun game, and I think everyone should give it a try. It's short, free, and there are seven super easy achivements to help get you a 100% completed game, which is neat. Give it a try, and see for yourself.\n\nSpoilers: [spoiler] So basically you are in Limbo, between life and death. The people who you need to collect tickets from are your sister (died tragically), father (drunkard), wife (died of broken heart, like Padme apparently), and yourself (guilt manifested as an alternate \"you\"). The story is basically you recalling these events by having the respective people tell you about it. Then, the boat docks and you are left with a choice. Submit to death, and live with your wife in Heaven, or resist death, and return to the land of the living. There are two portals you can walk through in order to choose. If you choose death, you hear your wife calling out to you, as if you are joining her in love again. If you choose life, you hear a hospital, as if you almost died but came back. Port of Call is a simple game, but fun nonetheless. If you have a few minutes to spare and want to try something new, try this. Trust me, it's worth your time.

Yes, there are elements here that you've seen in better, more compelling tales, but that's exactly the problem.  You've seen these twists and revelations before, and they're not being used in a novel or inventive way here.  Before you've even boarded the ship you should already have discerned one of the game's big upcoming revelations.  Talking to just the first passenger should make the other big surprise obvious -- one that you're not supposed to realize until several passengers later.  I'm speaking vaguely to avoid spoilers here, but the issue is that the game spoils itself.  With the game's mysteries laid bare far before they were intended to be, you're left in a clumsily-made environment, running through dialogue trees where your choices change nothing, just so that your character can realize things that were obvious to you ten minutes earlier.\n\nFinally, you reach the end, where you must make the most dramatic and important choice of all.  And it, too, functionally changes nothing, since the diametrically opposed endings still feel almost identical.  And if you want all the Achievements, you'll know this, since you have to experience them both.\n\nA tremendous story can make technical weaknesses unimportant.

Dicha atm\u00f3sfera logra crear una conexi\u00f3n entre el jugador y el protagonista en su b\u00fasqueda de respuestas, logrando una uni\u00f3n natural entre escenarios y personajes. Todo eso de la mano de un escenario peque\u00f1o, que intenta no colocar lugares de m\u00e1s en pos de no distraer al jugador.\n\n[h1]Argumento[/h1]\nEn un muelle vac\u00edo, apartado de toda costa \u2014mas no de un faro en la lejan\u00eda\u2014 se divisa bajo el manto nocturno de estrellas una figura femenina que se desvanece como si de un espejismo se tratase, dando pie a un viejo a nuestras espaldas que nos recibe, d\u00e1ndonos a entender que aguardaba nuestra llegada, este personaje resulta ser el capit\u00e1n del barco que tenemos a nuestras espaldas, materializado ahora como si de un nav\u00edo fantasma se tratase. Embarcados y dejando el muelle detr\u00e1s, el capit\u00e1n parece conocernos m\u00e1s que nosotros mismos, pues todo lo que sabemos es lo que pas\u00f3 desde el momento en el que pisamos el muelle, como si nos hubi\u00e9semos originado all\u00ed, en ese preciso instante.\n\nSin ning\u00fan conocimiento, deberemos recorrer los pasillos de la depresiva nave, rodeada de una ominosa atm\u00f3sfera, en donde se divisan vac\u00edos p\u00e1ramos marinos sin el menor rastro de tierra a la vista, surcando mar abierto en direcci\u00f3n al lejano faro, mientras a su vez, se nos cruza por los pasillos aquella figura femenina que en un principio se hab\u00eda manifestado. \n\nComo pide el capit\u00e1n, deberemos serle de ayuda y pedir los boletos de ciertos integrantes de la tripulaci\u00f3n, pero para lograr eso, deberemos mantener una charla con ellos antes de que se dignen a otorgarnos dicho papel. A medida que se conozca a cada tripulante, la trama comenzar\u00e1 a moldearse frente a nuestros ojos y, con ella, comprenderemos quienes somos, y c\u00f3mo acabamos all\u00ed.\n\nNo es en s\u00ed la historia lo que se aprecia de este t\u00edtulo, sino como esta es contada, a trav\u00e9s de los individuos con quienes entremos en contacto. Mec\u00e1nicamente el juego permite moldear los di\u00e1logos, leyendo y preguntando. Es as\u00ed como se nos proporcionar\u00e1 de variadas preguntas a las cuales nuestros receptores responder\u00e1n; dicha mec\u00e1nica no est\u00e1 ah\u00ed para cambiar sustancialmente la trama, sino que sirve como medio narrativo; es por esto que el juego se basa en la historia, manifestada a trav\u00e9s de conversaciones en las cuales, al poder interactuar en pos de recibir diferentes di\u00e1logos, entra el factor inmersivo, pues no solo seremos espectadores, sino tambi\u00e9n participantes. Dicho sistema de interacci\u00f3n resulta b\u00e1sico a la manera que fue implementada, pero para este t\u00edtulo de corta duraci\u00f3n, bast\u00f3 y sobr\u00f3 para entregar una experiencia satisfactoria.\n\n[h1]Controles/Interfaz[/h1]\nAl iniciar el juego podremos elegir su calidad, resoluci\u00f3n, entre ejecutarlo en modo ventana o pantalla completa, y, sobre todo, personalizar las teclas designadas. En el men\u00fa principal solo podremos iniciar la aventura, no sin antes ser abordados por una imagen explicando los controles de interacci\u00f3n. No posee interfaz, pues no hay nada que la justifique en este caso, dado que el t\u00edtulo se inclina a la inmersi\u00f3n del jugador.\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad[/h1]\nAl ser un walking simulator no posee particularidades de maniobrabilidad o interacci\u00f3n en cuanto a su faceta jugable, pues este t\u00edtulo se enfoca a la experiencia, dejando de lado la jugabilidad, reduci\u00e9ndola a lo m\u00e1s simplista e intuitiva que pueda llegar a ser.\n\n[h1]Conclusi\u00f3n[/h1]\nA pesar de su simpleza, este t\u00edtulo logra su cometido, otorgando una historia con un grado de inmersi\u00f3n apropiado para su duraci\u00f3n, y es que esta misma resulta justificada a fin de cuentas, tomando en cuenta la trama que se desarrolla, el lugar de la misma y siendo este un juego gratuito. No dudar\u00eda en pagar si se desarrolla un poco m\u00e1s de cara a futuro.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9059978][u]Seguir a Mentor P\u00edxel para m\u00e1s an\u00e1lisis y rese\u00f1as[/u][/url][/td][/tr][/table]", "timestamp_created": 1477526289, "timestamp_updated": 1499009323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.713085", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26234226": {"recommendationid": "26234226", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992511557", "num_games_owned": 389, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477370163}, "language": "english", "review": "An enjoyable little 15-20 min walking sim.

Port of Call \u00e8 uno di questi giochi.\n\n\nAttenzione, Port of Call non \u00e8 assolutamente un titolo ottimo o in qualsiasi caso un must have, e forse non \u00e8 neanche un titolo da tenere d'occhio, \u00e8 un titolo solamente buono,sufficiente,niente di pi\u00f9,niente di meno. Ma \u00e8 una sufficienza vera, acquisita poich\u00e8 meritata, ed \u00e8 una sufficienza che la si sente quando si prova il titolo. Ovviamente ne parlo con un accezione positiva.\n\nPort of Call \u00e8 prima di tutto un'esperienza, un miscuglio di emozioni confuse che poi convergono tutte alla fine del gioco dove viene risolto l'enigma dell'avventura. Port of Call \u00e8 un titolo che va giocato tutto d'un fiato, non ci sono salvataggi e questa \u00e8 una scelta di game design molto azzeccata sopratutto per ci\u00f2 che la produzione propone. Parlando di durata del titolo, sar\u00e0 sufficiente una sessione di 40/50 minuti per portare al termine l'avventura. Una sessione di circa 2 ore per portarla al termine con ambe due i finali. \n\nPort of Call \u00e8 un'avventura grafica di tutto rispetto che usa l'ambientazione e la buona caratterizzazione (in termine di background narrativo, non di tecnica) dei personaggi per coinvolgere il giocatore. E ci riesce, cavolo se ci riesce. Port of Call ha una sola ambientazione, una nave. Ed \u00e8 tutta una metafora per esprimere un concetto molto ampio che il giocatore andr\u00e0 ad identificare nel suo vissuto. La storia non \u00e8 niente di che se presa come storia a s\u00e8 stante, ma se presa come uno spunto di riflessione \u00e8 di una profondit\u00e0 disarmante per un titolo indie, venduto poi anche gratis. La storia procede velocemente e senza tanti colpi di scena, quei pochi che ci sono risultano essere telefonati e sono clich\u00e8 del genere, niente di eccezionale insomma. Ma quello che colpisce \u00e8 la capacit\u00e0 del gioco di coinvelgere semplicemente con l'ambientazione, \u00e8 la capacit\u00e0 di far vivere il titolo in noi, \u00e8 la capacit\u00e0 che ha di far pensare al titolo anche ad avventura conclusa, sono stato tanto tempo a pensare, a riflettere sugli avvenimenti e sul finale, di scelta davvero molto personale. I due finali sono molto semplici ad un primo impatto ma se presi seriamente davvero molto complessi e profondi.\n\nIl gameplay praticamente non esiste, ma essendo un'avventura grafica non ne vedo la pecca. WASD per muoversi, Click Sinistro per intereagire, Movimento del Mouse per spostare la visuale. Basta.\n\nIl comparto sonoro ci accompagna per tutta la misera(ma giustificata) durata del titolo con alcuni pezzi davvero molto azzeccati per l'ambientazione. I Characters Theme poi sono incredibilmente inseriti bene per ogni personaggio, e nel mentre siamo assopiti nella lettura dei dialoghi( non c'\u00e8 doppiaggio) sembra quasi che la musica faccia da doppiatrice, davvero davvero alienante, ma in senso estremamente positivo. \n\nInsomma in toto \u00e8 un'esperienza che oggettivamente \u00e8 sufficiente ma soggettivamente \u00e8 uno di quei titoli indie che non ti aspetti di giocare e di trovare, sopratutto a gratis. E' davvero un titolo molto complesso e profondo, ma molto semplice e banale e quasi mediocre se preso superficialmente. Vi consiglio di provarlo ma sar\u00e0 la vostra persona a decretare un giudizio sul titolo, che nel mio caso \u00e8 estremamente positivo. Appunto per questa grande disparit\u00e0 tra giudizio oggettivo e soggettivo, non mi sento di dare una valutazione fissa per il titolo, ma consiglio A TUTTI di provarlo, a qualcuno sortir\u00e0 lo stesso effetto a me dato, ossia un inebriazione di sentimenti ed emozioni che sfociano in spunti di riflessioni davvero profondi.", "timestamp_created": 1477210052, "timestamp_updated": 1477210228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26176347": {"recommendationid": "26176347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203961431", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 995, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477200225}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u0445\u0443\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u044f\u0441\u043d\u043e, \u044f \u0434\u0430\u0443\u043d, \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1477200242, "timestamp_updated": 1477200242, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26101670": {"recommendationid": "26101670", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064307874", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468274140}, "language": "english", "review": "I downloaded this game durning gameplay it just felt weird to me I honestly did not care for it I'm more into simulations other than RPGS to me this game is rpg", "timestamp_created": 1476801176, "timestamp_updated": 1476801176, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.320495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26051588": {"recommendationid": "26051588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035653054", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494000766}, "language": "english", "review": "A cool, free, short exploration game.

The story was rather simple and linear[spoiler]with somewhat of a cliche ending,[/spoiler] but did a good job revealing the story incrementally through talking with the various charming characters.\n\nFor a free game it was worth every penny and more, and it was obviously a labor of love for the developers.

In order to solve the mystery of why you're on the ship of the dead and who you and the other people are, you go on a journey of slowly walking back and forth across the ship while having vague conversations and clicking on stuff. The dialogue system is fiddly and prone to accidentally selecting dialogue options by mistake, but it doesn't actually effect anything gameplay wise when you make these choices. There's really not enough emotion here for this experience to get anywhere past slightly unusual/weird. There's no emotional follow through, especially since we don't know or get to know much about anyone involved. \n\nYou have to play the game twice to get all the achievements, because there is one for each ending. Both endings are exactly the same, its just that by walking through one door instead of another you get different sound effects. I also needed the second run to find all the crayons for another arbitrary achievement, because apparently the first time, one of the six crayons fell out of the universe.

Sin tener recuerdos de qui\u00e9n somos ni de c\u00f3mo llegamos ah\u00ed, nos encontraremos con un hombre de edad avanzada y personalidad c\u00e1ndida que nos ordenar\u00e1 colectar los tickets de los pasajeros que encontraremos en su barco, y bajo esta premisa transcurre su narrativa.\n\nCon una exploraci\u00f3n bastante limitada, nos encontraremos a unos pocos personajes con los cuales sostendremos conversaciones con di\u00e1logos seleccionables, que si bien las opciones no ser\u00e1n vastamente amplias, s\u00ed notaremos que recibiremos respuestas distintivas acorde a nuestras elecciones.\n\nLa producci\u00f3n audiovisual quiz\u00e1s no sea la m\u00e1s inmersiva del g\u00e9nero ni la que m\u00e1s carezca de fallas, pero es evidente que no intenta simular alguna clase de terror, sino m\u00e1s bien un suspenso ligero que inspira misterio e intriga sobre el trasfondo del [i]status quo[/i] de los personajes, y es esta, precisamente, la debilidad del t\u00edtulo.\n\n[h1]Un potencial castrado[/h1]\nDebido a que la durabilidad del juego es muy reducida, no nos veremos tan involucrados con los personajes como para interesarnos genuinamente en ellos, aspecto que podr\u00eda afectar negativamente nuestra impresi\u00f3n cuando habremos llegado al cl\u00edmax de la historia. No obstante, [b][i]Port of Call[/i][/b] espera que el giro argumental al final de la narraci\u00f3n nos marque de alguna manera con un mensaje significativo sobre las relaciones personales y nuestra percepci\u00f3n de la vida, y a ciencia cierta, lo logra, muy a pesar de que el argumento del protagonista con amnesia pudiera ser clich\u00e9. Cabe notar, no obstante, que el desenlace de este relato nos dejar\u00e1 una moraleja que no pudiera ser contado con un enfoque distinto.\n\nEl juego no durar\u00e1 m\u00e1s de una hora as\u00ed seamos minuciosos con el entorno, y es lamentable que el concepto que brinda este t\u00edtulo no pueda ser explotado con una longevidad que permita dar paso a que el jugador se comprometa emocionalmente con su ficci\u00f3n. Probablemente la respuesta a esta disyuntiva es inherente a su comercializaci\u00f3n, puesto que el juego es gratis, y como un proyecto independiente sin fines de lucro, cualquier cr\u00edtica no pudiera ser m\u00e1s de all\u00e1 de unos pocos aplausos o un pulgar arriba a los desarrolladores, quiz\u00e1s no por su ejecuci\u00f3n, sino por su interesante concepto.\n\nEl asunto es que de haberse dise\u00f1ado con una mayor longevidad y un desarrollo m\u00e1s comprometedor y complejo de los personajes, [b][i]Port of Call[/i][/b] pudiese haber tenido el potencial de causar un verdadero impacto en el jugador. Sin embargo, el concepto que ofrece como medio narrativo es lo suficientemente s\u00f3lido como para ser valorado por s\u00ed solo.

In fact, the trailer essentially spoils the first \u201cmystery\u201d - i.e., what is the boat and why has it lured you in. The second but central question is answered by piecing together a narrative based on conversations with other passengers.\n\nYou begin on a small port surrounded by ocean with a lighthouse barely visible in the distance. You encounter a transient woman followed by a ferryman who hires you for an unexplained job. The ferryman himself is lithe, jovial, and snarky all at once. His simple instructions are to retrieve a passenger\u2019s ticket. His simple job has the effect of granting some order to the chaos of the opening scene. It\u2019s a wonderful trick, as it provides guidance and normalcy at a junction in the game where the player doesn\u2019t know anything. The captain\u2019s presence is avuncular and almost calming.\n\nThe game\u2019s creepiness in general is offset by its jaunty atmosphere. The graphics consist of clean lines and deep, opaque hues. The color scheme is dark, but the presentation itself isn\u2019t melancholy. The ship is physically small but has a presence that\u2019s difficult to explain. Some games, films, and books burst with detail and eye candy but fail to capture a milieu, or a sense of place. In Port of Call, which can be completed in maybe ten to fifteen minutes, I found myself exploring what little space there was to observe all of the detail. The ship was clearly crafted with care and meticulousness rather than caprice. Thus, it has a presence that balances amiability and angst.\n\nWhile I believe the first two thirds of the game captures what Poe calls the \u201cunity of effect,\u201d or the interplay of an artwork\u2019s elements contributing to a single effect, the last third is flawed. The last third involves beating the player over the head with shameless exposition. The first two thirds allows the player to stitch the story together without narratorial intrusion. The last third is overt and ruins the fastidiously crafted effect.\n\nHowever, despite the flawed ending, Port of Call is worth playing for what it achieves. Like other similar titles, such as the magnificent Thirty Flights of Loving and free prequel Gravity Bone, Port of Call opens new possibilities for video games as art.\n", "timestamp_created": 1452062695, "timestamp_updated": 1452062695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510902", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20325943": {"recommendationid": "20325943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164110055", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451071248}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00c9 um jogo simples, sem muita complexidade e relativamente f\u00e1cil de desenvolver.

simulator / visual novel type of game, or I suppose I would say \"visual short story\" since it is very very short. The only thing you can really do in this game is walk slowly and talk to people.\n\nThe story and dialogues aren't super interesting until you get to maybe the third or fourth one.

Port of Call non \u00e8 stranamente definito da nessuno uno \"walking simulator\", e questo fa riflettere molto su questo genere. Sebbene Dear Esther e Gone Home siano espliciti riferimenti del team di sviluppo (cercate \"Gallaga: UT student team builds spooky game in just one semester\" per trovare la mia fonte), forse la narrativa troppo esplicitamente rivelata, forse le pochissime (ma pur presenti) sequenze interattive presenti e necessarie per progredire allontanano Port of Call dalla suddetta etichetta per avvicinarla a quella di \"avventura\". Port of Call \u00e8 stato costruito da zero in un semestre universitario da un team di sei studenti afferenti a corsi diversi della University of Texas di Austin: l'estrema competenza nei vari settori dei cocreatori (programmazione, writing, modelling...) giustifica un prodotto di qualit\u00e0 davvero notevole; i tempi ristretti (finalizzati a presentare il gioco a un concorso universitario nell'ambito dell'E3) un prodotto per certi aspetti poco rifinito. Rimestando nel calderone dell'immaginario dell'aldil\u00e0 e delle transizioni dell'anima, i nostri sei studenti texani ci mettono davanti a un impacciato Caronte e a un cast di personaggi ben caratterizzati, graficamente ammiccanti verso la Citt\u00e0 incantata di Miyazaki, i Korogu di Wind Waker e il cell shading di Okami. La visuale in prima persona \u00e8 usata sapientemente per creare incertezza sull'entit\u00e0 del protagonista (spoiler di qui in avanti), che dovr\u00e0 letteralmente decidere da solo se il suo io (e di conseguenza il suo corpo) sia morto o meno. Assai raffinata \u00e8 la scelta di raffigurare la parte oscura dell'io come un fuochista, che con il carbone dell'anima alimenta il fuoco della condizione ultraterrena a cui il protagonista ha relegato i suoi cari. La riunificazione della coscienza pu\u00f2 portare all'autoassoluzione, ma non a capovolgere la sabbia nella clessidra: la soluzione ultima \u00e8 una questione di etica personale, dove comunque sia non esistono lieto fini su una nave al tramonto. La \"frettolosit\u00e0\" di Port of Call si percepisce soprattutto sull'ambigua introduzione del tema del suicidio, mai totalmente \"srotolato\": l'intelaiatura della trama risulta cos\u00ec forse un po' troppo esile, non riempiendosi neanche di spinta esegetica soggettiva dal momento in cui non viene data (ovviamente) sufficiente carne al fuoco per le speculazioni. I finali, che altrove vedo essere stati di ampio dibattito, peccano in un utilizzo veramente mediocre dei mezzi audiovisivi disponibili. E' comprensibile infatti l'impossibilit\u00e0 di aggiungere delle vere e proprie sequenze animate, ma il fonosimbolismo e le semplici scelte coloristiche, se usate con maggiore accortezza, avrebbero veramente aggiunto qualcosa al valore finale del prodotto, senza considerare che il completamento del gioco pu\u00f2 essere considerato tale solo dopo due playthrough. In definitiva, anche se queste frasi nascondono sempre dietro a un augurio una maledizione, spero che il team in questione non consideri episodica la loro comparsa sullo scenario videoludico e possa, con calma, progettare qualcosa di stile simile ma \"in grande\".

Also please do not get this mixed up with the naval / simulation game Ports of Call (note the plural \u2018Ports\u2019). This game is totally free in Steam that tells the story of you, on a ferry boat, not knowing how you got there in the first place. Plays upon the narrative / walking simulator theme however it\u2019s a little more than simply looking at the scene and moving on to the next. The backdrop story, whilst not original however still interesting enough to play through until the end.\n\nThe game\u2019s visuals all renders in cell shading and nicely done. However there are times where the frame rate drops all of a sudden when more items suddenly appear on the screen. However, because the game\u2019s pace, this does not deter the gameplay at all. The controls are extremely simple to learn as it plays along with \u2018traditional\u2019 adventure games without inventory management. Furthermore there\u2019s almost no puzzles to solve however, like I have mentioned before, it plays along with telling the story instead of puzzle solving. The musical scores, whilst all short in nature, do produce a meticulous, mournful tone; similar to those ambience scores from the Stalker series.\n\nWithout inventory management, this may be the bane of playing any adventure games however due to its short length (about 30 mins) and being free, you really cannot argue about this. Normally I will dismiss the idea of amnesia stories as, for me, they portray lazy story writing falsely perpetrating the mystery behind the main protagonist, I\u2019m happy to dismiss it this time. Also, the project (game) was part of the finalist at E3 2014 from the team of students from UT Austin\u2019s Game and Mobile Media Applications (GAMMA) program, I hope the team continues on developing more games as I was impressed with this one.\n\n8 / 10", "timestamp_created": 1448787458, "timestamp_updated": 1448837999, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565173", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19334672": {"recommendationid": "19334672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165831443", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442346935}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "Outro jogo horroroso.", "timestamp_created": 1448717076, "timestamp_updated": 1448717076, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19324745": {"recommendationid": "19324745", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982530266", "num_games_owned": 858, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448681274}, "language": "english", "review": "It'll take about bout 15-30 minutes of your time, and it's worth it considering the price.", "timestamp_created": 1448681333, "timestamp_updated": 1448681333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431276", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19279224": {"recommendationid": "19279224", "author": {"steamid": "76561198259941483", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448590540}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game!", "timestamp_created": 1448512831, "timestamp_updated": 1448512831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19270402": {"recommendationid": "19270402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097666512", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448477801}, "language": "english", "review": "Great quick play!

When I saw that it had achievements for a free game, I thought to give it a shot (since it was short). I was honestly ready to write a negative review right off the bat. I was wrong.\n\nThough this game is short (and with a rather cliche story), it is still a well-told story that is to be enjoyed. To ease the fears of those who dread horror games, this game is very tame. Creepy...yet tame. No screamers. No gore. Only a feeling of discomfort in your own mind, yet not terrifyingly bad. Just creepy enough to catch your attention.\n\nPros:\nFree\nAchievements\nA nice tale to be told\nA nice cast of interesting characters\n\nCons:\nStory can be a little overtold. ()\nA little too short.\n\n\nIt is also another \"choose your own ending\" game, but it's based on personal preference after everything you've experienced. Me? I'll admit that when it came to life or death, I chose death. (Though I'd normally choose life, circumstances led me to believe life would be more painful)\n\nIf this was longer and if more work went into it, I could see this thing becoming something great. I wish there was an epilogue or sequel for those taking the \"Death Door\".\nIt's worth to play this game for 3 reasons:\n1. It's 100% free.\n2. Very easy to collects 100% of achievements, which took me not even an hour.\n3. And most important, it's quite nice adventure game.\nIt's really good way to spend half an hour of your spare time. Don't expect anything revolutionary, it's only budget indie game. A game which tells you nice story. And this story is something worth to read. Just don't skip the dialogues.\nAlso it's worth to make a decision in final stage.\n\nVERDICT:\nYes, it's worth to give it a chance, and c'mon, it's free.This is probably the shortest game I every played... which is fine. Took me about 20-25 minutes to play it. And another 10 Minutes to complete the rest of the achievements I was missing.\n\nPro:\n+ Free to Play\n+ nice and simple graphic\n+ simple controls\n+ easy to 100%\n\nCon:\n- very short \n\nIf you can spare half an hour and are into adventure, explore games you should definitively try this. You board the ferry to learn about your past, and in the end you choose your final outcome. \n\nThe game is very short taking no longer than 15-30 min. What you do learn of your character is actually quite tragic in some ways and does make you consider the end you choose. And given that there are two endings, it means this game has more endings than Mass Effect.

When I saw that it had achievements for a free game, I thought to give it a shot (since it was short).   I was honestly ready to write a negative review right off the bat.  I was wrong.\n\nThough this game is short (and with a rather cliche story), it is still a well-told story that is to be enjoyed.  To ease the fears of those who dread horror games, this game is very tame.  Creepy...yet tame.  No screamers.  No gore.  Only a feeling of discomfort in your own mind, yet not terrifyingly bad.   Just creepy enough to catch your attention.\n\nPros:\nFree\nAchievements\nA nice tale to be told\nA nice cast of interesting characters\n\nCons:\nStory can be a little overtold.  ([spoiler]A euphemism of death rowing his boat on the river Styx[/spoiler])\nA little too short.\n\n\nIt is also another \"choose your own ending\" game, but it's based on personal preference after everything you've experienced.  Me?  I'll admit that when it came to life or death, I chose death.   (Though I'd normally choose life, circumstances led me to believe life would be more painful)\n\nIf this was longer and if more work went into it, I could see this thing becoming something great.

The player starts off on a pier, with nothing but the light and silhouette of a distant lighthouse breaking the monotony of a vast ocean. After inspecting a strange figure standing at the other end of the pier a tall man apears, claiming that you're late and ushering the player on to his ship - which has now just appeared. On the ship the captain tells the player to collect tickets from ther other passengers. From there the player talks to each passenger. learns who they are, why they are on the ship and what the player has to do with any of this.\n\nThere's not much to be said besides that to be honest, the game is very short and describing the story anymore would spoil it. The player talks to each passenger, is given a few choices on dialogue and a simple task to complete, usually picking up an item and returning it to the passenger. Besides that there isn't anything else to the gameplay.\n\nGraphically the game is quite nice, with everything presented in a somewhat cel-shaded style. It's symplistic but it works and all the assets fit together with out anything looking out of place. The sound is much the same, each character has a sound cue that plays when they talk to give them a little more personality and what music there is helps the mood.\n\nUltimately though, whether or not you'll enjoy the game depends on how much you enjoy the story. As mentioned before it's very short and while there are different responses to the different dialogue choices as well as two different endings, the whole game can be completed in a single sitting. There are acheivement but they don't really add to the game and feel a little tacked on at the end.\n\nPersonally, I enjoyed the game.

Listening to their stories is also interesting because they hold the key to your identity.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, like the graphics that are so reassuring and freakening at the same time: while it's not a dark game, when you see floating stuffs, a huge toy sheet and shadows, you're asking yourself what's happening.

Shouldn't you be a simple passenger?\n\nAnyway, there are no puzzles there: apart speaking, finding a teddy bear and mixing drinks, you're just confronted to a poor gameplay. Yet, the dialogues here are important if you want to understand the story and find answers. The quest for the pencils and the paintings is also a nice bonus, though that for the paintings, it's very easy.\n\nThe main problem of the game is the fact that you have an hard time to find a menu, you have to press Escape to make it appear and to quit properly the game. The screen title lacks options.\n\nBut there is another problem with the game that will bother AZERTY users. The game is set with WASD keys, without ZQSD alternative or arrows. While the fix for comfort is to move the mouse and to keep pressing on W, as it's not natural  to press the W instead of the Z, once you're releasing the key, you have some seconds to remind yourself, that no, the key you're so used to press isn't the same.\n\nOther than that, I enjoyed the experience.

That's why I gave it a thumbs down.\n\nPlaying a free low-skill tech demo still occupies your time, and unless you consider that worthless, you can skip Port of Call without having to worry that you miss anything.\n\nThis game proves nothing more that the dev has very basic technical game-making skills. The story writing and such is slightly below OK. The story is like a copy of a witty story with surprise twists and then making it fully predictable, removing anything special and appealing from it, so it's bascially totally unspectacular. Also, the dialogues, while occasionally providing choices, not only have no effect on the progress of events, but often don't even result in different responses. This was especially bad towards the end, when the resolution forces its course even if your dialogue choices go totally against it, and that was like the seal of truth on what I perceived before.\n\nThere are achievements for doing stuff of no consequence or even not making sense. You collect crayons that are lying around. Why? Why should you pick them up? You have no need for them, no incentive to pick them up.\n\nEven so much as different text colors for you and others was too much to ask. Your text is placed slightly lower than NPC text, that's all.\n\nI don't know, maybe some people actually find this entertaining (especially if you have never experienced remarkable writing), but generally a game published on Steam should be focused on the player, not the developer. This is like: \"Look, I can make a game with kind of a story. Please take half an hour to admire that. I offer it for free, so you cannot complain no matter what.\"\n\nI feel like I watched a commercial.

Und da ich ein gro\u00dfer Fan von Games dieses Genres bin, konnte ich mir dieses, das obendrein auch noch kostenlos ist, nicht entgehen lassen ;)\n\nZur Steuerung:\nDie Steuerung ist - f\u00fcr solch ein minimalistisches Spiel wie Port of Call - vollkommen ausreichend und zufridenstellend. Die teilweise Controllerunterst\u00fctzung die hier bei Steam angegeben ist funktioniert mit einem 360-Controller einwandfrei, abgesehen davon, dass sich das Pausenmen\u00fc nicht mit Start aufrufen l\u00e4sst, sondern man tats\u00e4chlich auf den esc-Knopf der Tastatur zur\u00fcckgreifen muss. Mich pers\u00f6nlich hat dies allerdings nicht gest\u00f6rt, vor allem da das Spiel wirklich nur sehr kurz ist und man es so nicht unbedingt unterbrechen muss ^^\n\nZur Grafik:\nNaja, was soll man hier schon gro\u00df sagen? Bei Port of Call handelt es sich ganz offensichtlich um ein Indiegame und das sieht man der Grafik auch leider sehr an. Nicht besonders \u00fcberragend, aber Schlimmeres habe ich allemal schon gesehen, auch bei Spielen die etwas gekostet haben ^^\n\nZur Story:\nLeider hatte die Story f\u00fcr mein Empfinden selbst f\u00fcr die kurze Spieldauer etwas zu wenig Tiefgang, sodass mich selbst das Ende bzw die \"Aufl\u00f6sung\" der Situation nicht unbedingt ber\u00fchren konnte. Die Dialoge sind alle sehr knapp gehalten, sodass man auch wirklich nur das n\u00f6tigste von den Charakteren erf\u00e4hrt - auch die verschiedenen Dialogoptionen f\u00fchren letztendlich doch zu den selben bzw. \u00e4hnlichen Antworten. \nVielleicht ist das ja wirklich nur mein Eindruck, weil ich nicht bei jedem toten Kind in Videospielen gleich in Tr\u00e4nen ausbreche (Himmel, das sind auch nur Menschen, genau wie Erwachsene xD)  allerdings finde ich dies doch sehr schade, da die Story doch gerade der Grund daf\u00fcr war, dass ich mir das Spiel gedownloaded habe ;)\n\nFazit:\nAuch wenn mein Review fast nur die negativen Seiten des Spiels aufgreift, so m\u00f6chte ich doch eine Empfehlung f\u00fcr Port of Call aussprechen. Gerade in Zeiten, in denen so viele Indiegames praktisch einfach nur versuchen, Five Nights at Freddy's oder Slender nachzuahmen, schl\u00e4gt Port of Call eine ganz andere Richtung ein indem es sich auf die Story konzentriert. So erschafft das Spiel dennoch eine d\u00fcstere bis fast schon gruselige Atmosph\u00e4re...und das ganz ohne nervige Jumpscares ;)\nWer auf der Suche nach einem Spiel ist, mit dem er sich die Zeit vertreiben und einfach mal abschalten und Dialoge lesen kann - hier wird er bestens bedient. Und hey...das Spiel ist kostenlos! ;D\n\n\nAU\u00dfERDEM m\u00f6chte ich an dieser Stelle eine Triggerwarnung aussprechen, da in Port of Call (offensichtlich) Themen wie der Tod von geliebten Menschen und Selbstmord angesprochen werden.", "timestamp_created": 1441120896, "timestamp_updated": 1441120896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17831156": {"recommendationid": "17831156", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005107781", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441120493}, "language": "english", "review": "2deep4u walking simulator", "timestamp_created": 1441120513, "timestamp_updated": 1441120513, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.395197", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17830772": {"recommendationid": "17830772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045100584", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441027745}, "language": "english", "review": "No matter what you say or do it ends in a choice of two different ways.

I want to be able to run around looking for paintings, and crayons; not be stepping in gum with every footfall. \n\n\nPROs: \n\n+ Partial voice-acting: Although a pet-peeve of mine, suits the style of the game very well. Included in both CONs and PROs, as I generally dislike partial voice-acting in games, and prefer either all-in or none, but it's well suited, so no points for or against, in my books.\n\n+ Ambiance: Very good; sounds and music set the tone of the environment very well, and give it that mysterious, yet familiar quality.\n\n+ Style: I like the art style, as well as the choice of paintings, and character designs.

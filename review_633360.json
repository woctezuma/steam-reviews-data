It's not 'bad', it's just that I can't currently recommend this and steam won't let me give a neutral review.\n\n*The Good*\nI'm honestly extremely excited to see where they take this, Clocktower/Haunting Grounds/Alien Isolation type horror games where there's a focus on a few memorable stalkers that you try and creep around. The game's graphics are solid for what they need to be (baring mouth animations) and very thematic.\n\n It's honestly pretty tense even in it's current state to creep around the mansion, and the fact that the stalkers aren't massively rubberbanded to you like some of the other games mentioned means that you can get a good feeling when you managed to slip past them. \n\nAlso just having developers focus on stealth and avoidance in the current generation of gaming is worth some degree of praise from me.\n\n*The Bad*\n>It's understandably brief at present. \n>There's also a lot of genuienly annoying quirks with the systems in place; grabbing items is just annoying when getting them from cubbords or closets for instance since it'll generally lead to the game closing/shutting the cubbords instead of grabbing the item unless you're squared on it.\n>It's also huge on stuttering and preformance issues.\n> A lot of the facial animations are pretty questionable in general\n>The voice acting is very hit and miss. To it's credit the stalkers are mostly hit.\n>A lot of the gameplay tends to just be 'grab this item and take it over here'\n>Stealth is very patchy and could use some more neuance. Maybe some light & dark mechanics as well?\n\n*Suggestions/Ideas*\n>Make all of the killers function differently would be a huge thing. <Spoilers>The girl in the attic approaches this with her sitting/not doing anything unless you grab something mechanics</spoilers> but it's not enough. The insect nun should cut you off with insects or use them to block doors temporarily or something whilst he's in a room. He gets a fantastic enterance and then pretty much acts like the first guy. I'm hoping that all of them have differing AI & mechanics to keep challenging the player; look at Haunting Grounds and what it did with it's stalkers. You can't really fight them, but all of them are still massively different from eachother in how they interact with you.\n>Flesh out the stealth system some more, maybe with light and dark mechanics to make hiding more than just running to the nearest closet\n>Expand upon the crafting in the game.\n>Make more quests than go to X and do Y. \n>Stick to the current amount of rubberbanding, I'm actually really happy with it.\n>Work on some better themes/OSTs for it. Legit playing some of the old Thief III themes in the background actually added a lot to my experience in this game.\n\nI'll be carefully following this though and I'm very excited for where you guys will take it.

The puzzles are very well placed and varied. As for the story, it's really quite immersive and haunting.\n\nThis is probably a minor detail, but the only thing that seemed off to me was the conversational pacing in the cutscenes. Feels like every sentence is blurted out and rushed so that the next line can immediately be spoken by the other characters. As for the voice acting, it's acceptable. It's interesting, because some may say that the voice acting needs work, but \"old style\" video games like these didn't feature that great of voice acting either. So it has the voiceovers going for it, yet also against it. It's hard to explain, but to me it's like this game is trying to seem like it was created back in the PS2 classic era of video games, but features the modern enhancements of widescreen displays and higher visual fidelity achievable today.\n\nOverall, Remothered has hit atmosphere and story on the nail. I can't wait for the full story to be unlocked soon!

I was *truly* afraid playing this game, I screamed out loud several times, not from some jump scare but because I got spotted and had to run my ass off to avoid getting impaled by a psychopath.\n\nThe sound design is ridiculously good and goes a long way to making the game truly scary.\n\nThe enemies are weirdly sensitive to noise.... if you stop movnig in crouch they'll hone in on you, and if you run they'll find you in seconds.

Las animaciones son algo rob\u00f3ticas y las expresiones faciales tampoco dicen mucho.\nEn cuanto a la ambientaci\u00f3n da bastante mal rollo, transmite ese agobio del personaje cuando intentamos evitar que nos vean o pillen. La IA del antagonista es bastante predecible y es f\u00e1cil de evitar o escapar.\nLos puntos de salvado escasean en la mansi\u00f3n, pero tampoco es que los necesites con bastante frecuencia, debido sobre todo a la torpe IA del antagonista. Haciendo comparativas, la IA del juego queda bastante lejos de lo que experimente en juegos como Al\u00eden Isolation.\nLa historia est\u00e1 muy currada y seg\u00fan avanzas quieres saber m\u00e1s el secreto que encierra los ocupantes de la mansi\u00f3n. Por otro lado, el juego al estar en acceso anticipado no te deja acceder a los logros del mismo, lo cual tampoco es que resulte imprescindible para disfrutarlo.\nPor lo tanto y para ir terminando, el juego en su base es interesante, su historia transmite empat\u00eda con el jugador.

I realize it is still in early access, and this review was written two months after its early access release, but on the off-chance that one of the folks working on this happens to see it, I'll leave some of its flaws in here\u2014and will of course edit it later when it's fully released and I've played it again! Despite its flaws though, I thought it was a pretty good game overall for $10.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\u2022 Wonderful atmosphere\u2014the background music, the chase music, the diagetic music, and the scenery itself. This game's got it down fairly well.\n\n\u2022 The characters are quite interesting. From our protagonist, Rosemary Reed, to our antagonists\u2014those being [spoiler]Dr. Richard Felton[/spoiler], [spoiler]the Red Nun[/spoiler], and [spoiler]Celeste / Jennifer Felton[/spoiler]. The little collectibles tell things about these characters\u2014mainly [spoiler]Dr. Felton[/spoiler]\u2014that are very interesting as well!\n\n\u2022 The story itself\u2014as to be expected from something in thought for a few years\u2014is great! \n\n\u2022 You can use sound to\u2014sort of\u2014determine where the killer is.\n\n\u2022 You can defend yourself, in a way.\n\n\u2022 You can heal at [spoiler]the mirrors with the metronomes in front of them[/spoiler].\n\n\u2022 In a way, Rosemary Reed reminds me of Heather Mason from Silent Hill 3 and Clarice Starling from Silence of the Lambs.\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\u2022 It is very easy to escape your would-be killers. To be perfectly honest, I found myself looping around a few particular pillars and then crouching behind them to escape my stalkers. It worked almost every time, and when it didn't, I just found another place to loop around. I also found myself using a potted plant to hide behind and escape. It was funny, but that's not the point of this.\n\n\u2022 The voice acting can definitely be improved upon. Also the character's lip-syncing with what they are saying\u2014also in Ms. Reed's case, when she is breathing\u2014is off a lot, if not all of the time.\n\n\u2022 The cutscenes can definitely be improved upon as well, as there is a stark\u2014harsh, even\u2014difference between them and the game itself. Perhaps the dialogue should be slowed down a tad bit as well.\n\n\u2022 99.9% of the drawers, cabinets, and cupboards in the game are useless. I can only recall one or two times when I actually found something in one of them.\n\n\u2022 It ends rather abruptly, as to be expected from a work in progress. Just adding this though.\n\n\u2022 [spoiler]Don't be like me. Smash the mirrors with the bricks that you were supplied with. You'll know what I mean when you get there. It took me a couple of deaths to figure it out.[/spoiler]\n\n\u2022 Save points are not [i]sparse[/i] per se, but if you're like me you'll find yourself going a while without saving.\n\n\u2022 The character's choice of attire for this situation is plain stupid. At the least, she could have taken her heels off and shortened her skirt with one of the many sharp objects you find. But that's just me being me.\n\n\nAgain, overall this was a very good early access game for what it is\u2014and if it is improved upon, it can only rise to further greatness.", "timestamp_created": 1514519294, "timestamp_updated": 1514519294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38747616": {"recommendationid": "38747616", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041595853", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514094602}, "language": "english", "review": "Very enjoyable, feels like it's from the golden age of horror games.

Um tapa na minha cara por este jogo! Subestimei esse t\u00edtulo no come\u00e7o, colocando defeito em tudo. Sou muito c\u00e9tico para jogos de terror. Dificilmente, algum me prende a aten\u00e7\u00e3o. Esse jogo me fez bocejar logo nos primeiros minutos. Achei 'interessantinho', mas o deixei de lado e tinha certeza que nunca mais iria jog\u00e1-lo. Numa hora dessas, abri o jogo, sem querer, e tentei jogar por mais uns 5 minutos. Poxa! Na verdade, fiquei quase a tarde toda. \n\nPrimeiramente, interessou-me a combina\u00e7\u00e3o de jogo furtivo, ou seja, tentar esconder-se o tempo todo, com a estrutura dos 'Resident Evil's cl\u00e1ssicos, isto \u00e9, buscar um item que encaixa, mesmo n\u00e3o tendo l\u00f3gica, verossimilhan\u00e7a com a situa\u00e7\u00e3o na vida real. Raramente, gosto de algum jogo que temos que jogar de maneira furtiva, mas a mec\u00e2nica desse funciona muito bem! Lembrou-me 'Dead by Daylight', andando agachado atr\u00e1s de objetos e tomando cuidado quando um som de alerta se intensifica indicando que o perigo se aproxima. No come\u00e7o, achei p\u00e9ssima a precis\u00e3o para pegar as armas de defesas, por\u00e9m depois concordei que o jogo fica, de fato, muito mais tenso dessa maneira. \n\nA hist\u00f3ria me prendeu. No in\u00edcio, achei que seria mais uma daquelas historinhas bobinhas. Nem dou bola para narrativas em games mesmo. No entanto...uau! Fiquei bem interessado em saber mais depois que acabou o jogo (de acesso antecipado). Onde eu parei, a hist\u00f3ria j\u00e1 ganhou complexidade e j\u00e1 ficou bem diferente de tudo que eu imaginava. O jogo ficou mais tenso, os desafios tamb\u00e9m. Portanto, quem \u00e9 muito c\u00e9tico, como eu, deve jogar uma horinha, pelo menos, pois n\u00e3o ir\u00e1 se arrepender. \n\nESTOU ANSIOSO PELO JOGO FINAL!!!", "timestamp_created": 1514246787, "timestamp_updated": 1514246787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38634897": {"recommendationid": "38634897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106382869", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514143523}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased this game after reading some reviews referencing Clock Tower series. Just to be clear... Back in the days when the grass was greener I played Clock Tower 2 on PS1, which eventually became my gold standard for horror games; I got all possible endings, learned all dialogues by heart.. God.. Even tried to learn how to play that ending song.. \nSo, when purchasing Remothered I was hoping for a similar experience with that eerie atmosphere of defenselessness and fear of the unknown.. Did I get it? - No. Don't get me wrong - it's a decent game and, imo, it's probably worth its 10 EUR if you're into horror games in general. \nBut if you're expecting an experience similar to what you had with CT1-2,  sorry to disappoint you - it's not there. It feels more like an Outlast-type game than a Clock Tower one. Yes, there are some spooky moments and hide'n'seek stuff, but more frequently I felt I was playing a stealth game: \"Ok. Now, I got 'the basement door key' - I probably have to go to the basement. Let's activate the alarm and hide behind the table. While [the bad guys] are searching for me in the wrong place, I'll pass by unnoticed and head further to my destination\". \nAlso, don't expect a finished story.. that's actually the most disappointing part to me, as the game ends when the things actually get interesting. \nUpvoting, only because it's a good beta.

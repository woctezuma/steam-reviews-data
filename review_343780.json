You play as a furry little cat and infront of you lies a vast sea to scour and fish.  You start on land with only a basic rod.  Then you can sell the fish you catch for money to buy improved fishing gear, boats, and plenty of other items to help you catch some of the bigger, more challenging, and rare fish.  There is a good amount of customization which allows you to develope your own style of fishing.  The game is very casual and the simple controls makes it easy to play.  Still there is plenty of action and strategy involved in wrestling the fish back to the surface without being eaten by bigger fish.  There is a large and unique variety of fish, and a organized log to keep track of the fish you caught.  Each type of fish has its own behavior and specific location that adds to the challenge of catching it.  You can also find plenty of hats to wear in the sea that add a nice bonus and cosmetic to your cat.  Cat Goes Fishing is short, though there is a suprising amount of depth and alot of charm which makes this game highly replayable.  This game is well worth the money and the time spent.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31699029-The-Wisdom-of-Oz/] For more quality reviews, check out and follow my curator page!

It's something to do when just sort of sitting around. It's simple enough to be straight forward, sometimes is a little tricky and sometimes a little about luck. Sometimes it can be just a little frustrating in a good way, where it's just enough to keep you wanting to play more, but the game is casual easy, which I think is part of what makes it so relaxing.\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics are just down right adorable. It might be a little like a flash game, but I find nothing wrong with the simplicity of that because it works for what the game is (not to mention there is just nothing wrong with flash games in general, game is a game).\nThe fish all have a certain charm to them with the artistic style. The Cat is Cute. The game's graphics and aesthetics all contribute nicely to the games relaxing feeling.\n\nThe controls are simple and easy. Casting is easy to control, and boat movement is simple enough. Combining the two adds some extra control for the player. Menu's are straightforward to navigate through.\n\nThe strategy for the game is quite simple to figure out, so it's not really challenging persey, but that's just part of the simplistic nature of the game, which I think really just lends to the casual relaxation of it. Cat Goes Fishing doesn't need terribly complex controls and stategy to be fun.\n\nThe music track 'Easy Lemon' is so absolutely perfect for this game, and incredibly relaxing. I personally find attatchment to games in part from the audio componants of them, with music being a powerful aspect, and when I play this game I absolutely never get sick of hearing Easy Lemon.... I didn't like the other track much, it was ok. I kept finding myself wanting to hear easy lemon instead though (as silly as that is). I also enjoy the sound effects, the cat's little myau's are perfect little polishes to the game in my opinion.\n\nAnother great aspect about this game that I think is overlooked a little, is how nice it is that the dev has taken time to do some bug fixes over the years, and some rebalancing and even some content updates (with another planned content update at the time of this writing from what I understand from their web page).\n\nConstructive Criticisms:\n\nI find it can be a little dodgey to toss fish into the back of a boat, so whenever I catch something that's really worth a lot I just take it straight back to shore. Would be nice if there was maybe just a button that moves a fish into the boat without risk of it falling out the back. Been a few time's that I was disapointed from trying to toss the larger fishies into the boat, only to have them accidently bounce out the back and turn into bait. Course, the work around is bring it to shore ASAP, but that breaks a little immersion.\n\nIt would be nice if hats were equipable like the fishing rods. I stick with the Cuddlebane I caught because I really like it's effect, but sometimes I wish I could swap out to a different hat just for aesthetics  or different stats. This is a feature I think should be added, particularly because without a hat storage and equip changing it makes me fear hat's I see in the water... I did a save edit just one time because I was so disapointed when I accidently hooked a common hat I did not want..\nI felt a little dirty for doing that, but also justified it because hat swapping makes just as much sense as changing your boat. They shouldnt need to be rebought, especially because some are not purchaseable (like the Cuddlebane). It would add collectability to the hats and make them appealing to catch, rather than something aversive due to fear of losing the ability on a currently worn hat.\n\nThere's a lack of small fish at night time, which makes it really hard to begin catching larger fish, such as the Noctis and other plethora of medium sized fish that are available at night. I understand that night seems like the sort of time where small fish would be hiding, and sleeping etc.. But when catching larger fish requires the need for your bait to scale up in steps it can be a little bit of a disapointment when you see all the interesting night fish you'd like to catch up, but just cant because lack of bait. Sure, there is the wait button to go back to daytime, but that doesn't quite solve the issue.\nWhat would solve it though, and would be great even for daytime fishing, is if different sized bait's were just purchasable from the shop. I think that would work great with the current level of Small fish at night, because it would make night time feel a bit more special and something to save money up for during the day, as well as lend itself to the casual nature of the game. Making only level 1 and level 2 bait available in the shop would be a good balance, so that level 3 still requires the recasting of a medium sized fish that's been caught.\nMaybe even just make it a \"bait tin\" item you can click to \"bait the hook\" and be something you can hold only a limited number of and be purchaseable only during the day. Could be a whole new type of item to upgrade, similar to the boat, where different stages of tin hold different quantities of differing levels of bait. It's all just a thought.\n\nAnd the Last Constructive Criticism I have is the lack of a full version on iOS and Andriod....\nThis isn't a real criticism of the game I guess, just a wish really..\nI seriously wish very much that there was a full version for iOS and android (especially iOS).\nI know there is a LITE version for Andriod (and I have it), but I would certainly have no issue paying for this game again on my Android and iOS devices. I really recommend the dev make a full version available for both... Would be really wonderful to have it for those platforms as the full version.\nWith support on more platforms it could reach more people, and the casualness of this game would be just SO perfect for mobile devices. I'd personally buy the game for a few people I know if the full version was on Android and iOS (as I know a few people with these platforms that would absolutely love to have this game with them on the go, of course myself included).\n\nCat goes fishing is a game that I think many people can enjoy.", "timestamp_created": 1516010055, "timestamp_updated": 1516012857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39326741": {"recommendationid": "39326741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195282103", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521130959}, "language": "english", "review": "great for killing time and pretty fun.", "timestamp_created": 1515897982, "timestamp_updated": 1515897982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39322772": {"recommendationid": "39322772", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303444145", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517485870}, "language": "polish", "review": "Polecam gor\u0105co ;)", "timestamp_created": 1515883774, "timestamp_updated": 1515883774, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39322399": {"recommendationid": "39322399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171432405", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517604970}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bardzo mi\u0142a, odpr\u0119\u017caj\u0105ca gierka.

The game however goes farther than the premise. There are two modes to play, classic and realistic. Classic is a mode where you can catch any fish and they will not fight back, in realistic the fish fight your reel and the bigger the fish the bigger the fight. There are over 40 different species of fish to catch in the game which fall into the categories of small, medium, large, and huge. The fish also all have different sale values. There are many different fishing rods and even more rod upgrades to buy as well as boats and bait upgrades. All the upgrades in the game can truly change the mechanics of the gameplay which is fun to evolve into how you want to play. There are also over 20 hats to find and collect in the ocean which give various upgrades and buffs also changing gameplay. The game can be a grind at some points saving up for more expensive items, but the grinds do not last very long. This game is very calming and relaxing as well as intense. It is a load of fun exploring the ocean and fighting to catch a new fish you just saw or completing the quests you have been assigned. Overall Cat Goes Fishing is a very fun addictive game and is a cacophony which is all new and original, and the wealth of things to do will keep you coming back for more. I can beyond a shadow of a doubt recommend this game to anyone and everyone interested.

The vast mayority of the fish are very distinguishable by their color and shape. \n\nThe sounds and music are very well made. The underwater sounds resonate with the depth that your in and the music on the surface is quite tranquile. \n\nAll in all you have a simplistic fishing game that is nice and tranquile for those afternoons when you just need to space out.

At first I felt like a fish out of water for this game, but after serval attempts it made quite the splash. This game, in its simplest form, is purrfect. With all the games these days, death is a constant, and it seems like you need nine lives. It\u2019s good to play a game that the only death is of the aquatic amphibious. Don't get a hairball, keep trying and this game will be like a cat\u2019s meow.\n Overall rating of a scale 1 to 11.\n 5, average, right in the middle  ._.\n\n[h1] Gamer Review\t[/h1]\n(The view point of a person who plays video games)\n[b] Pros:\t[/b]\n+Lots of fish\n+Relaxing\n+Lots of upgrades\n\n[b] Cons:\t[/b]\n- It feels like a game that your could get for free.\n\nCat Goes Fishing is a nice game where you can spend sometime and catch some cool fish. I suggest to get it on discount. \nThe video that plays when you go to the store page shows what the game is. It's exactly like that. You will love it or find it boring but if you are into these types of game than get it and enjoy.\n\nI would not give this a thumbs up or down it's more of a neutral thumb, but I am nice so I would give it a thumbs up.\n\n[b] This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: [/b]\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curation\n\nThis review is just my opinion.

You can play it for 5 minutes or 2 hours. I have found myself immersed in 2-3 hour sessions of this wonderful indie title.\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n- The art style is a perfect blend of cartoon and realism.\n\n- The quests, although some can be extremely difficult, present a nice balance of challenge, objective, and progression.\n\n- The developers are quick to patch bugs or errors and pay close attention to what the community has to offer. For examle, I posted a screenshot to show my friends that I had snagged my first legendary hat. I expressed that I felt that hat was slightly nerf. Within a week a developer had commented saying that next patch they would buff it. \n\n- The AI for the fish is so well build. Each one of the 40+ fish in the game have a unique fighting style when hooked. Also, some fish travel together, chase eachother, and some will protect their \"leader.\" I would like to write more about the AI but it would take hours.\n\n- The game progression is layed out perfectly, the larger, and harder to catch fish are father out at sea which requres the player to buy a boat, stronger fish are deeper, which requres the player to buy a better rod. The prices are layed out perfectly so when you dont get all the rods, then all the boats, air vice versa.\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n\n- The music can get a little repetitive, but this can easily be fixed. EDIT 1: Hat for new music was added :D\n\nTo be honest there arent that many cons :)\n\n[b] Suggestions [/b]\n\n- I feel this game could improve visually by adding in more customization options. These could include rod colors, boat, colors, boat names.\n\n- Lastly, on realism mode I think a day night cycle could be cool. EDIT 1: Added\n\n[h1] For 6.99 this game is 100% worth it!

Das wars auch schon.\nDieses Spiel handelt nur von einer Katze, die scheinbar alle ihre 9 Leben darauf verwendet, immer gr\u00f6\u00dfere und seltenere Fische zu fangen. Dabei schaltet man immer mehr Gadgets und andere Hilfsmittel frei, mit denen man sich das Angelabenteuer erleichtern kann.\n\nDie Story ist in diesem Spiel vernn\u00e4chl\u00e4ssigbar, weshalb ich an dieser Stelle keine Bewertung abgeben will.\n\n\n[h1][b]Das Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\n\nDas Gameplay wirkt erstmal sehr abgestumpft und \u00f6de. Man holt mit der Angel aus, in dem man die linke Maustaste gedr\u00fcckt h\u00e4lt und wirft sie aus, in dem man besagte Taste im richtigen Moment losl\u00e4sst.\nH\u00e4ngt ein Fisch ander Angel, so kann man diesen einholen, in dem man erneut die linke Maustaste gedr\u00fcckt h\u00e4lt.\n\nDieses System klingt zunn\u00e4chst sehr langweilig.\nJedoch ist es wichtig, bei steigendem Schwierigkeitsgrad, seine Gadgets sinnvoll und an die Bed\u00fcrfnisse angepasst einzusetzen. Dazu kommt ein fesselndes Levelsystem und eine irgendwie hypotisierende Titelmusik.\n\nAlles in allem gebe ich dem Gesamtpaket 6/10 Punkten, da es eine wirklich nette Idee und auch eine gute Umsetzung hat, jedoch kommt man bei dem Spiel sehr schnell an die Grenzen, weshalb es auch schnell an Reiz verliert.\n\n\n[h1][b]Meine Bewertung:[/b][/h1]\n\n[b]Pro:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Entspannende Atmossph\u00e4re durch Musik\n[*]Ausgefeiltes Levelsystem\n[*]Gute Steigerungskurve beim Schwierigkeitsgrad\n[*]Leicht zu verstehende Gadgets\n[/list]\n\n[b]Kontra:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Man hat schnell alles gesehen\n[*]Kaum unterschied zwischen den beiden Spielmodi\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1][b]Mein Fazit:[/b][/h1]\n\nAn sich ist das Spiel eine nette Abwechslung, wenn man nach einem actiongeladenem Ego-Shooter mal komplett abschalten will. F\u00fcr den Preis von 6.99\u20ac ist es auch f\u00fcr die nicht all zu prall gef\u00fcllten Geldbeutel immernoch erschwinglich. Jedoch sollte man beim Kauf bedenken, dass dieses Spiel sehr stark beschr\u00e4nkt ist und man schon nach etwa 15 Spielstunden \"am Ende\" sein kann.\n\nInsgesamt habe ich mich auf 5/10 Punkten festgelegt. Es hat zwar viele gute Eigenschaften, jedoch lassen mich die Einfachheit des Spiels und die starken Einschr\u00e4nkungen bez\u00fcglich Langlebigkeit des Spielspa\u00dfes viele Abz\u00fcge machen.\n\n\n[i][b]Dieses Review wurde als Wertung innerhalb des eigenen Genres verfasst.[/b]\n\nWenn euch diese Review gefallen hat, dann folgt unserem Reviewprogramm auf [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/-German_Gamer_Community-]German_Gamer_Community[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1451823923, "timestamp_updated": 1451823980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532944", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20234979": {"recommendationid": "20234979", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991587929", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466548311}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so simple, but it's REALLY fun.

Do the thing, unlock things that make it easier to do the thing, do the thing more.  Unfortunately, it suffers from unfocused game design, and leads to a lot of frustration.\n\nThere are four different sizes of fish, each having a minimum size of bait required to catch them -- but ALL fish go after and try to steal ALL bait, not just bait their own ranking.  The only way to get this bait is by catching a fish of one rank, and throwing it back in to get bait of the next rank.  Lastly, any time you're pulling a fish in, any larger fish it passes will nibble on it, damaging your catch and lowering its value (and making it not count towards quests - though it can still be bait).  This bait system works against itself in the worst, least productive way.\n\nSo let's say you catch a small fish.  You throw it back in as Medium Bait, and start trauling for bigger -- oops, no, another small fish ate it.  You start pulling in your new small fish, and the medium fish you were trying to catch darts in and eats half of it before you can get it back on board.  So you throw it back as medium bait, and try again.  Three attempts later, you finally catch your first medium fish.  You throw it back as Large bait, aiming to hook a big one -- oops, no, the cheapest variety of small fish just ate your bait, and then got eaten to the bones by a medium fish again.  And you have a quest to catch three large fish, and the game will not progress until you manage.\n\nUnfortunately this ruins it as a casual experience, adding difficulty via grinding.  I'm holding out hope for an eventual upgrade that will make it go away, but it's not in sight yet.  I'll change the review if I find it.  Example upgrades that could turn it around if they exist :\n- the ability to buy bait of the desired size\n- permanent upgrade that raises the minimum rank of your bait\n- permanent upgrade that makes fish on your line immune to being nibbled on on the way back\n- making fish stop stealing bait too low rank for them\n- making fish stop biting bait too high rank for them\n\n..but really, it would be better if one of those things were available from the start.", "timestamp_created": 1448924062, "timestamp_updated": 1448924062, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589062", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19393824": {"recommendationid": "19393824", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208401824", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451121974}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bardzo fajna gra, nie zajmuje du\u017co miejsca , szybko si\u0119 instaluje.Bardzo fajna gra polecam!", "timestamp_created": 1448906966, "timestamp_updated": 1448906966, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19390550": {"recommendationid": "19390550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012506945", "num_games_owned": 271, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449381144}, "language": "english", "review": "An accurate simulation of how a cat hunts for fish.\n10/10 purchase for educational purposes.", "timestamp_created": 1448897859, "timestamp_updated": 1448897859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19370324": {"recommendationid": "19370324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256873626", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467989755}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game about fishing n a cute cat! :)", "timestamp_created": 1448821231, "timestamp_updated": 1448821231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995632", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19339873": {"recommendationid": "19339873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178534501", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471789915}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e", "timestamp_created": 1448730272, "timestamp_updated": 1448730272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19255793": {"recommendationid": "19255793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094722924", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454967372}, "language": "english", "review": "Its everything anyone could ever want out of a game 15/10 \nyou lose yourself in the game \nits hypnotic and therapeutic \n(the fish are kinda jerks sometimes TBH)", "timestamp_created": 1448397919, "timestamp_updated": 1448397919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975774", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19245984": {"recommendationid": "19245984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087378581", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464751765}, "language": "english", "review": "Strangely addictive and fun.", "timestamp_created": 1448349076, "timestamp_updated": 1448349076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19163901": {"recommendationid": "19163901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141325098", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447018617}, "language": "english", "review": "Cat Goes Fishing, (CGF), is a casual, inide, fishing, singleplayer simulation and, I dont really like it.

It has become almost a trend in gaming to put a Cat or funny animal into an unusual role and forget the importance of game design. When it comes to Cat Gone Fishing, the adorable aesthetic aside. The game is very well designed and highly addictive. Yes, it's a cat holding a fishing rod and it is adorable but that aside the core gameplay of Cat Goes Fishing is what I enjoyed most about this game. With dozens of upgrades available for your rod, boat, radar and more, you will turn your Cat into a fishing machine as you begin to battle the monsters underneath the surface. Cat Goes Fishing is a wonderful game to just load up and completely just fall into and relax while you play it, discovering even more aquatic animals after you think you've found everything. The only true complaint I could have about the game is it's lack of options, Cat Goes Fishing shows its mobile roots with no shame. While this may be disconcerting to some, I found the positives of this fun and adorable game to far outweigh the bad. Besides, guys, it's a Cat wearing a hat and fishing! Come on!

Cat Goes Fishing is a fishing simulator from Cat5Games. Let\u2019s get rocking.\n\nThe Good\n\nCat Goes Fishing gets everything just about perfect. The controls are as simple as they come and you won\u2019t even need a tutorial to figure them out. If you did, you\u2019d probably be some sort of mollusk\u2026and not one of the smart ones.\n\nThere is a delightful plethora of fish for you to catch. The small fries can be caught without any special baiting, but, the further up the scale you move, the bigger the bait you\u2019re going to need to attract your Moby Dick\u2019s interest.\n\nThere are several items for you to purchase that will aid you in your fishing endeavors. You can get new rods (and upgrades for each of them), you can buy boats to take you out further onto the lake, you can get a sonar to show you where fish are in the lake, and much more.\n\nThe boats were especially useful. Some fish only appear further out in the lake and, so, would be unreachable without a boat of some kind. The boat also lets you store a finite amount of fish so that you can sell them when you get back to shore.\n\nCGF offers the player \u201cquests\u201d to complete. This results in the player gaining experience and working towards a level up to unlock more gear, but it also fights back at the repetitiveness of the game itself. When you\u2019re given a goal to work towards, you don\u2019t get bored quite as much.\n\nThe Bad\n\nInevitably, CGF does become repetitive. There\u2019s only so much digital fishing one can do before they get tired of it.\n\nThe Meh\n\nCGF also has hats for you to find in the depths and equip your character with. The hats are absurdly hard to find and you rarely come across one at a moment when you could actually try and snag it with your hook.\n\nVerdict: Yea\n\nCat Goes Fishing is fun, but it\u2019s more of a novelty game for killing time. If you see it go on sale, by all means, buy it. It\u2019s worth of few bucks. You can find it in the Steam Store.

At first it's kind of zen, you just hook fish from the water. Then it starts getting more complicated - you catch a small fish which you use as bait for bigger ones, which can then be used to catch the biggest ones. The problem is that the water is filled pretty densely with fish and fish you don't care about will constantly take the bait instead. So many times I made a large bait and then threw it in only for it to immediately be taken by a tiny fish near the surface. Additionally bigger fish can bite at smaller fish caught on your line and if they do, the fish you caught won't count for any quests you have.

Visuals are nice, animations are fine, and music is okay to listen to for a while (then press M to turn it off). Upgrades come in pretty quickly at first, then mid-game there is a lot of unrewarded gold grind while you save for better rods + upgrades, boats, and other upgrades. Quests are decent gold but you can easily get stuck on a quest if you haven't gotten the proper rod/upgrades yet. Also, fish take time to respawn so you may have to wait for the fish you want (or get a boat to increase your fishing range). At end-game once you can grind the shark/maw/anglerfish, gold comes in quickly enough to upgrade everything you want and more.\n\nFishing is pretty straightforward: catch a small fish to catch a medium fish to catch a large/huge fish while avoiding fish you don't want to catch. I upgraded reel speed and lure sink speed to better avoid fish I didn't want to take. The Bait Guard and Crankbait upgrades are really useful, but are also very expensive to grind. Minimap and radar upgrades are nice for avoiding unwanted fish, though you can throw your line beyond the radar (which might be fixed in the beta). Radar is also useful for finding where the Maw/Anglerfish spawn and where you can cast to avoid the most fish on the way down.\n\nPretty fun for a 2D fishing simulator, though I would've liked more special fish like the shark. The shark takes your live fish and drags your line further away, effectively extending your rod's reach further than you normally could go. It's pretty fun to use when you're starting out with mediocre rods and no boat, but I don't think there's any more sharks further out so everything beyond the initial screen is just simple fishing.", "timestamp_created": 1428753469, "timestamp_updated": 1428753469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15304452": {"recommendationid": "15304452", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030243254", "num_games_owned": 361, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428749651}, "language": "japanese", "review": "Meow", "timestamp_created": 1428750655, "timestamp_updated": 1428750655, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506494", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15295255": {"recommendationid": "15295255", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052590023", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506169160}, "language": "english", "review": "The game `Cat Goes Fishing\u00b4 turns out to be a minimalistic but nice pastime.

Tip : I think the best one to wear is the baseball cap, because being able to have two quests at the same time is great, especially if you are stuck with one, since you cannot drop it.\n\nIn the end, this game is simple but pretty fun, even though it is a little bit grindy if you want to unlock everything and get all of the achievements.", "timestamp_created": 1422810940, "timestamp_updated": 1422810940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.425328", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14280630": {"recommendationid": "14280630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049159669", "num_games_owned": 1244, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 1362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490012338}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u306b\u306f\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3060\u3051\uff08\u305d\u308c\u3082\u5de6\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3060\u3051\uff09\u3067\u904a\u3079\u308b\u9b5a\u91e3\u308a\u3060\u3088\n\n\n\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u9069\u5f53\u306a\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3067\u96e2\u3059\n\u3059\u308b\u3068\u5cb8\u8fba\u306e\u732b\u304c\u91e3\u308a\u7aff\u3092\u632f\u308b\n\u91e3\u308a\u91dd\u306f\u98db\u3093\u3067\u3044\u304f\n\u91e3\u308a\u7cf8\u3092\u5dfb\u304d\u623b\u3057\u305f\u308a\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u9b5a\u304c\u639b\u304b\u308b\u306e\u3092\u5f85\u3064\n\u9b5a\u304c\u91e3\u308a\u91dd\u306b\u4e0a\u624b\u304f\u639b\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3089\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3092\u30af\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u3057\u3066\u91e3\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\n\u9b5a\u3092\u58f2\u308b\n\u9b5a\u3092\u58f2\u3063\u305f\u304a\u91d1\u3067\u3088\u308a\u826f\u3044\u7aff\u3068\u304b\u6d77\u306b\u6f15\u304e\u51fa\u305b\u308b\u30dc\u30fc\u30c8\u3068\u304b\u3092\u8cb7\u3046\n\u306a\u3093\u304b\u3084\u308b\u3053\u3068\u306f\u30b7\u30f3\u30d7\u30eb\u306a\u306e\u306b\u6c17\u4ed8\u304f\u3068\u6b62\u3081\u6642\u3092\u898b\u5931\u3063\u3066\u4e00\u5fc3\u4e0d\u4e71\u306b\u7aff\u3092\u964d\u308a\u7d9a\u3051\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\n\u4e00\u884c\u76ee\u306b\u623b\u308b", "timestamp_created": 1422802864, "timestamp_updated": 1422802864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.806342", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14278265": {"recommendationid": "14278265", "author": {"steamid": "76561198138095226", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 61, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422842029}, "language": "english", "review": "very relax game!", "timestamp_created": 1422793943, "timestamp_updated": 1422793943, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14275943": {"recommendationid": "14275943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048980957", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480172056}, "language": "german", "review": "es ist Wundersch\u00f6n :,D  (\u3065\u25d5\u203f\u25d5)\u3065", "timestamp_created": 1422784010, "timestamp_updated": 1422784010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14272277": {"recommendationid": "14272277", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105385568", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463610768}, "language": "french", "review": "Tr\u00e8s bon jeux pour se d\u00e9tendre.", "timestamp_created": 1422761828, "timestamp_updated": 1422761828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14270313": {"recommendationid": "14270313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001066632", "num_games_owned": 1364, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 2618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512929256}, "language": "english", "review": "To paraphrase the old Ronseal adverts from the UK, this game does exactly what it says on the tin.

There are a few other fun features that give this game a playful, meaningful and yet simple to understand, feel that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone.\n\nIf you are looking for a relaxing game that doesn't cause you to obsessively keep track of every detail, a game that helps you unwind from a hectic day, this might be for you.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that has mild strategy, a fishy smell and a furry protagonist, this is for you.\n\nIf you broke your thumb and two fingers on your left hand, no worries.

It may be cute, but the grind gets old fast.\n\nFor example, let's take the bait mechanics.  Catching a small fish is easy enough, but if you want to catch medium fish, you must first catch a small fish and recast it.  To catch a large fish, you must catch a small fish, recast it as bait, catch a medium fish with that, and recast that one too.

It's kinda grind-y.\n-The music is ok but it repeats way too much.\n-It doesn't feel like a PC game, it still feels like a mobile port.\n-Resolution that doesn't fit my screen entirely.\n\nSUGESTIONS FOR DEVS:\n-Add a menu where you can change resolution/music options.\n-Add more overall content (New hats, more rods, etc)\n-Change the music so it loops purrfectly (Get it?)\n-Make it so you can collect hats and don't have to sell them and only have one at a time.\n\nOVERALL:\nGood game to relax to after a long day of work/school/whatever. It isn't at it's best however, and I feel the devs can really improve it.", "timestamp_created": 1422073270, "timestamp_updated": 1422073389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14137147": {"recommendationid": "14137147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076450397", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516406940}, "language": "english", "review": "its like fishing but without fishing", "timestamp_created": 1422073028, "timestamp_updated": 1467729312, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14136545": {"recommendationid": "14136545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053444572", "num_games_owned": 428, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455955215}, "language": "english", "review": "Never before in my life have I had an apopleptic fit while trying to fish because the FUCKING CUNT-GARBLING FISH KEEP FUCKING STEALING THE FUCKING BAIT\nFUCK", "timestamp_created": 1422069358, "timestamp_updated": 1422069358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14136074": {"recommendationid": "14136074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036160932", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471528171}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e 10 \u043c\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0439\u0442 ^^ \u0421\u0431\u043e\u0440 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0433 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0438\u0439, \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044b \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0435. \u041c\u043d\u0435 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0438 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u044f \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0443\u044e \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0443. \n\n\u041d\u0430 \u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0435 \u0441 \u0411\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0423\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u044e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430, \u0438 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0435 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0432\u043a\u0443 \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043d\u044b, \u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u044b\u0431\u044b. \n\n\u0422\u0443\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 :D", "timestamp_created": 1422066517, "timestamp_updated": 1422066517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14135442": {"recommendationid": "14135442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990833248", "num_games_owned": 3706, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509179140}, "language": "english", "review": "A very cute and fun game.

The art is friendly and colorful. There's 1 music track (turn it off by pressing M) that you can hear in the trailer. The actual game is simple and fun. When you cast your line, you control where the bait moves. Then when you hook a fish, you have to reel it back while avoiding the other fish that may want to eat it. You'll have to use a different type of strategy to catch each fish.\n\nThere's a leveling system where you can buy and upgrade things with the money from the fish you catch. It's a bit clunky and annoying to use, but I didn't feel that it took away from the game at all. You can buy different fishing rods and add some tweaks to augment your playing style. It's mostly to give you some goals and rewards.\n\nIt's an okay game.  It's missing a few things, but what's there is fun to play with.

Click for casting/reeling & A/D for movement. There is no tutorial as of the writing of this review, but getting the general sense on how to start casting to maximum effect is quite simple. There isn\u2019t any Menu either. \n\nWhile, the casting & movement mechanics couldn\u2019t get any simpler, there is some depth on how you choose to complete the quests. There are many different types of effects you can apply to your rod to target or dissuade various types of fish or to augment other elements. There are also tools both temporary & permanent that will come in handy.\n\nAs you catch fish & complete quests, you will level & accrue currency. As you level, the quests get progressively more difficult. However, from my experience, there does appear to be a degree of randomness with respect to the quest system; old quests will pop up time & again. The quests will progressively get more & more grindy. Completing them will require you to farm currency for pro-longed periods of time, before you can purchase the necessary items & upgrades to complete them.\n\n[i]Hats! Hats! & More Hats![/i] Yes, [i]Cat Goes Fishing[/i] does have an array of hats. They are obtained by catching them so keep an eye out. The sad part is that you can\u2019t collect them. You can only wear one hat at a time. Each hat provides a useful boost. Be wary of accidentally selling a hat, as it is easy to do. \n\nThere is an in-game catalog giving various details on the different types of fish, so it may yield some assistance in catching your desired fish.\n\nThe artwork is exactly as shown in the screenshots. The background scenery is under-utilized & quite bland. The sound is one uninspiring track looped continuously. Luckily, it can be muted with the \u2018M\u2019 key.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t label [i]Cat Goes Fishing[/i] as a fishing simulator. I wouldn\u2019t recommend it to those who love fishing & desire that experience, albeit through the eyes of a cat. Rather, [i]Cat Goes Fishing[/i] is a game you pop in when you have a few minutes to kill, just for the posterity of seeing a cat catch some fish, while wearing a snazzy hat.", "timestamp_created": 1422011875, "timestamp_updated": 1422016122, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.666963", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14123635": {"recommendationid": "14123635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120241184", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437508015}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0447\u0438\u0432\u043e \u043e\u0442\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0441\u044f \u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 youtube \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f \u0434\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e.\n\u0412\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0435\u043b \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 15 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442... \u0430\u0433\u0430... \u0434\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e.\n\u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440, \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0432\u044a\u0435\u0445\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0437\u044f \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 - \u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0440\u044b\u0431\u0443 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c. \u041e\u0442\u0434\u043e\u0445\u043d\u0451\u0442\u0435 \u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e.\n\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043b\u0438 \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c? \u041e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e - \u0434\u0430!\n\u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430.\n\u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e - \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430.\n\u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435 2015-\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0434, \u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u0432\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435\u0441\u044c, \"\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442 \u0440\u044b\u0431\u0443\" - \u0438 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439!!!\n\u041d\u0443 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446... \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b \u043a\u043e\u0442. \n10 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0451\u0434\u043e\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10!

Fishing up the smaller species initially and selling them will reward you with money, which is used for purchase of better rods or upgrades to current equipment. The game then introduces you to it's quest system, completing these tasks rewards larger sums of money. While questing the fish catalog becomes useful as it will display all species in the game.\n\nSometimes fishing in the depths you may discover rare hats, which not only look cute on cat but give large bonuses to both your fishing abilities and values of catches. More tongue in cheek one-use items available later include rockets and bombs but everything has it uses. In these cases scaring away packs of fish or making your cast go much further with cheaper rods. Boat travel is also included, but I have not progressed that far yet.\n\nContent wise, If you check the store page the developer mentions and I quote.\n\"Regular updates will bring new fish, boats, hats, and entirely new mechanics to the game, extending your experience and offering new ways to master the game. \"\n\nAddictive and enjoyable for all ages.

I would recommond you give it a try if it's around 2.5~3 bucks. \n\nYou can NOT change the settings such as music on/off, screen resolution and all that stuff. Actually there's not even a menu for that.\n\nI should give some credits to the person made the top right corner flyer pic. However keep in mind that it has nothing to do with the graphics of the game.\n\n**edit 12:08pm 1/20/2015: fixed typo.**", "timestamp_created": 1421717737, "timestamp_updated": 1421777337, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.428054", "comment_count": "22", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14075594": {"recommendationid": "14075594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041818023", "num_games_owned": 1861, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 699, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425678058}, "language": "english", "review": "I think many phone games should just stay on their tiny little screens, but there are some I've enjoyed on PC.

It's fun, in a casual, play a bit here and there way, which seems to be the phone game mantra.\n     Cat Goes Fishing does take a bit of strategy, as you have to use smaller fish to catch larger ones, while trying to get the bait to the fish you want to catch.

I'm of the opinion that 'if I can't interact with the story, I might as well read a book or watch an anime'. And for the most part, this game hasn't changed that. I feel as though this would make an absolutely incredible anime series or movie, but instead it chose to take in the visual novel form. That doesn't mean this game is bad. In fact, far from it. It tells a compelling story of a soldier hired to guard a facility, but in the process he finds himself and what he's always longed for.\n\nMy breakdown:\n\nPROS:\n+Music. Quite possibly one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a VN. Some scenes are absolutely flawless, and the soundtrack really enhances the power it has. By far the best element of this VN. The reason it is not a 10 is because some of the songs I didn't feel fit as well as they could have.\n+Art. Some of the best 2D CG's I've ever seen. Compelling, powerful and expertly done. The entire game is run on different variations of these CG's, so instead of having the normal renpy look, it has a completely unique feel.\n+Characters. Every character is designed incredibly well. Lavie/MC's dynamic was quite possibly the best written companionship I've seen in ages. With that being said though, a few of the decisions and dialogue choices some characters make (Especially Inaba) feel out of place, and out of line.\n+Voice actors. I don't speak Japanese, but even I could tell that the voices did fantastic performances for the most part. The MC's one in particular, was outstanding.\n+Story. Act 1 and 2 were phenomenal. Great conflict, expertly crafted scenes, and intriguing characters made these two segments just insane.\n\nCONS:\n-Old engine. The game feels old. On a technical level, it's just no longer up to par. When right click opens a default Windows dropbox, it takes a lot out of the experience.\n- Spoiled sections. The games subheading 'they were the only two, on the planet' kills a lot of the power Acts 3/4 should have. And I feel that it's unjustified like that. Same with the prologue, which honestly would have made the game so much nicer if it didn't exist. Act 1 is so great because we don't know what will happen, and the prologue spoils a lot of it.\n- Kinetic novel. A problem for me, for the reasonings stated in the opening paragraph of this review.\n- Slow. Act's 3/4 were sreally drawn out, and honestly could have been done in way less time. I felt that the last 4 hours of the game could have been done just as well in around an hour.\n\n-Scores-\nStory: 8\nCharacters: 7\nArt: 8\nMusic: 9\nEnjoyment: 7\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\ntl;dr a beautiful

It took me just over 13 hours total to finish, and was one of those well written VNs that leaves you never wanting it to end. The artwork and music are wonderful, but it's the story/writing that really sets this VN apart. I usually prefer non-kinetic VNs, but this one reads so beautifully, I was happy to forgo any decision making. The story itself revolves around a core of characters who are facing the impending end of the world.  I'll pass on giving a run down of the plot itself to avoid any potential spoilers. It delves into subjects such as redemption, love and loss, and the importance of cherishing what time one has left in life. If you're looking for a tear inducing read, this is for you. The VN is fully voice acted (in Japanese), and done really well, as is the translation through English subtitles. There are Steam trading cards for those who look for that, but no achievements.

Nothing excels between \"competently made\" and \"good\", but overall, the technical quality is there, absolutely.\nWhat isnt there, however, is a compelling story.\n\nI wont spoil anything, because there is nothing to spoil: this novel is exactly what it says on the tin. Tragic story, precious girl with (insert power \\ ability here) and main protagonist (insert tormented past here) falling in love at the end of the world. That's it.\nThe story progression has no detours. The very beginning is promising, but there is nothing else to look forward to afterwards. It's all the same, same conversations, telegraphed encounter(s), trope-ridden small talk with little to no originality. It's your copy-and-paste novel with no redeeming qualities.\nIt should have been no more than 2 hours long, at best, maybe even Planetarian-sized. Then it would have been worth a read, although stereotyped, it might have been a small piece of literature to pass the time when on a flight or when on a train ride. Too bad it's more than 10 hours long, depending on the average reading speed of course, but it is still pretty long, definitely too much for how little it has going for it.\nSo at its current price tag, I cannot recommend this novel.

I had a good time playing through it.\nIf you're expecting a fast-paced story, you should look somewhere else (probably something other than VNs generally). \nThe story was not fast, like previously stated, but still not too slow. It's a game you can enjoy playing, it's not something you have to divert all your attention to. However, this does not mean that it does not have something special and intersting. It's a very typical romantic story, but with it own twists. \nI felt the game as a whole was very well excecuted. It's not a game that I would be able to finish in ''one sitting'', but it's still the type of VNs that I would come back to and complete.\nThe only drawback may be the pricetag, it can be a bit expensive.\nI recommend this game to any VN-fan who has some interest in love-themed stories.

Always beholden to duty.  Lavie is a psychopath.  I saw two scenes of her pulling a weapon on Ryou that were completely pointless.  I get it.  She's nuts.  Sion is an eccentric genius.  Doc Brown had far more personality.  Many scenes are long-winded and tedious.  Some scenes come across as completely pointless.  I stopped caring when Lavie pulled the gun on Ryou.

The overwhelming sensation, when it finally registers, is not entirely unpleasant. It is like being dragged slowly across a pane of glass. It is like licking almond scented sawgrass. Ecliptic after images, the light cuts spread eagles crossing slowly, vulturish, circling. \n\nThe searing photonic stress had knocked me out. I awoke with little memory of the preceding hours, but the pink paisley bark on the trees around me unnerved me to no end. The grass underfoot crinkled oddly and when I knelt down to snap off a blade I realized it was plastic astroturf stuff. It tasted like lime and it stung like a mother. Florid fauna dappled with spots of what couldn't have been real sunlight filtered through tea leaves and steeped for an hour of northern-bound motion, I couldn't find no one but came to a road and turned towards my right unto what would be the sun if it wasn't so pink and cost less to come see.

italiano.\n\nTempo fa, nel periodo di saldi estivi, novizio come ero (e come in parte sono tuttora) nel vasto mondo delle Visual Novel, decisi di acquistare Eden* ... in quel periodo avevo altro da fare, e tra le mani avevo altre VN, quindi per un bel po' rimase fermo l\u00ec nella libreria di Steam, mai aperto, nemmeno la pagina iniziale, tenendolo quasi come un soprammobile polveroso adagiato e dimenticato in soffitta ...\nPoi finalmente, mesi pi\u00f9 tardi, decisi di iniziare: che dire, in parte mi pento di non aver iniziato a seguirlo fin dal suo acquisto; rimasi sorpreso, praticamente la gran parte delle VN che ho visionato non avevano una dinamica basata su degli sfondi cos\u00ec ben curati, ed \u00e8 anche una delle poche in cui la visuale non sempre corrisponde al protagonista, ma talvolta si diventa un'osservatore estraneo (potendo quindi vedere la faccia e la fisionomia del personaggio principale). Quindi quanto alla grafica, nulla da ridire, anzi, complimenti a chi se ne occupato, davvero un ottimo lavoro, sfondi meravigliosi, luci ben gestite e personaggi ben curati.\nLa trama, sotto certi aspetti, pu\u00f2 apparire semplice (addirittura banale per chi \"consuma\" abnormi quantit\u00e0 di anime/manga/VN/etc.), ma tutto sommato, l'ho apprezzata molto, in special modo per i rapporti che il protagonista ha con altri personaggi, e non mancano certo i colpi di scena; devo ammettere che il finale mi ha lasciato sorpreso, ha lasciato emozioni contrastanti, ma c'\u00e8 da chiedersi ... va bene che finisca cos\u00ec? ... certo ... non pretendete il classico \"e vissero tutti felici e contenti\" perch\u00e8 qu\u00ec non lo troverete, a maggior ragione se si scorgono i tristi presagi di una \"Bad End\", e non essendo questo un Dating Sim, c'\u00e8 poco da fare ... ma proprio il modo in cui \u00e8 finito rende giustizia a quelle ore passate a seguire i dialoghi e le interazioni tra i personaggi, che in qualche modo dovrebbero annunciarvi la piega che prender\u00e0 la storia.\nL'OST, dire che l'ho apprezzata sarebbe un eufemismo; sar\u00e0 che, come tutte le VN, talvolta riprendono la medesima musica per ripeterla a \"disco rotto\", ma non mi \u00e8 dispiaciuto; sopratutto la perla musicale che accompagna l'ending movie, qualcosa che ti dice \"si, beh, forse non \u00e8 andata come speravi, ma la vita continua, ci rialziamo, prendiamo a schiaffi il destino avverso e si guarda al futuro\".\nUnica cosa, per fortuna non mi sono scaricato la patch \"+Mosaic\" (ho visto solo qualche anteprima su un sito di terze parti), che praticamente aggiunge il lato ecchi/hentai che qu\u00ec non \u00e8 presente, in quanto penso distorca eccessivamente l'atmosfera e la visione che si ha dei personaggi, risultando spesso surreale e fuori luogo: mi sento di dover raccomandare fortemente all'astenervi da aggiungere tale patch al gioco.\n\nConclusione (parere soggettivo):\nEden* \u00e8 una visual novel stupenda, che merita il tempo che ad essa ho dedicato, consigliatissima a novizi e non, perch\u00e8 nel complesso, parlando di trama, personaggi, musica, grafica, etc. \u00e8 un prodotto di qualit\u00e0 e degna di attenzione.", "timestamp_created": 1486234989, "timestamp_updated": 1486234989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

it was just that good. This Novel will send you through a multitude of emotions. Personally i am the type of person that does not show emotion twords games and novels alike, However eden* took me to the point of tears by the time i hit the end.\n\n\nBut aside from my opinion there are pro's and cons. \n\nPros:\nDepending on if you listen to all the voice acting or not it will give you 8-15 hours of time i would say.\nIf your human has the abilty to bring out emotions you thought nothing could.\nThe music mostly fits with the mood, and atmosphere.\nThe auto mode worked perfectly and its speed unlike some others was fantastic.\nThere are probably more but im stuiped and cant think of them :p\nIf you like to just sit back and watch then your all good cause it has no choices.\nIs entirely voice acted.\nHas almost 0 if no fan service at all.\n\nCons:\n(Depends if you hate people seeing you in tears like me) Brings you tears in more than 1 part.\nThe auto mode dosnt work if you have 2 screens and click on the opisite one of the game.\nHas no interaction and runs on its own (Aka a kinetic novel)\nIf your human has the abilty to bring out emotions you thought nothing could.\nThere are probably plenty more but not any more i can remember or reconize, also not once did i hit any kinda of bug or similar problem.\n\nThis is my first review, so excuse me if it sucked :P but i hope it does affect your choice into buying this 8/10 kinetic novel.",

(For those unfamiliar with kinetic novels, it is like a visual novel but the player isn't given any choices to determine the direction of the story so it is like reading a book or watching a movie.) As I don't wish to spoil too much of the story (since this is a KN and all), I'll only give a very brief synopsis. Basically, Earth is about to meet a fatal catastrophe but as this has been forewarned, felixes are created to find a way to save the human race by building ships that will eventually take them to a new world. As Sion is the most gifted of these felixes, she is the one who comes up with the idea of the ships' engines and Ryou is assigned to guard her. \n\nSince I'll refrain from spoiling more of the story, I'll just get right to it and give my opinion. Despite that it's a KN, it's pretty lengthy so I didn't find it boring in the least. (Check my playtime to get an idea of how long it took me to finish it.) There are two arcs or acts in eden. I found the first one to be interesting of how Ryou came to work as a soldier in the research facility where Sion is. Once the second act came, I did find it slower but more emotional (although the first act was pretty emotional in some parts as well, especially towards the latter part). \n\nThe art was beautiful and I do love the anime style used. However, I'll give a bit of a criticism. Even though I know this is normal in anime art, I find it a bit unusual when the guys tend to look like their age while the females look younger than their age. Of course, with the nature of felixes, this can be explained away but even among the normal female humans, they do look younger than their age so yeah. I loved the music and there were a lot of pieces so I have no complaints there. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed eden* and found it to be a very beautiful story. I did find the ending to be sad although it can also be looked at as full of hope. I did get a little tearful towards the end although I found myself crying more when I played To the Moon. Still, eden* narrates a lovely, romantic story and if you like a good story, then I recommend it. ^^", "timestamp_created": 1484982011, "timestamp_updated": 1484982011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29375835": {"recommendationid": "29375835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139383119", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454997176}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u770b\u4e86\u8bc4\u8bba\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u611f\u4eba\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u901a\u5173\u4e86\u4ee5\u540e\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\u5168\u7a0b\u6beb\u65e0\u6ce2\u6f9c", "timestamp_created": 1484920556, "timestamp_updated": 1484920556, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.215848", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29366271": {"recommendationid": "29366271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010395496", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484812257}, "language": "english", "review": "Length: Short (2- 10 hrs)\nAvg read: 5 - 6.5 hrs\nType: Kinetic Novel\n\nDescription: In the near future, an ominous red star suddenly appears in the sky. Its presence is about to bring about the extinction of all life on Earth. The unified government proposes an evacuation project to take all of mankind into space, but in order to make the seemingly impossible project a reality, 'felixes' are brought into the world. Engineered to be highly intelligent with perpetual youth and longevity, the genetically modified superhuman felixes stand as humanity's only hope for survival.\n\nSion, the most gifted of the felixes, has been kept in a research facility built on a solitary island for the past hundred years. Her sole purpose, saving all of humanity. Ryou Haruna, a soldier from the Earth's unified government is sent to watch over Sion, who desperately seeks freedom from the military that's imprisoning her. Earth's last love story is about to begin. \n\nOverall: I really don't think Haruna \"earned\" Sion's love but its a bitter sweet love story.

hour long story.\nAs it has a rather slow and long start, it starts off to get really intense and emotional mid/end part.\nThis is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read - and one of the most tragic one's.\nBe prepared to get your heart filled with emotions - joy, passion, anxiety, sorrow - it is all packed in this masterpiece.\nThe soundtrack combined with the carefully animated graphics with full voice over will bring you to tears - in a good way.\n\nRight now I am still listening to the very very good sountrack and thinking about the story and the tragic fate of a young

The game felt nice in the beginning, I said nice because it doesn't hold a candle compared to the other VNs I read, but neither belongs in the trash, my positive opinion carried on until a certain moment in the game, perhaps near the end, either way, I can guarantee it's definitely after the first half of the story, but back to the main point, the game turned into a real chore, I couldn't stand the boredom anymore, these accurate and vivid \"descriptions\" lasted far too long and there was no story progression overall, in addition, what makes it even wrong is the inaccurate timing of the backstories, which are told too late in the game, making it seem even more dull and boring rather than the opposite.\n\nIn other words, *eden completely and utterly failed to captivate my attention, making me fall asleep more than twice during reading.\nWhen I asked for something lighthearted to read, I was hoping to find something that would hook me at least for two weeks or more, but unfortunately the game doesn't appear to be my cup of tea.

Vous incarnez Ryou Haruna un soldat affect\u00e9 dans un centre de recherche \u00e0 la protection de la brillante Sion, \u00e0 l\u2019origine du projet d\u2019\u00e9vacuation. \nGraphiquement sur steam on trouve peu d\u2019histoire visuelle de cette qualit\u00e9, Eden vous donne une vraie claque, il est sublime des personnages jusqu\u2019aux paysages et d\u00e9cors. \nL\u2019histoire malgr\u00e9 quelques petites longueurs est tr\u00e8s belle et riche en \u00e9motion. On s\u2019attache \u00e0 chaque personnage et mon plus grand regret est de ne pas avoir le choix surtout que par moment l\u2019histoire nous taille de vraies portes de sorties vers d\u2019hypoth\u00e9tiques fins alternatives qu\u2019on peut imaginer mais malheureusement pas vivre. Certains personnages auraient m\u00e9rit\u00e9 qu\u2019on passe plus de temps avec mais le choix des auteurs reste n\u00e9anmoins le plus \u00e9vident. \nLa musique est superbe est pas mis en boucle abusivement, on ne s\u2019en lasse pas et elle colle parfaitement \u00e0 l\u2019ambiance.\nPour ma part j\u2019ai mis un peu plus de 20h \u00e0 aller jusqu\u2019au bout mais je ne suis pas sp\u00e9cialement \u00e0 l\u2019aise avec l\u2019anglais, j\u2019imagine que pour un bon lecteur \u00e7\u00e0 se fait en 10-15h. Le prix peut para\u00eetre du coup un peu abusif mais vu la qualit\u00e9 je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re mettre 20euros pour encourager ce studio plut\u00f4t qu\u2019acheter 4 histoires fades et sans int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 5euros. Cependant on le trouve assez facilement en solde alors autant en profiter. \n\n[h1]En conclusion :[/h1] \nA part l\u2019absence de choix qui aurait pu permettre de d\u00e9velopper d\u2019avantage certains personnages auquel on a juste le temps de s\u2019attacher ainsi que de proposer des fins alternatives je ne trouve aucun d\u00e9faut \u00e0 Eden. Un vrai petit bijou visuel agr\u00e9ment\u00e9 d\u2019une histoire int\u00e9ressante et riche en \u00e9motion que je recommande \u00e0 tous les amateurs d\u2019histoire visuelle.\n\n[b]Bilan : 9.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]English summary :[/h1] \nAside a lack of choice wich might have allowed to explore more deeply some characters and to offer others endings, Eden is absolutely flawless.

I have more or less gotten through halfway of the story, and man, it is so wonderful. \nThe art holds some sort of angelic resemblance to paintings, and the lighting helps it gain more... aesthetic beauty. The story trope can be considered a classic, but it does not give the cliche feel.

From beginning to end the artwork was beautiful, the music carresed the ears, and the dialouge never seemed forced. I have not played many VNs, but this is number 2 on my list of favorite VNs. I found it unique that there was lip syncing, no matter how small the character was in the shot, and the eyes always blinking, making the image feel like more than just a static image.

Le suivi de ces derniers au cours du sc\u00e9nario est tr\u00e8s bon, aucun d'entre eux n'est compl\u00e8tement oubli\u00e9 au fil des \u00e9v\u00e8nements.\n\nLe sc\u00e9nario quant \u00e0 lui est int\u00e9ressant, bien \u00e9crit et bien ficel\u00e9, bien que loin d'\u00eatre r\u00e9volutionnaire, mais avec un probl\u00e8me de rythme. \nLa premi\u00e8re partie du VN propose une intrigue tr\u00e8s correcte et bien rod\u00e9e, mais la deuxi\u00e8me partie abandonne toute intrigue pour laisser place \u00e0 du [i] slice of life [/i] que j'ai trouv\u00e9 un peu longuet alors que je suis g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement client du genre.\n\nMalgr\u00e9 cel\u00e0, eden* brille par sa qualit\u00e9 graphique. En effet il y a un nombre hallucinant de CGs par rapport \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e du titre, ces derni\u00e8res comportant pour la plupart un grand nombre expressions faciales et \u00e9tant visuellement r\u00e9ussies. Les sprites des diff\u00e9rents personnage sont globalement tr\u00e8s beaux et vari\u00e9s. A cel\u00e0 s'ajoute de nombreux effets visuels renfor\u00e7ant le tout : lueur autour des personnages, gestion du flou... ainsi que la mise en sc\u00e8ne g\u00e9r\u00e9e parfois de mani\u00e8re cin\u00e9matographique, ce qui est plut\u00f4t rare dans un VN (ou tout du moins ceux que j'ai l\u00f9 jusqu'ici).\n\nAu niveau de l'ambiance sonore et de la musique, c'est correct. Le sound design fait tr\u00e8s bien son travail tandis que les musiques sont pour la plupart oubliables, bien qu'elles remplissent tr\u00e8s bien leur r\u00f4le et donnent un ton particulier aux sc\u00e8nes.\n\nN\u00e9anmoins, eden* m'a marqu\u00e9 par son ambiance, qui se ressent comme un tout, \u00e0 travers la fusion de sa musique, de son [i] voice acting [/i], et surtout de sa direction artistique, qui d\u00e9gagent une impression onirique tout au long des deux parties du jeu.\n\n-\n\nEn conclusion, eden* est, malgr\u00e9 un rythme assez in\u00e9gal, un tr\u00e8s bon VN, poss\u00e9dant un univers int\u00e9ressant, un sc\u00e9nario correct, des personnage attachants, \u00e9tant sublim\u00e9s par une r\u00e9alisation et une technique vraiment excellente qui justifie pleinement, \u00e0 mon sens, de s'int\u00e9resser au titre. Attendez-vous \u00e0 verser quelques larmes si vous \u00eates du genre \u00e9motif, mais \u00e0 vous ennuyer pass\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 si vous ne supportez pas les [i] slice of life [/i].\n\n> Ce sera 8/10 pour moi.

The ending in particular seems to be able to move in many directions that all seem awesome, so interactivity would have been very much welcome.\n\nOverall, if you like visual novels, this one is very solid. \n\n\n\n***MINOR SPOILERS WILL APPEAR FROM THIS POINT***\n\nPersonal Opinions:\n\nI liked EDEN* a lot. I spent about a day playing through it, and I do not regret doing so. It's a great experience, but it's not without flaws. I'll praise the game first though. The writing is solid. It's suprisingly authentic, and you really believe a lot of the conversations the characters have. The music is f*cking amazing, and I could listen to the OST for hours. This also goes for the beautiful scenery and overall visual presentation of the game. The most important thing in the game is the love story between out two protagnonists and, honestly, it's really heartwarming. It never really delves into creepyness or goes to another extreme, the love story is right where it should be.\n\nNow let's talk about some of the negatives. The first 1-2 hours spent inside of the facility are boring. Plain and simple. Sure, we get the necessary information about the characters... but that's it. Nothing else. The story only gets amazing when the perspective shift solely to our two protagonists, but it just only happens after a mediocre at best opening. Also, the ending. Now I know, this ending made people cry, and the love story was indeed, pretty tragic. So why didn't I cry? Simple. I kept thinking about other possible endings that made more sense in my head, espicially after they threw in the detail that one of the characters \"had a wish to see the protagonist one last time\". Instead, the ending we get it the one where the protagonists stay together, removing any logic from that scene where it clearly shows that the side characters are concerned. If you want us to care about the side characters, don't base the ending SOLELY around just the protagonists. If you want us to care about the protagonists, don't throw in statements about the side-characters, focus on the main two! \n\nSo, after all that ranting about the ending, do I hate it? No. I just got really confused by the writing near the end, but I think I'm probably the only one to do so. I had the same reaction to the ending of Life is Strange, which people seemed to love, but I didn't. Most people will fall in love with the ending, if they don't tend to overanalyze things like I do. The ending is still heartwarming and indeed sad, and you'll probably shed a tear or too.\n\nNot to mention that the 3-4 hours between the beginning and ending are the best parts of the game. They are so perfectly written, deciding to focus on the main characters, rather that dragging in several other characters, like the beginning and ending did. This part is what I love most out of the whole game.\n\nIn conclusion: While the beginning fails to completely impress me, and the ending is quite confusing in terms of the direction it really feels comfortable going in, I still had a lot of fun with EDEN*. In the end, it is the writing that makes a visual novel, and the writing is fantastic. The \"visual\" part of visual novel, the scenery and the music, are also breathtaking on their own. I wrote alot about the ending of the game, and how I wish it had more choices, but in the end, it's still a good ending. I'm probably also the only one who think it isn't perfect, so don't mind my opinion too much on that point.\n\nEDEN* is a game I recommend to any visual novel-lovers, fans of love stories or simply bookworms.

It's like day 3 of majora's mask, except extended for like 8 hours.\n\nThe main theme would be \"(no)Regrets\" and \"Accepting the inevitable\", but taken to extreme levels.\nIf you have trouble coping with any of these, I wouldn't recommend going into this unprepared.\nRegardless of previous experience with sad novels, eden* had me crying internally halfway through even before the sad events happened because I wasn't expecting plot curveballs and indeed, they never came. The reader is given the burden of shouldering all of the characters' emotions, building up to an obvious tearjerking ending that unfortunately, couldn't be happier.\n\nIt does exactly what you expect, but does it brilliantly. The voice acting is extremely well executed and caught me off guard a couple of times with it's subtle but noticeable emotional nuances not written in text. Coupled with the characters themselves, it actually had me paying close attention to their voices to try and catch on their hidden meaning.\nThe CG's are beautiful and do a great job at drawing you in with the extra animations every now and then, complementing it's artistic value with a more lively style of representing the scenery.\n\nThis might be a recommended from me, but it can be a tough one to chew for some especially if you identify yourself in some of the presented situations.\n\nTo summarize: \neden* is a sad Love story about regret, atonement and -more than one kind of- acceptance. Boasts an immense artistic value from it's execution and leaves the reader with lingering feelings unique from what other nakige provide.\n\nA good experience for my friday night.

sort of tragic (it IS tragic) but it comes off as very predictable and the story itself constantly feeds and foreshadows its own tragic end.  Both of the lead characters are extremely practical emotionally, so when the characters in the story show such little emotion it can be hard to get drawn in.  The main character is so stoic he can only make progress emotionally by experiencing invasive plotlines that cause the reader to wonder if \u201cfantasy\u201d should be added as a tag.  I guess I was hoping for a struggle - seeing the heroines struggle to accept emotion instead of a switch just being turned.   \n     \nI was ready for \u201cthe end\u201d well before the story gave it to me and the time between when I was ready and the game finally did end didn\u2019t add anything for me personally.  This is the first VN I have completed and when I went to \"gallary\" at the end felt no draw whatever to recall any certain parts of the story.  Generally, I find it hard to ever uninstall a VN, just like it can be hard to sell a good book, but I don't see myself mssing this one :(.       \n\nPros?   it is an interesting setting and if you aren\u2019t extremely cynical you will probably personalize parts of the story and get some emotional ripples out of it.  The story is essentially \u201cbird-in-cage,\u201d \u201cstoic heroines,\u201d & \u201cSave yourself and leave me to my fate.\u201d  The animation was good and the project very good quality.

It is also worth mentioning that it is a Kinetic novel.\n\nIt has beautiful music with great characters. Amazing art and a wonderful story. This is a game that I can recomend buying at full price, and is definitely worth purchasing when on sale. \n\nThe game is fully voice acted (In japanese) and the characters don't feel static and stand in multiple poses with them blinking and having their mouthes move when speeking which really help them feel alive. Also there are plenty of CGs with great quality in all of them. The developer clearly put lots of time and effort into making the game with beautiful character design and art quality. \n\nThe game is about a world coming to its end and of Earth's final love story. The pros of the story being its length and the great ways that the developer presented the story. I would also recomend having some tissues when playing the game.\n\nOverall it is a beautiful game with a great story and made me shed a tear, I wish there was more of this amazing story to read -

This was maybe the worst story I've ever experienced, in any medium. \n\nIt should be, but isn't, broken up into two distinct episodes. The first half is a fairly decent, if cliche-riddled, suspense plot, and the second half feels like a too-long epilogue that eventually festers into 3-4 hours of syrupy, sentimental loli fetish scenes. In both halves, the story goes out of its way to deflate elements of narrative tension that it bothers to introduce, with antagonists literally just stepping out of the protagonists' way. \n\nThe writing itself is verbose to the point of smothering the emotional impact that a scene might have. Characters will repeat a simple statement three or four times in the same scene, contributing to the problem of scenes that go on for 2-3x longer than they need to. There are many scenes that are repetitive or pointless (and still go on for 2-3x too long). Props, symbols, and images are repeated constantly, leaving them shopworn. Added for good measure is some cheap moralizing about taking care of the planet, the \"appetites of those in power,\" and a few other super-deep subjects. Ryou even says \"Sometimes, even pointless conversations can teach you a thing or two,\" without apparent irony.\n\nSpeaking of characters, they're more stock than Getty Images. For brevity, I'll talk mainly about the Gary Stu protagonist: He kills without a flicker of emotion, flies a helicopter, cooks breakfast (which he does over and over), and generally does anything the plot needs him to do with no previous setup. He can also completely abandon his professed love for violence and following orders, opting to dedicate his whole life to taking care of his loli. If this sounds like it could maybe be a character arc -- trust me, it isn't. His change is quick, complete, and virtually conflict-free. His old life doesn't come back to haunt him or lure him back to his past ways. I think there's one line, as he's serving his bedridden daughter figure dinner or something, where he mentions not liking how domestic he's become, but he doesn't actually experience any tension or conflict because of it -- he keeps it up, getting even more pathetic as he goes along. He also treats the female lead like an idiot, points his gun at everybody, and does some highly rapey stuff to a throwaway character who's introduced toward the back end of the story. Great guy.\n\nSo, what actually works in this game? The sounds effects, music, and voice acting are all fine to my ear. The art is nice, and really deserves a better story. I wouldn't mind this style becoming the norm for VNs. There's a warm glow to the scenery and lighting, and camera focus is used really well. The character designs are okay to good, and the blinking and moving mouths add to the immersion in a big way. But for whatever reason, characters tend to \"dance\" through three or four poses in a single conversation -- it can get a little distracting, like watching the exaggerated gestures and expressions of an actor in a silent film. Still, it's doesn't detract from the visuals too much, and some of the poses are cute.\n\nThere are many, many problems with this game -- more than I've mentioned here.

The art is really good. The music is appropriate albeit a little repetitive. The story had some promise at first (it seemed), and had some novel ideas, but ended up just being clich\u00e9. As others have mentioned, the ending had the makings of being sad, but for me really wasn\u2019t. Why? By the time they got around to ending it, I didn\u2019t really care about any of the characters.\n\nWriting was ok, but I can\u2019t think of a scene except for the very last one that wasn\u2019t unnecessarily drawn out way too long. I know they were trying to provide backstory and detail in an attempt to make the characters deeper, but for me there were far too many instances thinking \u201cI wish they would just get on with it an advance the plot already\u2026\u201d Sometimes that wish would take as much as 30-45 minutes of drawn out dialog.\n\nThe characters themselves weren\u2019t great. Sion was the character I liked the most, and her story was fairly sad. The male main character I didn\u2019t care at all for. He was intentionally cold, emotionless, and flat. They tried to remedy that near the end of the story, but by then I just simply didn\u2019t care. It was too little too late. A half an hour of opening him up at the end didn\u2019t make up for 9.5 hours of listening to the same \u201cpoor me\u201d lines from him again and again.\n\nI was waiting for some action, or a big plot twist, or something. Nothing like that ever came. The story was extremely predictable from beginning to end. I'm glad that I was eventully able to reach the end, just because this is the first visual novel that I've ever experienced. It's an interesting idea, and I'm sure there are good ones out there, but I didn't think this one was particularly great. The whole story could have easily been condensed down to 2 hours and probably would have been more enjoyable, given the fact that at 10+ hours in, at the end, you wouldn't be feeling like the whole experience was such a chore.\n\nAt the end, for me the positives outweigh the negatives. I've read the positive reviews and I can see why some people liked it, but reading the negative reviews after having gone through this, I don't disagree with any of the points that they make either. 3/10.", "timestamp_created": 1466881457, "timestamp_updated": 1466881457, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496569", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23793274": {"recommendationid": "23793274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276317251", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507051610}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u97f3\u4e50\u4e5f\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u542c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1466865422, "timestamp_updated": 1466865422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23776171": {"recommendationid": "23776171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223708320", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472279815}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6253\u6298\u5566\uff0c\u8d2d\u4e70\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u53ea\u652f\u6301\u82f1\u6587...\u597d\u5427", "timestamp_created": 1466819954, "timestamp_updated": 1466819954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.993345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23756988": {"recommendationid": "23756988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169827414", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467187785}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8d81\u7740\u6691\u5047\u7279\u4ef7  \u5165\u6b63 \u7136\u540e \u5de6\u62d0\u73a9D\u7248....  \u6ca1\u627e\u5230\u6c49\u5316...\u82f1\u8bed\u82e6\u624b \u4e00\u8138\u840c\u903c", "timestamp_created": 1466776976, "timestamp_updated": 1466776976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702290", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23747167": {"recommendationid": "23747167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116641130", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 331, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1514843550}, "language": "english", "review": "It's pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1466752268, "timestamp_updated": 1466752268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23744005": {"recommendationid": "23744005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161862077", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 131, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454814698}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7eaa\u5ff5minori\u901d\u53bb\u7684\u8282\u64cd\u2014\u2014\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8d2d\u5165", "timestamp_created": 1466742479, "timestamp_updated": 1466742479, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23723672": {"recommendationid": "23723672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185151477", "num_games_owned": 517, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 645, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466876498}, "language": "english", "review": "Touching.

"review": "The premise is pretty solid for this one and I think the execution does it justice, though the game does lose a bit of momentum in its second half, and the last act of the game is kind of a slog similar to sitting through a funeral. But overall, I enjoyed it. The art is good, the music is good, the story's not too long, the characters, while maybe a bit mary sue-ish, feel real enough to keep me engaged in their interactions, and the ambiguous nature of the main plot is probably for the best; doesn't really need to be an exact answer for everything. The romantic aspects are generally sidelined and only come into play near the end (maybe why the ending felt like a slog for me) but there's enough of a buildup and character development that it's not really bothersome. Do note that this is a VN with no choices whatsoever, literally just a visual novel that you read/look at/listen to etc. But it works fine for the story. So yeah. Mildly pleasant overall, doesn't really feel like it drags on much, and there's plenty of heart to it.\n\nThe heck is up with the intro though, doesn't really fit in with the tone of the game at all.", "timestamp_created": 1464924456, "timestamp_updated": 1464924486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23321970": {"recommendationid": "23321970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085647596", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465296264}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful visual novel with an amazing and emotional story.

Innocent. Sad. Funny.\n\nAn excellent visual novel with an intrigung story and great characters.\n\nRyou, a soldier having worked for the military as part of an elite unit, is sent to protect Sion, the person responsible for saving humanity from Earth's imminent destruction.\n\nThere are no choices to be made in this game, so you can just turn on auto play and watch it like a regular anime if that is what you prefer.\n\nThe art and music is superb, and the voice actors and actresses are top-notch having worked on popular shows such as Naruto, Clannad, Gintama and many others.\n\nI only experienced two minor cons. It felt like a few scenes dragged on for a split second too long, and some of the sound effects (such as when someone's stomach rumbles) sounded a bit strange.\n\nOther than that everything was great, and I definitely recommend eden*.\n\nTip: If you want to play the game in \"full screen\" I recommend using the program Borderless Gaming.

[/b]\n\nI think the first thing I want to mention about Eden* is that this is a once in a life time experience.\nI have spent a lot of my time reading stories/books or whatever came under my eyes, but Eden* stood out from everything I have ever experienced.\n\nI have to say that I'm still new to the Visual Novel genre and after I played two Sakura Games, I kinda thought that all the Visual Novels point out in a more \"feminine sexy direction\".\nEven though that can be entertaining to a certain point, I was really glad to find out that this is not what all Visual Novels are about.\n\nSince Eden* could be called a sci-fi genre I was kinda sceptical at first, since I enjoy the medival age over any futuristic genre, but I'm really glad I gave it a go, because I would have missed a masterpiece of art, graphics, voice acting, story, music and an emotional expirience. \nI'm still lacking words to actually point out how good it is, since it's way to spectacular to really put everything in a review or even on a thought itself.\nI do wanna point out the music for itself as well. I still cannot really tell if the music is incredible sad or unbelievable beautiful. But it comforts the story and the dialogue so well that it's always on point. \nEven if you take out the music itself I could listen to Eden's* tunes everyday without playing the game just because it's so amazing, heart touching and it feels like opening up a gate into your very own imagination.\n\nEven though I finished the story it feels like it never ended. I have played the second half of this game in one go because there was no way for me to stop in the middle of this beautiful story but afterwards I was kinda sad.\nSad that I've read it in one go. Sad that it actually ended. But on the other hand this is a story so perfect that even if the story is over, even if the world would end, it still continues.\nAnd still I have the feeling that I want to experience this even further, even after the game has ended.\n\nThis story would not change if you read it a second time, but it wouldnt lose its power either. It is rare for me, that a story brings me down to tears, but that term would be way to less to describe the state this game left me in. I have never cried over a story for more than 3 hours STRAIGHT. Just because it was so beautiful and heart breaking in the same time.

No real choices to make during the game, so won't get that kind of gameplay out of it.\n\nBut I can say it was very much worth getting. For a summary that talks about the planet's final love story, it certainly delivers on that front. You know how it is going to end, but it takes nothing away from the power of the story. It's one of those times when you know how things will turn out and it's all the more impactful because of it. Finding out how things ended up like this and the journey the main characters went through.\n\nIn terms of story and characters Eden* just delievers. I also appreciated the strong art and visuals. It is just japanese voices and english subtitles, but the voice acting is top notch. A nice touch as well that you do get to see lips moving as the characters talk so it really does feel like you are watching this story from up close. I don't think the story would have been as good if the MC wasn't as complete a character as the rest of the cast and you had dialogue options popping up. Everything just worked for the sake of the story.\n\nTook me about 12 hours to get through it. Might take others a bit less time, but if you are letting all the characters speak their voiced lines then it will take a good while. Definitely worth what I paid for such a strong story. And got to me enough that I wanted to write up something about it.\n\nIt is a story that will leave a bittersweet feeling behind, but if that doesn't bother people then I wholly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1457478150, "timestamp_updated": 1457478150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21713908": {"recommendationid": "21713908", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275097140", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507394587}, "language": "english", "review": "It seems too long to send in this evaluation zone,I edited for almost 4hrs and found that I can't send this:)\n\nClick the link below to read the full contents about my opinion of this game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/315810/discussions/0/412448792372282792/\n\n[spoiler](Well, forgive my poor English anyway)[/spoiler]\n\n[h1]In the beginning[/h1]\nI bought it in the IndieGala Charity pack,and I also purchased one as a present to my friend [spoiler]for the belief of Eden*,Sion and Minori[/spoiler],as now I'm reliving the game, I will say some of my feelings.\nEden* is my favorite one in the VNs I have played/experienced, although I didn't go over as many as some VN fans. And Sion is the person I love best, in my own heart. My portrait is Sion's back shadow.\n\n[h1]About Eden*[/h1]\nTalking about Eden* in Minori's history, it is another pinnacle production after having a great success in [i]ef - a fairy tale of the two[/i], at that time they have really much money to produce a same-level production.\nWhatever the resolution of the game, artwork of background&character,movable emotion CGs,almost every element in the game, has reached a height that few opponent can compete with.\n\n[h1]My understandings in detail[/h1]\nThe artwork of the game is mainly presented by \u3061\u3053\u305f\u3080&KIM\u3061\u30fc, not \u306a\u306a\u304a \u306a\u308b in former productions of Minori, but the artwork is still exquisite.[spoiler]Almost every frame of this game can be screenshot and set as your desktop image,better performace with the magnify tools like Waifu2x in high resolution screens.[/spoiler]\n[spoiler]Try playing it in fullscreen, fantastic experience.[/spoiler]\nComparing with others, Eden* is not a long story, won't cost you too much time finishing all of the story.But all main character have their enough full characteristic in this story.\nThe illustration is also different from other VNs, with lots of static illustrations of the event, while many others use set painting plus background. Showing more storytelling attribute in the whole story.\n\nThe opening is not the production of Makoto Shinkai, but can say it from his disciple, with lots of style of Makoto Shinkai.\nYou may not find such a shocking PV among many VNs, when you see the glass shatter and the ruin collapse into pieces, background turn into grass at the moment Ryou and Sion hold their hand, and the surrondings suddenly change into wide angle view of  blue sea and sky with the running of Sion.\n\nThe script, or the story by IURO, has a big framework,but much simple and obvious [spoiler]or straight[/spoiler] story-line. But you can see it pays a lot of work in completing the characteristic in every main character in the game, like Ryou, Sion ,Elica and so on.\nSome might say the end of word is not an important part of the whole setting of the story,but I think that it is not the whole and most important part of the story, but the element of it. The crucial part should be the story between the characters in the story.\nOr, simply saying, a love story in a dying planet.[i]They were only two, on the planet[/i], of course the setting of the end of the word is the foil of the atmosphere and melody of this beautiful and ,well, tearjerker story.\nAlthough the story doesn't have many choices for you to decide, but it is coherent. In other words, it is not an adventure game,seems more like a long story that let you to read.\n\nThe OP and bgm is from Tenmon,or Shiragawa Atusi,which also produce the bgm of ef, although many bgm can be seemed as the modified tone of the theme song Little explorer, but when you play the game, you can find the whole story is more colorful and lively with these soundtracks. Though the character voice and the artwork of the game is better than many opponents,but the soundtrack is the assistance of letting the game more than touching your heart.\n\n[h1]My feeling of Eden*[/h1]\nIn the opening of the game I see Sion running on the grass with Ryou at her side, and standing on the small hill, with [i]To the new world[/i], it gives me a strong feeling of getting rid of constraint of the institution, walking freely on the new world with Ryou.\nI see the ending of the story,but I still feel so sad when it comes to the farewell in the setting sun.\nIn the epilogue of the story, looking at the happy and warm, sweet story finally comes to the end, making me awfully sad, even if I have known that the end is unavoidable, I can't stop the sad feeling spread out of the screen, into my heart.\nThough I have forgotten how to cry for many years, but looking at the end of the story,and [i]Desire[/i] like the final detainment, describing the reluctant of the world and love with Ryou from Sion,I feel so sad that I can't say any word.\n\n[h1]Conclution[/h1]\nThough Eden* was released in 2009, debarked steam in 2015,but it is still can be one of the best Japanese VNs ever.\nSo, if you haven't experience the charm of Japanese galgame ,and/or don't like too many choices in the game, Eden* would be your good choice.\nThank you for reading.\n\u304a\u4f11\u307f,\u30b7\u30aa\u30f3\n\n10/10 recommend\n\n\u2014\u2014update 2016.11.26\n\nI would like to nominate eden* for The Steam Award: I didn't cry, just a grain of sand in my eye.\n\nI'm going over this story once again, it still touches me, and it worth the prize.\n\nMaybe eden* is not as magical like The Stanley Parable, Civilization VI or many other games, but, well, there's not any other game or VN can replace the place in my mind, that's all.", "timestamp_created": 1457464153, "timestamp_updated": 1480168389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0,

I feel like I have been rick rolled, like this game was a gag and I'm waiting for the punchline. Don't get me wrong, I have a heart and can find romance in games wonderful if told right. To the Moon is a great modern example. \n\nThis game game just never captivated me for a second, and when I saw the credits role I laughed out loud, not believing that is the end.\n\nSo in this game world, there are only 2 men, the protagonist and one other guy just to show that this isn't about young girls and their love for cold, strong killers. Every single other character is an incredibly immature (in appearance and behavior) girl who all fall in love with the protagonist at some point (yep, every single girl) at some point. \n\nThe protagonist is a 2 dimensional killer, who says the most outrageous and plain weird things (your face is too big) but is turned into a \"human\" again by the 100 year old in a 12 year old body.... yeah, I'm open... Lolita was a great book/ movie, but it had a point. It felt like this whole premise of this game was just a males hot fantasy about innocent, naive, defenseless young girls (yeah yeah she's 100... keep telling yourself that.)\n\nThe content is painfully immature, I am a lover of literature, and I must admit this is my first true visual novel, and first dip into Manga and I am shocked at the banality and two-dimensionality story telling found here. It was as if it was written by a young 20 year old male, with no higher education, who has got stuck in his high school fantasies of hooking up with the 1st grade newbies. \n\nThat this visual novel comes so highly recommend by a variety of sources brings me to wonder and awe at the other \"Delights\"that are out there for me never to read.\n\n8 hours of my life that I will never get back. I can not in any way recommend this game, and advise anyone who is over his or her teenage years to step clear away from this (Harry Potter The Philosophers Stone by comparison would appear like one of Dostoevsky more complicated pieces). 1/10", "timestamp_created": 1455836308, "timestamp_updated": 1455836308, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.434595", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21300381": {"recommendationid": "21300381", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108479987", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458408256}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u6700\u540e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u7231\u60c5\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1455816730, "timestamp_updated": 1455816730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21282392": {"recommendationid": "21282392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017602480", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479994634}, "language": "english", "review": "+ Interesting story.\n+ not a Harem VN.\n+ Good art and soundtrack.\n+ Sion's cuteness.\n\n- It's kinetic novel (don't mind, but it'll be nice to have 'IF route').\n\nThat's all the reason I give this  9/10.\n\n\"Must play\"\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1455742037, "timestamp_updated": 1455742037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21279728": {"recommendationid": "21279728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254119441", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449571549}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5c31 \u7b97 \u6253 \u6298 \u4e5f \u8981 \u8cb7 \u6148 \u5584 \u5305 \u554a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1455734082, "timestamp_updated": 1455734082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21275044": {"recommendationid": "21275044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198176837318", "num_games_owned": 384, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455781044}, "language": "schinese", "review": "They were only two,on the planet.\n\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u7684eden\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u604b\u7231\n\u7ed3\u5c40\u662f\u611f\u4f24\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u90a3\u9897\u7ea2\u8272\u7684\u884c\u661f\u7684\u7167\u8000\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u662f\u90a3\u4e48\u7f8e\n\u6216\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u603b\u662f\u4ee5\u60b2\u5267\u800c\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u7559\u4e0b\u7684\u6c38\u8fdc\u53ea\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\n\u5c31\u50cfSion\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8d70\u5f97\u8dcc\u8dcc\u649e\u649e\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6bcf\u6b21\u53ea\u8981\u6276\u4e00\u4e0bRyou\uff0c\u5979\u53c8\u80fd\u7ee7\u7eed\u884c\u8d70\uff0c\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5979\u7684\u56fa\u6267\u5462\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5979\u4e00\u76f4\u770b\u7740\u524d\u65b9\n\u665a\u5b89Sion\uff0c\u653e\u5fc3\u7684\u7761\u5427\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u6700\u70ed\u7231\u7684\u5c71\u5761\u4e0a\nThe end of days has begun.\n\u2014\u2014\u8bd7\u97f3\u7684\u5fc3\u60f3\u8981\u53bb\u5411\u4f55\u65b9\uff1f\n\u5b83\u88ab\u9057\u5931\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u5730\u65b9\u4e86\u5462\uff1f\n\u5927\u6982\u8bd7\u97f3\u81ea\u5df1\u90fd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5427\u3002\n\u5c31\u7b97\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u98ce\u80fd\u591f\u8ba9\u5979\u98de\u8d77\u6765\u5427\u2026\u2026\n\u65e2\u7136\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u98ce\u5439\u8fc7\u6765\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u90a3\u6211\u5c31\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1455719976, "timestamp_updated": 1455781007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507591", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21273661": {"recommendationid": "21273661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018056824", "num_games_owned": 2376, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459250087}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok, I'm going to be honest here.

soundtracks available for sale which isnt that really that bad...but other than that its all really great about the story,the cg effects and stuff.I completed it around 8 hours and gotta say i enjoy everything it displays,to those that like very story enriched visual novels i recommended this game and if you dont mind the hefty price tag it displays or you could just wait for sale as i did but i think even with the hefty price i still think it somewhat worth it but it depends on you.The english it displays,its quite phenomenal and exceptionally good that gives you in-depth feelings into the game.I admit this game would almost almost make any reader shed tears at the near ending part especially moody people such as myself XD.Initially the game tells you mostly about post-war experience and duties of a soldier and stuff which can be boring to some but as I proceed into the story,it slowly changes from that i mention just now to more of a unexpected romance which puzzles me at first XD.Overall,I had to say,this game is pretty good for a visual novel and to those seeking ecchi stuff,Sorry to disppoint but theres none unless you have the patch :P.", "timestamp_created": 1455358524,

Some of them seemed completely out of place within the context of the story.\n\nOverall a good game.\n[spoiler]Even if I was waiting for a plot twist that never happened.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1455353849, "timestamp_updated": 1455353849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498241", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21155590": {"recommendationid": "21155590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011962156", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455294478}, "language": "english", "review": "(I know people that see this come to my profile just to down vote on all my reviews... seriously stop. You can't expect everyone to like this and recommend this game, if you have such a problem that I gave this game a down vote then move on. Don't come to my profile just to down vote all my other reviews because you are mad, it's weary childish and really fucking sad to do so, do your life have so little meaning that you have to give downvote revenge on people? Do your life just revolve around this and nothing more, that someone gave a your waifu visual novel a bad review and have to give revenge in some way?)\n\n\nI got this from a friend because he really thought I would enjoy this, but... ugh, no, I don't, I really don't like the visual novel anime thingy. Every sound they make sound so wrong (thank you Hentai) They all have the face of a 10 year old, just why, and they pretty much sound the same all of them... The animations are like 10fps and that's really annoying, they had like this one moving thing to do, and that was animate blinking eyes and this mouth that don't sync at all... good job, why even bother have animation in it. \n\nI'm trying to follow the story and look back to this entire typical Anime style, but the story is soooooooo booooooring! I try to get through this and hope it turn somehow to something interesting that will happen before the refound get's out or the 2h limit. But I have my doupt. The closest to some story telling game I ever enjoy is things like Firewatch or Dear Esther, or I just grab a Warhammer 40k book instead and be happy with that. \n\nSo in final, if you are like me, just don't bother with this, if your friend is trying to gift this, don't accept, don't let him waste his money to you with it. This thing is not the big turning point that will make you love anime novels. \n\nThat's all for me.", "timestamp_created": 1455295798, "timestamp_updated": 1481797116, "voted_up": false, "votes_up":

nunca encontraba el momento de hincarle el diente.\n\nTengo que decir que me ha sorprendido gratamente, superando en mucho mis expectativas.\n\nEl juego nos pone en la situaci\u00f3n de un mundo al borde de la extinci\u00f3n debido a una inminente cat\u00e1strofe natural de naturaleza desconocida.\n\nPor suerte, gracias a la felix Sion se ha podido llevar a cabo la construcci\u00f3n de unas enormes naves utilizadas para evacuar a toda la humanidad hacia el espacio.\n\nPara que nos entendamos los seres conocidos como felix son humanos creados artificialmente con unas grandes capacidades mentales y cuya vida es muy superior a la de un humano com\u00fan, aunque por desgracia no tienen la habilidad de poder reproducirse.\n\nEn esta historia nos ponemos en la piel de Haruna, un joven militar que es destinado a una base secreta donde se encuentra Sion y su asistenta personal.\n\nNo entrar\u00e9 m\u00e1s en el tema narrativo porque ser\u00eda hacer spoilers, as\u00ed que os lo dejo para vosotros, pero os recomiendo sin duda que le deis una oportunidad.\n\nA nivel gr\u00e1fico y art\u00edstico es muy bello. Me atrever\u00eda a decir que tiene cierto aire a anime. Todos los personajes y escenarios est\u00e1n recreados con mucho cari\u00f1o, de eso no hay duda.\n\nUno de los apartados que me han sorprendido much\u00edsimo es el sonoro. Normalmente no le doy demasiada importancia a este aspecto en una novela gr\u00e1fica, pero es que en este caso es brutal.\n\nCabe destacar que todas las conversaciones est\u00e1n dobladas en japon\u00e9s, lo cual a m\u00ed particularmente me encanta.\n\nLa duraci\u00f3n es realmente larga, yo cre\u00eda que durar\u00eda como un juego cualquiera de la saga Sakura (4 o 5 horas), pero que va, dura mucho m\u00e1s.\n\nUn puntazo a su favor es que a media novela hay una especie de video de opening incre\u00edble, que nada tiene que envidiar a ning\u00fan opening de cualquier serie de Anime actual.\n\nSi tuviera que ponerle una pega es que no viene traducido al espa\u00f1ol, pero este tema ya es muy habitual y repetitivo en las novelas gr\u00e1ficas de steam.\n\nHay que decir que la versi\u00f3n de Steam viene censurada, aunque si busc\u00e1is un poquito por ah\u00ed pod\u00e9is encontrar el parche que habilita la versi\u00f3n hentai (te da la opci\u00f3n de ver 4 escenas \u00edntegras, de unos 30 minutos cada una de puro hentai, una con cada chica de la novela gr\u00e1fica).\n\nEl juego tambi\u00e9n cuenta, como en la mayor\u00eda de novelas gr\u00e1ficas, con su galer\u00eda de im\u00e1genes donde encontraremos absolutamente todas las escenas del juego.\n\nCreo que no me dejo nada por comentar. Atrever\u00eda a decir que es de las mejores novelas gr\u00e1ficas que he le\u00eddo por el momento. Muy profunda, larga, que te da que pensar y con ese toque hentai extra y completamente opcional por si te gustan esas cosas.\n\nLe doy un 9/10.", "timestamp_created": 1454876831, "timestamp_updated": 1454876831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693565", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21021805": {"recommendationid": "21021805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045308994", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454842704}, "language": "english", "review": "Really the only thing i can say about Eden* is just\n\n\n\n\nThank you\n", "timestamp_created": 1454842944, "timestamp_updated": 1454842944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21012395": {"recommendationid": "21012395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152481160", "num_games_owned": 275, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448000001}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u522b\u95ee\u6211\u6211\u53ea\u662f\u4e70\u6765\u6c2a\u5361\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1454806996, "timestamp_updated": 1454806996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21002152": {"recommendationid": "21002152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019784368", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 839, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462084232}, "language": "english", "review": "Although the length is short, the slow-paced story makes it seems abit longer.

Japanese voice-over.\n\nI was hesitating to play it because the character art is uninspiring. There are chlich\u00e9s like oversized breasts, a cute army girl and a cute housemaiden. Part of me was afraid a cute magical cat-girl would appear next but thankfully I was spared this. Luckily the protagonist is not some silly perverted fool tripping into his own personal harem he has secretly dreamed for but a rather cold-hearted war veteran, and there are a couple other characters of that sort that you wouldn't necessarily expect in your more ordinary anime.\n\nDespite some initial bumps and doubts the game is rather profound and thoughtful and has a better world and story to tell than most other KNs/VNs I have played. Their unoriginal exterior and clich\u00e9-like introductions aside the characters were likeable and quite well written and had more depth than meets the eye. The game features a pretty interesting pre-apocalyptic sci-fi scenario that has you experience the final phases of mankind fleeing earth due to a bright red star that appeared in the sky and is said to destroy it. It's featuring some genuine sci-fi elements but isn't dwelling on the technical terms of it as much, it's more about the people and how they handle it all. This and the extensively designed background art (particularily skies and clouds) remind me fondly of the Makoto Shinkai animes that I had seen many years back.\n\nThe music deserves some mentioning too; there is plenty of it, it fits the situations nicely and is memorable. I intentionally stopped progressing at times just so I could listen to it more. It features contemplating, sad and upbeat tunes and I wasn't surprised to see that other players were wondering if it was available separately (it isn't in the West afaik, but there is a playlist in the main menu and I guess one can try YouTube or sorts).\n\nI don't think I would've touched it anytime soon if not for the \"overwhelmingly oositive\" Steam reviews. Thanks to them I put my initial doubts aside and it didn't took me long before I liked it, wanted to see how the story works out, had it touch parts of my heart in several ways and realized that this game is one of the better, higher-value kinetic novels to be found.

A galge publisher which I will forever remember by IP blocking all non-Japanese visitors and blame all of us gaijin as responsible for their own country tightening laws regarding erotic games.  How does a game from a publisher like that get an official English translation and got put on Steam is beyond my imagination.\n\nOf course, you all know this is Steam, thus there is absolutely no conventional erotic content in this visual novel.  Forgive me being too lazy to search the internet on whether the actual sex scene got cut for the English release, or was it nonexistent in the original version.  It is irrelevant, because a sex scene in eden*\u2019s story and the mood would be an intrusion, rather than enhancement, and I\u2019m glad that there is none for me to see.\n\nAlthough far from being a bad vn compare to rest of the genre on Steam, I don\u2019t feel eden* is worth of the $20 asking price.  Gorgeous background CGs coupled with dubious character sprites/portraits of inconsistent style; nicely tuned soundtrack but eclipsed by mediocre voice acting\u2026 I can\u2019t pin down what exactly went wrong in the production phase\u2026 but something definitely was amiss for such swing of quality in different departments.\n\nStory of eden* is largely a fairytale-ish romance.  (And by \u201cromance\u201d I don\u2019t just mean a love story, but rather a tale of emotion and human nature.)  Background setting: The world\u2019s scientists somehow are convinced that the world will end in about 100 years.  World war then broke out; half of human population died, and the rest formed a unified government and started to build spaceships.  The plan is successful; nearly everybody on Earth got evacuated in the end, and the story really begins on one couple who chose to remain on Earth to live together and eventually faces the inevitable.\n\nOf course, there would be a few more to the story than that which I would not spoil.  The plot does introduce a few more elements to aspire intrigue and perhaps the readers\u2019 tear\u2026 but when the time comes, the ending is largely predictable.  I know it\u2019s beside the point and focus, but the vn never tried to explain what exactly is the nature of this \u201cArmageddon\u201d event, and the story doesn\u2019t elaborate on it, deliberately I shall say, which is irritating even more.\n\nSo in the end, I feel the story couldn\u2019t leave a positive impact.  It is partly due to the premise of the story is built too much on a hypothetical and fantasy world setting that is far too removed from current reality.  Or maybe I\u2019m just not into love stories about people who know their life would soon end.  It is fine, though, like not all people enjoy horror game/movies and not all like the science fiction genre.\n\nIn conclusion, if you dig for a story like this, then you can safely ignore everything I wrote above.  Otherwise I would advise caution, because in the end the experience which this vn brings might very likely not worth the money\u2014and more importantly, the time\u2014you spend reading.",

"language": "english", "review": "    Eden, this is one of the best romance visual novels I've seen and enjoyed so far, it wasn't much of a fan service (which, was perfectly my taste, except for maya's part) but it mainly relies on it's story plot, normally visual novels would go with a steady story about love in different ways, not complete romance but with comedy and ecchi. Eden was different, in a lot of ways, it has emotions, it shows us how horrible humanity is, it shows us how would the world rot and it shows us how hope still exists in the darkest ways. \n    I've never gotten so addicted to reading a visual novel for 6 straight hours, slide by slide, munching on each and every word... Eden has reminded us of a lot of things, Ryou Haruna, the main character of Eden was a boy who had been given birth in a village on a certain mountain that gathered people that did not want to evacuate to space, eventually they began to fight back to the army since they were capturing them and evacuating to space, ofcourse a lot of them had gone \"missing\". After a certain while, one day a felix that had escaped from the No.703 Facility escaped to the mountain, her name was Natsume, who eventually became like a sister for Ryou, people started disappearing more and often, at the end even Ryou's' parents, the whole mountain was left with Nastume and Ryou, they had enjoyed the time, but it wasn't long. The No.703 facility staffs had traced her down and had forcibly taken her from Ryou, giving him ultimate despair and made him join the army, to see his sister again. A world where you can make an innocent child who just wants his sister that was going to die within a year, kill people, and by that I meant a lot of people, Ryou had stepped his way up the military and did everything he could, basically killing everything he can to reach Natsume, even his emotions, even his memories for Natsume, at the end all she did was left a shadow in Ryou's heart to keep fighting, but for no reason since she's already dead after a year she was captured back (felix's end of life span). In reality people keep hurting each and other every day, they take, they gain, but they lose as well, no one has ever thought of stopping, they hadn't, they couldn't, and that's how monsters were created, monsters to the society, but horribly sad.\n    Sion was another case, her very existence were a disgrace for humanity, the sadness she gave me was a kind that couldn't be expressed by tears, but rather, a smile that couldn't explain human emotions, it was sad, but also breaking my mind. Sion reminded us of the balance in the world, you take, someone gains, you enjoy, someone suffers, you live, someone dies, but the world isn't completely balanced as well, humans have broken it, they took away freedom to continue living, but they didn't give happiness, there were those who had happily evacuated to space, but there were also those who wanted to stay on earth no matter what comes next. I'll get straight to the point now, Sion was created for humanity's survival, she had led the evacuation project for 100 years, right when she finishes it, she wanted freedom, she wanted to try things on earth, try things for life, but the united government had taken that away, they wanted to keep her alive and show her off as hope, she had worked on for 100 years straight, no complaints, yet she couldn't enjoy freedom in her last few months of life. At the end, Sion did escape with Ryou, the government had to announce they found Sion dead in an accident for test, but Sion's death did not bring sorrow only, it also brought hope, it empowered people they have to keep moving on, to carry on the death wish of their savior...\n    Things have been completely ridiculous, the war that started before humanity was destroyed almost destroyed themselves, they never realise technology made life comforting but could also destroy humanity on another hand... I once thought about it but never made a fuss, now that I read Eden, it made me understood how selfish governments are, they wanted stable economics, society, but not people's happiness. Eden's definitely the game where you want to be sad, but as you feel sorrow, you might feel that you couldn't cry for it. (seems like at the end, Ryou had also broken down due to Sion's death)", "timestamp_created": 1451377227, "timestamp_updated": 1451377227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20038891": {"recommendationid": "20038891", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095467334", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451322214}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442. \u0420\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430! \u0412\u0438\u0434\u043d\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0439! \u0418 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430)", "timestamp_created": 1451321799, "timestamp_updated": 1451321799, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20036564": {"recommendationid": "20036564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257333619", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505650483}, "language": "schinese", "review": "minori\u4e00\u8d2f\u7684\u7cbe\u81f4\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\uff0c\u70e7\u94b1\u7684\u7247\u5934\uff0ceden\u81ea\u7136\u4e00\u4ee5\u8d2f\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0eef\u7b49\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e0d\u540c\uff0ceden\u4e2d\u540e\u6bb5\u7684\u6218\u6597\u60c5\u8282\u8f83\u4e3a\u7d27\u5f20\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u6216\u8005\u8bf4\u60ac\u7591\u7684\u6210\u5206\uff08\u8bef\uff09\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0d\u7b97\u5f88\u957f\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u95f4\u6709\u63d2\u53d9\uff0c\u5f00\u5934\u6709\u5012\u53d9\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0ceden\u5c31\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u90e8\u7a0d\u957f\u7684\u7535\u5f71\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u505a\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f60\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u597d\u597d\u4f53\u4f1a\u8fd9\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u6700\u540e\u7684\u604b\u7269\u8bed\uff0c\u5728\u7ec8\u7109\u524d\u4eba\u4eec\u5185\u5fc3\u4e92\u76f8\u4f9d\u5b58\u7684\u6e29\u6696\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u62c9\u7ef4\u771f\u662f\u5e05\u6c14\uff01\n9/10 \uff08\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u625310\u5206\u611f\u89c9\u603b\u6709\u79cd\u7ec8\u7ed3\u611f\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1451317118, "timestamp_updated": 1451317118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20029493": {"recommendationid": "20029493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123972838", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451383439}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f53\u521d\u4e70\u4e0b\u65e5\u5446\u5305\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8fd8\u4e0d\u77e5\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u540e\u6765\u542c\u8bf4\u4e0d\u9519\u5c31\u5fcd\u4e0d\u4f4f\u73a9\u4e86\u4e0b\u3002\n\u5267\u60c5\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u6c1b\u56f4\u6781\u4f73\u4ee5\u53caBGM\u771f\u7684\u8d85\u597d\u542c~\n\u771f\u5fc3\u5f88\u597d~", "timestamp_created": 1451300743, "timestamp_updated": 1451300743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20024699": {"recommendationid": "20024699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146616487", "num_games_owned": 344, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 861, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451286864}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e16\u754c \u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u7ed3.", "timestamp_created": 1451286905, "timestamp_updated": 1451286905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.990025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20018711": {"recommendationid": "20018711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986398583", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451160847}, "language": "english", "review": "Do not think of this as a game.

I would have to agree, but they didn't sufficiently edit the PG version which lead to some really awkward dialogue that didn't seem to fit in with the tone of the story. It felt like *lewd comment that leads to H scene* > *scene missing* > *comment about said H scene*.\n\nEDIT: I have since been informed that the Steam version and PLUS + MOSAIC versions dialogue are exactly the same and that the H scenes are part of the extras. I guess in that case I have to call into question the writing, given how really out of place some of the diakogue is. /EDIT\n\nI can't fault the art, music and voice acting which is actually quite good but everything else is very bland.

(Not that they are necessarily bad games). \n\neden* however, is a completely different kind of novel from the differently garbed anime girls throwing themselves at the protagonist's feet in a different interpretation of love. \n\nThe basic premise of eden* is a love story between two very different individuals.\n\n Right off the bat, from the preview alone, the art, the music, the smooth animation already grabbed my attention.  Believing it to be a truly exceptional work, I wanted a copy of eden* the minute I saw it.\n\nIt lived up to my expectations.\n\nYes, it isn't perfect, the upsize/fullscreen isn't as good, the characters eyes are a little too large for my liking.\n\nBut still, in spite of all that, eden* delivers, and what a story it has delivered. The art, the characters, the voice acting, the music, the CGs, the finale and more. Each and every bit of eden* delivers and brings the story to life. To me, the story is not particularly long, at 7-8 hours, yet in game, that time is both fleeting and eternal. At times it feels so excruciatingly long, and at times it passes by so quickly.\n\nAnd the ending, my sweet merciful (whatever religious figure you believe in or don't for that matter), the ending.

It matches with the mood quite well and is never irritating.\n\n11/10 Visuals: A kinetic novel always needs less work, however, the opening and the animated visuals with multi CGs are still fantastic. The amount of CGs make me forget that they're even considered CGs because it feels like it blends in with the story so well along with its frequency. Their mouths move and they blink in every single scene. That is absolutely amazing effort. The opening looks like an anime. The art is so beautiful and impressive.\n\n10/10 Atmosphere: The writing style, audio and visuals were put together to create such an amazing atmosphere. It may be just a kinetic novel, but the way this visual novel was made creates such an amazing atmosphere. When they were in the mountains, I felt ultimately relaxed, but when they were in the facility, I felt more tense. This adds to the feeling of the reader to emphasize with those who stayed in the mansion for so long.\n\n9/10 Plot: Almost a masterpiece! The plot is quite sensical, however only a few small things were never explained. The small things unexplained were not the main point of the plot, so know not to worry. A majority of the plot was explained. The plot is quite sensible and consistent. When I expected the plot to end, it wasn't even close to the end, in fact they covered a majority of plot holes. The plot went about excitingly or gently, never rushed. \n\n\n9/10 Characters: The character development was magnificent and each character has more to them than just their looks.

It took some hours to get going, often times I'd fire up the application to get to the menu and alt + tab and forget to continue for an hour or so haha.

Wondering why this settlement would need so much protection, he soon discovers that it is the home and workplace of a girl named Sion, who is hard at work developing ways for the people around the world to leave Earth before an unknown calamity.\n\nRight off the bat, I\u2019ll have to praise the game for its incredible pacing, writing and voice acting. Not once did I ever feel bored while reading through eden*. Each scene only lasts a few short minutes so you\u2019re never forced to go through a large chunk of it at a time, but at the same time the writing is so good that you\u2019re always wondering what happens next.\n\nThe kinetic style of eden* doesn\u2019t hamper the story it tells. It perfectly complements the story by providing you with great illustrations and emotional music that really makes you feel every scene. The world is well-built, the graphics are beautiful, the characters are engaging and the voice acting is top-notch.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to review a kinetic visual novel without spoiling anything important. I will tell you, however, that I was hooked basically from the very first scene, and more than a few tears will be shed by the end.\n\nI highly recommend this game for fans of great stories. I also recommend you to not look at how much the game takes to complete to really feel that every day could be your last.\n\nWhat I played: The full story arc in under [spoiler]8[/spoiler] hours (I'm

while, having forgotten about it after a while.. One day, my internet was fucked, so I was desperately searching for some kind of source for entertainment and spotted this game on my desktop, which made me think - \"Oh, this game, I completely forgot about it!\". The first couple of hours into the game, I was constantly wondering how this story was going to expand from here, because for me, the ending was spoiled, due to the nature of the description given to this game. This, I thought, might make the whole VN underwhelming, but I was completely wrong. The overall shell of this VN is easy to figure out, in the early stages of this VN I couldn't help but be sceptical overall about this. The whole trailer type video shown in this page is also a big spoiler for me, as it shows the two main characters already in the mellow state. I couldn't stop wondering about how these two main characters, both seemingly cold-blooded with no humane emotions to be seen, were going to develop. This VN starts off in an oddly relaxing manner, it feels like this game's just going around in circles with its story at times, but after having finished this game, I can't help but appreciate the amount of time I was given to get attached to the characters (deeply, deeply attached). The pacing is incredible, looking back at how the whole entire story has unfolded, in a slow, majestic manner. This game knows to take its time with the story. This game seems to have all the time in the world, contrary to the inhabitants of this small world, the measly human race, desperately struggling to survive the end of the world. Things seem uneventful, duty for the main male protagonist also lacking any kind of action. The seemingly static storyline put me off at first, but as I've mentioned before, this is crucial for this story to have any kind of impact on your feelings, so bear with me on this and this game will show you its worth in full display. Something which has caught my attention very early on into this game is - the incredible dialogue between characters, it's seemingly flawless and the usage/timings of specific words are impeccable, they were incredibly poetic and have made me quite envious of the writer! The way this story develops is simply amazing, I couldn't expect when or how this story would expand, due to the nature of this VN, only sloooowly..and slooooowly.. revealing each and every part of the story, completely trapping me in the game, unable to stop pressing the space bar! I was so absorbed into this game, I had forgotten that it has become midnight, I had forgotten to breathe regularly and ended up having to do it manually! (I guess that's what you call \"breathtaking\"?) Once the story had started to gain momentum in the storytelling aspect, it has gotten too interesting for me to let go of and time was seemingly flying! (though my clock says otherwise) The main female (Sion) protagonist's character development is astonishing, I knew something had to happen in her for this to be the \"Earth's last love story\", same goes for the male protagonist. And I was correct, something DID happen (what a surprise). The game had become a feels trip, I cried so many times and so much that I've lost count. \"I have become too attached for my own good..\" is what I was mumbling, while wiping my tears. *sniff* Yes, if you're wondering about the art and all the other things in this masterpiece, you won't be disappointed, though I expect you've already seen this game's trailers and what not, the art just gets better and better, same with the soundtracks, so you won't need to worry about these aspects being a potential sacrifice in order for them to have created the incredibly immersive and simply touching story. Sion's VA is incredible, she has simply pummelled my heart constantly, with her flawlessly delivered, impactful lines. So I have looked her up on the internet, only to find that she doesn't seem to be well-known at all and by that I mean - she hasn't been a part of many games/anime/vns so on so forth and it's very saddening for me, as I was ready to watch/read what other great things she might have had in store. This is the first game to make me feel my heart wrench, I have actually felt the pain in my chest and the inability to calm myself down from the sadness during and after. The ending of this game has left me in a dazzled state. As the credits were rolling, I was simply staring up ,while lying on my chair, thinking about nothing, absolutely nothing, as this game has left me speechless, accompanied by the feeling of emptiness. \n\nI give this game 10/10 with no doubt, this deserves more than just a glimpse. Delve into it, experience true melancholy and a feeling of amazement, followed by the feeling of accomplishment after having finished this game, which is truly worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1446589512, "timestamp_updated": 1446647012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18825483": {"recommendationid": "18825483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063522281", "num_games_owned": 502, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 1560, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446099596}, "language": "english", "review": "Spends a couple hours building an excellent death, and does a fantastic job of it.", "timestamp_created": 1446413464, "timestamp_updated": 1446413464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18818356": {"recommendationid": "18818356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131527969", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458473848}, "language": "bulgarian", "review": "The game where even 100 years old girls look like 12 ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1446393103, "timestamp_updated": 1446393103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18760131": {"recommendationid": "18760131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257798600", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446199641}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u542c\u4e0d\u61c2\u65e5\u8bed\u7684\uff0cFUCK", "timestamp_created": 1446200503, "timestamp_updated": 1446200503, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.206305", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18757157": {"recommendationid": "18757157", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073573846", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446505614}, "language": "english", "review": "played game, title screen changed as i progressed\n10/10 sweet dreams sion", "timestamp_created": 1446186633, "timestamp_updated": 1446186633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491803", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18755043": {"recommendationid": "18755043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105633036", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485138698}, "language": "english", "review": "Where do I even start.

Sprache auf Steam und ihrer eigenen Platform ver\u00f6ffentlicht. Ich habe eden* schon kurz nach dem englischen Release gelesen, bin bisher aber nicht dazu gekommen eine Review dar\u00fcber zu schreiben. Nun ist es aber Zeit, dies nachzuholen.\n\n    [quote]Titel: eden*\n    Entwickler: minori\n    Genre:Sci-Fi, Drama\n    L\u00e4nge: ~10h\n    Premiere: 18.09.2009 (japanisch), 30.01.2015 (englisch)\n\n    Story:\n    In the near future, an ominous red star suddenly appears in the sky. Its presence is about to bring about the extinction of all life on Earth. The unified government proposes an evacuation project to take all of mankind into space, but in order to make the seemingly impossible project a reality, \u201afelixes\u2018 are brought into the world. Engineered to be highly intelligent with perpetual youth and longevity, the genetically modified superhuman felixes stand as humanity\u2019s only hope for survival.\n\n    Sion, the most gifted of the felixes, has been kept in a research facility built on a solitary island for the past hundred years. Her sole purpose, saving all of humanity. Ryou Haruna, a soldier from the Earth\u2019s unified government is sent to watch over Sion, who desperately seeks freedom from the military that\u2019s imprisoning her. Earth\u2019s last love story is about to begin.[/quote]\n\n[h1]Handlung:[/h1]\n\neden* spielt in einer Welt, in der die Menschen dem Untergang geweiht sind. Die einzige Chance ist, dem Planeten zu entkommen. Hierf\u00fcr wurden genetisch manipulierte Menschen erschaffen, welche \u00fcber erh\u00f6hte Intelligenz verf\u00fcgen und genutzt werden um fortschrittliche Raumschiffe zu erschaffen um die Menschheit ins All zu retten. Hierbei verfolgen wir allerdings nicht den Entwicklungsprozess, sondern das Schicksal einer dieser genetisch ver\u00e4nderten M\u00e4dchen und von ihrem neu zugeordneten Leibw\u00e4chter.\n\nDas Setting hat mir recht gut gefallen und auch die Entwicklung der Geschichte ist gut gestaltet. Je weiter es sich allerdings entwickelt, desto mehr liegt der Fokus auf den Charakteren und nicht mehr so stark auf das nahende Ende der Menschheit. Dies h\u00e4ngt aber doch im Hintergrund \u00fcber allem, was die Charaktere tun. Die ganze Zukunftsvision wirkt durchdacht und hat einen interessanten Ansatz.\n\nZum Ende hin hatte ich aber ein bisschen das Gef\u00fchl, als wenn der Fokus nun zwangsweise extrem auf Drama geschoben werden musste. Auch die Einf\u00fchrung eines weiteren Charakters hat f\u00fcr mich die Story nicht positiv voran gebracht. Zwar sorgt der Charakter daf\u00fcr, dass es zu einer Entwicklung zwischen den beiden Hauptcharakteren kommt, aber dies w\u00e4re auch (angenehmer) ohne diesen m\u00f6glich gewesen.\n\nZwischendurch gibt es ein paar Passagen in der Geschichte, in der manche Dinge zu lange und zu breit erkl\u00e4rt werden und dies sogar zu einem sp\u00e4teren Zeitpunkt noch einmal wiederholt wird. Gef\u00fchlt ziehen sich diese Stellen elendig in die L\u00e4nge und bringt die Freude an der Handlung dort ein bisschen ins Stocken.\n\nDa es sich bei eden* um eine Kinetic Novel handelt, gibt es in der Novel selber keine Entscheidungen zu treffen. Hier l\u00e4uft alles linear ab. Dies ist allerdings nicht als Nachteil zu werten, sondern nur eine andere Darstellungsform.\n\n[h1]Illustrationen:[/h1]\n\nDie Illustrationen in eden* haben mir sehr gut gefallen. Hier gibt es nicht wie bei anderen Visual Novels Charaktersprites, sondern nur die CGs. Daher arbeitet eden* sehr gro\u00dfz\u00fcgig mit diesen und liefert dem entsprechend f\u00fcr alle wichtigen Szenen auch passende CGs. Die Illustrationen sind sch\u00f6n gestaltet und auch die Charaktere sehen alle gut aus. Vor allem wenn die Landschaft dargestellt wird, hat mir dies gut gefallen.\n\n[h1]Charaktere:[/h1]\n\nDie Charaktere haben mir in eden* alle recht gut gefallen. Es gibt hier nun keinen Charakter, der mir irgendwie unangenehm aufgefallen ist. Auch wenn der Charakter, welcher zum Ende hin neu hinzu kommt, mich in der Story eher st\u00f6rt, so war er doch sympathisch. Letztendlich liegt der Fokus hier aber doch auf den beiden Hauptcharakteren. Hier gef\u00e4llt mir zum einen das Charakterdesign und die Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten. Vor allem Sion hebt sich hier positiv hervor. Letztendlich ist aber vor allem die Entwicklung, die die beiden Charaktere durch machen das, was sie wirklich interessant macht.\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\n\nDer Sound ist auch hier mal wieder so eine Sache. Die Musik passte gut zu den Szenen und hier wurde eigentlich alles richtig in Szene gesetzt. Allerdings ist bei der Musik nun nichts bei, was besonders hervor sticht und einem im Ged\u00e4chtnis bleibt. Es ist gute Untermalung der Handlung, mehr allerdings auch nicht.\n\n[h1]Fazit:[/h1]\n\nUnd zu Fazit, also die tl;dr Edition von dem, was bereits hier dr\u00fcber steht. Mir pers\u00f6nlich hat eden* Spa\u00df gemacht zu lesen. Es war eine gute Mischung aus Charakteren und Story mit ansehnlichen Illustrationen. Davon einmal abgesehen war es aber nun auch nichts, was einen \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigt oder einem furchtbar lange im Ged\u00e4chtnis bleibt. Das mit dem Review dazu hat auch einfach nur so lange gedauert, weil ich die Novel schlicht weg wieder vergessen habe. Solange wie man es liest unterh\u00e4lt es einen gut, trotz ein paar Passgen die sich einfach nur hinziehen. Sobald man allerdings mit eden* durch ist, verschwindet es doch wieder recht schnell aus dem Ged\u00e4chtnis.\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1445688327, "timestamp_updated": 1445688327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18596746": {"recommendationid": "18596746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165491668", "num_games_owned": 794, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 5, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441579677}, "language": "schinese", "review": "EDEN\u5927\u6cd5\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1445416292, "timestamp_updated": 1445416292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18594859": {"recommendationid": "18594859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043098538", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435086046}, "language": "english", "review": "Boreing", "timestamp_created": 1445401882, "timestamp_updated": 1445401882, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.316744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18572940": {"recommendationid": "18572940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093809999", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465623953}, "language": "english", "review": "It's too sweet.

The story involves the final days of the planet Earth which may seem like a cheap way to inject drama but, honestly, that part of the story may as well be an aside. The fact is that the main story is between our two main characters and it could have just as well been told in another setting while still remaining as powerful. It's very well written with one caveat...\n\nThe pacing for the first half is incredibly slow. If you're not a patient person, you may have trouble dragging yourself through it. Speed reading or skimming along until the main characters get together wouldn't be a terrible idea if you feel yourself getting disinterested because there is a great ending to this story, despite the slow start. This is a long story and they get together at about the midway point so you won't be robbing yourself of much by skimming a bit. Lastly, just an FYI, this is a kinetic novel meaning there are no choices, branching paths or interactions. \n\nAs far as the artwork goes, it's mostly top-notch. The characters are often incorporated into the backgrounds instead of the standard VN format of having a background layer with static \"pop-up\" characters in front of it. There are a few frames of Major Inaba that are comically bad and I question how they ended up in the game when the rest is so well drawn but aside from that, it's all very beautiful.\n\nIn summary, it's a great story if you have the time (and a little patience) to put into it. A bit slow to start but it has a fairly powerful finish.

You know.. f-for the plot! baka! >////<\n\nOk but seriously for my second i really like this. Now you can buy Eden* or Eden* plus mosaic that is basicly the H version of this game. i havent finished the game as of yet but i think after so many hours i can give a solid enough review. \nSo, \nPros- Well the art works amazing. Really well done, sometimes tho i feel like Ryou's face looks fking wierd in some scenes LOL\nMusic- the music in this really suits the scenes, i wish few parts it would of varied a little bit but asides from that really good soundtracks. love them!\nVoice acting- The voice acting. You can really feel the emotions from the characters, and actually get attached to them , feel theres moods ect. You can tell they werent dragging on with this game as the voice acting is superb.\nCons- a few things that got me confused was how the story starts, its like, it goes in the future stops goes in past then vise versa at the start but i think i was just tired when i started so i like derping out. Buut once you get in things start to be explained and it gets REALLY intresting.\nWhen you try going in fullscreen mode it doesnt really fill the entire screen that isint really a bad thing just for me kinda anoyed me i dont know why lol\n\nIs this game worth it? Yes. althought the price is a bit on the high still worth it. You really get your money worths. \nI can't wait to finish this game completly and know the rest of the story as this games really really good.\n", "timestamp_created": 1443713099, "timestamp_updated": 1443713099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.435000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18203311": {"recommendationid": "18203311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161942731", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462029658}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u597d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u795e\u4f5c\uff01\uff01\uff01\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1443278048, "timestamp_updated": 1443278048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501107", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18181518": {"recommendationid": "18181518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035684047", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506272454}, "language": "english", "review": "As I write this review with tears still in my swollen eyes, I can only remember the last time I cried this hard.

So I can speak for at least how good the story and audio for both are because according to mangagamer.com the only differences between the AO version and the All Ages version is the addult content which are 4 non canon side story, 1 partial nudity scene, showing blood and enhanced CGs and thats  all the  main story is the same in both. So anyway I'll start with saying the main story for eden* is very well done it's got some sad moment, some touching moments, some funny moments and some exciting moments, you won't find any adult scenes in the main story for either the all ages version or the adult version, to get to the adult content you have to finish the main story at least once all the to the end. How ever the story is very detailed and well written so it's well worth the read. The main story didn't make me cry like it did for some other people evidently but I can understand as to why it would. The 4 adult side stories however aren't bad but they aren't great either if I had to rate the main story I'd give it a 10/10 now if I had to rate the 4 side stories I'd suppose if I felt generous I'd give them a 8/10. The Art and animation for both the main and 4 adult side stories were absolutely beautiful, and both the BGM and voice acting were very good. though if I could change 1 thing about the adult side stories it'd be the mosaic's I'd make it uncensored mostly because I think censoring ruins good artwork, without the mosaics the side stories might've gotten a 9/10.  Why only a 9/10 and not a 10/10 well the main story set the bar up to high, I've read hentai manga that've been able to have a good and long story and still add in adult scenes to the story. Hell a parody doujin of Neon Genesis called Re-Take is a  hentai manga with a long story but manages to add in the hentai scenes in a way that they add to the story's quality like there not there just for masterbation. Also Sunirder Academy if you use the restoration patch the story's still long and just like in the Neon genesis parody manga the hentai scenes in my open add to the story they don't seem like they're just for masterbation. So I think  the developers at minori could've done a better job with the story part of the 4 side stories but chose not to, the side stories are still good just not as good as they could've been. Anyway I'd give both the artwork and animation for the main story a 10/10 the 1st video/movie scene in the main story is amazingly well done just loved the way they did that, and the ending credits just as good as the 1st video/movie. The Audio both the BGM and the voice acting were excellently done in my opinion. Now the artwork and animation in the 4 adult side stories were just as good save for the mosaic's, and the audio once again same as the main really well done. Now is buying eden* Plus+Mosaic worth the extra money I'd say yes I think the added blood and the partial nudity scene enhance the story, now is it worth buying for the 4 adult side stories   I'd say yes plus when you buy eden* Plus+Mosaic from mangagamer.com you get both the adult copy  and a steam key for the all ages version, I'd rate the eden*/eden* Plus+Mosaic a overall of 10/10 so this iss worth every penny in my opinion.

If you are Haruna Ryou, you take this opportunity so that you can live the last happy life on this dying planet. \n\nNOTE: This is a slow paced visual novel. There are only a few jokes here and there to lighten the mood sometimes. Otherwise, this VN can take 10+ hours to read, so if you don't have the patience and you just want to finish a story quickly, this VN probably isn't for you.\n\n[h1]What type of VN is this?[/h1]\nThis is a kinetic VN, meaning that you read it as if it were a story book. There are no choices to make so just sit back and enjoy the story (and keep tapping the space bar to move to the next line of text if you don't have Auto forward turned on).\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nTo put it short: The world is coming to an end. People are preparing to evacuate from Earth. Creatures know as Felixes have helped humanity with the evacuation, including one particular Felix, Sion. \nWarrant Officer Ryou is a deadly soldier who struggles to find the reason why he wants to fight and what his goals in life are. He is assigned with a comrade named Lavie by his lieutenant to protect Sion.\n\nThe story is told in flashbacks. The story begins with the present, with Ryou and Sion living together. Afterwards, we go back in time and see how things came to be.\n\n[h1]Visuals:[/h1]\nThere is a reason why Minori's name is on this VN. The scenes are very well done. They are simply, yet beautiful. Character designs are nice. While the building interiors may look generic, there is usually that light streak that helps add some \"life\" to the scenes. Characters will also blink (it's not much, but its at least better than looking at a still , unmoving picture).\n\n[h1]Sound:[/h1]\nMaybe I love the Opening them for eden too much. The soundtrack consists of soft piano music in the background that helps accompany certain scenes. When dramatic scenes start to roll in, you will feel it.\nThe voice acting for this VN is superb. None of the dialogue feels rushed and it feels as if the characters are having a real conversation as they usually would. When things get serious, you will definitely hear it coming.\n\n\n[h1]Should you buy it?[/h1]\nLike I said before, it's best to enjoy eden if you have the patience for this story. This story can be considered a love story\".", "timestamp_created": 1442566969, "timestamp_updated": 1503376605, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.609620", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18079603": {"recommendationid": "18079603", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006269309", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 461, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454151191}, "language": "english", "review": "I first became interested in this by its charming video on the store page.

And for those who do not wish to read the entire length of my review, a TL;DR is located at the end of the review summarizing my thoughts.\n\n[Synopsis] Over a hundred years ago, humanity learned of a humungous comet, one massive enough to obliterate Earth itself. Now, as the day of destruction closes in, most of the human race has already evacuated into space in search of a new beginning. This escape is largely due to the accomplishments of a woman named Sion - a genius scientist born as a part of a new race of intellectually-enhanced humans created for the sole purpose to find a method to counteract humanity's extinction. It was at this time that she met Ryo, a soldier seemingly void of life and purpose, who was ordered to become her bodyguard. Now, let the curtains rise on the last love story on earth\u2026\n\n[Review] Eden* is undoubtedly one of the best and most touching VNs currently available on Steam, and is a must buy for anyone looking for a beautifully written and somber story accompanied by fantastic visuals and music. Though there are certainly flaws within the VN itself, I believe the pros far outweight the cons of this VN.\n\nPros:\n\u2022 Characters - Each and every one of the characters is written with care. Though each falls into a certain trope in their early stages of development, depth is carefully layered upon each character that far surpasses their original trope.\n\u2022 Music - Eden* has some of the most pleasantly somber tracks I've heard in any VN. Many classical instruments are used including the violin and the piano.\n\u2022 Voice Acting - \n\u2022 CG/Visuals - \n\u2022 Pacing - \n\u2022 Translation -\n\nCons:\n\u2022 Price - For a 10 to 15 hour VN (varies on whether you choose to use the autoplay feature and/or skip voice acting), $19.99 is a pretty high price. Though I'd love to say it's completely worth it, I'd recommended waiting for it to go on sale. Fortunately for me, I was able to pick Eden* up months after release in a very cheap Humble Bundle deal for less than a dollar.\n\u2022 Certain Facial Proportions - Eden* has some of the biggest eyes I've seen since CLANNAD, so for some it might be a turn off. Additionally, Ryou has the most awkward looking facial features in many of the CGs he's included in.\n\u2022 Minor Distracting Fanservice - Though fanservicey shots are used extremely rarely (taking up less than 5 minutes in total screentime), I find it still worth mentioning that there are a few CGs which included some unnecessary fanservicey elements to them.\n\u2022 User Interface - Compared to other VNs of similar quality, Eden* has a very basic UI.\n\u2022 Animations - \n\u2022 Plus MOSAIC (18+ additional content) - Entirely unnecessary. Unless for some reason you desire the eroge content the game offers separately (only available on MangaGamer), I wouldn't touch this.\n\nTL;DR: A little slow to start, but the tears will rain soon enough.", "timestamp_created": 1442118902, "timestamp_updated": 1479961994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17991985": {"recommendationid": "17991985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009590474", "num_games_owned": 379, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461551947}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f60\u4e0d\u5fcd\u5fc3\u518d\u770b\u4e00\u904d\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1442026244, "timestamp_updated": 1457674261, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17987388": {"recommendationid": "17987388", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057703560", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442000069}, "language": "polish", "review": "Na pocz\u0105tku nie mog\u0142em si\u0119 pogodzi\u0107 z tym, \u017ce kupi\u0142em cholerstwo za spore pieni\u0105dze i jedyne, co dosta\u0142em, to mn\u00f3stwo obrazk\u00f3w i dialog\u00f3w z narracj\u0105.

Having known this for 100 years a certain someone was instrumental in creating a space program so man could escape. People were not given a choice on if they could stay and die so many were outraged. Some also refused to believe the end would ever come. Thus the world has been in a constant state of martial law style war. The main male character is former special forces and a ruthless killer in his own eyes totally full of sin. Will he and the countless other people he meets find an internal sense of redemption or a way to atone for the immense guilt they feel?\n\n[b][u]Positive[/u][/b]\nWell obviously art and sound are top notch for a VN. I mean just watch the preview video. The story has a nice way of coming full circle and telling stories within stories. The whole story itself is by no means short like most VN titles bosting over 10 hours of story. \n\n[b][u]Negative[/u][/b]\nIt ends up very difficult for a rational person to find any point in some of the decisions made since there is really no reason things had to turn out so heart wrenching if you think about it after your done with the game. This is a kinetic novel so choices do not exist. It's actually kind of a shame that choices don't exist because the option to make this into a Clannad type visual novel would have made more sense even if the story suffered slightly. In the end this game reminded me a lot of Clannad the anime series because it felt like it was purposely set up for feels even when it didn't make a whole lot of sense.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nIf you don't mind emotional stories with well developed characters this is a must. So far it is the best VN I've experience on steam easily beating the rest. Unlike many other steam VN's that have hentai on other sites this one has it available on other sites, but it actually is separate and makes little sense with the game if you go that route. Thus the steam version is actually better in my opinion because it won't make you wonder about that other content that makes little sense with the story. Even if I do think the story purposely makes the reader sad by having the characters purposely choose the more painful route even though there were way better options available I still respect it none the less.\n\n[b][u]Value[/u][/b]\nI would say about $15. To be honest I usually don't value VN games at a high value so this is actually rather up there for me. Especially since I normally say $1 per hour of gameplay. Except this time the story, sound, and slight animations make it worth the extra $0.50 an hour.", "timestamp_created": 1441866788, "timestamp_updated": 1441866788, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17963040": {"recommendationid": "17963040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124675387", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441319673}, "language": "english", "review": "It's slow, I mean very slow, but it suits itself.

He enters a mysterious facility and meets a girl who has more to her than meets the eye. No, I promise you I have not confused eden* with Planetarian. That said, if you enjoyed Planetarian, then I think you are very likely to enjoy eden*.\n\nThe visuals in eden* are good. In addition to having a variety of poses and facial expressions for each character, the characters are shown to blink and their lips sync with the voice acting. There are many CGs and each one is beautiful to see. Several locations even have multiple CGs and this gives the impression of a changing camera angle. I like it.\n\nAs eden* is a visual novel, the topic of H-scenes should be raised. I did some research and discovered that the H-scenes are apparently bonus content to unlock in the main menu after completing the kinetic novel once. This means that the H-scenes are not at all relevant to developing the canon storyline. So don\u2019t worry about characters suddenly referring to something that happened during a deleted H-scene. That said, I also read that the H-scenes add more depth to each character despite being non-canon. Anyway, it should be well known now that if you want to see H-scenes then you should buy directly from MangaGamer.\n\nThe sound is good. The background music sets the mood well. However, it does not loop well because the end of the music fades to silence before starting again. The voice acting is good. I did not find any characters irritating to listen to. I think the emotions contained in the voice acting were appropriate for each character and the situation.\n\nThe story is told using flashbacks, and it makes some of the plot developments easy to see coming. The setting is easy to follow. The plot is decent and enjoyable, but it is not great. The translation is good. There are a few instances when I think a native English speaker would find the text unnatural but the text is still grammatically correct so it can still be understood.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed eden* and recommend it to people who enjoy visual/kinetic novels.

Per cui, senza una buona conoscenza della lingua \u00e8 difficile goderne fino in fondo.\nAvverto fin da subito che non si tratta del tipo di Visual Novel dove \u00e8 possibile effettuare delle scelte (come Fate Stay/Night ad esempio), ma la narrazione scorre su un unico binario, senza finali alternativi o route diverse. L'unica cosa che saremo chiamati a fare \u00e8 premere il tasto invio per far andare avanti i dialoghi.\nSviluppata dalla compagnia Minori, famosa soprattutto per \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" (\"Ef: A Tale of Memories\" e \"Ef: A Tale of Melodies\" per chi ha visto le due serie anime), racconta una drammatica storia d'amore in un mondo ormai al collasso.\n\nLa trama di Eden \u00e8 molto semplice e nemmeno molto originale in fin dei conti, ma funziona piuttosto bene.\nIl protagonista, Ryou, \u00e8 un militare che fin da piccolo ha passato la maggior parte del suo tempo sul campo di battaglia tra un conflitto e l'altro in questo clima di costante guerra civile che accompagna il mondo ormai da molti anni.

I disegni sono molto piacevoli e una nota di merito va ai fondali, davvero ben curati.\nLe OST sono in linea con la drammaticit\u00e0 che permea l'opera, ma vi sono anche musiche un po' pi\u00f9 frizzanti per le scene di commedia. Inutile dire che \u00e8 stata data molta pi\u00f9 attenzione alla prima categoria, essendo il drama la componente principale dell'opera. C'\u00e8 da dire che dopo molte ore di gioco iniziano a risultare un po' ripetitive.\nOttimo il doppiaggio, che vanta nomi come Junji Majima, Eriko Nakamura e Mai Goto (ho apprezzato particolarmente quest'ultima)\n\nUna cosa che mi ha fatto storcere un po' il naso \u00e8 il ritmo della narrazione, a volte davvero molto lento. Vero anche che ci\u00f2 non \u00e8 inusuale per una Visual Novel, ma a volte le situazioni risultano un po' troppo ripetitive, dovuto anche all'ambientazione, non molto sviluppata. Se aggiungiamo anche che le ore di gioco sono un bel po' (io ci ho messo 20 ore a finirla, anche se ci sono andato davvero moooolto con calma), si ha a volte la sensazione di non fare progressi di sorta.\nLe location della storia saranno infatti principalmente due. Questo costringe i personaggi a interagire tra di loro sempre nel solito clima di staticit\u00e0 che crea un'ambientazione cos\u00ec scarsa. Questa stasi si ripercuote negativamente anche sulle situazioni e le interazioni tra i personaggi, oltre che nel progredire della storia.\nIn ogni caso la drammaticit\u00e0, soprattutto a met\u00e0 e a fine opera riesce a dare diverse emozioni, facendo scoprire allo spettatore di essersi affezionato ai personaggi.\n\nUltimo punto da definire \u00e8 la versione +Mosaic.\nLa versione qui presente su Steam \u00e8 quella censurata dalle scene di sesso. Infatti, sul sito ufficiale degli sviluppatori \u00e8 possibile acquistare con un'ulteriore spesa il pacchetto +Mosaic, che trasforma la VN in un vero e proprio Eroge, oltre che migliorare la CG.\nAvendo provato solo la versione di Steam non so dire se questa patch aggiunga profondit\u00e0 al gioco (non dovrebbe, a detta degli sviluppatori, aggiungere nulla alla trama). Il problema \u00e8 che nella versione normale non si fa nemmeno un vago riferimento a nessun rapporto sessuale avvenuto tra il protagonista e uno qualunque dei personaggi femminili (dovrebbe passarsele tutte nel +Mosaic xD) e la mia impressione \u00e8 che risulterebbe poco realistico, oltre a distruggere l'atmosfera di dolcezza e romanticismo che permea soprattutto le fasi finali dell'opera.\nMa queste sono solo mie supposizioni basate sul nulla.\n\nIN CONCLUSIONE\nEden* \u00e8 indubbiamente consigliata a chiunque piacciano le opere di matrice giapponese come anime e manga. \nPu\u00f2 piacere sia a chi non si \u00e8 mai avvicinato ad una Visual novel, sia a chi ne ha gi\u00e0 provate altre.\nLa storia \u00e8 ben curata, soprattutto il rapporto tra i personaggi essendo il vero punto di forza della VN, dato che in quanto a sviluppo vero e proprio degli eventi, pecca un po' in ripetitivit\u00e0.\nSul lato tecnico \u00e8 molto godibile sotto ogni punto di vista.\n\nConsigliata!", "timestamp_created": 1441478994, "timestamp_updated": 1441478994, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.953872", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17895735": {"recommendationid": "17895735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129631406", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443913102}, "language": "english", "review": "This game hits right in the feels. \nOne of the first VNs I have played, one of the best.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1441468167, "timestamp_updated": 1441468167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17894411": {"recommendationid": "17894411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139328230", "num_games_owned": 1819, "num_reviews": 215, "playtime_forever": 917, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441459742}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]\"The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.\" ~ Albert Camus[/b]\n\nI haven't been playing visual novels for years now. Around the time that I got involved with adult responsibilities a couple year back, I involuntarily stopped sparing time for the genre. Thanks to a friend's insistent screenshot sharing of many beautiful VNs, I noticed that I've been missing pretty artwork and superficial stories in a very girly manner. I gave up and decided to give the genre a go after a long time. My first pick though, being anything but superficial, left me thoughtful and shaken.\n\n[i]eden*[/i] is a tale of compassion, free will and tomorrow. It is the tale of a world coming to its end. It all started with the appearance of an ominous red star on the sky. After through research, scientists agreed that it is the first warning sign of the end. It took a hundred years for mankind to prepare themselves for a major immigration project to evacuate the planet and search for its destiny elsewhere. During these final moments of the worn planet earth, there are yet things to wonder and chains to break. Between a stoic soldier, a secluded genius, a kind maid, a broken warrior, a regretful commander and a loud journalist; [i]eden*[/i] is the tale of breaking chains.\n\nThe game is designed to be a kinetic novel - which means a visual novel without any choice options. You only keep reading and watching the story as it unfolds. In this manner, it cannot wholly be defined as a game. The quality of CGs and the labor put into artwork are far beyond your casual visual novel though. Characters present a full selection of animations, including moving eyes and lip synch with Japanese voice acting. Voice acting is also beyond the par, as if taken out of an A+ anime series. Translation from Japanese to English is great - which is a rare case in any media - and manages to deepen the mood furthermore. The game is quite long so to say; if you'll be waiting for voice acting you can expect an average game time of 13-15 hours.\n\nI'd love to share some character details, but any relevant information about identities or backgrounds would be downright spoilers. Have you ever watched [i]Clannad[/i]? With After Story part of course. If your answer is no, it is a huge recommendation. If yes, you already know what kind of soul wrecking experience that you are getting yourself into. You'll remember Sion and Ryou's story for a long while.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1441463145, "timestamp_updated": 1454109139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.812704", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17891128": {"recommendationid": "17891128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198204345115", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441979880}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u522b\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u65e9\u5df2\u901a\u4e86\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f1a\u4e70\uff0c\u4f60\u61c2\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1441448527, "timestamp_updated": 1441448527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503759", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17888977": {"recommendationid": "17888977", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133295657", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 670, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441504096}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game on a whim a mere day and a half ago...I can't think of enough good things to say.

Truly, anybody.  I should mention, no spoilers in this review.  So newcomers, read to your heart's content!  Veterans, enjoy the ride.  :-)\n\nI never believed myself to be the visual novel type person.  Games where you just read text always seemed boring to me.  I usually play more RPG/Adventure type games where you actually DO things with your characters, not where there is a set, linear outcome.  \n\nBut this game truly altered my views on visual novels.  \n\nI like to think of my myself as a rather \"tough\" individual when it comes to watching movies and playing games and not getting genuinely sad or \"immersed\" with the characters in the story.  Not so with this game.  I can count no less than 3 times when I had tears in my eyes playing this and many many other times when I felt concerned beyond what I can describe for the characters within this game's incredibly well-presented story.  \n\nThe story combines science-fiction with romance to create a very interesting situations.  And the use of suspense, oh my God.  The feeling of: \"NOOOOOOOO, not now!\" or: \"That's not good...\" will grip you and tear you apart all throughout the story.  It's fantastic.  Truly fantastic and engaging.  \n\nThe game's soundtrack is beautiful.  Although at points I have wondered: \"Oh boy, that song again?\" it does not detract from the game in any way.  Although a few times when it kicked in it scared me, I remedied the issue by turning BGM down just a tad in options.  Then no problems.  \n\nI thought the art style was sort of weird at first, but now it is very appealing to me.  I guess it may be my sister's very awkward views on what is anatomically correct, but I promise this game's art is quite incredible and that my sister is full of crap.\n\nIn terms of characters, their development, and how they change over the course of the story, I've never experienced anything quite like this.  Some of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen have come from this game.  I cannot applaud Minori, the creator of this work of art, enough for the beautiful creation I have just witnessed.  This is off the grading scale.  \n\nI'd have to invent an entirely new grading scale to accurately rate how good this game is to me.  But I'll spare those details.\n\nI came, expecting it to be a \"crappy harem\" with a \"strange\" art-style and only one, \"dry\" ending.  Plus ew, all that text you have to read and potentially \"bad\" voice actors/actresses.  \n\nI left feeling completely different.  Changed.  Soothed, if you will.  Also, I must say my prior judgements are unfathomly incorrect.  If you have any/all of those like I did, play the game.  You will see what I mean after completing the game.  You will be most surprised.\n\nThe game has an overwhelmingly positive rating, and I am proud to contribute to that.  As my first ever review for a game, I am most satisfied it is with this glorious visual novel.  I played.  I cried.  I left feeling at peace and satisfied with my purchase.  Money well spent.\n\nTLDR:\nRecommended.  :-)  Very highly recommended.  :-) :-) :-)\n\nPS- And don't rush through it, whatever you do (I didn't, although towards the end I was quite anxious to see the ending, although I never skipped anything).  Enjoy it.  And remember, do not suppress your tears.  Or I probably would've cried a ton more, and especially audibly at no less than 3 parts in the game.  Part of enjoying games like these are to truly take in their beauty and let your emotion express itself, as it should be allowed to.", "timestamp_created": 1441436693, "timestamp_updated": 1441436693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17884391": {"recommendationid": "17884391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097727278", "num_games_owned": 152, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512863625}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all i'll start by saying, This is gonna be kind of a long review (might be my actual first serious review to anything actually)\nThis novel made me laugh and then cry. ;c\n\nThis is the story of the end of the world and the woman who saved humanity.\n\nOne day, humanity learned the Earth was doomed\u2014that an interplanetary object would collide with our planet, destroying its capability to support life. Humanity would have only 100 years to escape the planet and venture out into the stars.\n\nTo accomplish this monumental task, one scientist genetically engineered genius children. Among these was Sion, the genius among geniuses who would go on to design the ships and engines to make interstellar travel into a reality. And now, as Earth enters its last days and mankind has begun its migration to the heavens, she has but one wish: freedom.\n\nI highly recommend Eden* to those who love romantic visual novels, but mostly to those who have the patience! Not only is the story rather long, but some scenes seem drawn out more than they should be. At the same time, there\u2019s plenty of character development. If you\u2019re someone who wants a story told with little backstory or diversions, this game is not for you. Those who can stick it out, definitely pick this game up!

Thats just becuse i'm a bit of a pervert and decided i'd rather read the 18+ version, which btw changes the story in no way. It just adds some extra bonus 'alternate' scenes if you know what I mean. ;)\n\nFirst things first this is a kinetic novel, in other words there are NO choices, and therefore only one ending. The closest parallel I can draw from the steam library is Planetatian, which btw is another great kinetic novel, if a bit shorter.\n \nThe story in this one is for the most part pretty predictable, in so much as you know what the ending is going to be basically from the get go. This is not actually a problem though as for this visual novel, it is the journey, not the destination that you will enjoy. The plot is vaguely similar to the anime plastic memories if you have seen it, and if you have then you will know to prepare for some hardcore emotions throughout, so make sure to pack some tissues.\n\nI liked all of the characters and enjoyed their interactions with each other, although the main character was perhaps a bit unlikable at the start but by the end he had really grown on me.\n\nThe animation and CG design was really top notch, the artwork is one of the best i've seen visual novel wise. The soundtrack was good as well, really fitting the mood for the most part.\n\nTo sum up, this is an amazing visual novel and is well worth your time to read it. Having said that, this is my first real review so It may be a bit shoddily written but I hope I have articulated how good this is.\n\nPersonally I would suggest getting it on mangagamer though, I believe you get a free steam copy anyway, as that version contains bonus scenes that require just as many tissues as the main story, though for a bit of a different reason.

It's good, but not great. A decent premise and some characters who don't stick completely to type make it better than most visual novels, but too many cliches drag it down and the ending feels like a cheat.[/h1]\n\nThe world's about to end, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. After decades of civil war the last of the human race has come together to realise a desperate plan. A genetically engineered young scientist, smartest of her kind, has come up with a design for a fleet of spaceships to ferry the survivors off-planet to start over somewhere else. And a weary, battle-hardened soldier takes an unusual posting to the secluded military base where the genius is holed up.\n\n[b]eden*[/b] is a little more mature than your average visual novel, then: sure, it's merely an elaborate excuse for two wounded birds to fall for each other, and the daft character designs make that clear (the tiny, waifish heroine with her huge, vulnerable eyes!) but it's refreshingly low-key in many respects. No aliens, no elaborate pseudo-science, no brazen monologuing, just a clock slowly winding down.\n\nIt's a book you click through - totally linear, no branches - and the plot struggles to find its feet a bit. The localisation is occasionally dire, with some truly awful, dreary prose early on. The few action scenes are borderline incompetent, and the attempts at comedy aren't much better (because maid uniforms and sexual harrassment in the military are hilarious, am I right?).\n\nBut slowly, surely, it gets better. You realise characters have depth, and nuance, and they aren't just sticking rigidly to stereotypes. Potentially cliched plot beats just get tossed aside with a surprisingly level-headed \"Nah, I'm not going to stress about that any more\". And it stays relatively quiet, and subtle - a couple of gorgeous repeating musical themes help with this immeasurably. It's melodramatic still, but it's good, solid melodrama.\n\nIt's a shame, then, that the ending feels like a cheat. What happens to the two leads, all alone on a dying planet, is interesting but it's pretty obvious what soap opera plot device we're following and the way the game resolves it is frustratingly problematic and depressingly predictable. It doesn't totally kill the emotion the rest of the game built up, but it's far sillier, far more obviously manipulative.\n\nI doubt many people who aren't hardcore visual novel fans already would think [b]eden*[/b] is worth the asking price; I can think of any number of books you could buy instead. A few pretty pictures and some decent voice acting don't make up for that. If you see it on sale and you're interested, though, by all means give it a shot; for all its flaws it's still a sweet little story that's far more clever and emotionally affecting than most of the competition ever manages to be.", "timestamp_created": 1439727504, "timestamp_updated": 1439743416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575672", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17542999": {"recommendationid": "17542999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189515743", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439593582}, "language": "english", "review": "Deep, powerful, and emotional story, beautiful artwork, the music fits perfectly, and the Japanese voices are great.

Another huge negative, this VN has you making no choices, despite the fact their are about 4 \"choice options\" were the main character chooses for you. It is almost as if the writer wanted a branching story and got in a fight with the director who wanted a linar story. This aspect makes the game have zero replayablaty. 6 hours, you cry, your done. Keep this in mind. \n\n     As far as the little extras go, the do have a \"memories\" section that allow you to look at sceens that you have already cleared, as well as listion to music already played.

This game just did it.\n\neden is a kinetic visual novel with almost no required input whatsoever from the players, as the game naturally flows by itself. No branching story, no multiple endings etc. Be it so, it is brilliant on its own. The characters, the story, the soundtrack, all fit together.\n\nMany people say the artwork or graphic is stunning. It is true. There's a real art involved in this game. While it's just a mere 2D pictures, the backgrounds of each frames are nicely put together and designed, smooth flows between the transitions. The characters arts are what you can expect from Japanese games, pretty. Moreover, there's a nice design like characters eyes' blink and their expression changes, lips move in sync accordingly when the mood changes/talks. Simple touch, but meaningful - it makes everything as a whole more lively. Although yes, I do have one complaint, that is - the eyes of those chars are a bit too big overall, makes it a bit weird. \n\nDon't forget the important part for Visual Novel - it's the voice acting. While bunch of VNs abandon the voice acting because of many reasons, eden doesn't neglect it. The voice acting here is simply too good and unquestionably high production value. The actors really really pushed themselves to the limit, the emotions they bring through sheer voice acting alone is too incredible whether they portray happiness or sadness, they do it correctly. Can't deny this one is probably the strongest element this game has. That said, I'd recommend you let the game plays for you, so you get the fullest experience from hearing the voice acting. Voice acting is done in Japanese while the subtitle is in English. As someone who watches a lot of anime, I really appreciate it.\n\nThen there's a mixing element of VN, story. The story starts out slowly and seemingly simple - our protagonist Ryou is assigned to protect military base and the female protagonist Sion. But as the game progresses things getting more intense - until the first act in Military Base ends -, and the last half of the game where Ryou and Sion away, it starts slowing down again. You'll mostly see development of Ryou and Sion's relationship, how two humans with very different background fall for each others. Sad moment, happy moment, funny moment, sad again rinse and repeat. Roller coaster storyline, but by no means bad. In fact, it's very well written when combined with the game arts and voice acting. Can't say much without spoiling, and it's not funny to spoil people's experience on VN game, isn't it? Do note, again, this is a Kinetic VN. There's only one ending as an end result of one linear story and despite you know the ending is coming as you imagine and you don't want it to come, you can't stop playing.\n\n(....even I shed a tear or two watching the ending...)\n\nNow there's a con. The game's performance is a bit bad. It does not support controller natively, and this is an annoyance for people who love to lay down comfortably on the bed while reading the texts. There's also a major problem with Steam Overlay (the Developer admitted it already, and can't fix it with their current resources) so people might have problem taking a screenshot or two. I also had a problem launching the game, not until I complained endlessly and had the Developer fixed it with beta branch which I'm currently using. \n\nI also have to mention that the OSTs are not included in this Steam, be it within the game files so you can listen to them using Winamp for example, or being sold as DLCs. Too bad, would love to grab 'em - the soundtracks are really good. Here's one full song for opening movie from Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL2ZTgbgQdg\n\neden is about ten hours long if you keep playing like my pace - letting the game does everything by itself.\n\nVN is a genre that's not too popular on Steam, but overall, eden is a worthy game for any VN fans.\n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1438969154, "timestamp_updated": 1439804342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643158", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17418564": {"recommendationid": "17418564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028552023", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438887470}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u7ed9\u6211\u5370\u8c61\u6700\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u662f\u6781\u5177\u51b2\u51fb\u529b\u7684OP\u3002\u5f53\u5e74\u77e5\u9053\u8fd9\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u8d34\u5427\u770b\u5230\u67d0\u4eba\u7684\u7b7e\u540d\u6863\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u7528\u7684OP\u91cc\u7684\u4e00\u6bb5\u3002\nOP\u662f\u4e2d\u7684\u7537\u4e3b\u9047\u5230sion\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8f6c\u6362\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u611f\u67d3\u529b\u3002\u901a\u5b8c\u6e38\u620f\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u770bOP\u4e2dsion\u5728\u8349\u539f\u4e0a\u548c\u7537\u4e3b\u7275\u7740\u624b\u8086\u610f\u5954\u8dd1\u548c\u4e24\u4eba\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u98ce\u4e2d\u5bf9\u89c6\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u60b2\u4ece\u4e2d\u6765\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1438888877, "timestamp_updated": 1438889110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500378", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17412214": {"recommendationid": "17412214", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965049785", "num_games_owned": 649, "num_reviews": 389, "playtime_forever": 967, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438894497}, "language": "english", "review": "It took me a long time to get around to playing through this game. Partly because my backlog these days is so massive that it is more than a little overwhelming, and partly because I had a sense this game would probably make me sad. Turns out both of these are true, particularly the latter. ;_;\n\nBut... it's a nice little story. A bit predictable perhaps in that you can guess how it is going to end hours before it does, but not everything needs to surprise or shock. Also this is a \"kinetic\" novel, so there are no choices to make. Just read the text, listen to the voices, and look at the artwork.\n\nGood thing that all of those things are generally well-done. The art in particular stands out. The amount of CG's is staggering, the \"regular\" artwork looks just as good, and they even gave some attention to male characters here (unlike alot of other VN's XD). The voice acting works alright, and I was amused to find out that the male lead in this is voiced by someone who has voiced another male lead in one of the few romance VN's/animes that i've actually seen (Takasu Ryuuji from Toradora!). Lastly, I don't recall any parts of the text that seemed badly worded or mistranslated, so hooray for that.\n\nThe cast is fairly small, but they are interesting even if most of their backstories involve something they regret or wish for. The male lead Ryou starts off as a cynical emotionally dead soldier who has seen far too much violence and lost sight of what he is truly living for. The female lead Sion, despite looking like a loli and being [i]way[/i] older than she looks, is a lonely high-functioning autistic who is a victim of her own genius and unable to really enjoy her life (sounds familiar ;_;). The rest of the cast, from the seemingly bubbly Lavie, the actually bubbly Maya, the caring big-sister figure Elica, and the regretful Major Inaba all play their parts in the story, but, since this is a romance, ultimately eden* is dominated by Ryou and Sion. As for them working as a couple... I've seen better, but I've also seen much worse. It's fine.\n\nSo it's a relatively short (<10 hours) KN with superb art and decent story/characters. Also being a VN with a serious and emotional plot without any fan service nonsense is always welcome to see on Steam. I liked it, don't regret playing it, and that's good enough for me. :3", "timestamp_created": 1438856595, "timestamp_updated": 1438863767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17406348": {"recommendationid": "17406348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081030101", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438136817}, "language": "english", "review": "This story is an absolute beauty.

If you play only a couple visual novels this year, or even in your life, this should be one of them.  It is fairly short; it took me under 10 hrs to complete, but I did not listen to much of the voice acting and I do tend to speed read but I feel this was worth the money.

This is a kinetic novel, a visual novel that plays without any player decisions. It compares more with a novel or a movie, so those looking for anything resembling 99% of video games should look elsewhere, but those who are looking for an excellent story may look no further.\n\nAs a game that is entirely based upon story, eden* delivers. \n\neden* is a character-driven experience. Plot twists are used sparingly, and the story flows about as how you would expect. It is in the characters that the game shines. None of them resemble any cookie-cutter archetypes, especially those commonly found in anime or other visual novels. They feel human. They have a million different things on their mind, and the emotions attached to them are incredibly complex, and the game isn't afraid of discussing those conflicts inside each of those characters. It is especially apparent with the two lead characters' interactions; they understand each other's complexities almost absurdly well. It's a great joy seeing them change in even some minute ways as they face the very end.\n\nThe orchestral soundtrack is excellent and accents the story very well. The visuals are refreshingly more dynamic than most other visual novels, showing scenes from \"camera angles\" beyond the usual cut-and-paste sprite approach. Hearing different voices in different ears depending on the placement of the \"camera\" is a nice touch if you wear headphones.\n\nAs for downsides, the game is a little short. My record is a little bloated from semi-frequent breaks and waiting to hear all of the voice acting before continuing. The story was sweet enough that I didn't care. \n\nThe pacing might be a little slow in the beginning. The game definitely takes its time introducing the characters' quirks and histories. Again, eden* is a character-driven experience, so I didn't mind since that's partly why the characters felt so complex.\n\nFinishing the game made me want more, yet the feeling of closure to the character's inner struggles also made me feel satisfied.

After all I enjoy stories with substance and content that can be emotionally provocative, which, if you were to read the reviews, eden is just that.\nExcept it isn't.\n\nUnlikeable characters:\nMain character is a stereotypical Gary Stu war-hardened soldier whose inner dialogue takes up at least 60% of the reading which usually wouldn't be a bad thing if it wasn't for the fact that the subject matter of the inner dialogue is always about how emotionless he is. There is hardly any character development, so this doesn't change much. He isn't a good person, not even in a Byronic hero sort of way, and acts like a sociopath, yet still people like him. Okay.\nOther main character, Sion, is the typical 100+ year-old \"woman\" trapped in the body of a prepubescent girl with no personality. That's really all there is to her. \nEven when these characters finally show some semblance of emotion, it doesn't provoke any empathy because their backstories are shallow and their characters have hardly been fleshed out at all.\nThe rest of the characters are either similarly of little depth or are entirely shoehorned in, possibly for the sake of offering some temporary distraction from the otherwise boring plot that seems to drag on forever. By the time any action scenes do occur, you're already numb to what's happening after laboriously clicking/scrolling through the boring \"muh stoicism\" thoughts of the main character.\n\nThe animation isn't bad and neither is the music, although I found it to be noticeably repetitive at times.\nAt the end of the story, the non-canon, 18+ Plus Mosiac content is unlocked. Not expecting much I decided to open it because I was curious. Surely they wouldn't make the pacing of the non-canon 18+ scenes as mind-numbing as the main story. Nope. It too dragged on for so long I gave up and closed the window before anything involving hentai/18+ happened.", "timestamp_created": 1438047428, "timestamp_updated": 1456758353, "voted_up": false,

"playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436285040}, "language": "english", "review": "You may think that since I have only played for about 3 hours I have no right to write a review, but I\u2019m starting to fear that I\u2019ll burst if I hold this in. I may update my review if I ever manage to finish this game or my opinion changes.\n\nI still remember the first visual novel I ever played. It had pretty bad graphics with broken anatomy for the character portraits, very few CG\u2019s, 12 different soundtracks of horribly repetitive music, several flaws in its coding which made things confusing at times and not the best English. But the fact stood that a single person with English as a second language had worked and produced an amazing visual story with deep characters that touched the heart.\n\nEden* is the exact opposite. The graphics are beautiful, characters have animated eyes and mouths, there are a huge amount of CG\u2019s, fully animated opening, beautiful soundtracks and sound effects, full voice-acting, perfectly coded and excellent English text. But Eden* with its mind-numbingly dull story and flat characters have succeeded in completely killing my interest for visual novels. Eden* is for some reason passed off as a visual novel but is really a kinetic novel.\n\nFrom the moment I started up Eden* I was bored, but told myself that I was being unfair and should play more before passing judgement. But no matter how much further I went things never turned out interesting and the story only became duller and duller. At certain parts of the story there were moments that could have been interesting but was completely cut out and skipped over because god forbid we have something remotely interesting.\n\nThe protagonist is Ryou Haruna who is the most perfect boy in the world, the best soldier of them all, dark and totally edgy, has a dark past and charms all the girls simply by existing. He is a terrible person but the story progresses as if he\u2019s a good person with characters magically being in love with him and completely trusting him for no reason.\n\nOther characters include Sion who is the most perfect loli in the world, the most intelligent being on the planet despite not being able to wash her own hair and everyone calls her \u201cthe messiah\u201d. Elica who is a ditzy maid that takes care of Sion. Lavinia who gets her panties wet over bladed weapons and Inaba who drinks on the clock. \n\nI couldn\u2019t for my life care for any of the characters or their backstories and only found them infuriating. Every character\u2019s personality is horribly typical and cookie-cutter. All I needed was an introduction and then I had immediately grasped their entire character and could predict their actions from there on. The conversations between the characters are so flat and unrealistic it feels like everyone is talking to a wall. \n\nWhen I read the description, saw all the good reviews and saw that it was developed by the popular Minori I honestly expected a good story with deep characters. For the first time I wish that Steam issued refunds. The only consolation I have is that I bought it on sale so I didn\u2019t suffer the full blow of the 20 euro that this game is selling for.\n\nI would not recommend this for anyone with regular standards. If you however have a strong liking for dull storytelling, underdeveloped characters, anime characters whom look like they\u2019re 12 years old and old-fashioned cheesy drama this would satisfy your needs.", "timestamp_created": 1436293021, "timestamp_updated": 1436293021, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.636199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16927756": {"recommendationid": "16927756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085918222", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472644872}, "language": "english", "review": "This kinetic novel got me hooked onto the visual novel genre,\nthe voice actors are great in every scene, expressing the emotions and meaning behind it.\nDecent backdrops, sprites are animated!

We see the story through the eyes of an elite soldier called Ryou Haruna who is a personal guard to Sion, the Earth's lead scientist. We are just a passive observer and have no control over anything except when to start the next line of dialogue. There are no decisions to be made or any dialogue choices here. It does make your character more interesting and it makes for some pretty tense situations in where you hope he does the \u201cright\u201d thing. But that also means you will be doing nothing but right clicking from start to finish which can be a turn off considering it is a lengthy game that took me about 12 hours to complete. \n\nOptions menu doesn't have much to it but a very neat feature is that you can turn off individual characters voice actors if you don't like there acting. Can't speak of the quality of acting as it is all in Japanese with subtitles being in English. Starting off you are in a field with Sion and it's all calm and happy. After a short while you are teleported back to the events that got you there which was kind of daunting and that intro served no purpose other then taking the impact out of scenes, as you already know both Sion and Ryou will be fine. Anyways, after the intro you will be on your way to a secluded island masion which is housing the renowned genius Sion who is working on her lasts steps to get mankind off of the dying planet.\n\nEven though the world is about to end and Sion is nearly done with her work there are infiltrators that want to kill her. The game does not handle intrigue and mystery well. For example someone says \u201cShe is a...\u201d and the game fades to white and teleports you to another point in the future leaving you clueless as to where you are or what you are doing now. If you don't want us to know about it yet just don't bring it up. Another scene has you killing an infiltrator but you never see it happen, instead you are teleported a bit forward in time after the murder happens, leaving you wondering \u201cWait. He is dead now? Well, okay then.\u201d  It does this every time something mildly interesting happens which makes the game an utter chore to play until you escape the island.\n\nCharacters don't help at all either. Most are very unlikable which would be perfectly fine if they didn't try to play them off as good guys later on. Especially your character. He is supposed to be some elite solider that doesn't question orders but comes off as an extremely paranoid antisocial psychopath. That would make sense though the game never builds him up as a character or shows what he has been through to make him so psychopathic. Seeing his transformation from a sad kid to a hardened soldier would have been a much more interesting tale than anything on offer here. It is an interesting setting, humanity went bunkers after the red star in the sky was confirmed to destroy Earth and started a World War. Afterwards they focused on escaping the dying planet but some people refused to leave and started a guerrilla style war against the government. \n\nBut no, there we are stuck in a mansion with a douchebag protagonist and nothing much of interest going on. It really picks  after you escape the mansion though. As to be expected from this game it doesn't tell or show about your journey or how you avoided the military after escaping, you just teleport to a safe house. In that environment is where the game really shines. Sion being sick to the point of dying any moment really tugs on the heart strings. She is a super genius but she has been so sheltered that she does not know how to do the most basic of things like cooking or brushing her hair. You take on a father like role until things get romantic which is uncomfortable considering she has the body of a child. That is very late into the game though, do not be expecting a romance game, it is more of about taking care of a dying \u201cchild\u201d.\n\nLate in the game they also introduce the only other decent character besides Sion. It is entertaining watching our psychopath Ryou bully her, though Ryou will never become a likable character. Eden does a far better job mixing day to day comedy and sadness in events leading into the end of the world than trying to tell an actual narrative. There is nearly no \u201cfan service\u201d except for one scene showing a girl in a bikini which was a nice change a pace from most Visual Novels.  Our character does like to stare at breasts though and probably spends more time looking there than at their faces. You can also buy a different version over at MangaGamer.com that features H scenes if you are interested but the story is perfectly fine without it.\n\nOne thing that really helps set the mood is the amazing soundtrack featured in this game. All the songs are top notch and really amplify the powerful moments. Artstyle is great though the environments are nothing special. This is a strange title. It does nothing right story-wise other than get you to care about Sion. If it didn't reveal right off the bat that you will escape safely there might have been some tense or interesting moments in the mansion which is a shame as the intro served absolutely no purpose. Eden did something right though since even if we all know how it will end you can't help but see it through to the end. It's not awful but it is a very slow burner and has neither the characters, the overall objective or the story to hold your interest until you reach the good parts. Something like finding out secrets about the facility, having the infiltrators be an actual threat or having meaningless dialogue options would have done wonders to alleviate the boredom. When all is said and done the last few hours are pretty memorable and emotional which does save the game in my opinion.

Don't read them unless you played the game or you are not going to.\n\nPretty much sweet story about a girl that is involved on providing people optiom to escape from a Earth to a different planet because 'world's end' is knocking at the door. She's been genetically modified, which resulted in abiloty to live longer life, but she was 'made' to just help with creation of the space ships. Thus she was locked in the facility, which means she couldn't see outer world while it was one of her wishes.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Great art and animation\n[*]Well-fitting BGM\n[*]Game is mild in overall. There are no erotic or especially profane parts - It had the exact amount of violence it needed. R18 version does indeed improve few parts, but the ero-scenes are in special section so this part of game is not afflicted.\n[*]Touching story, none of VN/eroge I played was actually this powerful. Sad things are often not even worth dropping a tear for, but minori moved these situations on next level. Actually it did not really move me when [spoiler]Inaba died[/spoiler], but when Ryuu [spoiler]burried his beloved and only girl on this world[/spoiler] it really made me drop a tear or two.\n[*]The story is straight - No choices. It usually happens that if you finish another VN by bad ending, then it does clearly say what is going to happen in other endings, thus one ending avoided this.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]In comparison with R18 version, it had some huge censorship, for example blood is completely removed, that kind of decreases the emotions.\n[/list]\n\nI firsly said that I shall wait for sale or when it is in bundle.

As Kinetic Novels s\u00e3o como as Visual Novels, contudo n\u00e3o h\u00e1 escolhas a serem feitas ou caminhos a seguir. A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 linear e apresentada diretamente, como um livro.\nMas que livro...\nEden* n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas uma arte maravilhosa, com uma m\u00fasica fant\u00e1stica que se encaixa perfeitamente em cada momento, mas como uma hist\u00f3ria de amor, de supera\u00e7\u00e3o e de descobertas, repleta de poesia e reflex\u00e3o. E \u00e9 o tipo de hist\u00f3ria que fica por muitos anos, sen\u00e3o at\u00e9 o fim de nossas vidas. \nAcho que esse \u00e9 o principal ponto: a narrativa muito bem desenvolvida, alguns personagens interessantes em um mundo que est\u00e1 chegando ao seu fim. Uma hist\u00f3ria de amor imposs\u00edvel e que, se fosse falar muito sobre ela, estragaria cada instante.\nContudo, Eden* n\u00e3o \u00e9 um jogo para qualquer um. A falta de escolhas e caminhos pode desapontar aqueles que esperam uma Visual Novel comum, ainda assim, da forma como a hist\u00f3ria se desenrola e como foi criada, n\u00e3o poderia ser diferente. \nMesmo porque se precisasse pensar muito, n\u00e3o conseguiria sair das partes iniciais, pois estava sempre muito ocupado enxugando as l\u00e1grimas.\nSim, se voc\u00ea quiser vivenciar essa linda hist\u00f3ria de amor, a \u00faltima do nosso planeta, ent\u00e3o prepare muitos lencinhos, porque l\u00e1grimas \u00e9 que n\u00e3o ir\u00e3o faltar. De longe uma das melhores hist\u00f3rias que j\u00e1 vi em um jogo. Simples, graciosa, po\u00e9tica e linda. Eden* consegue tocar nos sentimentos com uma delicadeza de beleza e tristeza, marcando seu espa\u00e7o muito al\u00e9m do fim do jogo.\n\nResumidamente:\n[list]\n[*]Hist\u00f3ria maravilhosa, muito bem desenvolvida e o formato de Kinetic Novel (n\u00e3o h\u00e1 escolhas ou rotas a serem feitas) n\u00e3o atrapalha em nada a narrativa e os sentimentos que ela trasmite\n[*]Possui aproximadamente 15 horas de dura\u00e7\u00e3o caso o jogador queira ouvir todos os di\u00e1logos\n[*]Sim! O jogo \u00e9 dublado e o trabalho \u00e9 MUITO bem feito\n[*]A m\u00fasica \u00e9 simples, mas consegue dar uma incr\u00edvel sincronia e profundidade ao jogo, deixando-o ainda melhor\n[*]A arte \u00e9 nada menos que maravilhosa. \u00c9 impressionante como os cen\u00e1rios e personagens foram bem trabalhados\n[*]Prepare-se para vivenciar momentos de apertar o cora\u00e7\u00e3o e chorar\n[*]Sion \u00e9 a coisinha mais graciosa do mundo *-*\n[/list]\n\nA vers\u00e3o desse jogo no Steam \u00e9 censurada, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 sangue e as cenas de sexo foram cortadas.

I was skeptical at first, since I had heard nothing of this visual novel, and it didn't seem to be very prominent on forums or other gaming sites. Thankfully, the summer sale reduced the price to about $8, and I bought it. After reading all the way through, I completely understand the price point. eden* has absolutely gorgeous artwork, a sweet, melancholic soundtrack, an intriguing and engaging story, and complex, relatable characters. It was developed by minori, a small studio known for their most famous visual novel series, Ef: A Fairy Tale of The Two. eden* took me about 12 hours to read through with auto mode on. It is a kinetic novel, which means there are no player choices, just straight up reading. \n\neden* was originally released as an all-ages VN, with an eroge side story named Mosaic releasing later. There is no sexual content in the Steam release, and you will not be missing out on any story or character details if you buy it here. If you're looking for something to fap to, you're in the wrong place. eden* was published by MangaGamer, who also brought Higurashi and Go Go Nippon to Steam.\n\n[h1]Premise and Story[/h1]\n\neden* takes place in the near future, where mankind has predicted the death of the world. Scientists concluded that Earth will die in approximately 100 years, and began to frantically find a way to transport humanity to space to live on. Because of the pressing time limit and the magnitude of the situation, two major events transpire: all of the governments of the world join together to form the \"Unified Government\", and a certain doctor had the bright idea to genetically enhance a handful of humans. These creations are dubbed \"Felixes\" and their main perks are that they are intellectually superior, and their bodies stop aging after a certain point. These Felixes greatly accelerated the research for space travel, and a new project was initiated: The Earth Evacuation Project. The head of the project, a girl named Sion, is the alpha felix, the cream of the crop, if you will. The story revolves around her. \n\nUnlike most VNs, the protagonist has a name, a face, and a personality. His name is Haruna Ryou, a Warrant Officer in the Unified Military, who is assigned to a research facility in the middle of nowhere with the vague objective to \"protect it\". He has quite an impressive track record in the military, only volunteering for the most dangerous missions and showing no mercy or remorse. Most of his comrades fear him and respect him from afar. Another Warrant Officer by the name of Lavinia F. Asai (Lavie) is assigned to be his partner. I feel as though revealing more would ruin the experience, so moving on.\n\n[h1]Presentation and Gameplay[/h1]\n\neden* is a kinetic novel. There are no choices at all. Just relax and read through the story. Depending on how fast you read and if you listen to the voice acting (every character is fully voiced, Japanese only), it can take 10-12 hours to complete. It has a rather small native resolution of 1024x640, and there are various graphical options available. \n\nWhat sets eden* apart from other VNs is the characters being given life through subtle animations. They blink and their lips move when speaking, as opposed to the standard static image. One can turn off these animations through the options if desired. Functions such as saving and loading are not part of the text box, but reside in a small bubble that appears when moving the cursor to the bottom right corner of the window, Windows 8 style. That deterred me at first, but I quickly got used to it. \n\nSome of the highlights of eden* are its spectacular artwork and music. The use of lighting is fantastic, giving a bloom effect when outside and limiting it indoors to create an oppressive, somber tone. The characters themselves are simple, but attractive. Sion's large red eyes are incredibly alluring. The backgrounds are detailed and polished. Many of eden*'s still images are wallpaper-worthy. For most of the VN, melancholic piano music fills the silence. In moments of tension and suspense, it switches to a more chaotic, impactful rhythm. The music also plays a role in the storyline, which I find refreshing. eden*'s opening theme, \"little explorer\", is sung by Harada Hitomi.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nIf you have $20 to spare and are looking for a good VN, look no further. eden* is a fantastic and heartwarming experience that gives perspective on morality and humanity. The art is gorgeous, the characters are diverse, the plot is engaging and impactful, and it will most likely make you cry by the end. Make the purchase. Spend the 12 hours.

So now, you maybe are thinking \"Well, what's the difference between this and a book then\", and the answer obviously lies in the way it's presented.\n\nVisual novels, as the name suggest, are like a book but with images. It sounds like \"that's not interesting\", but it is. Eden* has such a nice plot, and the visuals are wo gorgeus, so shinny and pretty, that I was like all the time \"this is so beautiful\" and \"I'm hungry, but this is really good and I don't wanna stop\". Now, as you know, games have soundtracks (not all the games but a lot of them), and this game has one that is perfect for the plot, I mean it.\n\nI metioned the plot, and as you migh've read in the synopsis, this story takes place in an ending world. I've seen some people complaining about the lack of explenation about what's causing this situation, but the story it's not really sci-fi, it's not really necessary for the player to understand the whys, the stroy wants only to tell us a wonderful tale about the last romance of this world, adding too much explanations will only obstruct this, so I think there's nothing wrong in that regard. Finally, while the game it's not so long, the way it is presented, with the animations, and lips sync, and the cgs, this thing makes this game a true work of art (come on, art's not only those things on the museum), so buy it an play it.\n\nThat's my review, a little messy, but oh well.\nPS: Dat ending.", "timestamp_created": 1434598618, "timestamp_updated": 1434598618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16477737": {"recommendationid": "16477737", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119483129", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 868, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434564951}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my my first V.N. and did the feels hit me like a train.

Even though the story got a tad boring at points, the interesting characters always got it back on track. The story is mostly focused on the emotions, thoughts, and conversations between the characters, rather than worldbuilding. I would have enjoyed some more in-depth explanations about the setting. Small complaints aside, the touching ending was phenomenaly done.\n\nAlso, all sexual content has been removed from this game. Regarding censorship, I go back and forth. If a visual novel has a good reason to have adult content, it's totally alright, but, in the case of eden*, I think the narrative could be hurt by h-scenes. Either buy it from MangaGamer and support the forcing of h-scenes into visual novels that don't benefit from them or buy it on Steam and support censorship -_-\n\nScore:\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1434509937, "timestamp_updated": 1498318304, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502135", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16460268": {"recommendationid": "16460268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052506288", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 376, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456530544}, "language": "english", "review": "Saw this on daily deals read the reviews and was interested.

What would change for you, how would your priorities shift? Assuming you'd find an opportunity to escape, would you choose a future of perpetual narrow walls and cramped spaces over a short time of ultimate freedom followed by certain doom?\n\nFor the people living in the world of [b]eden*[/b], these questions are [url=http://store.steampowered.com/video/315810/]no longer abstract[/url].\n\n[i]MangaGamer[/i] delivers the English release of this 2009 title by [i]minori[/i] to Steam. [i]eden*[/i] is a kinetic novel (a story without choices or gameplay) about the last few people on a [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=397872856]dying planet[/url]. Its most unique selling point compared to similar titles is its visual presentation: Instead of the waist-up character sprites positioned in front of static backgrounds that we are used to from most modern visual novels, it relies almost entirely on scene-by-scene [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=439376082]custom images[/url], [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389363810]each one[/url] carefully designed to take character positions and camera perspectives into account. This gives the experience a very cinematic feel, quite literally reminiscent of movies, compared to other titles of its kind. Most scenes also features blinking eyes and lip syncing with the Japanese voices, which makes it impressively lively.\n\nNeedless to say, the asset quality is [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=387507579]excellent throughout[/url], starting with the backgrounds ranging from the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=395878979]painterly[/url] to the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=394384272]borderline naturalistic[/url]. The same attention to detail extends to the characters who, despite the multitude of poses and perspectives, always appear consistent, unique, and alive. From what I can tell as someone who does not speak Japanese, the voices really fit well, and coupled with the competent sound design and the soundtrack by Tenmon (if you happen to enjoy Makoto Shinkai's movies: yes, [i]that[/i] Tenmon), which expands a small number of recurring motifs into a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fkXilmYxq0]gripping soundscape[/url], this is an aural experience that you are unlikely to forget.\n\nThe story revolves around Warrant officer [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389363853]Ryou Haruna[/url] and his assignment to guard a remote research facility during the planet's final moments. A peculiar (but largely unspecified) astronomical phenomenon is going to wipe out all life on Earth, and humanity is putting the finishing touches on a centennial plan to migrate into space and search for a new home. One component of this plan are the felixes, genetically engineered superhumans whose intellect propels scientific progress far beyond its normal pace. However, there are dissenting voices claiming that humanity should face its ultimate fate head-on instead of trying to escape, so military protection is granted to essential actors within the plan \u2013 in particular to Sion, the supreme felix, mastermind behind the giant starships and humanity's savior.\n\nThe central themes of [i]eden*[/i] include destiny and free will as well as the morality of living one's life for someone else. Ryou, as the self-described \"military's attack dog,\" and Sion, as the people's only hope to keep on living, are both so devoted to their duties that they have fallen out of touch with [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=387780332]their own humanity[/url]. Circumstances force them to confront their deeply buried sense of self and be thrust before the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=397873537]most pivotal decision of their lives[/url]: to keep on living in the narrow golden cages of their own design, or to choose the ultimate act of defiance and experience the freedom and joy that they had always denied themselves, living life to the fullest until the curtain falls.\n\nThe writing tends to focus on character interaction and personal growth over story complexity \u2013 [i]eden*[/i] is all about the human condition, not about hard sci-fi. In fact, even the scientific details of the end of the world are almost completely glossed over. If you are looking for an apocalyptic sci-fi story with cool technology, this isn't it. Rather, the focus on the characters is so strong that it could be described as downright melodramatic in parts, insofar as that can be a good thing. It features countless [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=395878549]goosebumps-inducing[/url], [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=389363244]memorable[/url], [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=397873014]quotable[/url] [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=386222872]moments[/url] that easily smooth over the fact that some of the tension maybe could have been resolved in easier ways, or that there's a certain degree of plot convenience constructing the situations that are most interesting for the characters. It all ends up feeling very complete and satisfying.\n\nAll in all, I can recommend [i]eden*[/i] without much in the way of caveats. If you dislike visual novels or anime-style art, odds are you have not read this far down. If you like visual novels but you're not sure if this one is worth your time, my answer is that it is. I also recommend avoiding playtime estimates. Reading speed varies from person to person anyway, but the later parts of this story work best if you can empathize with the sense of impending dread that the characters are feeling. For them, any day, any moment, could be the last one. It'll be more fun for you if you can get lost in that feeling as well, instead of calculating how many hours you might have left. Even if you have little to no experience with visual novels, this one is probably a better one to get started than most titles currently on Steam. With the above-mentioned reservations in mind, [i]eden*[/i] easily gets a positive recommendation from me.", "timestamp_created": 1434206256, "timestamp_updated": 1434206256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.873302", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16353713": {"recommendationid": "16353713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150736454", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496081827}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u73a9\u4e00\u8fb9", "timestamp_created": 1434193279, "timestamp_updated": 1434193279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16347410": {"recommendationid": "16347410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129372995", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 21894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513060369}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u665a\u5b89\uff0c\u8bd7\u97f3", "timestamp_created": 1434172116, "timestamp_updated": 1434172116, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16336170": {"recommendationid": "16336170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126549818", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429627372}, "language": "english", "review": "a great VN with stunning music", "timestamp_created": 1434135320, "timestamp_updated": 1434135320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16299802": {"recommendationid": "16299802", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977152166", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433984583}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend reading this Graphic novel about 9 and a half hours long but great story lovable characters.", "timestamp_created": 1433984694, "timestamp_updated": 1433984694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16234083": {"recommendationid": "16234083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198196704053", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432735871}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't know that it was a kinetic novel (no choices), and I found out halfway into the game that I could enable auto scrolling text, which meant I didn't need to keep clicking to read the next line. \n\nHaving said that, it was quite a compeling little novel with beautiful graphics and enough suspense to keep me reading.

The sexual content comes in the way of 4 extra scenarios you can play after the game, that for the most part are contradictory to the main story. Its pure fanservice. If you wish to purchase that version, you can do so at mangagamer.com and they will also provide a free steam key for the all ages version.\nThere is ALOT of artwork in this game. Most VN's are content to use the same set of character portraits over various backgrounds, but eden* very rarely uses these instead choosing to have entirely new artwork for almost every diaglogue scene in the game, and these include some basic animation (blinking and mouth movement). And its all of a high standard.\n\nSidenote: I played this game in offline mode, so steam failed to track my actual playtime, good jerb 8v", "timestamp_created": 1433509925, "timestamp_updated":

Then, it breaks it at the end.\"[/i][/b]\n\neden* is a visual novel game about Haruna Ryou, an adept special force agent, assigned to guard and protect the last hope of humanity, a felix named Sion. And from that encounter, there lives where destined to change.\n\nThis Visual Novel of Minori is absolutely one the best out there. As like every Visual Novel that Minori has made, this one doesn't have any choices and many routes. It has only one main route and one heroine but don't get taken back by these things because the story plot is totally solid and well-written. Every moment took me to the edge of my seat. What makes this VN standout is its way of affecting the player's emotions. The VN starts slow with but as you go deeper into the story, you begin to absorb the emotions expressed by each character. I don't know why but the VN's ending is quite predictable to me but the emotional delivery is what shot me down to tears.The VN has a great set of soundtracks as well. The visuals and art are totally magnificent. The protagonist is also voiced in this VN. (The protagonist's monologues are the only ones that are not voiced.) \n\nIf you're a big a big fan of Visual Novels then you can't possibly miss this one. If you're new to the genre, then as early as now, prepare your heart for something very emotional. I recommend this VN to those who are looking for a VN that is well written, has awesome visuals, great soudtracks and has a solid story plot.\n\nI can assure you, you won't be disappointed with this because after all, this is... \n\n\n...the last love story of the planet.\n\n[b]My Personal Rating:[/b]\nGraphics: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nPlot: 10/10\nGameplay: n/a (it's purely a Visual Novel, no decisions are made)\n\nOverall: 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1430014996, "timestamp_updated": 1430015282, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15503155": {"recommendationid": "15503155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048604554", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 648, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478079590}, "language": "english", "review": "You will most definitely love this story if you like bittersweet and sad endings.... \n\nA tale themed around death and reminding you to live life the way you want.... not just for the sake of living\n\nIn my opinion, worth every cent I put out for this game... <3", "timestamp_created": 1429794206, "timestamp_updated": 1429807400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15500543": {"recommendationid": "15500543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082057749", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467886332}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8349\u6ce5\u9a6c\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u5fc3\u597d\u75db\u3002\noyasumi sion", "timestamp_created": 1429772660, "timestamp_updated": 1429772660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15497792": {"recommendationid": "15497792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165564217", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438688586}, "language": "english", "review": "A really long but story rich novel.\nReally worth my time and its so intresting I hoped they will add what actually happend to the guy in the end.\nIts really sad that he have to live on earth alone after sion's Death.\nReally made me sad at some point.\nIf you have some spare time just buy this novel and read it\n9/10 \n", "timestamp_created": 1429748559, "timestamp_updated": 1429748559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15484392": {"recommendationid": "15484392", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086309281", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429580848}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good Visual Novel Game\nReally Great Romantic Story but kinda sad to\nIt's worth buying if your into visual novel games\nI'd Recommend this game to any Anime and Manga Lovers", "timestamp_created": 1429662878, "timestamp_updated": 1429662945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15476755": {"recommendationid": "15476755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072519638", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429625289}, "language": "english", "review": "for all people that are not sure it's a must buy the story is so good :D", "timestamp_created": 1429625355, "timestamp_updated": 1429625355, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15460126": {"recommendationid": "15460126", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019598217", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 968, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1436401404}, "language": "english", "review": "Lots of feels.\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1429513895, "timestamp_updated": 1435397382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15435624": {"recommendationid": "15435624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017398842", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1036, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429377865}, "language": "english", "review": "A quote from Eden*. Technically not a spoiler, but just in case I'll cover it:\n[spoiler][i]We all have our tiny hellos and goodbyes every day, but nobody knows for sure when a long farewell will come. That's why we have to see each other eye to eye, so that when that final goodbye comes, we can say we had no regrets.[/i][/spoiler]\nThis line is my favorite line from Eden*, and I really took it to heart. You never really know if the next goodbye will be the last.\n\nConsider this your TL;DR version:\nWith a cute yet very sad love story, Eden* is out there with some of the best stories I've seen in a while. It's brought all together with brilliant characters, gripping story, beautiful art and astounding soundtrack.\n\nThe story to Eden* is fairly simple. The world is coming to an end and the human race needs to evacuate into space to avoid being wiped out by whatever the world is about to be destroyed by. Out of the characters we get to know throughout the story, two of them refuse to leave the planet. Instead they take up a life of solitude in the mountains and live the last few days they have left in peace. It's not something that looks very good on paper, but in my opinion it's handled extremely well. It's not only the story itself that makes Eden* an amazing visual novel though, it's also the characters. How they feel about one another, how they interact and so forth. With all the characters you meet, you grow attached to them. And with all the farewells you have to go through, it quickly becomes a very sad story.\n\nThe art... Not only is the art beautiful, it goes above and beyond of what a lot of other visual novels tend to do. The amount of detail and care that went into the art shows. A majority of the visual novel is not just one background with characters placed there like a lot of other visual novels are. Instead there are several backgrounds for a room from different angles. Also, the amount of pictures (not backgrounds where you can paste any character, but actual pictures with a character usually doing something already in them) is huge. The drawings give attention to even the little things that don't even really matter, making it a much more enjoyable experience in general. And to top all of it off, the opening is one of the best animated clips I have ever seen. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C11JmxKvcOk]I really recommend you click here and watch it. It's amazing.[/url]\n\nThe soundtrack is one of the saddest yet most beautiful soundtracks I've ever heard. Pure and simple, it really knows how to set the mood for many situations. If there were an option to buy the soundtrack, I would probably do it.\n\nNegatives are a tough one to mention, since there isn't a whole lot to mention. I guess you could say that I am a little disappointed with some scenes and how boring they were, but that's just me. Not a whole lot of things during the prologue were very interesting, and some scenes in general felt like filler. Thankfully, a majority of the content is interesting and what little boring content there was doesn't really affect the story telling in any way.\n\nFrom a bunch of different visual novels that I've seen this stands out, because you can see how much effort was put into this to make it what it is now. If you're looking for a good, yet very sad story, this one is definitely something you should read.", "timestamp_created": 1429381648, "timestamp_updated": 1429394258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Both are short kinetic novels, both deal with heavy topics like death.  But I think Eden* handles its topics a lot more interestingly than Narcissu.  \n\nA lot like Narcissu, death is a looming inevitability on the minds of the main characters.  For Narcissu, the constant talk of death and hopelessness turns the story into a drawn-out slog with an inevitable conclusion.  The characters don't really grow or noticably change over the course of the story.  Eden* handles the same concepts in a way that is a lot easier to swallow.  It isn't a spoiler to say that the main heroine dies in this story.  But how it handles that character death makes all the difference.  Eden* uses every chance it gets to develop its main hero and heroine into interesting characters with detailed motivations.  Where Narcissu was primarily about picking a better place to die than a hospital, Eden*s characters  use their struggles with their own mortality (either due to physical illness or the approaching end of the world) to learn to live life to its fullest with what time they have left.  \n\nComing back and reading Narcissu again recently after having not read it for several years left me feeling depressed and almost...empty.  It was a soul-sucking experience.  But Eden*, despite being at times equally dark, sometimes even moreso because the characters were so much more three-dimensional, left me feeling uplifted and more positive about life.  I felt like it had really successfully communicated to me how important living my limited days on this earth to their fullest is.  So I think that's really a victory for this game's storytelling.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, pros and cons.\n+Great art.  This is subjective, of course, but if you don't mind the Key/Visual Arts-style GIANT ANIMU EYES, the spritework is great.  The occasional sweeping vista of fields or mountain lakes look great too.\n+Great writing.  I only recall seeing a few minor typos, and it all read very smoothly over the 7 hour experience.\n+/-  Music and general sound design was competent, but I don't recall anything hugely impressive.\n- This isn't really surprising to anyone that has played a visual novel before, but there are no resolution settings.  You have windowed and fullscreen.  I just played in windowed.\n\nVerdict: if you're looking for a book-like experience and don't mind moe-style eyes, pick this game up.  It's a beautiful story and you'll love all the characters by the end.", "timestamp_created": 1428969703, "timestamp_updated": 1428969738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15326778": {"recommendationid": "15326778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097856674", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465619832}, "language": "english", "review": "Rating: 9.5/10\n- Nice/Sad Music\n- Beautiful Artwork\n- There are no choices/routes in eden.

Some parts were much longer than they needed to be, others were short, small feel of character playfulness, but a brilliant game. Recommended buy, only If you\u2019re interested in visual novels or want to take them seriously as a medium eden.If you have the chance on buying something beautiful. It is tottaly worth it.\n\n__[Extra Info]__\nAnyone looking for an introduction to minori\u2019s works or anyone looking to read one of the most polished VNs will be more than satisfied. If you don't like to read, or you don't like anime, you might not want to jump into the genre of visual novels due to that fact that you paid full price for this. Another fact is  that the great voice acting is kept in the native Japanese that i have heard for a while now. Certainly, if you're a fan of visual novels, check it out.\n\n__[How would i Recommend this game?]__\nFirst thing first, I would recommend this. The artwork that the developers have done to make this game is very beautiful on my opinion, I really enjoy my time to play and listen to the game.", "timestamp_created": 1428865535, "timestamp_updated": 1428972879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.969238", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15326436": {"recommendationid": "15326436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161453353", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506272010}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e90\u81ea\u4e8e\u8d34\u5427\u4e0a\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u7b7e\u540d\u6863\uff0c\u6211\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u6b3egal\u5e76\u7231\u4e0a\u4e86\u5979\u2014sion\uff0c\u5076\u5c14\u4e4b\u95f4\u770b\u5230steam\u4e5f\u51fa\u4e86\u6b63\u7248\uff0c\u679c\u65ad\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd5\u7adf8\u5468\u672b\u4e5f\u901a\u4e86\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u611f\u52a8~\u665a\u5b89sion", "timestamp_created": 1428864040, "timestamp_updated": 1428864090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15318172": {"recommendationid": "15318172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054276897", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428813481}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e1a 9/10\n\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 10/10\n\u0e14\u0e35\u0e44\u0e0b\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23 9/10\n\n\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e44\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01", "timestamp_created": 1428822920, "timestamp_updated": 1428822920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15314873": {"recommendationid": "15314873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036851532", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428798268}, "language": "english", "review": "Prepare to tear up at the very least.

wonderful visual novel with brilliant art and a soundtrack that enhances the reading experience without being too overpowering. Simple details like having the characters blink add a nice touch to an already high quality work. This is by far my favorite visual novel currently (this review was created March 22, 2015) on Steam. The $20 price tag is quite steep, so I would wait for it to go on sale (mine was 50% off). If you're looking for a serious visual novel to start reading, I recommend this.\n\nNotes:\n- Length ~15 hours (assuming you listen to the voice acting)\n- There IS voice acting\n- There are NO choices/routes in eden* (Kinetic Novel)\n- There is VERY LITTLE TO NO fan service\n- This is the regular version of eden. The eden Plus+Mosaic version (not available on Steam) includes added blood to certain scenes and less censoring for certain scenes. It also includes an extra eroge side story that is not part of the main story. In my opinion I would have liked the added blood, but an eroge side story sounds incredibly out of place for this VN.\n- I consider this a serious/emotional visual novel, unlike a VN such as Sakura Spirit. It tries to BE something and succeeds instead of appealing to absurd fan service.\n- Originally released September 18, 2009", "timestamp_created": 1427083490, "timestamp_updated": 1447958801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 203, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926989", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15007460": {"recommendationid": "15007460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117073099", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427008791}, "language": "english", "review": "I laughed,\nI cried,\nI cried more,\nthen went to sleep with a smile, full of positive thoughts....\n\nExcelent kinetic novel, very much recomended.", "timestamp_created": 1427041418, "timestamp_updated": 1427041418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819839", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15007147": {"recommendationid": "15007147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062640898", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502120454}, "language": "english", "review": "Iz my keyboard okay? uhm... okaay i will start first....\n\nBest Visual Novel game in my life (first goes to NEKOPARA huehuehue) \nIts really worth it if u guys buy (i buy this coz i got second version on my computer, it includes H-Scene)\n\nmostly i end the game like 4-5 hours, when it comes to steam, i just copy the saves from second version on my computer and put it on steam files... it works \n\n-The artwork it is like handmade for me, very nice and beautiful \n-The song? dont ask me, its really beautiful that makes me to cry abit.. dammit \n-The storyline? its so god dammmmn beautiful... especially when Sion dies scene, it make crying like a baby and then my mom tells me to shut up LOL xD \n-The second version? hue dont ask me, if you guys complete the storyline... it unlocks the PLUS MOSAIC thing (like bonus stage or something) this where you guys got some H-Scene on Sion, Lavie, Maya and Elica...

Nope.\n\nIs this game worth a read? Yes.\n\nAs expected of a minori game there is quite a bit of effort put into the visuals and music. Also as with a lot of their games the beginning lags a little bit in terms of pace due to heaping on the world building and dialogue but this is to be expected by now. This is a good choice of a minori game to come out on steam, though I'm surprised this came out at all due to how xenophobic they were (in no small part due to a cultural conflict earlier in the millenium that totally had nothing to do with overzealous double-standards feminism and certain nukige(pr0n game) makers).\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\nWell then, lets start with some negatives since I feel like a pessimistic pete today.\nDespite all that world building you hear of in the beginning, the game just ends up throwing you into a completely different place soon after and leaving you there. Admittedly the setting DOES play a large part in shaping the characters, enough that it could be said to be the antagonist itself but why spend all that time talking about the military and the setting if you're going to throw \"perfect murder mystery island\" out that quickly?\n\nTropes are abound in this game. For example, the thousand year old albino loli/petite girl or the bimbo large-cup-size maid or the mentally challenged blonde twin-tails, or the \"I'm vicious but clearly a tsundere\" girl or the stoic gary stu super soldier. I realize you can't perpetually avoid tropes when you write... But this cast. Why? Just why? Did they just throw traits in a hat and draw characters or something?\n\nAs is minori's style the regular dialogue is normal at best, all their charm in their writing seems to  come from their drama. Or it's been like that as far as I know. It hardly needs saying that the large-cup-size yandere girl in natsuzora no perseus(another minori game) is going to have subpar plot compared to terminal illness girl. (Well her \"plot\" is larger.) There was less drama-llama hence it was worsererer.\n\n[b]Positives:[/b]\nOverall tastiness.\n\nOooooo pretty pictures.\n Being a kinetic novel this is essentially the feeling of watching a movie, and minori certainly didn't slouch with CG or the regular character art and backgrounds. As always their opening movies, animation and art are a visual treat.\n\nTenmon delivers the nomnomnom music. BGM isn't shabby either\n\nTasty albino loli.\n\nSad girls and seasonal themes.\n\n[spoiler]This is a tragedy and a pretty predictable one at that but still, it was tragedy done right. It's pretty hard to screw up on tragedy (look at anything by key) but this still delivered in the end.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nThe overarching theme (besides delicious flat chest) would probably be identity. The young man finally finds/reinvents himself and is able to find the best ending that could be had without turning the novel into a classic comic ripoff.\n\nNot bad.\n\n7.8 stereotypical characters out of 10 stereotypical characters.", "timestamp_created": 1426040480, "timestamp_updated": 1426040564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14802351": {"recommendationid": "14802351", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028831024", "num_games_owned": 796, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 655, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425830409}, "language": "english", "review": "I have read and seen a lot of love stories, and this one ranks up there as one of the best.

I wish I'd remembered that it was a Minori game -- I'm not a fan of the company for various reasons. I'm also not the target audience for this particular type of story, as the prospect of romance with Sion is not one I find appealing, so others may find value in this story that I didn't.\nAt a glance, the visuals of eden* are really impressive; they are technically adequate (I like the weathering effects on Elica's old radio, for example), but after a while you start to feel surfeited by the sheer volume of sweeping plains, elaborate vintage mansions, and dramatic winds constantly blowing the characters' hair around even when they're indoors. That's right, instead of static images, mouths move and eyes blink, which is (again) technically cool but also kind of weird. If you leave it on while making a sandwich or whatever, they'll just keep blinking, frozen in time. Spooky. The basic designs of the characters are generic, and everyone looks about half the age they're theoretically supposed to according to the text -- it's unintentionally hilarious when a vaguely teenage-looking dude announces \"I'm not thirty yet\" as if this is news. Of course all the girls have pretty much the same face (then again, that's true for 90% of visual novels, so it's hard to fault them for this). The opening theme is extremely nice, and I've no complaints about the background music or sound effects, which are serviceable enough. Sion's voice actress is the only one I found pleasant to listen to; I am grateful to Minori for including the option to turn off individual characters' voices, as this meant that I didn't have to listen to Lavinia.\nThe story here is that oh snap, the Nibiru people were right and the planet is going to be destroyed. The main character, who absolutely everyone falls over themselves to assure us is Totally Cool and Very Strong and The Perfect Soldier, is suddenly stationed at a remote research facility to act as a guard. It transpires that the reason they needed The Coolest And Strongest And Most Perfect Soldier is that The Smartest And Most Beautiful And Most Perfect Little Girl works at the facility. Apparently most of humanity is either dead from a massive war or in the process of leaving Earth on ships engineered by TSAMBAMPLG, so she is not just the smartest person ever (which she is, because she's the smartest of ALL the genetically engineered smart people), she is also the most important person ever. (Seriously, the other characters refer to her as \"The Messiah\" and literally dream of so much as catching a glance of her. Evidently the writer wanted to make sure absolutely no one missed just how wonderful and special these people are.) In practice, protecting TSAMBAMPLG entails sitting around chatting with several attractive ladies, followed by assassinating the evil spies who are trying to kill TSAMBAMPLG. The story routinely elides scenes that could conceivably be interesting (come on, a fade to black before the welcome party?) and telegraphs future plot elements with such gusto that readers are likely to sigh \"finally!\" when the main character finally figures out whatever was spelled out an hour or two ago. It's like trying to tell Dora that Boots is behind the box with this guy.\nI was told by review after review that eden* had incredibly compelling characters, and so I was a bit put out, to be honest. I didn't find myself empathizing with Ryou at all, and honestly found him incredibly creepy, given the way he becomes obsessed with Sion after talking to her for maybe ten minutes. Sion herself is the \"genius girl with no people skills or self-care abilities\" archetype that can be found in a million other games, including compatriot Steam VN World End Economica; the standard hand-wave of a childlike character actually being super old is in play, because Minori knows very well how to make money hand over fist. Other characters include Elica, a mischievous and slightly ditzy maid (of course) who takes care of TSAMBAMPLG's everyday needs but seems to have a Dark Secret, and Lavinia or \"Lavie\", who is probably one of the most annoying characters I've encountered in some time. There's also the Major, who drinks and hits on civilian maids while on the clock and also has a Dark Secret. I'm used to stories in general at least having some sort of break point or divider when the POV changes, so I was jarred and confused when sometimes Ryou left the scene and the narration sort of hung around for a bit -- telling us what other characters are thinking or doing, often related to how awesome Ryou is -- before remembering that it had places to be and skedaddling back to Ryou without warning.\nIf you hunger for cheesy drama and animu chicks, especially those that are \"totally like a hundred years old, so it's cool\", this game has you covered. (The Clannad comparison made in other reviews seems apt.) There aren't really standing sprites and the overall presentation is supposed to evoke a movie, so it's not that different from watching a film that requires regular mouse clicks to advance. Still, as far as this type of game goes, I'd much sooner recommend Narcissu or Moonshine. eden* is just not for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1425647891, "timestamp_updated": 1425648199, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449115", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14745704": {"recommendationid": "14745704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000907052", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 2191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431839504}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e08\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22 minori \u0e19\u0e33\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e19\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e08\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e34\u0e19\u0e44\u0e1b \u0e21\u0e35\u0e08\u0e38\u0e14\u0e14\u0e36\u0e07\u0e14\u0e39\u0e14\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19/\u0e1f\u0e31\u0e07 \u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e46 \u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e \u0e40\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e20\u0e32\u0e01\u0e22\u0e4c \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e33\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49\u0e25\u0e07\u0e15\u0e31\u0e27 \u0e08\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e08\u0e30\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e17\u0e35\n\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e40\u0e04\u0e22\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e41\u0e19\u0e27\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49\u0e16\u0e49\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e43\u0e08\u0e01\u0e47\u0e41\u0e19\u0e30\u0e19\u0e33 \u0e41\u0e15\u0e48\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e30\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e15\u0e48\u0e33\u0e01\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32 60 \u0e0a\u0e21. \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e08\u0e17\u0e33\u0e43\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e32\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e44\u0e14\u0e49...\n\n\u0e1b\u0e25.\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14 auto \u0e19\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e40\u0e25\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e49\u0e32\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35 \u0e17\u0e33\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e32\u0e40\u0e01\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e44\u0e1b\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e22\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a", "timestamp_created": 1425569314, "timestamp_updated": 1425569314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14741302": {"recommendationid": "14741302", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121480812", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424449587}, "language": "thai", "review": "It not funny", "timestamp_created": 1425541006, "timestamp_updated": 1425541006, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493827", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14722698": {"recommendationid": "14722698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088076230", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425223214}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u6700\u540e\u7684\u604b\u7231\u7269\u8bed\u3002\n\u60f3\u8bf4\u7684\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u5374\u53c8\u4e0d\u77e5\u4ece\u4f55\u8bf4\u8d77\u3002\n\u6700\u540e\u6253\u51fa\u6765\u7684\u4e5f\u53ea\u6709\u8fd9\u4e00\u53e5\u3002\n\n\n\u665a\u5b89\uff0c\u8bd7\u97f3\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1425294846, "timestamp_updated": 1425295431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14711364": {"recommendationid": "14711364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024275465", "num_games_owned": 419, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425227446}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played about 60 or so VNs in my time (some translated, some not) and I find Eden to be up there with some of the best. Probably one of the most striking things about this kinectic novel are the amazing visuals. The animation for the character's eyes and mouths immerses you far more than most VNs. Another great thing is putting the game on \"auto\" mode and displaying it on your HD TV really makes you feel as if you are watching an anime movie rather than simply reading a visual novel. I HIGHLY recommend playing the game this way for the best experience. The characters themselves I thought were quite interesting and deep, although I would have liked to learn more about them. \nThis game goes through a lot of emotions and you definitely go through these emotions while reading. I often empathized with the characters, felt sad when they were sad, or hopeful when something good happened. \n\nNow for the stuff I didn't like too much: this VN is WAY too short. I was actually surprised at how quickly I read through it on auto mode (which is WAY slower than if I would read it myself). I read it in only 6 hours on the slowest mode! I find this to be far too short for a game like this that depends on character development. I actually wanted to learn about the early lives of the Felixes, more about Lavie, and have more interaction with Elica, who I felt needed more screentime (she was REALLY underdeveloped compared to the other characters I felt). \n\nI think if it were even 1/3rd longer, it would be a much better story. Some people actually thought this game was longer, but it's really too short compared to most VNs in the same genre. \n\nThat's really the only glaring problem about this VN. The length. Especially since you are paying $20 for it, although the production values likely ramp up the price a bit which I can understand. \n\nI do recommend getting this game regardless, it's a great story.", "timestamp_created": 1425225553, "timestamp_updated": 1425225553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14690429": {"recommendationid": "14690429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178840455", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 444, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466958361}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u591a\u5c11\u5e74\u4ee5\u524d\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u7684GAL \u5982\u4eca\u5728steam\u770b\u5230\u5fc3\u91cc\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u3002\n\u6b63\u5982\u5f53\u521d\u521a\u5165\u5b85\u4e00\u6837\uff0cEden\u7ed9\u4e86\u6211\u5f88\u6e29\u6696\uff0c \u5b83\u65e9\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u6211\u5fc3\u4e2d\u6c38\u8fdc\u7684\u4e00\u7247\u51c0\u571f\n\u5982\u4eca\u518d\u4e00\u904d  \u4e0d\u4e3a\u522b\u7684 \u53ea\u4e3a\u5f53\u521d\u8ba9\u6211\u6cea\u76ee\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u60b2\u4f24\u7684\u8bd7\u97f3 \n                                                                                      \u8ba9\u5979\u6c38\u8fdc\u5b58\u5728\u6211\u5fc3\u4e2dw", "timestamp_created": 1425125749, "timestamp_updated": 1425125749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14690056": {"recommendationid": "14690056", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119436578", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447922952}, "language": "english", "review": "To be honest, this is the first VN i've read, and probably'll be one of that stucks in my mind.

Or does a person even have to be fully prepared to face problems at all... eden* did a really wonderful answering each question I've thrown up. \n\nI've have to say that the number of VNs I've read can be counted with my fingers alone, but in any case, any good work would deliver perhaps more so to people that still sees something as fresh.\n\nI really liked the style the story presented itself. The players would already know what is going to happen in the end from just the title and the first few minutes of the game. A style that is rarely used but makes what happened at the beginning crystal clear by the end. A story that connected each character it has ever shown to have a significant impact which was truly amazing on how everything can be seen as these keys that slowly but truly opens the door to that one path. \n\nThe story (not giving a synopsis) is a simple one that means that character devolopments is key here. The way eden handled each relationships from family, friends, to even lovers were spendidly done. The lingering thoughts about someone important (aka flashbacks) really just shows the sentimental feeling and happiness from past events.\n\nThe art was stunningly beautiful especially with the scenes showing nature in its full glory.

"This Visual Novel... is a masterpiece... I have to say it is 100% one of my very favorite VNs. The ride of feelings and emotions you go through as you begin to understand the characters and care for them in your own way. Most other VNs I've gone through barely scratch the surface on emotions... and I can't say many things bring me to tears, but this VN accomplished that. I do hate one thing about it though... that I can't play it for the first time again.\n\nTrying to not spoil anything is very hard, as I want to just write all about it in this review, but I will restrain myself, of course. You MUST experience this, it is well worth the $20. It should be worth $40 in my opinion. \n\nThe soundtrack is wonderful, I find myself listening to some of the tracks back to back just because they are so awesome to listen to. The voice acting is incredible, the voices fit the characters nicely and not to mention, they animated the lips/mouths while they speak, which is rare.\n\nBe ready for the roller coaster of emotions... including rage, hate, the want for revenge, happiness, sadness and most of all, the Love that 2 people can share that could overcome anything. Seriously... I can't get anymore detailed without giving some plot away... Do not pass up this story, it would be a shame for you to miss it.\n\nEdit: I also don't write reviews on most anything, the fact that I took the time to do so for this VN should say something!", "timestamp_created": 1424245587, "timestamp_updated": 1424245777, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14522391": {"recommendationid": "14522391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104003565", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 853, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506530998}, "language": "english", "review": "This novel taught me two lessons.\n\n1) I'm soulless b**ch.

In fact, this is just a story, and it's a damn good one too.\n\nLike holy.... I just finished this entire series after 8 hours and I feel like my heart's been ripped out.  Ok, maybe not that severe, but I thought the story was overall extremely cute.  A very well done visual novel, and I will not spoil anything in the story since that's what you're going to be paying for if you choose to buy this, but in my opinion the story was....\n\nThe story was moderately boring in the beginning, but that's like all animes and visual novel stories because they need  to take a little time to establish the general context of the story, especially since this one starts off somewhere in the middle of someone's life.  So they reflect on the past for a little bit in the beginning, then move on towards the future while working in the present.  Anyways, I didn't feel like any part of the story dragged on for too long, except the end, but that's to be expected since well... you'll know why when you get eden*.  \n\nOverall, 9/10.

I remember seeing it and having a grand amount of breathtaking moments with it. The story itself is fascinating however the route is limited and you are literally following through more of just a one route. Within the game, I fell in love with some of the characters and I do admit the game is great. To me this is a 9/10 work. Reason being is due to the nature of this game being pairing you with one route only. However it leaves much of you to think and as you go about realize a bit more about the characters and the settings. It's really drawn out and I admit playing this again brings back good memories. Now if we had this to come with the others previously over the years. Nonetheless this review is for this game, I recommend it for those looking for a VN with a breathtaking usage of work. Some would average it an 8 but I'll be honest, reading through it reminds me of relatable appreciation you have to some characters. However on buildup the 1 point lacking is routes, reason is we are all playing the same game then with the same result. A fundamental flaw that some many might not believe it to be but let's be honest, it's like seeing the same anime, just people get different views from it. Same with books. Moving on from that there seems a good backstory written to go with it but there seems to be some detachment less noted here which in my opinion could be included.

It should be noted that I'm fairly new to VN games in general, having only played six or seven personally. That being said, compared to those, this blows them out of the water. \n\nFirst off, the story is not only moving and impactful, but long. You don't actuall come across the intro until about 30~ minutes in. That's just a estimate, but it honestly felt the opening came in where other VN closing credits would start rolling.\n\nSecondly, the entire VN is voice acted. Voice acted tremendously well, for that matter. Even the main protagonist has not only a voice, but a face as well.\n\nNot only that, but the art in this game is amazing. At first I thought I was delusional, but every character's eyes and mouths move.

visual novels but enjoyed eden*.  I found the Story to be decent despite some lingering questions.  Spelling mistakes in the english dialogue were pretty minimal and easily ignored.  I didn't have difficulty understanding it for the most part.  \n\nThe Artwork was great although I found male characters to be sloppy compared to female characters.  There were nice touches like blinking eyes and moving mouths.  The mouths unfortunately don't always move during speech and while playing the visual novel in windowed mode the mouth was somewhat unnoticeable for me at times.  \n\nThe Sound was good throughout although you will hear certain tracks (if not all of them) over and over again which can become annoying but the music is good and the voicework while it was abit irritating at a certain point early on it was for the most part solid.\n\nThere really isn't any Gameplay but atleast I could save where I was and continue it later at anytime.  The most you can control aside from that is the flow of the story, window or fullscreen resolution and voicework.  If you just want to sit back and enjoy a story eden* will accomplish that.

I played it trough but of course Steam wouldn't know about it hence my lack of playtime on my profile.\n\nFor those who aren't into Visual Novels:\n\nI'm just gonna go ahead and say if you are a gamer in the sense that you wanna \"play\" with games this game is not for you. Visual Novel are about storytelling (or they should be) so most of the time you just advance the test.\nThis particular Visual Novel is a Kinetic Novel meaning you literally can't do anything during the gameplay. It's like an animated picture book with (japanese) voice acting and background music.\n\nAmong Visual Novels this is one of the best I've ever read so if you feel you might be intrested in a good, heartwarming and bittersweetstory then you have my recommendation. This is one of the finest examples of what Visual Novels can be at their best.\n\n\nFor those who already fans of the Visual Novel genre:\n\nThis is not a nukige. If you just wanna buy it because \"lol it has a lol\" then shame on you!\nIt's a feel-heavy storytelling piece which really deserves it's price. If you will buy just one VN in your entire life then put this game on the candidate list ASAP.\nAs to which version to buy. I have the PLUS+ MOSAIC from the Mangagamer site and after reading trough the game I cannot in good conscience go to the adult content.

Set in the future, the earth is facing its destruction due to causes left largely unexplained. The protagonist Ryou is sent to guard a secret facility. The facility was used to research a new genetically modified form of human with hyper intelligence. These modified 'felixes' were used to research and design the ships to be used to escape the destruction of the planet. The story is told half through flashback about the events surrounding Ryou, and the final days of the doomed planet.\n\nUltimately however the story comes off as somewhat unsatisfactory. Due partially to its nature as a kenetic visual novel. There are no choices, and no options for further reading. The game presents a lot of interesting material, but it is entirely set within either the research facility or the countryside. There is little to no opportunity to learn about the rest of the world. Ultimately this is a love story between the hero and heroine, and the rest takes a backseat with no chance to bring to light anything about the interesting background world. If you like a romance, this is a very good one. But it falls quite flat in other areas. Particularly as the story is actually at its core very simple and straightforward, it could take place in any setting with minor modifications. It therefore doesn't make the best use of the world nor characters it has come up with.\n\nPros:\n\n- Overall well illustrated, pleasing on the eyes.\n- Mostly realistic, likeable characters. No airheads or stupidity here.\n- Decent length; my playtime is slightly inflated, it should take around 6-8 hours to complete.\n\nCons:\n\n- Character illustrations ocassionally off model.\n- Very limited animation, some lip-flap and blinking is the extent of animation.\n- Kenetic story means no opportunity to explore areas of personal interest.", "timestamp_created": 1422789490, "timestamp_updated": 1422790129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573838", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14274997": {"recommendationid": "14274997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163831796", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1422853915}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u597d\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1422778707, "timestamp_updated": 1422778707, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14274818": {"recommendationid": "14274818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056243458", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1423396344}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautifully illustrated VN.\nThe music fits it so well, it set the perfect mood for many scenes.\nEven though you were pretty much told how the story would end, for many people, it does nothing to stop the tears from flowing.\n\nGet it while it's 50% off and do yourself a favor.

originally released in 2009 by minori (>inb4 minori is kinda paranoid back then that they sue someone and put region lock protection lel) that tells the story of a skilled soldier named Haruna Ry\u014d and a felix girl named Sion.\n\nThe premise of the story is that in the far future, a huge mass energy called \u201cPlanet of Destruction\u201d suddenly appeares in the sky as a red star. Lots of scientists starting to predict the end of the Earth, but at this point, 100 years before its predicted end, humankind started to feel another big threat - the Earth is dying: terrorist attacks and wars are ravaging badly that it decreased the human population rapidly. After some time passes, a United World Government was formed to prevent any further human destruction. When all the fighting stopped, the remaining humans came up with a plan to escape the Earth. At the same time, people were working on the \u201cFelix Plan\u201d: a plan to create a new technology to bring the remaining humans to a new planet. The story of Eden* begins 99 years later, when the Earth is on the brink of destruction.\n\nMost of the stories were told via flashback and when you start the game for the first time, you could actually tell the ending since this is a kinetic VN. The flashback serves as to what is going on prior to the ending of the game and mostly consist of your SoL of Ry\u014d & Sion.\n\nThe CG and BGM in this game was well done despite its age. The CG has that cold but warm hue to it that kinda adds melancholic feeling to the atmosphere, fitting the setting of what is going on around. I just wished that they did it on a higher resolution as most of the background CG is very calming, lushful and beautiful. The BGM is very well done, with based Tenmon also composing the BGM really gives that special feeling to it that somehow very calming yet at times is paced properly to what is going on around it.\n\nI played the game for the first time on late 2010 and I fell in love with it. It is short & touching yet even though the opening of the game kinda spoiled you the inevitable ending, you still want to stick with it and enjoy the whole story and then cries on in the end :\")\n\nI recommend this VN if you enjoy planetarian and narcissu, it is on the same group cluster of short-but-packed feeling to it. This Steam version of eden* is the All-Age version, you can download the MOSAIC patch from your favorite site and inject it here or get it off MangaGamer store. Also the seiyuu of Haruna Ry\u014d is Toru from Hitsugi no Chaika so if you're kinda pissed of at the ending of Chaika, go buy this, it'll help you get moar Tooooooru satisfication :^)",

visual novel, and I'm really glad it was!  It was a great way to jump into the visual novel genre.  As a kinetic novel, you play through the game like reading a book, with no options for the player to make choices to influence the storyline.  \n\nBut just because the playstyle was hands-off, it didn't lack in other departments.  The graphics are so beautiful - I am really drawn to games that are visually striking, where the art style is detailed and high quality.  This game is definitely gorgeous to look at, which is a major plus because I played the game for close to 20 hours.  \n\nAnother thing I really liked is how the characters aren't static.  On any particular scene, the characters' eyes blink, giving the \"page\" a little extra visual oomph.  The scenes also change slightly every few sentences, making it seem like the characters are moving - a tilt of the head, a turn of the body, movement of the arms - they all add up to make the characters appear fluid when they are actually standing still for most of the game.\n\nThe storyline is a little more militaristic than I expected, but still enjoyable.  Warning!  This novel is a tearjerker!  There are several character deaths, which was very difficult for me to get through. I loved their personalities and backstories, and it was heartbreaking to watch them die.  \n\nDespite the sad parts, I would absolutely play this game again.  The artistry is magnificent, and the characters are intriguing and lovable.  Highly recommended!\n\nHere is a link of my entire gameplay with commentary.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenLevelStart", "timestamp_created": 1422672915, "timestamp_updated": 1433357833,

I'm not usually a fan of heavy military story lines so I was a bit worried but the military setting is rather light and mixes into the main interests of the story seamlesly. \n\nArtwork for the game is absolutly brillant, you can see a lot of work and love went into it. I loved the slight eye and mouth animations.\n\nThe soundtrack is pretty nice. I feel like I didn't fall in love with any of the tracks during my playthrough but I was interested enough to go back and listen to it on YouTube. After having done so, I have found several tracks that I'm actually going to save for later listening.\n\nVA is fantastic! All spoken dialog in the game is voice acted. You also have the option to turn off characters that you don't like. However I doubt you will actually hate any of the voices.\n\nThe UI was a bit confusing at first. I couldn't find the option to save until I accidently moved my mouse to the bottom right of the screen. It keep my eyes on the art and I wasn't distracted but some mention of the location before starting the game would of been nice.\n\nNow I got eden* in a Humble Bundle for $10. I don't think i'd recommend this VN for $20. However if you are interested, there is a demo so you can try before you buy. There's also a 18+ version that you can find online. It adds some nudity and a lot of blood but I don't really feel it's needed.\n\nAll in all, eden* was a great experience!

Although it's a love story, it certainly did not feel that way for the majority of the time I was reading it. It did not feel like the usual cute and cheesy love story that we've been accustomed to in anime culture. It felt like a lot of things, and I'm happy it did. Because the situation presented in its storyline was one that calls for a lot of emotions.\n\nI'll refrain from commenting too much on the storyline. Instead, I'll focus on what it made me feel. What I felt throughout most of the visual novel was a tinge of loneliness. Almost everything past a certain point in the story had made me feel lonely, and even more aware of how separated we all truly are as people. However, loneliness is far from what the visual novel imparts to you by the end.\n\nI'd encourage anyone with spare time to give the game a try. It has a unique concept of using rather theatrical methods in portraying the story at hand, and I believe it worked as well as intended. It was a new experience with how they structured the visuals, and I'd love to experience something like this again. The music was pretty good as well, matching the atmosphere and its transitions. I also liked how the characters developed as the story progressed, and how grounded in reality their process of decision-making was. \n\nFor those who'll be asking about the adult version, there's not much of a difference, really. The adult version has the 18+ scenes in a separate option in the main menu, which you'll be able to access after you finish the main storyline. I'm glad they made these scenes as a sort of what-if scenarios, because I'm pretty sure they'd ruin the solemnity of the storyline if they were inserted somewhere in the middle, especially the scenes of the other main girls which I'm sure were made as a sort of bonus for the fans. In the end, the most important aspect of the visual novel is already included in the Steam all-ages version, so don't hesitate to pick it up. c:\n\nI'm looking forward to more visual novels from minori and mangagamer being on Steam. <3", "timestamp_created": 1515420771, "timestamp_updated": 1515420771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39179920": {"recommendationid": "39179920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213741627", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 368, "last_played": 1516017604}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5341\u5206\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5341\u5206\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u5341\u5206\u63a8\u8350\u3002\n26\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u4e70\u7684\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u6253\u6298\u5230\u4e866\u5757\uff0c\u7b80\u76f4\u767d\u9001\u3002\nminori09\u5e74\u7684\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u653e\u5230\u73b0\u5728\u6765\u770b\u5236\u4f5c\u6c34\u51c6\u7136\u51fa\u4f17\u3002\n\u5c31\u51b2\u7740\u8bda\u54e5\u548c\u5929\u95e8\u7684op\uff0c\u4e5f\u8981\u7ed9\u6ee1\u5206\u3002\n\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u5417\uff0cCG\u91cc\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u662f\u4f1a\u5f20\u5634\u8bf4\u8bdd\u7684\uff0c\u662f\u4f1a\u7728\u773c\u775b\u7684\uff0c\u4ee3\u5165\u611fmax\u6beb\u4e0d\u8fdd\u548c\u3002\n\u4e00\u5929\u4e0d\u770bop\u6211\u8981\u6b7b\u4e86\n\u795e\u4f5c\uff01\n\u795e\u4f5c\uff01\n\u795e\u4f5c\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1515413980, "timestamp_updated": 1515675519, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39166721": {"recommendationid": "39166721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050821024", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 517, "last_played": 1515275492}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow.

Pessoalmente, isso contraria o meu conceito de 'jogo', mas tudo bem. \nFiquei impressionado por ele ter abertura, encerramento e dublagem dignos de animes. Bom, talvez muitos tenham isso, j\u00e1 que esse \u00e9 apenas o meu segundo VN.\n\nVisualmente, o jogo \u00e9 muito bom. Personagens bonitos e cen\u00e1rios muito bem ilustrados, por\u00e9m \u00e0s vezes algumas express\u00f5es faciais ficaram bem esquisitas.\n\nTecnicamente, ele \u00e9 ruim, j\u00e1 que ele opera em uma resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de tela bem baixa, e em tela cheia ele simplesmente estica a imagem e aplica filtro bilinear, tornando um pouco mais amarga a experi\u00eancia de jogar ele em uma resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de tela um pouco mais alta. \u00c9 de se esperar de um jogo de 2009, da \u00e9poca dos DVD-ROMs. \n\nA hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o \u00e9 ruim. Fiz quest\u00e3o de acompanh\u00e1-la um pouco mais lentamente que o meu normal. Em alguns momentos eu me senti levemente envolvido com ela, mas na maior parte do tempo eu achei ela fraca. Ela n\u00e3o conseguiu me prender. \nBom, talvez eu seja t\u00e3o ranzinza a ponto de perder o gosto por esse tipo de hist\u00f3ria.

Ela n\u00e3o \u00e9 t\u00e3o boa quanto eu esperava.\n\nNo mais, esse jogo foi uma \u00f3tima aula de ingl\u00eas, pois aprendi um monte de palavras e express\u00f5es mais complexas que eu n\u00e3o conhecia.\n\nEnfim, queria dizer que esse jogo est\u00e1 longe de ser ruim e que notei o carinho que os desenvolvedores colocaram no projeto, mas pessoalmente acredito que ele n\u00e3o vale os R$ 36,99 que ele cobra. Existem muitos jogos que custam menos que isso e entregam um conte\u00fado mais substancial, e, como n\u00e3o tenho muita grana pra gastar, senti que poderia ter investido melhor esse dinheiro.",

First of all, it's worth stating that this is a  [url=https://vndb.org/g709]Kinetic novel[/url], which is a sub-genre of visual novels that doesn't present any choice at all, there is a single storyline and the only interaction is to read and advance through the dialogues.\n\nThis is will be an opinion-based review, like most of them here, just wanted to make it clear that I will not be objective with this. Also, for the record, this is the first visual novel that I've ever played.\n\nThat being said, I will put it simple, there are three main aspects to consider here: art, music, characters & story (ok, that's four, but characters and story fall into the same block).\n\nThe art is really good, though in-game is not as much good as the opening and promotional video. But that's true also for many other games when comparing the cinematic scenes with actual in-game graphics.\n\nThe music really fits with every scene, there are really beautiful and pleasant music as well as music for tense situations.\n\nAbout the characters I have to say that at least some of them are very generic, but it's really hard to stand out and came with something new nowadays, not matter how you try to setup the character. In its favour it has a good character development through the story.\n\nFinally, about the story itself. All I have to say is that it is a really good story, very touchy and sad. But a bit predictable.\n\nOverall, It's a good VN, but not worth the full price.\n\nNow, what I'm going to say is a bit off-topic but... This would be better told in the form of an anime or a book. In fact, I don't get what's the purpose of Kinetic novels. In visual novels in general, they get rid of most part of the narrative that would be there in a book in favour of the imagery. But, there's a little problem, they won't draw every detail of every scene, instead they draw some generic poses for each character and some specific for important scenes. It implies that there are some scenes that are briefly described by the narrative but the imagery doesn't fully match. And that feels very weird to me.\n\nFor example: the narrative says something among the lines: \"I grabbed her shoulders and asked ...\". There you see an image of a girl, but there is nobody grabbing her, that detail just wasn't drawn, which renders the scene a bit awkward.\n\nI think I would have enjoyed this story better either as a book with full narrative or a full animated movie. Kinetic novels are a step in between the two formats but I just don't see the point. With other novels at least your choices influence the story, which gives them some re-playability and it makes more sense to use this format for multiple storylines.", "timestamp_created": 1515265777,

The art is more than adequate, and there's sufficient animation to make this feel like much more than your run of the mill visual novel. The dialogue if fully voiced, and the actors did a phenomenal job. \n\nFrom other reviews, I've deduced that the story is somewhere north of 6 hours as far as duration is concerned.

In short, it's about the end of the world, guilt, redemption and love, done in a very sincere and natural way.\n\nEven though the art style may look a bit dated by now, the artwork itself is nicely done and diverse. In fact, most sequences look like what you would consider CGs in other VNs. The characters also blink and there is mouth movement when they talk. This might seem like no big deal, but it actually helps making everything feel a lot more alive as compared to other VN.\nThe (Japanese) voice acting is great and manages to carry over all those emotions flawlessly, accompanied by the beautiful music.\n\nIn short, you owe it to yourself to read it, if you care about emotional stories, likeable and interesting characters and a great audiovisual presentation throughout. It may or may not change your life, but the story and characters will most certainly stick with you forever.\nNow where did I put that handkerchief again...?", "timestamp_created": 1519390121,

It is hard to find fault in a story which plays exactly like you know it will play, after all arguing how novelty and originality matter when judging a story is subjective to how much one knows about the genre and the tropes at hand. Eden* constantly plays it safe, never trying to explore unknown territories in an all too familiar and stale genre.\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate it purely as a visual novel, since it uses narrative and graphics techniques which resemble an animated series, with shift in perspective, lip sync, close-up etc. and, given the general (subpar) quality of the narration and the dialogues, we could equally associate it to anime and manga and not lose much in the comparison. The list of works that deal with what Eden* tries to narrate is boundless, and arguably each one of those has greater character and precision, just accounting for the Japanese industry; studio minori does not try in any way to revitalize the formula and instead discards any possibility towards new horizons to get back on the safe tracks of the mainstream.\n\nAre you satisfied with a flat, predictable plot where some music and a few tears shed are enough to stir up a mirror reaction of sadness in you, leaving aside any substance of emotion and with a side dish of unfunny and boring anime clich\u00e9s?

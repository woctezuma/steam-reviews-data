What makes TLoZ's combat distinct from its successors is the combination of a short sword and grid-locked movement. Fights are a unique kind of scramble for position as Link tries to get right up to the enemy to line up hits, without getting into a vulnerable position himself. Swapping the sword for a shotgun is an effective twist on the design that gives Shotgun Legend its own feel despite how it follows Nintendo's design in other places. Because of the gun's wide spread, you still need to get in close to deal the most damage, but the ability to deal decreasing damage at increasing range allows a lot more flexibility in how enemies and encounters can be designed. Shotgun Legend fully exploits that flexibility with some of the more deviously challenging room layouts I've seen in this genre.

Most of the secondary weapons require ammo, that randomly drops from enemies, and can also be bought from some vendor or replenished for free from the occasional ammo station.  Regaining lost \"hearts\" (HP) works the same way - loot drops, vendors, health stations.  As you progress, you also find heart container (max health) upgrades, ammo capacity upgrades, and shotgun upgrades (adding additional pellets to the shotgun blast).  You can switch secondary weapons by cycling through them while playing, or from the inventory screen which pauses the game play so you don't get hurt while picking the best weapon for the current situation.\n\nThe map is open world, littered with monsters and dungeons.  Plenty of secrets in both the map and the dungeons, most of them blocked off by obstacles that require a weapon or item found in the dungeons, so it's best to note down where you come across the (quite obvious) obstacles so you know where to revisit later.   The monsters respawn after you move a few screens away (not sure how many, maybe 4-5), but the cleared obstacles remain cleared.\n\nThe vendor at the starting location has a compass costing 10 coins (drops from monsters).  You should buy it quickly, as it gives your character's relative position on the minimap for both the overmap and the dungeons.  However the actual dungeon rooms/features will not be visible until you find the dungeon's map somewhere inside, and the overmap features will not be visible for quite a while longer.  Again, note taking would be encouraged, though there's no real need to actually draw a square-by-square map of your own like some games pretty much required in ye olden times.\n\nThe game controls great with the Xbox 360 pad, so I never tried the keyboard controls.  One thing to keep in mind is that this is [b]not[/b] a twin-stick shooter.  The only direction you can fire your weapon is the one in which your character is facing, and the only way (as far as I know) to face in that direction is to move in that direction, which adds a level of difficulty when trying to blast nearby enemies without colliding with them and losing health.\n\nThere is a hardcore mode, where you only get the one life and if you die it's Game Over.   I did not even attempt it, considering how many times I died on my play through.  In non-hardcore mode, if you die, you get sent back to the save point.  There is only the one save slot, but that never presented much of a problem to me.  Save points are placed at all dungeon entrances/exits, health & ammo stations, some in-dungeon transitions, and whenever you find an item/upgrade.   If the save is made when your health is too low, reloading it will bump you up to 3 HP or about half your max HP, whichever's greater. \n\nI had a lot of fun in then 5.5 hours or so that it took me to complete the game.  I did miss one passive item and a few ammo upgrades along the way, hunting them down without a guide would probably take another hour or two, and I'm not enough of a completionist to do that.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure why Shotgun Legend still in Early Access - I played it from the beginning to end without encountering any bugs.", "timestamp_created": 1514166758, "timestamp_updated": 1514166758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625784", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38608994": {"recommendationid": "38608994", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988850970", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1514184214}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game for real... it's a taste of old school meeting where I'm from.. as a new world Samurai and a redneck none the less...

I can gladly say that this is not the case with Shotgun Legend, and the game is fully completed, and I haven't encountered any bugs during the four hours that I've played the game.  That being said, on to the review of the gameplay:\n\nLet's start by getting the obvious out of the way.  This game is \"heavily influenced\" by the original Legend of Zelda, to say the least.  That being said, it manages to do something unique with the formula, including some fairly creative powerups and combat strategies.  If you're a fan of the original LoZ, then you should have no problems jumping right into this game.  \n\nWhile there are many similariites between the two titles, Shotgun Legend offers a new take on the Action-RPG combat by equpping the protagonist with a shotgun instead of a sword.  This allows you to attack enemies from farther away, while decreasing the amount of damage you depending on how far away from the enemy you are.  While this might not seem like a huge deal, it complelety alters the way that you play the game because it is no longer a simple hack-and-slash mechanic that you're dealing with.\n\nThe game provides a very basic concept for a story during the intro, but this becomes more fleshed out as you advance and find various notes left around the world that add more to the game's backstory.  All in all, it provides a fairly interesting plot to go along with the basic LoZ exploration concept.\n\nI picked this game up during the Winter Sale for $.49 today, and I honestly didn't have high hopes for it.  Gladly, I have been proven wrong, and have already put 4 hours into playing it.  This is one of those games that you want to keep .playing and advancing in when you start it.  I highly recommend it, and since the game offers trading cards,  you can pick it up for the $.49 sale price, and most likely make back most of, if not all of your money by selling the cards.  \n\nHere's a quick breakdown of the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n- Borrows heavily from the original Legend of Zelda, while paying homage to the same\n- Heavy on exploration- lots of secrets to be found, and doesn't hold you hand throughout the whole game\n- Replacing the sword with a shotgun offers a unique approach to playing a familiar action-rpg\n- Secondary items are creative and help to enhance the different ways in which to play the game\n- Despite being an \"early access game,\" offers a complete game, that seems to be free of any major bugs\n- Very cheap, especially if you can get it during a sale\n- Offers Steam trading cards, which can potentially get you back all or some of the money you spent on it\n\nCons\n- Difficulty spikes with some of the dungeon bosses.  While most are fairly easy to beat after learning their pattern, ther are a couple that really ramp up the difficulty\n- As someone with red/green colorblindness, I sometimes got killed because I failed to see a bat that blended into the background, or because I couldn't tell the differece between a normal enemy or its poisonous (green?) counterpart.\n\n\nAll in all I definitely recommend this game, especially to any Legend of Zelda fans out there.  I've played many ROM hacks of the original LoZ, and this game manages to do what most of the don't- introduces something fresh and avoids becomign stale and repetative.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514095849, "timestamp_updated": 1514095849, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38587019": {"recommendationid": "38587019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025041613", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "last_played": 1514055446}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun.

In this retro 2D RPG, you explore an unfamiliar world that is plagued with evil aliens who are trying to resurrect their leader. As a result, the lands are swarming with the undead and other challenges you must face to get back home. Overall, Shotgun Legend is a great example of a retro RPG done well. Exploration is fun and rewarding, dungeons are challenging, and combat is exciting. \n\n[h1][u]Positive:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Notes are scattered all over the world and provide just enough information for you to figure out what to do next. As such, plenty of exploring is expected and required, but the game isn\u2019t cryptic to the point of frustration. In fact, exploration often rewards you with upgrades. This is a refreshing break from games that hold your hand from start to end. \n[*]Blasting crabs, bats, and skeletons with a shotgun is so satisfying. I also enjoyed the trade-off you have to consider when using a shotgun. The further away you are from your enemies, the safer you are, but you do less/no damage. Whereas if you want to do maximum damage, you must position yourself dangerously close to your foes. Finding the ideal balance is necessary to complete the game, as it is fairly easy to die and somewhat difficult to kill enemies.\n[*]You have a good selection of secondary weapons that have different strengths and weaknesses. This becomes especially fun towards the end of the game, where you can adjust your playstyle and weapon choices depending on the enemies or map design. [spoiler]The banjo made me crack up.[/spoiler]\n[*]All the hidden rooms and locations can be found if you pay enough attention. The cracks in the stones/walls are always clear, and walkable paths, through trees for example, are of a different colour. \n[*]At first I didn\u2019t like that Cedric\u2019s shotgun was placed as a secondary item instead of replacing and strengthening your main shotgun. However, once I started dual wielding shotguns, I felt like a madman on steroids. Very nice. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Negative:[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Very few music tracks; there were only 2 or 3 different tracks, as far as I could tell. As a result, it gave the game an unnecessarily tedious feel. I ended up turning the music off and listening to other songs while playing. I think the addition of tracks that are specific to each area/dungeon would vastly improve the playability of Shotgun Legend.\n[*]In most Legend of Zelda games, the boss at the end of the dungeon requires you to use your newly acquired item to defeat it. This is not the case in Shotgun Legend. I don\u2019t think any boss requires you to use anything besides your shotgun. While I don\u2019t think this is a huge flaw, I would have liked if this was incorporated (perhaps in the next Shotgun Legend game?). \n[*]I think it would be nice if the keys could be remapped, especially for those playing with a keyboard. It would also be great if the player could assign the secondary weapons to specific keys to avoid having to scroll through each item individually.\n[*]The order in which you enter/complete dungeons doesn\u2019t seem to matter much. I didn\u2019t really pay attention to which dungeon I was in and just went with a first-find-first-go approach. There was one situation where I needed the shield generator but didn\u2019t have it yet because I went to the wrong dungeon. I managed to progress by simply tanking shots. I think it would be good to somehow enforce a certain dungeon completing order. \n[/list]\n\n[h1][u]Conslusion:[/u][/h1]\n[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 Surprisingly great[/h1]\n\nIf I were browsing the Steam store, it is very likely that I wouldn\u2019t have taken a second look at Shotgun Legend. Luckily, this game was recommended to me, so I gave it a try. I\u2019m happy to say that I was not disappointed in the slightest. Shotgun Legend was a thoroughly enjoyable experience, so it would have been a tragedy if I simply chose to ignore it. As a Steam community I think it\u2019s important to support the small indie developers that really care about making great games. Without these pioneers we wouldn\u2019t have the opportunity to play such unique titles. Jonathan Tindell did (and is still updating/fixing the game) an excellent job with this game, so I urge you to put your scepticism to the side and try Shotgun Legend. \n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[th][h1]If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/26827738-%27b-Reviews/?appid=241930]curator page[/url] and [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/breviews]group[/url].

I will admit I did get confused a few times so it can definitely be finished in under 3 hours. I did enjoy it and would reccomend it but not at the current price. I payed $1 and if I had payed more than $3 I would not be reccomending it at all.  I understand the developer has put a lot of time into this and when I had a question he replied almost instantly in the forums but even with the last dungeon included this just doesn't feel like a game that should cost $10. \n\nThe game itself was enjoyable and did make me scratch my head a few times but the enenies were lackluster at best. The only enemys that seem to know you're even there are the ones that shoot projectiles. All the others including bosses just randomly move around as if you don't even exist. The Boss battles themselves are way too easy as well. I only found out I was even fighting a boss on more than one occasion after defeating them. I just thought it was a new enemy being introduced. \n\nThe map is basically useless as well in my opinion. It may be more useful if it wasn't the size of a thumnail and introducing  a second map only made things more confusing. I enetered a dungeon at one point that I had already been in but had to turn back because I needed another item. When I returned later I turned back again thinking I had already finished it but that was only becasue the map was completed. An X or something on the map once completed would probably help or just have seperate dungeon maps in each dungeon.

That said it definitely gets the feeling of the original zelda down.  The monsters in the beginning that pop out of the ground to attack are a pain in the butt to kill and I died many times to them before I just gave up trying to kill them and ran on by instead.  Honestly the blobs and skeletons are easier to deal with than the burrowed ones.\n\nAs of the posting most of the dungeons are not very complex, by far the best dungeon is the fish shaped one (number 5).  It is less linear than the other dungeons and makes you solve a maze to get through (albeit a simple one).  The final dungeon was difficult but not impossible and it still allowed for more surprises from the developer.\n\nUsing a shotgun to fight definitely takes some practice because of the random spread and how it doesn't knock enemies away like swords do in other games.  However the shotgun mechanic creates a good risk/reward situation everytime you engage an enemy.  Another good thing to see is that the NPCs will defend themselves if you attack them.  And it will hurt when they fight back.\n\nWhen I have seen problems with the game, the developer was quick to fix any issues like crashes or problem areas.  For example I commented that when you get a rim fragment it shouldn't teleport you to the entrance of the dungeon becuase there might still be things in the place you need to collect.  So he fixed it almost the next day.\n\nI know this review seems to be scatter brained but that's probably becuase I just need to improve my writing.\n\nSome improvements I recommend if the developer has time and resources to do them.\n[list]\n[*]-Most dungeons could use a few more updates to make them harder to solve.  Not by adding more enemies but forcing the player to think more about how to get through them instead of the linear setup for most underground areas.\n[*]-Leave more clues in the world about the background story.  It's an action game and story isn't critical but it can add more appeal if you have time.\n[*]-Add more hidden areas in the overworld.  Not necessarily for more equipment (unless you want to) but maybe some collectibles you can get an achievement for.\n[*]-Maybe include an in-game timer for people that want to speed run the game.  You can show the time for completion after the credits and end story dialog.  Just have the time start when you first appear on the map and then end just as you trigger the ending dialog.\n[/list]\n\nI really recommend this game.\n\n*edited to add bullets and update critiques as changes were made.", "timestamp_created": 1505806693, "timestamp_updated": 1513484489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35057466": {"recommendationid": "35057466", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025967342", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505792970}, "language": "english", "review": "I would put this on par with the original legend of zelda.

Not sure whether I should just suck that one up though...\n- Final Dungeon location is not immediately obvious, nor was the hint to its location (which I never found, but was told about)\n- Grid-based movement is a little cumbersome when fighting enemies in tight corners, but not sure how you could get around this.\n- Some respawn locations are right on top of enemies, so when you restart with three hearts, unless you are moving and shooting immediately, you often lose some health.\n\nOther than that, a very enjoyable title, and one I fully intend on playing again when it has been finished!\n\n\u0b67\u0f3c\u0ca0\u76ca\u0cb0\u0cc3\u0f3d\u0b68", "timestamp_created": 1499992102, "timestamp_updated": 1499992102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33315128": {"recommendationid": "33315128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053779952", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 174, "last_played": 1514315615}, "language": "english", "review": "i dont alway support idea game that look like it made by older game but i say this is ok. i do enjoy this even it is a rip off of older game. it still fun to play.", "timestamp_created": 1499355238, "timestamp_updated": 1499355238, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.451505", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33259483": {"recommendationid": "33259483", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989126693", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500930620}, "language": "german", "review": "Wer kein Problem mit der Grafik hat und das erste Zelda oder \u00e4hnliche Spiele mochte, dem wird wohl auch dieses Spiel gefallen.

This game feels and behaves just like you'd expect a Legend of Zelda shooter to!  It's awesome fun, and a lot of that fun, much like an old school Zelda classic is exploring the world, the dungeons, and figuring out how to best defeat all the different monsters and bosses that you will encounter.\n\nFinding new weapons and items is super fun as well, and even how best to use them in ways you might never expect to open secret walls and doors is much more exciting than you might expect a game with graphics this retro to be!\n\nIt's pretty hard to grade this game really precisely without knowing how many hours of content it will deliver, but at a $10 price tag I feel pretty confident in my first impressions video scoring where I calculated a whopping 89% score for this game, even considering what some may thing is expensive for this kind of a game!  I also give it a high recommend, especially to those of you who enjoy an old school game with classic gameplay that this game delivers in abundance!  \n\nHigh praise to the developer!

If so, I think you'll be mostly pleased with Shotgun Legend as it clearly pays homage to the original Legend of Zelda on the NES - albeit with some changes to suit the more gun-based weaponry system.\n\nThe main cons that I can think of - if I'm being purely nitpicky is that the shotgun often feels like it doesn't have a set damage due to the spread of the pellets. Sometimes you'll one shot kill an enemy. Another time the same enemy will take four shots because the crab keeps piroetting out of the way of your shots while you're low on health and don't really want to tempt fate by running up and shooting him directly in the face. Movement also felt a little floaty at times - it doesn't feel like it has weight to each step like Zelda does. \n\nStill if you're coming into this for a Zelda-like experience you're gonna find items. You're gonna fight bosses at the end of a dungeon and get a heart container. There's a vague plot in the background that you can almost completely ignore if you're more worried about just shooting things. Overall I'd recommend it for the intended audience.\n\nAt the time of this review I completed four dungeons - and since the game asks you to review the game at the end of dungeon three I figured I'd do it ... even if putting a declaration of wanting steam reviews in the game itself is a bit too mobile game-esq for my tastes.", "timestamp_created": 1515842280, "timestamp_updated": 1515842280, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39265348": {"recommendationid": "39265348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143529190", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 177, "last_played": 1515550477}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a nice game.

Here's a summary of what I mentioned or possibly glossed over in my video review. I'll avoid spoilers here unless you want to watch my full review, which there are spoilers in that one:\n\n-The audio design was great. The quiet ambience really fit a good chunk of the time, subtle musical moments were appreciated to break the silence, not everything relied on screamers for jumpscares.... nice job! It had me at the edge of my seat almost the whole time.\n\n-The gameplay was way more involved and had more variety than what I first anticipated. Between meta moments and files appearing out of the blue, it certainly made the experience engaging. I have very little gripes with the gameplay other than a puzzle or two.\n\n-The characters were executed pretty well, both in behavior and design choice. This is why I always say that simplicity can work just as well as complexity, because this game exists and did it so well.\n\n-The scares... I've never been so apprehensive to move around in a game until this came along. The majority of them are built up greatly to where they don't have to rely on something cheap.\n\nIndeed, I was scared. Playing in the dark certainly built up tension, having to listen really distorted noises just sent shivers down my spine, and the sense of dread was very much present.

reservations. It wasn't bad enough to warrant a negative review, and honestly, I wish there was a neutral selection, because that's how I feel about it. This game's overall story is cryptic, but I interpreted it as a murderer being haunted by his victim's restless soul and enduring a tinge of self-loathing for having committed the crime. The game feels like the murderer trying to come to terms with it. I probably totally misinterpreted the creator's vision, but I still found the storyline interesting.\n\nTo the gameplay itself!\n\nFirst off, here are the positives:\n\n+The gameplay mechanics are unique. It reminded me of Pony Island, to an extent.\n+Her is legitimately creepy (yes, that's grammatically correct).\n+Strangely, the silence is unnerving. Coupled with the pixellated environment, I find it oddly scary. It's possible that this game just brought back memories of playing the first Slenderman game (which looked a lot like this).\n\nNegatives:\n\n-Huge reliance on jump scares. If I felt any degree of dread while playing this game, it was just in anticipation of cheap jump scares, which isn't truly scary. So, instead of being scary, it's often just startling.\n-Chase sequences galore. That's fine, but I hate that the game crashes every time you're caught. That's not a glitch, either; it's by design. Restarting the game doesn't take long, but it's incredibly annoying. I'd be fine with dying and being sent back to the last save point.\n-Super tedious to play through. The game purposely crashes or forces you to quit so often that I started getting pissed off. I'm sure somebody out there loved this aspect, but I just found it annoying.\n\nOverall, the creator's attempt to create a truly unique gaming experience trumps the negativity in this review. I endured, and I'm glad I did. There were a lot more \"Oh, that's kind of cool\" moments than there were \"God damn it, this is annoying\" ones.\n\nAlt + Tab is your friend, by the way.", "timestamp_created": 1514577973, "timestamp_updated": 1514577973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38824014": {"recommendationid": "38824014", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334278509", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515857944}, "language": "english", "review": "The Game Is Spoopy, As In Actually Spooky, Not Fnaf Spooky, Well Most Other Horror Games Focus On The Jumpscares Over The Gameplay IMSCARED Has More Puzzles Than Jumpscares, With Some Of The Jumpscares Being Subtle For Example [spoiler] In Chapter 2, Theres A Part Where You Have To Walk In A Room (The Main Menu) Down The Hall You Have Two Options To Your Left, A Locked Door If You Go To The Locked Door When You Turn The Corner You See A White Hand Thing (And I Think Some Noise) [/spoiler] The Game Gives You Limited Vision So You Cant See Everything Thats Coming And Pretty Much Have To Walk Into Things To See Them, Which Makes It Sorta Scary When You Walk Straight Into A Painting Or The Enemy, The Game Also Crashes And At Points Forces You To Close The Game, Which Will Usually Progress The Game (Unless You Died, In Which Case Youll Be Put Back At Your Save) And There Arnt Really That Many Jumpscares With Loud Noises And Stuff But Rather Just Small Jumps From Making Mistake [spoiler] In The Tag Level,\n Your Being Chased By White Face, But The Limited Veiw Makes It So You Can Only Really See Him When Your Right Next To Him [/spoiler]\n\nOverall, Great Game, Great Atmosphere, Half The Time Your Scared By Anticipation Rather Than The Jumpscares Themself Showing Theres Nothing To Fear But Fear Itself", "timestamp_created": 1514563878, "timestamp_updated": 1514563878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38811702": {"recommendationid": "38811702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296268463", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517714944}, "language": "english", "review": "Pixel + Horror = Best Game\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1514538437, "timestamp_updated": 1514538437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38806267": {"recommendationid": "38806267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098492236", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514523201}, "language": "english", "review": "IMSCARED is an experience.

It scared me really good.\nNow it's 2017 and I have played lots of horror games and must say that only a few still manage to actually scare me.\n\nThe steam version of IMSCARED being one of these few. The graphics, due to having so many dark corners and places that are only revealed if you go towards them, create a creepy atmosphere. The sound design definitely adds to that. The fourth wall breaks are awesome and mess around with you (and with your computer). The puzzle design is very well done and fun and I like how it's integrated into the fourth wall breaks.\n\nOverall the steam version is much longer than the gamejolt version. You'll roughly need 3 - 3.5 hours to finish it which makes the price fair in my opinion. Obviously you can also just wait for a sale. A fair warning: There's a point of no return and if you want to get all achievements you should do that until then. Some people are complaining that you can't just easily replay the game again, so keep that in mind. \n\nThis is what some people see as a negative point. In my opinion it makes the game even better. The only negative thing that I have to say is that it's annoying to sometimes get stuck on edges, but that's pretty much it.\n\nIMSCARED is a little horror gem, that I absolutely loved to play again after 5 years. It's an awesome horror game, that I absolutely recommend, especially if you like intelligent and fourth wall breaking games.", "timestamp_created": 1512002401, "timestamp_updated": 1512002481,

Attempts to capture that magic in an actual game don\u2019t tend to work out, though. It\u2019s one thing to hear a story and imagine the reality of it, and another entirely to play through a simulation of that story yourself. We\u2019re getting into brain-frazzling meta-narrative territory here but that\u2019s where IMSCARED hails from, that kitschy gray area that tries to convince you it\u2019s a haunted video game with a completely straight face. And despite the chunky sprites and awkward controls, it actually works. In fact, it might be because of those low-rent features that it works.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in delving into the plot here, because it\u2019s the kind that only means anything once you seek it out and see it for yourself. IMSCARED is very up-front about being a haunted video game; it doesn\u2019t pretend to be one thing and then turn haunted, it simply is what it is. Before you begin, the game even warns you that it will try to trick you, and also that it will create files on your desktop that relate to the game. Then you start out in a low-res approximation of an apartment with a door labeled EXIT that \u201cneeds a heart in order to open it\u201d. From here you\u2019re off to explore inexplicable hallways, mansions, hedge mazes, and other places all while trailed by an off-putting presence called White Face.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that weird shit is afoot, and you\u2019re going to get creepy moments of being watched and chased right from the start. You might think that a game that looks like a Commodore 64 trying to run Wolf 3D would be too ugly to be scary, but you\u2019d be wrong. IMSCARED uses every part of its retro presentation to the fullest, throwing up oppressive fog and harsh transitions and unsettling sprite ghosts at just the right moments to make you jump. The sound design is a huge stand-out here as well, doing work with unnerving ambient tracks and little sound effects at, again, just the right moments. The pacing here is the real MVP, spacing out scares so that just when you think you\u2019re clear, something gets right through your defenses.\n\nAll of this is accomplished without screamers or cheap jumpscares, either. The worst I\u2019ve been rattled has been from unexpected scene shifts or just the digital apparitions catching up to me during chases. Something about how brazenly the game leans into being a haunted house of a title makes the spooks work that much more, as if some small part of me is willing to believe these strange sprites actually have some malevolence behind them. The out-of-game elements deserve a lot of credit here as well, starting with notes that flesh out the story and then moving on to key files and YouTube links necessary to progress. They give the game a real-world presence which builds on that same urban legend motif that works so well. The game also does one particular thing here that I won\u2019t spoil, but is absolutely brilliant and caught me completely off-guard.\n\nIt\u2019s not a straight shot through the game by any means, in large part because of these external gameplay elements. A large part of the game is quitting out (or being kicked out) at certain times, only to return to a different segment. Sometimes you\u2019ll be prompted to enter text that determines where in the story you\u2019ll end up, or you\u2019ll need to do something to those additional files that changes something in the game. As good as this structure is for selling the dangerous, unstable atmosphere of the game, it can make progressing past certain parts rather confusing. The further you get into it the more difficult the puzzles are to solve and the harder the items are to find as well, so be prepared for a precipitous learning curve over a very short time if you want to see everything this one has to offer.\n\nThe game is roughly split into three acts, with a \u201cproper\u201d ending for each. Getting the final one requires you to get all the achievements and follow some pretty thin puzzle logic, something I haven\u2019t managed to do yet. But the journey so far has been plenty interesting, engaging, and above all, terrifying. I did not expect this game to get me as good as it did but I got to a point where I dreaded playing it, dreaded walking down darkened halls, and dreaded turning around every time it would taunt me with \u201cI\u2019m right behind you\u201d or the like. IMSCARED understands horror, understands what makes people look over their shoulder in the real world, and builds itself around those notions to terrifying effect. It\u2019s a an indie horror gem, a short one and a rough one, but one that should not be missed.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Not because I don't like the game or because I don't have any strong feelings for it, but because it's so difficult to sell what's so good about it without also spoiling the very magic you're trying to praise. So brace yourself for an incredibly vague read; charting the virtues of a game whilst also avoiding any meaningful details of it in the process.\n\nEurgh...\n\nBy now, hearing the words \"a first-person horror game on Steam\" typically elicits a weary sigh or some heavy eye-rolling as the most horrifying thing about them will be the prospect of actually having to endure their insultingly abysmal content. But the thing that makes IMSCARED different from all the \"me, too\" genre fluff is it values atmosphere and thoughtfulness above cheap jump scares and poor attempts at sensationalism. This is the thinking-man's horror game.\n\nActually, I say horror, but first and foremost it's more accurate to call it a puzzle game based in a psychological horror setting. It's a game that's never abundantly clear, and always leaves you guessing. In fact, from the very start, it states that it intends to deceive you whenever possible, and it absolutely lives up to that declaration. It operates on levels beyond what's merely contained within the game and will cause you to pause often as you try to figure out your next step and apply the solution.\n\nThere are hints of a story, but it's never explicitly stated, and in a way could probably be considered one of the biggest puzzles of the game as information is gradually drip-fed to you throughout the various everyday (and sometimes otherworldly) environments you'll explore. Aesthetically, it closely resembles - and I think largely tries to ape - games like the original Doom, but also draws heavy influence from another genre masterpiece, Silent Hill.\n\nAs with the best horror games, the thing that most unsettles you isn't the blood and gore or the scary monster jumping out at you - it's the anticipation that gets you; the moments in between where your mind is doing most of the work and your worst enemy is really your own imagination. This is where the game excels, and I think strikes a near-perfect balance of building tension before delivering some kind of release in one way or another.\n\nI do have to make one pretty major criticism, though. It's all but impossible to say without \"spoiling\", so I'm just going to say it... The game likes to close itself a lot. And I don't mean it crashes, I mean, at certain points the game will just shut down before having to be opened up again. And, actually, quite a lot of the time you'll need to do this manually to progress. The first few times I had to do it I thought it was a really clever and interesting novelty. But by the end of the game, when I was closing it over and over again every couple of minutes, I was thoroughly done with the concept; a classic example of a really great idea being overused and losing all of its impact, and, eventually, its good will. As a result, while I'm very glad that I played this, at the same time, I'm almost just as glad that I never have to play it again.\n\nIt may only take a couple of hours to complete, and the asking price may be a little questionable for some? (though I personally think it's fine), but even with its increasingly flawed progression mechanic, I still think this is a title worth experiencing that offers something genuinely unique and stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of its genre peers.", "timestamp_created": 1497190877, "timestamp_updated": 1497190877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793901", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32327391": {"recommendationid": "32327391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035599199", "num_games_owned": 1231, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497127628}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't recommend this enough.

You can download and play the free version of [u]IMSCARED[/u] where you will only be able to play Chapter 1. If you like it enough to want to play the actual complete version of the game, buy it here. The only downside is that you [i]will[/i] have to replay Chapter 1 once you purchase it. Otherwise, stop reading about this game now, buy it, and take it from there. The reason I say this is because [u]IMSCARED[/u] is an indie metahorror game that plays like a blurry fever dream. It's a niche addition to an already obscure and underplayed sub-genre of horror adventure games that might mess with people's standards of what to expect from an adventure horror game. \n\n[u]IMSCARED[/u] is a metahorror fever dream that has you as the protagonist. It creates a desktop folder where it will upload .txt, .htm .config files that you will have to read and alter in order to progress throught the game. It's an incredibly ingenious game that will have you oscillating between the game, the desktop folder and whatever links [i]it[/i] has you follow. If you stick around the end credits you will see one of the creators decided you claim anonimity through the witty pseudonym of \"you see? you can do so much with so little\" (or something like that). I think that's cute and funny. But most importantly, purposefully or not, I think that illustrates the core philosophy of [u]IMSCARED[/u]. The sound was created using FL Studio 10, the game itself was made with the help of GameJolt and the graphis are pixelated! Yet, this game manages to produce crips and jarring sound effects that, if played with the volume on mid/high, will undoubtedly scare you. Despite utilizing the one of the 'lowest' forms of visual illustration, it manages to craft cozy and interesting levels filled with inexplicable nostalgia and mystery. \n\nFurthermore, where [u]IMSCARED[/u] shines is through its script. The .txt files the game creates in your desktop folder comprise an apocalyptic log that compliments the eerie sense of being watched by [u]White Face[/u] throughout the whole game. [quote=author]There is a way to turn an entity into data. They have a life of their own, and it is difficult to disntinguish them from normal computer files. In our actions of everyday, while we sit at the computer, this byte entity observes us, and studies our every move and fear.[/quote]This is one of the first messages [u]IMSCARED[/u] creates in your computer and it is oddly profound for a pixelated game. A philosophical question at heart, admittedly fiction at the moment, but engaging to ponder. That is the main premise of the game --consciousness transferred into data-- and it executes it fairly effective for its medium.

It\u2019s \u201cmeta\u201d and it\u2019s spooky. I can see how the designer was aiming to create a unique experience, and I commend him for this, but in the end I think he was only partially successful in the execution of his goal and in creating a game I wanted to play. I ended up just watching my friend play through most of it and if it was only me I would have given up before I finished. \nMy thoughts (very mild spoilers ahead):\n\n* The meta-puzzles (puzzles which require you to look outside the game itself) are clever and out of the ordinary.  \n\n* The more traditional puzzles are all pretty simple. The answer is usually obvious although sometimes you might have a hard time because of the game controls or because you can\u2019t find something. \n\n* For the most part the game succeeds in creating an eerie atmosphere. The sound, the way the environment looks, the creepy messages and enigmatic characters\u2026.\n\n* As others have pointed out, part of the scare factor is a result of your annoyingly small field of vision. You can only see like five feet in front of you so it\u2019s easy to run into something surprising. \n\n* Related to the limited field of vision, the game has a lot of jump scares. These are fun at first but get old fast, especially if you are caught by the monster and have to replay the same part again and again. This is frustrating; but more than that it can destroy the scare factor.\n\n* The controls! You need to use the WASD keys to move around (this alone is almost a deal breaker for me) and the game is not very responsive, so your movements are jerky. It\u2019s also easy to get stuck in a corner or at the edge of a wall (this is  just a result of poor game design/programming). It\u2019s particularly frustrating in parts where you\u2019re being chased and need to run.\n\n*The graphics and the environment: I have mixed feelings. I see what the designer was going for with very basic, very retro graphics. The game\u2019s look reminded me of EGA computer games and also the LSD: Dream Emulator on Playstation. So this gives the game a dream/nightmare vibe and it fits well with the \u201cdeconstructing the game\u201d aspect of IAMSCARED. On the other hand, this really goes beyond artfully pixelated and sometimes just feels insufficiently detailed (get close enough to something and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s just colored blocks). \n\n* More than the graphics, I disliked the low level of interactivity. 90% of the objects you see (bookcases, cabinets, tables, shopping carts) are just decoration you can do nothing with. You\u2019ll spend a lot of the game going up to things and trying to interact with them only to find out \u201cnope.\u201d\n\n*Related to the simple puzzles and the static non-interactive environment, there are a lot of times when it seemed like I reached a dead-end and needed to do something (like find a key or a secret passage or something) but the answer was that I needed to trigger something like a \u201ccut scene\u201d and then when I came back the way would be clear.\n\n*The story: again mixed feelings. In the game you\u2019ll encounter one or two important characters. You\u2019re given vague hints as to what their story is, but it\u2019s left pretty fuzzy. On one hand, this is good because you need to fill in the blanks yourself and it\u2019s open to interpretation. On the other hand, maybe there\u2019s just not enough there.\n\n*That leads into my final gripe which is that there\u2019s no pay off. Towards the very end, the game throws up such a barrier it\u2019s almost like the designer doesn\u2019t want you to finish the game. And the ending(s?) are kind of anti-climactic; it made me question whether it was even worth it.  \n\nTL;DR: All-in-all, if I put aside the annoying controls, I\u2019d say I got something out of IAMSCARED and enjoyed the unique meta-puzzles but so many things frustrated or bored me that I would never have finished the game on my own.", "timestamp_created": 1484986825, "timestamp_updated": 1484986875, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29363355": {"recommendationid": "29363355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115202702", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492206201}, "language": "italian", "review": "[h1][b]IMSCARED[/b][/h1]\n\nIMSCARED \u00e8 un gioco di esplorazione in prima persona di un mondo 3D pixelloso(?) dove non tutto \u00e8 come sembra!\n\nNon so di preciso come descrivere questo gioco...\nLo sviluppatore ha davvero pensato fuori dagli schemi in quanto il gioco non rispetta i meccanismi \"tradizionali\"!\n\nNon voglio spingermi molto con gli spoiler, diciamo solo che dovrai chiudere/aprire il gioco pi\u00f9 volte per poter procedere con la storia e ogni tanto controllare il desktop [:\n\nChe dire, \u00e8 un gioco che dovrete giocare \"alla cieca\", senza sapere nulla...\nPerdereste tutto il divertimento a cercare delle guide!\n\nIl costo \u00e8 basso, il che direi che \u00e8 un'aggiunta [:\nUna cosa che posso dirvi \u00e8 che le ore di gioco registrate da Steam non sono del tutto veritiere per motivi che scoprirete giocandolo.\n\nSenza altri indugi, il mio consiglio \u00e8: giocatelo e dategli una chance!", "timestamp_created": 1484859667, "timestamp_updated": 1484859667, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494382", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29351954": {"recommendationid": "29351954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198323517416", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 696, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513894353}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most iconical horror games out there.

To do so I've made an example, just for you...[/i]\n\n[i]There is a way to turn an entity into data.[/i]\nImscared is a meta-horror video game that engages you as a player with the game and its world. The game communicates with the player breaking the fourth wall, giving them hints and throwing obstacles along the way and it does so by creating text files in a folder on player's desktop.\n\nThis is what I like to call the \"experience video game\". It may shock and fascinate you on the first playthrough more than many other games though its replayability factor is quite low.\n\nVisual design of the game reminds me of video games back from the PlayStation One era though more pixelated and way less colorful. It plays a big role in what atmosphere is perceived by playing this game.\n\nThe scare aspect of the game is one of its upsides. Surely, you will get more or less subtle jumpscares every now and then but the fear is captured through the tone of the levels, the ambients and the character design of the \"evil entities\". It will keep you afraid and uneasy on every step you take and that's what horror games are supposed to do.\n\n[i]When in danger, RUN[/i]\nThere will be times where the game will change its rules making it impossible to use the tactics you probably would resort to otherwise in distressing situations.\n\nYou may want to play this game having offline status on Steam. You will need to restart this game. A LOT! Your friends might be concerned/annoyed with the notifications. ;)\n\nMovement and collision in this game are quite picky and somewhat clumsy (perhaps in attempt to extort the feeling of helplessness?). When you're crouching you're moving way slower backwards and you can't move sideways. Maybe that's how it should be but it was very irritating to me personally having conflicting habits from First Person Shooter games. Objects' hitbox is inconsistent. You can easily clip with certain objects and navigating inside a tight corridor might be tricky since there is a tendency of this game that will require you to move away from the wall instead of sliding along it so you don't stick to it.\n\n[i]Follow my instructions: don't let the game's appearance deceive you from now on.[/i]\nIf you come across this game being on sale - don't hesitate. It's an amazing experience that will make you scratch your head in confusion, make you afraid and most importantly you will have fun with it.

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476063718}, "language": "english", "review": "IMSCARED started as a small indie project that was available for download over the course of its beta period. After the game became more refined and was eventually completed, it found its way on to Steam in early 2016. Gamers that may have played the title in its beta stage are in for a treat, as it has changed quite a bit since its early days. So for old players, there's something new, and for new players, well... you're in over your head; you may want to turn back before it's too late.\n\nYou may be thinking that this title looks like crap. Well, you're not wrong. Visually, it's like playing Resident Evil or Alone in the Dark from the first Playstation in first-person mode. The edges are jagged, it's blocky, it's pixelated to the point that text can be hard to read, and it only runs at 40 FPS. But looks, well they're not everything as any good gamer should know. The extremely limited view distance enhances the atmosphere of the game, making it all the more tense and suspenseful. There's also no real soundtrack to speak of, rather the game relies heavily on sound effects; this is a hard stunt to pull off, but in this case it works wonderfully.\n\nIMSCARED is a horror game like no other. You may think that you're playing it, but in reality it's playing you. It's a game that's often mistaken for a virus (which it isn't, it's impossible for a game downloaded directly from Steam to contain one) due to the fact that it monopolizes your computer; it'll open new browser tabs, create new folders and text files, and even feign the dreaded blue screen of death. It wants you to think it's a virus. It's deceitful, a liar, it antagonizes you, it dares you to keep playing it despite its repeated on-purpose crashing. It's a horror game that truly messes with your mind, not only in atmosphere and gameplay, but in the actions that it performs outside of the game. It'll stay in your head even after you're through with it... because you're not done with IMSCARED until it's done with you.\n\nSo by now you're probably wondering what you actually do in this game. I'm trying to tread lightly because I'd hate to spoil this title for anyone, and if I give a basic outline it'll sound like a key finding simulator. IMSCARED is a very hard game to describe without ruining the experience. Sure you find keys and open doors, solve little puzzles here and there, but the further you go along in the story, the more the game plays YOU. False endings, fake crashes, purposful glitches, it's all part of the psychological screw-with-you mechanic that makes this title so absurdly special.\n\nThere are only two things wrong with this entire event, and the first one is a very complicated puzzle near the middle of the game. There's a part involving some gramophones and the objective is to run around and shut them off; all the while being pursued by one of the antagonists. You must use audio clues to help find the direction to go to find the gramophones, but it's really difficult to decipher and usually you're led to a dead end. This puzzle is more frustrating than it is fun, and it was almost the end of my stint with the game. The second is that you must have obtained all of the achievements except one before proceeding to the final stage. The backtracking can get annoying, and I'm sure my friends were sick of seeing \"Belphegore is playing IMSCARED\" pop up every couple of minutes due to what had to be done to go back to obtain some missing trophies.\n\nOther than the two downfalls of IMSCARED, it truly is one of the most unparalleled horror games to come to life in recent years. As far as I know, there's really nothing else out there quite like it, and it'll really leave you guessing until the very end; beware, it may not really be the end and there may be more that you've yet to uncover! It would be out of this world to see a follow-up to this title, or anything else from this developer at all. He definitely has a creative and artistic mind that thinks way outside the box, and it's amazing that this game was made using so very little tools. If you really want a horror game that'll completely blow your mind, you absolutely have to play IMSCARED.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]5.0/5.0[/b] - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1476065583, "timestamp_updated": 1513693558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616751", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25938857": {"recommendationid": "25938857", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236177010", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504224309}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best horror game i have played!

In other words, no, it is not so scary that you wake up your family with a scream-swear. Instead you just enjoy a refreshing cold sweat and a slight sense of bewilderment as to why you are forcing yourself through this game.\n\nBaseline, it's a good game in itself.

It's the kind of game that makes you think you're playing the role of a character, but the game actually makes it feel like it's trying to interact directly with you, the player behind the screen.\n\nAnd it's exactly for that reason that the game manages to be so disturbing. I won't spoil the actual mechanics the game uses to interact with the player, but I can say it'll catch a lot of people by surprise - and often. It constantly tricks the player into thinking he/she has accomplished something or that they've finished the game, only to then reveal something new.\n\nThe only flaw I've found in the game is movement. While the actual controls work as intended, it's easy to get stuck at walls, which can be a problem when you're trying to run from something. Also, for some reason, you can't strafe when crouching.

It will fiddle with your mind and manage to dig a place in your memory. Absolutely recommended unless you can't stand retr\u00f2, low resolution graphics, especially considering the budget price.[/h1]\n\nThe game uses a first person view and extremely low resolution visuals and sounds to build a really eerie experience that only very old 90' Dos games managed to. Its strong point lies in the puzzles: they mostly consist of riddles you have to solve outside the program, looking inside files and folders it will create for you on your desktop. This concept, while not by any means new or original, is still very refreshing to see used in these days. The difficulty is not excessive and if you read carefully the instructions/tips provided and commit to it you will find it all around pretty fair, but to fully complete it you may need to look around for help on a couple things.\n\nThe controls are very simple and the game plays smoothly without evident technical problems, just the collisions may prove a bit finicky but overall are not crucial to the experience. The graphic is again very simple and can be compared to the likes of Doom with a Silent Hill feel, same goes for the sound and background effects, and the absence of a musical soundtrack only increases the uneasy feel it tries to convey. The render distance is very short, a questionable choice that anyways does not get in the way of the gameplay. The game does not abuse cheap jump-scares and instead maintains a constant spooky atmosphere from start to finish.

It's one of those games that can be repetitive, but, in the end, it was worth it. There are some things I need to go over, however.\nIf you haven't played the game yet, and you want to in the future, DO NOT READ THIS. IT CONTAINS SPOILERS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIMSCARED starts off where the Gamejolt verions also starts off. You have a folder thats created on the desktop, and that is where the documents are created when you are playing. I had no problems with the first section of the game. It was all familiar, and, so far, I was happy with the remake of IMSCARED. Although, some parts are different, such as the new sounds, better frames, and the video that pops up, I was still happy with the outcome.\n\nThe second part, HER, is scary, to an extent. The start of this section is confusing, but, it plays just like the first part of the game. Once you go into the cellar, however, is when the game gets quite difficult. You have to figure out the code to unlock the gate so you can get the rope. After that, the entity HER begins to chase you. This part I found frustrating because you had to exit the game at a certain point, but the entity was very fast, but, at my 2nd try, I did it, but it may be frustrating to others. After you quit the game, you are able to use the rope to climb down the balcony. You are then greeted to a hedge maze. This part was VERY frustrating because of the \"mirror code\". You had to find pieces of a mirror to find the code, but, like all first person mazes, this one was confusing. I eventually found all pieces and the code, and exited the maze. After that, the train station. You have to destroy 3 gramaphones to get the metro key. I found this next part cool because you have to change the time to get the metro ticket instead of waiting. After you enter the metro, you have to \"face the truth\". This part was amazing. \nWARNING: MEGA SPOILER\nYou have to face against HER. You have to kill HER. But, the game won't let you have bullets for your gun. \"Six will do.\"\n\nThe next part was clever. After you enter the name, you are in the grocery store. You have to complete the to-do list. But, as you quit the game, you appear outside of the grocery store. After all of that, you have to get 3 valves in order to reveal a door. You need all achivements to enter this door, however. Once you enter the door, you have two options. Take the flower or end the game. \n\nIn conclusion, IMSCARED is a good game, but can be repetitive. Some people may find this annoying, others won't. For me, I was okay with it. But, some of the jumpscares in the game are cheap, and that somewhat annoys me. I won't tell you where they are. ;)\n\nIn the end, IMSCARED is a truly fascinating game, and you should give it a try.", "timestamp_created": 1466836251, "timestamp_updated": 1466836251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23764138": {"recommendationid": "23764138", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973067314", "num_games_owned": 235, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473104496}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't read anything.

Sometimes you even have to close and restart the game yourself to continue. The fact that the game never communicates what you have to do to advance can sometimes create situations in which you're not sure if you should be looking around harder because you missed something, or if you should write a five page essay and submit it to the game. The fourth wall bits are interesting but poorly implemented for a cohesive horror experience.\n\nThe story is weak and vague, the graphics have a nice style but make text illegible, and the jumpscares were mostly unnecessary. Some parts of the game rely on sound within a 3D soundscape, and sound seems to originate in one position but does not change relative to your movement. Certain actions like climbing a ladder or printing tickets have a gratingly loud volume for no reason. \n\nMany achievements were very arbitrary, and ended up being necessary to finish the game. Oh, and if you want to go back to get the achievements, have fun figuring out the ridiculous hallway hub. 2 doors go to 2 areas, one door with a pickup is needed to access a password screen to get to 2 other areas.

There is a moment in this game to scare everyone and give them the chills, not a single opportunity is wasted to let you know the situation you have gotten yourself into.\n\nIMSCARED doesn't get old, not in the sense that it has replay value, but it is true: [b]once you complete this game in its entirety you will not look at any horror game the same way again.[/b] What this title does is excite you while unsettling the hell out of you for the entirety of the experience, from the start to the very end (oh, and I do mean very end, this game while technically short, feels like a lifetime to complete in the very best way possible).\n\n[b]Suffice to say, buy this damn game already.

However, they aren't perfect. A couple puzzles were very tedious: the hedgemaze and the grammophone puzzles specifically. Without spoiling anything, these were a pain to get through and were the only sections that are actually detrimental to full experience.\n\nThe game could use some more graphics options. Forcing the player to play in a lower resolution is archaic and creates a delay when having to alt+tab to the folder. There are also no FOV options or checkbox to turn off headbob. These two options would prevent a lot of simulation sickness for those that can get a little light-headed from first person view video games.\n\nThat all being said, any fan of horror should definitely check this out. It is beatable in 2-3 hours, and fully worth the price of $4.", "timestamp_created": 1455662756, "timestamp_updated": 1455662756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21260072": {"recommendationid": "21260072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022093844", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455577873}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely short and lacks replayability, but it was an experience that kept me going throughout the whole thing.

If you like horror games then it may be a game for you, if you like indie games that are a little different, more outside the box then it may be for you.  I personally love a \"good\" horror game like Outlast, Anmesia Dark Descent, Paranormal, and Pnumbra.  This game like to play around with you, such as crashing, making this and that and playing with your head, while this is a cool idea it does get really annoying later in the game where the game is crashing a lot for gameplay reasons and needing to keep starting the game back up is slightly annoying and may push some people away from it.  The story is unique enough for what this is and its not a very long game.  You can get 100% of the achievements if you play all the way through the game and pick one of the two endings for the game.  The game uses a lot of jump scares to add to the horror of the game and after a while it got to be a little much and some \"puzzles\" are frustrating because they are trying to mess with you.  It is intresting to see a game where the 4th wall is broken and you are  kind of brought into the game as a force to impact what happens. The game is short, looks and plays pretty well with some controls being a little weird at times.  This is a unique game but I think some people will get annoyed with the \"gimmick\" of the game crashing and trying to mess with you.

Thankfully, IMSCARED adjusts itself with this in mind, and drops the shock-seeking act in favor of unique puzzle solving that intertwines what you do inside the game with what you do outside of it. You'll transition from being a victim of IMSCARED's shenanigans to learning how to use them to your advantage, but despite gaining control you'll still feel uncomfortable not knowing what's going to happen next. \n\nThe implementation isn't flawless by any means - the uphill climb to the game's ending may prove more frustrating than frightening for some, and certain sequences may result in death desensitization. In certain places, IMSCARED is a little too particular about what you have to do in order to progress, and there is potentially a great deal of backtracking required to collect everything required to complete the game.\n\nEven so, the feeling of playing a game that's actively plotting against you is done to a T in IMSCARED, and if that's a feeling you'd like to chase - especially if Pony Island/Undertale whet your appetite - then IMSCARED delivers.\n\n(A word of warning, currently Windows 10 users are reporting rampant problems with the game's file-creation mechanic - which is required to progress and ultimately complete the game.

the freeware version is called pixelated but the steam version is just imscared in my library\n\n   because this is one of those games the obligatory twisty twist heres a short review; dont buy it. you can avert your gaze now and play the freeware version instead of this which i havent actually played but its probably this but shorter and freer so just play that if you want some fuckin twists. going back to the actual review imscared is a walking simulator horror game where you solve all of your problems by walking and picking shit up while the game tries to scare you except its not scary and pulls some pretty bullshit bullshit near the end of the game. maybe im horror desensitized now considering i beat amnesia and that wasnt scary but whatever write your own review cock juggler. im sure there are better and scarier walking simulators out there for free or not.\n\n   now that everyone who who wants to keep their imscared virginity gone i can safely talk about the only reason this game has any attention whatsoever which is the twist. the game does this meta shit which is summed up as what if game was alive and because game is life the game interacts with your computer in a meta way which sounds interesting. the game pushes this to the limit of intentionally crashing and sometimes playing a sound effect while youre out of game once it does and adding/editing text files in an imscared folder. truly my fear has reached a zenith unknown by sentient beings. this feature is seriously what has propelled this game into any sort of spotlight and its poorly utilized every time it gets dragged up from the depths of meta hell. like for real there are two things this game uses the meta shit for: text files and a single semi jumpscare thing and the text files are all puzzles that suck dick. so does the jumpscare but whatever. the game also tries to tell its story or some shit via those text files in cryptic and mostly uninteresting fluff paragraphs to go along with the stupid puzzles. i guess thats the extent of the meta shit as well as the game crashing when you die. if you are buying this game thinking it is some sort of superb fourth wall adventure you are wrong. this game is bad. i seriously wish i could write more about the meta shit but i cant because its just so not there. all of the puzzles with meta are seriously just you fucking with text files and if that sounds fun fuck you.\n\n   the gameplay is walking simulator. i am so glad walking simulator has become a legitimate genre on steam. the entire concept of walking simulator is ridiculous and yet omnipresent among shitty games. this is one of those games. the entire game is just walking around and away from enemies and pressing e to pick stuff up or interact with shit because the rest of the game is not scary horror. its basically a worse version of amnesia in like everything. ive already said it before but every single puzzle is just finding the right thing to press e on or the sequence of things to press e on. thats it. that and the meta shit which i said before. more importantly though the game pulls some serious asspull near the end where it actually requires you to have all achievements to progress while also not giving you any hints on what those achievements are. most of these achievements are self explanatory but there are definitely a few that could be easily missed and i missed three on the first playthrough plus theres one thats almost impossible without a guide which i used. i can only assume its trying to push the meta adventure envelope here too except instead of fostering a community of people who explore the game like yume nikki it makes everyone go look up a walkthrough on youtube to avoid potentially hours of backtracking through shit youve already been through to find a stupid ass achivement for this stupid ass game. unlike yume nikki this game has nothing interesting to find or explore so i dont know what the dev was doing with that. and yeah you do have to backtrack for all of them all of them are based on pressing e on things or looking at shit.\n\n   anyway the horror. the horror is horrible. life is horrible and so is this game. the horror seems to be based on the sort of hidden agreement you might get a jumpscare sometimes and that incredibly low visibility plus being chased equals horror. like im not even joking about how little you can see there is an impenetrable wall of fog forever surrounding the player almost all of the time. it varies in distance but still it seems to exist only so the player gets super spooked when the monster is five feet in front of them before they see it. the game also enjoys being fucking loud as shit for most jumpscares and other shit which makes me more annoyed than scared because this game has caused me slight physical pain instead of horror. its really just not scary and none of the gimmicky shit it does makes it scary.\n\n   the graphics in particular help absolutely nothing about this game. yeah its a pixelated nightmare i know but was the title not changed. running from a fuckin pixel face like come on son. the games environments look decent enough but none of them were scary which is a problem when this game is betting every single farm on horror. the game gets much worse in the second half when the face thing chasing you suddenly and inexplicably transforms into a girl thing chasing you which they actually manage to make more hot than scary im not even joking. this is a mostly featureless pixelated white thing. if you ever do play this game to the second part pretend to make johnny bravo advances on the ghost girl so that the game crashes when you touch her and you dont have to play anymore. for real though dont play this game. for real again this game isnt scary looking ever.\n\n   then we get to the sound. you know i think that this game actually did the ambience sort of well. it had a sort of vintage low quality freaky record player approach that worked pretty good and was different from the generic whisper/cave sound/whatever that ive found in like every other horror game. the sound effects though. the sound effects were alright except for the ones that fucking kill your ears holy fuck why. sometimes the game decides it is in the best interests of all parties involved to emit a piercing ear destroying sound wave for reasons i assume are loud = scary. its laughably bad especially when you finally get to the fuckin end of the game and the game pulls this shit repeatedly to the point where i was actually laughing every time it occurred because of how ridiculous it is. like holy shit kill me now. anyway im done with the review im not talking about the plot because thats on life support so fuck you heres a conclusion.\n\n   for a game that probably totes how innovative it is for breaking the fourth wall the pixel ass graphics and boring walking simulator gameplay say otherwise. it takes no leaps in game design or anything else that would make it truly remarkable. its not even fun as a non horror game. its not even fun as a horror game. its just not fun. it seems every gameplay mechanic was built to accentuate the horror instead of being good in its own right like what amnesia tried to do with its puzzles. i wont say amnesia went further than tried though. thus enjoyment of the game entirely depends on how much of a pussy you are and how much you enjoy being scared. if you are a pussy who enjoys being scared just play amnesia anyway.", "timestamp_created": 1454806522, "timestamp_updated":

I'll admit I was blown away. The low-fi visuals and audio, the fourth-wall breaking, the Yume Nikki vibe. All in all, a well-thought, hand-crafted piece of eeriness. I liked it so much I kept that version for years and gave it a play every now and then, showing it to some of my friends as well.\n\nThen, February 2016 came and on twitter I saw my friend benzoin-gum re-tweeting Ivan's announcement about the Steam release - that was a really nice surprise, and I thought I owed Ivan a beer for the entertaining he's granted me years before, free of charge. Hence I bought it, and that was it, I didn't even [i]want[/i] to play it again initially, but shortly after I caved in and gave it a go. \n\nLo and behold, there were a bunch of new areas to explore, new stuff to see and hear. New chapters, and secrets. I didn't know that, it was a very welcomed surprise. Yes, the game still lives to its old expectations and surpasses itself in this expanded version. I'm one achievement short from completion, but I reckon it won't be long due. \n\nFor the price of a pint of beer, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes Yume Nikki, or had at least one dream in their lifetime where everything was bright yet the sky lied still, and black.\n\n[b]update: 100%[/b]\n\nThe last chapter was very intensive and frightening.

FUCKING BUY IT.\n\nIMSCARED is a pixelated indie horror game originally released for free on Gamejolt some odd years ago. The steam version includes the free version plus another 2.5 times that content. So essentially 3.5x the free game. It is a defining game of the indie horror genre, and breaks the fourth wall in a way that I have never seen any other game do. These fourth-wall mechanics are incorporated into the gameplay, making it an even more unique experience. I believe that IMSCARED is the #1 indie horror game out there, and an absolute must-play for anyone interested in the genre. \n\nThe only con of this game, to me, is the labrynth portion that occurs ~1/4 of the way through the game. It was honestly a huge stalling point and not very fun to me at all, making me frustrated to the point of almost quitting. After getting over this though, the rest of the game was amazing. I had expected it to be the original game plus more thrown together content to make it 'long enough' to justify the (incredibly low) price, but that's not what this game is at all. Every part of it- save the labrynth- is a wonderful, unique terrifying experience.\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1454777177, "timestamp_updated": 1456783725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20999514": {"recommendationid": "20999514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043953864", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488754883}, "language": "english", "review": "This shits spooky af 10/10\nwould buy new pants again.

A game that has the player interacting with an entity that communicates with them by creating text files on the player's desktop is intriguing. The visual style, while not entirely original, feels dated, a commonly overlooked way to create unease with the player. The game's price point is also low and suitable for a game with this level of content. However, IMSCARED stumbles in a lot of areas and left me frustrated with it. I'll break down what I didn't like about the game.\n\n1. I said in my introductory paragraph that I found the interaction between the player and the game to be intriguing. While it is, it's also a bit awkwardly implemented. There are several points in the game where you need to be reading a text file while playing the game. During these segments, you can put the game in windowed mode, but the window is incredibly tiny and the controls sometimes glitch out while you're trying to go back and forth between the text file and game.\n\n2. The game \"crashes\" and closes itself on several occasions. This harkens back to Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem and the original Metal Gear Solid, where the game attempts to fool the player into thinking that the game is actually interacting with something in the real world. I initially didn't mind this, but the game began to abuse it. If you get caught by the monster at certain points in the game, the game will close and you'll be brought back to your desktop. There were points where you're required to solve puzzles with little to no conveyance as the monster chases you around the environment. If you get caught, you're brought back to your desktop, losing your progress up until the start of the puzzle. I actually took breaks from this fairly short game because I was so frustrated with my constant failures. I also imagine my Steam friends were getting annoyed, constantly seeing me start and stop playing the game. If the game maybe brought you back to the menu screen when you died rather than completely closing out, this wouldn't be so much of an issue.\n\n3. Jump scares, jump scares, jump scares. I see a lot of reviews praising this game for being \"truly scary\", but I see very little criticism of its over-reliance on jump scares. While I'll admit that the game made me feel uneasy at times with its retro atmosphere and creepy ambience, there were way more occasions where something would pop out and make a loud noise at me for a cheap scare. There are points where an overlay will flash on the screen with a loud noise and the game will close, something entirely jumpy and even more forgettable. The worst offender, however, is a puzzle about 3/4 of the way through the game where the player is tasked with finding record players in a maze and destroying them. You're being chased by the monster during this segment, but weird figures will come down from the ceiling and screech at you for absolutely no reason. They add nothing to the experience at all and don't play into the puzzle in any way, just being added as cheap scares to make the situation less scary than it would have been if you were simply being chased.\n\n4. The game is somewhat fragmented. There isn't really a hub location until the very end of the game, and the areas you're going through have little to nothing to do with one another. You go to a supermarket, a train station, a basement area and a hedgemaze throughout the course of the game. These areas aren't really connected to each other until the very end, and even then the game only connects them through a series of doors that teleport you to them. Some of the areas even require you to input different things into a text prompt, something that is vital near the end of the game if you didn't get all of the achievements (I'll expand on this later). Overall, you find yourself teleporting from area to area. The game will close, and you'll find yourself in an entirely new location without any explanation as to why. As a result, nothing feels familiar and the game feels stitched together, like a collection of different ideas.\n\n5. Movement is awkard and actually somewhat buggy. It's fairly simple, being mapped to the WASD keys for moving, the Shift key for sprinting, and the Ctrl key for crouching. However, it's easy to get \"caught\" on objects, requiring you to reposition the camera in order to move again. If you want to try this, you simply need to walk along a wall and rotate the camera towards it. You'll eventually get stuck and won't be able to move unless you rotate the camera away from the wall. This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't actual segments where you need to get through cramped spaces and you're constantly getting stuck on both sides of the wall. There's also a segment where you're being chased through a hallway, and while I only got caught on a bookshelf once, it still exemplified how buggy the movement is. It's also worth noting that if you crouch next to certain objects, you can clip through them, which looks very awkward and allows you to peer inside some things.\n\n6. Near the end of the game, the player is about to go through the last door when the game prompts them that they need to get all of the achievements in order to proceed. At first I thought this was a trick, but it's serious. Closing the game will bring you back to the start of the game, which has opened up some new doors to previous parts of the game where you can obtain these achievements. When I started this game, it was less than a week old. The achievement list gives absolutely no clues as to how the achievements are obtained and the discussion board was barren of help. This left me stumbling about, trying to figure out how to get the last few achievements so that I could actually finish the game. Some of these achievements are incredibly obscure, requiring you to do things like knock on a wall and set your system clock to certain times in order to get some items. Achievements are meant to entertain completionists, not frustrate people who just want to experience the game.\n\nI truly, dearly wanted to enjoy IMSCARED. It does some really interesting things and has a very low price point. However, the times where I was wowed were undermined by the amount of times I was frustrated or disappointed. In the end, this is just a short indie horror game with lots of jump scares and a somewhat entertaining fourth-wall mechanic. It's not incredibly noteworthy and I can think of other games that do fourth-wall breaking better with less frustrations and more polish.", "timestamp_created": 1454743061, "timestamp_updated": 1514415744, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 170, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648809", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20988155": {"recommendationid": "20988155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002803058", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475967801}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the free Gamejolt version when it came out, and was pleasantly surprised.

Although the game is very short (3 hours at best if you're looking to find all the secrets) it's filled with nice and never seen before ideas.

Don't expect to find a real \"plot\" here, because what you'll be doing will just be...playing with the game. Literally. You'll understand more only if you'll try it yourself. Here I can just say that it's truly something unique and worth to try, even if you're not the kind of person who enjoys the so-called \"walking simulators\". I am not, just to say.\n\nThe only real flaw that I can find in this title considering the fact that has been developed by a single person resides in its graphics: I understand that the pixelated style is intentional, but a 256x144 resolution is really ridicolous. 480p should be considered the minimum for decency in this kind of games, going lower than that just makes everything look worse than it should.

I would like to see more games do stuff like this.

However, there are some parts that really frustrated me. For example: There's a part where [spoiler] you're in a maze trying to destroy 3 phonographs while you're being chashed by \"HER\". The only way to find the phonographs is if you listen carefully with headphones while moving around. [/spoiler] I kept dying alot due to confusement, but of course I successfully did it anyways. Despite moments like that, keep in mind that it's a challenge, and challenges are the reason why games are great. I recommend this game to anyone who are really into thinking outside the box when it comes to computers.

If you've heard of it or seen any gameplay videos or Let's Plays, chances are you're already aware of the game's central \"gimmick\". If you'd prefer to go into the game blind (which I recommend) then don't read any further. IMSCARED is a good game for a very cheap price. Worth the play.\n\nIf you're curious, then read on: IMSCARED's main idea is that the game will mess with your computer itself to deceive, attack, and scare you. Essentially created a horror game acting like a malicious, haunted virus. Right off the bat the game automatically creates a folder on your desktop where it will send you messages, sometimes to aid you, and other times to taunt you. The ways the game requires you to think outside the box and the ways it uses your computer become more creative and more clever as the game goes on. For a gimmick, it's a well implemented gimmick.\n\nIt should be noted that when I say the game's tricks get more clever as you go along, the entire game really is the same way. The first gameplay section of IMSCARED (past the short tutorial) is the original 2012 game in it's entirety with one or two very minor changes. Compared to the rest of the game afterwards, the beginning segment feels amateur, and it's not a great testament to what the game had up it's sleeve. It feels very much like the developer took the original game and has been building and improving on it since 2012, leaving the segment feeling a tad uneventful and slow (not that the segment is bad, mind you, but the rest of the game just feels a lot better).\n\nYou're probably going to either tolerate or hate the graphics. It's VERY low-res and can make finding small object sprites hard. On the flipside, it does help push the idea that \"this is a video game that's acting very wrong\". Movement can be annoying, as the game has a tendency of having you get stuck on objects or even in narrow corridors, especially when running.\n\nThe game's no Silent Hill 2, but it has some fun, creative scares and incredibly creepy atmospheres, especially when it incorperates the gimmick of a haunted video game. Even the least subtle parts are still better than many cheap indie horror games.\n\nMuch of the gameplay consists of puzzles, which get better as the game goes on and it fully utilizes the central idea to it's potential, even if there's a bit overreliance on keyhunting, usually there's more than just backtracking to keep it interesting.\n\nOverall, for four dollars, IMSCARED is a good game to check out. Maybe it won't for your style if you can't suspend some disbelief at times, but if you can, then I believe you're in for an enjoyable and scary ride.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1454562347, "timestamp_updated": 1454562347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.872876", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20942166": {"recommendationid": "20942166", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134811176", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484101637}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, what a great game.

Even lying in the game itself. I've played it for about 40 Minutes and while there are jump scares the game looks great and the tension builds fear. If you played and liked the Free version then don't hesitate, if you haven't then try the free version.\n\nConclusion\nIt lives up to the name and expands upon the free version and is very cheap, I give the game a 9/10 for being scary, loud and fun.\n\nMy YouTube Video\nSoon!

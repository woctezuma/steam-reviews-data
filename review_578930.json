The new engine is more robust and kuso contains a lot of cool new level elements and improved level design. The increase in difficulty is definitively one of its stronger points, effectively doubling playtime. On the flipside, imo, there is a perceived loss of charm and expression of creativity. The varying level-of-detail, such as the crocodile mouth, the ending of level 8 and the cute soundtrack in level 9, and little dragons at the end gave the game a retro-active vibe thats almost entirely lost in its sequel. Everybody praises the game for its soundtrack, and although its great, its not all that fitting at times. Nevertheless, if LOVE was your thing, youll probably love this game too!\n\n[h1]For newcomers:[/h1]\n[b]Kuso is a simplistic, challenging-to-difficult platformer with a keen eye for level design.[/b] The game naturally lends itself for speedrunning and although you'll finish the game in about 40m first time through, you'll probably be coming back to get that double A rating down (hard!). The challenge is found mostly in its passages where multiple objects have to be tracked, and maneuvering through moving objects where absolute jump precision is required to succeed. The jumping mechanic is time sensitive and the level design is really well-adjusted to this. The game offers multiple modes with limited lives and some secrets to increase playtime. Although the level design is really solid, some 'bullet-hell' like sections were a little frustrating. They were way too difficult for me so i ended up just randomly jumping my way though hoping id succeed.

On my first playthrough I died 400 times but the smooth tunes and the checkpoint system kept me from getting frustrated, as I tend to get on difficult platformers.  Next I tried Arcade mode which limits you to 125 lives; I tried this on my second playthrough and finish with a scant 8 lives.  The \"hard\" setting only gives you 10 lives, so good luck with that!

I was introduced to it through a let's player/streamer I used to watch waaaaaaay back in probably 2010 or maybe even earlier than that. It was one of the first few indie games I have had exposure to during those times when I didn't really know the internet all that well. I fell in love with it instantly. Crushing difficulty, smooth tunes and a sleek lofi aesthetic. It was an is a solid game that sets out what it wanted to achieve.\n\nEvery so often my mind drifts back to LOVE and eventually that led to me discovering the existence of this game, kuso. So I was pretty excited of the idea of playing some more in the style of LOVE. And sure enough it doesn't disappoint. It's a difficult platformer with fantastic music, tight controls, and is basically everything I would have wanted from a sequel to LOVE. The soundtrack is a must purchase for the asking price of 2.99 for 26 tracks!

But as intended, it will probably make you curse under your breath as you try to complete the game in anything other than the unlimited-checkpoint mode.\n\nThis game is hard, but it's the right kind of difficulty - fair and telegraphed. It's a precision platformer with simple and intuitive controls - you just run and jump, and time your movement over many different obstacles. It's a relatively short game, but it is longer and more difficult than its predecessor, Love, which is the game that made me excited to get kuso in the first place.\n\nThe music is good: like seriously, this lo-fi track https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kh42huPe78 featured in the trailer for the first game is excellent and really helped me get interested in buying the game, and after knowing that the soundtrack held up throughout all the levels, I knew it would be a great feature of kuso as well. The music really supplements the experience of playing these games, with their flat black backgrounds but detailed pixelated art, and difficult platforming gameplay that both scare you into making a mistake or put you into a sort of zen state as you concentrate through playing carefully.\n\nI just really appreciate the design of these types of games: simple and self-contained with fluid controls, difficult enough to be engaging but forgiving enough and with enough difficulty options so as not to overwhelm the player, and it's like.... the game is really a work of art. WIth a game like this that doesn't have story or too many human-world elements, there's a focus on becoming immersed in the game's style, music, and gameplay, and that's what makes it feel like a real piece of art.\n\nI don't often write reviews, but I'm writing one because I feel that simple, well-designed games like this deserve more recognition.

Nah seriously this has to be one of my favourite games, it ellaborates amazing dialect from the characters thats humurous but can nail an eerie atmosphere if need be. It explores various topics, all characters are somewhat in the LGBT spectrum. It has amazing replay content and 4 endings with 5 achievements ( 2 linked to the yellow route ;) ) Its pretty amazing and has unique, lovable characters; not mention how diverse it is from other visual novels in terms of story and playthrough. In each route you learn more about all the characters. If you are still debating about buying I can say that i would have payed alot more for this game, and it truly is iconic x :)", "timestamp_created": 1519499405, "timestamp_updated": 1519499405, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40055272": {"recommendationid": "40055272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001589000", "num_games_owned": 447, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518512422}, "language": "english", "review": "[i]We[/i] know the devil.  When I say we, I mean, [i]everyone[/i].\nThe devil doesn't just take on a form of a naked, balding red man holding a stupid cartoon pitchfork.\nThey take on a form that is untangible, abstrat, and far more horrifying.\n\nWe Know the Devil is a short visual novel telling the story of three \"bad\" teenagers at a summer camp to fight the devil.  A single playthrough of the game takes approximately an hour?  But you will want to explore the other two endings, + the \"true ending\", so perhaps a full playthrough should take approximately 2 hours.  Getting each of the endings + the true ending is pretty self-explanatory, but if you can't figure it out, you can just google how to get it, it's not a big deal.\n\nI want to avoid spolilers, as it's a short game, it'd be harmful to the experience of playing it if too much is revealed.  What I can say though, WKtD does a good job of replicating the feeling of \"third-wheeling\".  From my experience, what usually seems to happen in groups of three is that two of the particpating people will just be closer together, leaving one person on the sideline, watching.  It's happened to all of us, and it feels isolating.  You want to just leave and go home, and let the other two enjoy themselves.  More than that even, you begin to feel like a nuisance, like your existence, at that moment, is detrimental to the other two's lives.\n\nIt sucks.\n\nThe game does a good job getting this feeling across.  \nOther than that, the only thing I can think to add is that the game has a problem with loading/saving states of the game. Whenever I loaded up a save state, I was unable to create a save state again unless I restarted the game.  The game auto saves, but a couple times when I loaded up an autosave from the main menu, it would take me to a black screen where I wouldn't be able to do anything. The game is so short however that even if you did forget to save your progress, you can use the fastforward feature to get back to the point you were at in about a minute or two.", "timestamp_created": 1518558249, "timestamp_updated": 1518558249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39951701": {"recommendationid": "39951701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019147628", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518176992}, "language": "english", "review": "Just blasted through this, would have taken less time but I spent some looking up how to get the fourth ending.  \n\nThere are only two serious criticisms worth noting.\n\n1.  Needs editing.\n\n2.  Too short, which is almost a recomendation in and of itself.  (The food is terrible and the portions are TOO SMALL!)\n\nMore time for character development would have amplified an already intense experience.  On the otherhand a short and sweet story completely avoids the heavy handed blungeoning similar attempts deliver.  Venus, Jupiter, and Neptune are also relatively relatable even if you're not LGBTQ because they're just kids who want to be themselves.  Adding more could actually spoil the magic.  \n\nAlso adored the soundtrack, though a longer story may have fitted it better as it comes off over the top in such a short time span, so I guess I'm conflicted.

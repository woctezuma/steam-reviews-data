Pero vamos con lo raro, hay pildoras para agrandar los senos de tu hija y de hecho te dan un logro si estos llegan a cierto tama\u00f1o, tambi\u00e9n hay una especie de modo de juego del estilo de los primeros Final Fantasy en el cual puedes matar a un se\u00f1or de la guerra, o que incluso te puedes casar con tu hija, ad\u00e9mas de ponerle ropas sugestivas, s\u00ed, creo que destaca que es japon\u00e9s. Lo que no se nota es que es del mismo estudio que creo Neon Genesis Evangelion (yo tampoco se porque hicieron un videojuego de hacer princesas).\n\nCreo que dejando aparte los puntos malos que se van ganando con el paso del tiempo, destaca mucho una cosa que pasa en este tipo de cosas y son los complejos sistemas de atributos, el juego te muestra una parte de estos pero solo es la m\u00e1s simple, cosas como la fecha de nacimiento o el tipo de sangre tambi\u00e9n dictan los atributos que tendra tu hija, y siento que el juego depende mucho de que lo jueges varias veces para que llegues a comprenderlo mejor.\n\nLa verdad es que Princess Maker 2 es el mejor de la trilog\u00eda y es un valor con un alt\u00edsimo valor rejugable (lo que ahora importa mucho) y lejos de los fallos que destaque es un buen juego que si te gustan los simuladores, los rpg y los juegos con much\u00edsimas posibilidades, lo m\u00e1s probable es que este juego te guste.", "timestamp_created": 1516231664,

At first this game was interesting and it was kinda cute. It wears off after a time. I tried to come back after a few weeks, same thing. The game gets to be dull and pretty tedious, but this isn't my main problem with the game. I wouldn't have bothered to come and review it just for that. \n\nMy real gripe is how throughout the game, everyone was sexualizing/objectifying my daughter. Even MORE once she turns 15. You can't get access to the best clothes unless she's around 90lbs (even as a full grown 18-year old). Some of the dresses have her almost nude (google siren's robes). Others are thinly veiled dom/otherwise sexy outfits. She's a child. In the desert area, there's a dragon who will constantly comment on my daughter's chest and gives her money scaled to how busty and sexy she is. Father-daughter conversations with her often touch on her asking you about her \"proportions\" - even when she's 11 years old. At 15, if she has high charisma (which is high-key code for sexual attractiveness), grown-ass married fathers will proposition your daughter to be their mistresses. She's a child. She's a damn child. It wears on you after awhile.\nIf you enjoy the game and want to play it, that's fine.

That's pretty much Princess Maker 2 in a single sentence.\n\nEvery month, you have to choose 3 things that your daughter will spend her time on. You can make your daughter work at a job, which will boost her stats and make her stressful in exchange for money. Each job boosts different stats and requires different stats to do well in. With your child labour-earned money, you can send your daughter to school, where she can learn to fight, to not be an asshole, to cook or that the Earth isn't flat. The lessons cost money and if you run out, you just wasted day(s) of time doing nothing. Some paths of education will earn you a rival or result in being challenged while you're out shopping for a winter coat. You can also go adventure in 4 different locations. Adventuring is like your typical old-school RPG: You walk around, randomly encounter people or monsters and you get to choose if you want to talk/fight/ignore/hide. You'll also find chests with items, and there are various NPCs and hidden events in the wild. You can get perved on by an old dragon if you're old enough. You can challenge the War God to a fight. You can find and arrest a wanted criminal. Or you can just run into angry mermaids that have boobs and nipples and will always fight you.  Lastly, you can reduce your stress levels by giving your daughter free time or going on a vacation. Going on a vacation will cost more money, be more effective, show you a nice vacation photo and sometimes change a stat like weight.\n\nYes, the game has SO FREAKING MANY STATS. There's your physical stats like height, weight, bust/waist/hips, but also things like 3 different reputations (Housework, Fighting, Magic), various combat-related stats and things like Sin. The stats (and some in-game events) are what determines the ending that you get, and there's a whole spectrum of them. You can end up as a regular housewife. Or maybe you kill the Demon King and take over Hell. The \"best\" ending for the game is, BIG SURPRISE TO LIKE 3 PEOPLE, is becoming the Ruling Queen. The stats can also trigger certain events or prevent certain events from happening, such as a high stress level leading to sickness, truancy or running away from home for a month.\n\nPrincess Maker 2 doesn't have much in the way of \"gameplay\" outside of the adventuring part. Studying and working are done with a montague-like video that shows how your stats change, with a window describing whether you did well or just sat on your ass all day. And while it is possible to play the game without looking at the stats, it's going to be very difficult if you don't understand why your daughter keeps running away or why the butler insists she eats a lot every month.

Can you think of any other games from the 90s or early 2000s that do that? If you can, it's because they were insanely good games, well-loved and of high quality. That's what this game is, high quality --- it's visual novel-esque with heavy simulation aspects. This game has so much replayability that you can enjoy it over and over again, playing it through again right after you finish the first time.\nYou manage your child's life from around age 10 until adulthood, and shape the adult she becomes. I highly recommend this if you like sims of any kind, and you enjoy management style games. Even if you don't like visual novels, this is old school and a bit how original Japanese style VNs used to be back on the SNES, more like a game and less like a book.

make her a nun and have her marry the demon butler so I aimed for that ending. Result: She became a general and married a cheerful, sociable knight. And also she hated me for making her train all the time. \n\nMost recent playthrough: Burnt by my last experience, I decided to focus on making sure she won the Art Contest at the Harvest Festival for the cash. 14 year, probably due to all the dance lessons I'd been sending her on for stamina and glamour her rival was the Dance Party girl, to my displeasure as I had a sure winner with the Advent of Angels painting. But I went along with it because I didn't want my daughter to hate me. I made sure she smoozed with the Minister, I beggared myself buying her a dress, I sent her dance class after dance class. She ran away during the month of the next Harvest Festival. She had to fund her dance classes with hairdressing that year. Result: Became a dancer and married the demon butler which I wasn't even trying for. And she loved me for cherishing her. \n\nWe make plans for our children and push them in that direction, but children will make their own choices and follow their own paths, parents plans for them be damned. That's why this game is an awesomely realisitic parenting simulator, apparent from all the fairy tea parties and demon feasts.", "timestamp_created": 1502804289, "timestamp_updated": 1502804289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.734474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34245129": {"recommendationid": "34245129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085853413", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507145435}, "language": "english", "review": "PBG led me to this game", "timestamp_created": 1502751262, "timestamp_updated": 1502751262, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.385690", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34115818": {"recommendationid": "34115818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198357151906", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511835883}, "language": "english", "review": "Loved this game on the DosBox, Love it now.", "timestamp_created": 1502242834, "timestamp_updated": 1502242834, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513417", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34079375": {"recommendationid": "34079375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198409113848", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 903, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507998588}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud504\uba54 2\ub294 \uae30\ub300\ub97c \uc800\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1502103716, "timestamp_updated": 1502103716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33797004": {"recommendationid": "33797004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407214421", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501083330}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438.\n\u042f \u043e\u0436\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0414\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e. \u0418 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0435?

Of course I am going to support it.\nPlaying it again (this time with the refined version in English) here's what I can say about this game:\n\nPros:\n\n+First of all this game is addictive. It's easy to lose yourself in plotting your daughter's schedule and trying to guide her to whatever ending you're gunning for.\n+This game has a high replay-ability value. PM2 has a lot of endings, A lot of events that a triggered based on what skills your daughter has, You wont be able to finish this game in a couple of playtroughs.\n+Has endearing characters such Cube for example.\n+Has an adventuring mode that gives the game more game-play and appeals to anyone who likes JRPG.\n+Good Voice acting\n\nCons:\n- The English release has awkward translations. Although CFK has made updates to improve them so this is not a major con but something to take note.\n-Game has Risqu\u00e9 endings and events. This can be avoided in the game though if you are uncomfortable with them.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this to anyone who love Sim games.", "timestamp_created": 1499362720, "timestamp_updated": 1511375676, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553435", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33261137": {"recommendationid": "33261137", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084739635", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1048, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499842460}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the original version way back when, so how could I not play the official Steam release?\n\nThe good:\n-Wide variety of endings & secrets. You'll be playing a while if you want to see everything!\n-Nice artwork that's been updated a bit without losing its charm.\n-Speed-up options. Particularly handy for speeding up the Harvest Festival(which is very long and repetitive).\n-Voice acting! It's all in Japanese, but it's a nice touch for a re-release.\n\nThe bad:\n-The translation is very hit or miss. Some things are phrased awkwardly, some characters get their names romanized differently in different places, and some things seem to be flat-out incorrect(the text after a win in the fighting tournament makes it sound like you lost, for instance).\n-The work/training dialogue gets very repetitive after a while. It'd be nice to be able to disable it.\n\nThe neutral:\n-No tutorial.

Do you like stat sims? Do you like Light RPG stuff? Do you like Mideaval times? Do you like anime? Then Princess Maker 2 Refined is for you. A TL;DR is at the bottom of the review. :)\n\nRefined being the word they went with for \"We updated the original title and put in some stuff and took out some other stuff to make it run smoothly\"\n\nThis game was originally released on DOS a while back (if memory serves correctly) and it was a fun little title with a built-in cheat system that let you basically get a bunch of money (among other things that are a bit controversial and NSFW by today's standards) called Mad Eddy's. \n\n\nMad Eddy's Cheats and Goods has sadly been removed and I hope it gets translated and re-added in a future patch or I will be very sad because it's nearly impossible to get these achievements without consulting a web guide if you want a specific ending. \n\nAside from missing one of the elements that made the game a little easier for newcoming players this game holds up well in my eyes and is a lot of fun for a good few hours with high replayability with its total of over 50 different endings (I think). Some of the downsides I don't like that will hopefully find a fix soon are minor bugs such as the ending letter just sort of getting skipped if you prefer to play with voice acting turned off. Yes, they added voice acting. It's pretty good in my opinion, though I prefer to play the game without voice acting turned on because I liked the original where there wasn't any and personally the voices in my head fit the characters just a touch better. \n\nIf you're a fan of the series you'll love this game and what it tries to do. If you're new to the series, it's a good start, but will probably be pretty confusing at first. \n\nOne last thing to note: Some of the artwork contains NSFW 18+ Content as I've seen from community screenshots of other players' subsequent playthroughs and results so if you don't like nudity or something like that then maybe wait for a patch that censors it or something.\n\nFinal Verdict as of current state (6/16/17): 8/10\n-Some of the missing elements make it more challenging than it was previously\n-Some minor but fixable bugs keep it down\n-Holds up extremely well\n-Fun with lots of replayability \n-Really lovely artworks.", "timestamp_created": 1497663608, "timestamp_updated": 1497663608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745154", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32402873": {"recommendationid": "32402873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198392519286", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503255034}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my childhood game.

The Internet was wrong.\n\nThis game lacks any narrative of Long Live the Queen, or more like, any narrative whatsoever. Random events occur often without any visible reason, story or meaning. Some skills may lead to your daughter running away or getting hit on by suitors. Without reading an actual walkthrough, you have no clue which skills cause this, even as it is happening. Nothing in this game is intuitive or exciting to discover. There is no clear goal to whatever you are doing. You can't even find the joy in your daughter succeeding, because it is impossible to relate to her in any way. There are a dozen or so different lines your daughter will say when you talk to her, many of them generic Japanese schoolgirl type lines such as \"I wish my chest was bigger\".\n\nWere you to catch this game for a couple of euros/dollars/rupees, I would recommend it.

I can barely type this I am so disappointed.\n\nImmediately upon seeing my totally-going-to-be-a-hoss of a daughter I realized that it was going to be a tough life for her. I planned on sending her to hard labor every day of her life from ages 10-18 and then see where things go from there. LIKELY a life as a sturdy brick shithouse nun if the gods would smile upon me. Optimistically, I did as I set out to do. I worked her every day for 3 months on a farm with no rest or leisure and at the age of 10 years 3 months she became a GANG MEMBER and would only wear a nightgown. \n\nAt that point she didn't want to do anything anymore, just kept like, literally squatting and pissing at the farm or something like that, until she was arrested by soldiers that found her hanging out with theives. They locked her up but for some reason they let her go, so I sent hossica back to the farm. I noticed she was gaining a lot of strength but still was beefy so I cut her diet down to the strictest level possible. This broad could still bale hay, let me tell you. They actually increased her pay.\n\nOne day shortly after all of this she ran off and came back with a HAND GRENADE. Literally. So I figured now would be a good time to enter her in the harvest festival combat arena. He first opponent was literally a blind guy who punched her so hard in the face it bloodied her up and she quit. I was pretty pissed off that she was so pathetic so I sent her back to the farm, but they kicked her out for having a bad attitude. \n\nI was going to have her repent at church but realized she would be better off wandering around in the woods so I sent her on a mission to the eastern woods. The first person she came across was a nice woman so obviously my daughter attacked her with the grenade. The woman somehow didn't die after getting hit with the grenade and instead punched my daughter in the face causing Trollop to run away. This was twice now that she had run away from fights after getting punched in the face. \n\nIt soon became winter and she was sick and cold because she only had a summer dress. FINE. I spent almost all our savings to buy her some mail armor to go over the dress to keep her warm. But she still got sick. At this point I was basically out of empathy for her due this persistent weakness and because of multiple arrests for hanging out with ragamuffins and the most unruly people. We also had little money since her lazy weak ass decided to not work when I sent her off. She was just super lazy and I kind of don't even like thinking about it because it's super disappointing. Only after going to jail would she work.  And she ended up being upgraded from hay work to LUMBERJACK. No flannel shirt but she didn't need it, she was soon hossin out at about 600 STR, dumb and clumsy as hell but could cut wood like a chainsaw. Good for her. Finally some progress. Maybe next year I will buy her that teacup for her birthday.\n\nBut after 3 birthdays in which I didn't buy her anything, 9 arrests, 3 harvest festival ass-kickings, about 8 forest beatdowns at the hands of city guards that she attacked of her own volition, and about 950 days of slacking off she finally got sick and died at the age of 13 from working at a farm and chopping down trees. And one time I sent her hunter and she didn't shoot anything.

I do have some problems with this release, however.\n\nFirst of all, the achievement system is bugged to a small degree. Achievements do pop up where they should, but are not implemented correctly, making a few of them incredibly easy to get. It's not a huge bother and makes it easier to earn all of them. Second, the font used for text is very off-putting and does not match up well with everything else in the game. they should've used the original font from the old beta, as it would've matched up much better and made the game easier to read.\n\nMy biggest problem with this release is the translation, which I assume was done by amateur translators. There are many misspellings and grammatical errors, which makes the job seem unprofessional. They also changed a lot of the names of the stats, which will confuse veteran players of the series if they don't have the names memorized. There are also some cases where things are translated completely wrong, which can confuse both new and veteran players. Overall, the translation is just shoddy and they should've hired a better translator.\n\nDoes this mean I don't like it? Of course not. The core mechanics of the game are still perfectly intact and the art of the characters and locations has been flawlessly remastered to fit modern day expectations of the gaming industry. It is not a perfect game, but that doesn't mean it is a bad game. I believe if the developers work on the translaton and achievement mechanics more, this can become a crown jewel of a game.\n\nOverall, I do reccommend new and old players of the series pick this game up, it is definitely worth your money. I give it a final rating of 9/10.

The reputation that \"Princess Maker 2\" has is well deserved. This is a very good game, easily the best \"raise your kid\" simulator currently available on Steam (it even beats \"Long Live The Queen\", which I also enjoy a lot), but at the same time, it is so much more. \n\nIt has interesting bits of story and lore, thrown here and there. This is a very complicated game, with a lot of aspects - you will shape relationship with your daughter, you will send her to classes, so that she can learn new skills, but that costs money. So you will have to send her to work (sometimes to not nice places) or send her to go on adventures. There are many different skills, characters, hidden statistics and all sorts of stuff, that will impact how your daughter will end up. There are over 70 (!) different endings, plus few different marriage options [spoiler]Cube is my favorite so far \u2665[/spoiler]. Also, you need to be aware of your daughters morality and stress level - she may be ill, she may become a delinquent, she may run from home, she may even die. Watch over her diet too. Oh, and don't be surprised, when she will fall in love or become someone's mistress. There are lots and lots of very subtle changes and many strategies to raise your daughter. \n\nThis game has huge replayability - I've played it three times already and I will definitely come back for more, as I want to see all of the most interesting endings and get all achievements.

Its a nice change of pace from the constant war and death in video games. Dont get me wrong thats all fun too, but its nice to get something peaceful and happy. In the game you are a great hero who saves a nation from certain doom, and as a reward heaven grants you a 10 year old girl from heaven to raise as a daughter. Its a strange reward to be sure but ok. You choose her birthday, her name, your name, your birthday and your age and the game begins. She has a ton of different stats, which get higher or lower depending on what you have her do. having her work at a farm will increase strength and stamina but will lower elegance. Doing housework helps her learn cooking and cleaning but she makes no money. There are other jobs such as lumber jack, babysitter, prostitute. That last one is real, and it pays a ton of money, but no daughter of mine will be caught in a place like that so off she went to the lumber mill. She was as graceful as a giraffe on roller blades but she could break you in half if she wanted to, and she was only 13 at the time. Outside of work she can study, which you spend money on rather than earn it. This affects more active stats like combat skill, decore, manners, intelligence and so on. You need to balance studies wil work and also which ones you select depending on what you want her to be. For instance its a good idea for her to practice Kung-FU and be a lumber jack because they complament each other, while dancing classes and lumberjack cancel out and leave you with a ton ofwasted money and nothing to show for it. When I first palyed I wanted to go with a princess Zelda type, very smart, good sword fighter, magical, and a princess. the problem was all those lessons cost more that you will have most of the time so I ended up sticking her in a resturant where she made bank and taught her manners so she would be noticed by the royalty. I also wanted her to be intelligent so I also gave her science classes. She ended up becoming aa housewife, and a damn good one at that. AAlthough she didnt marry a prince, she did marry a rich man, so I was satisfied know my son in law would eaty well the rest of his natural life as he married the official best cook in the nation 6 years in a row. \n\nMy second runthrough I wanted my daughter to take my place as legendary hero, so I got her to work the farm and do Kung-fu.

Welcvome to Micromanagement: THE GAME! In all seriousness though, this game takes up time and eats it pretty quickly if you're into the genre of running the life of an anime girl. A game that comes to mind that's also available on Steam is Long Live the Queen...but I've gotten more out of PM2 to be honest. There are plenty of events and plenty of endings to aim for, some harder and more intense to gain than others. You can do everything from being a housewife to being the Queen of Sin. \n\nThe game IS slow and it will take patience...if you're unwilling to sit around staring as your virtual daughter does subpar hairdressing or wtaching her slooooooooowly get better at magic/fighting/manners then maybe skip it.\n\nThe only issue that caused me some frustration was the translation of the game. Even in a Steam re-release they couldn't be bothered to check through the script. This is especially prevelent (for me anyway) in battles. I'd be doing damage or being delt damage and the log spew nonsensical broken sentences or some of the ending text/\"cutscene\" text wasn't well translated.

(you, ya fool) After being badly injured you acquire a demon butler, a miniscule pension and a hearty handshake from the King. one day you are drawn inexplicably to a mountain and promptly have an Astrosprog foisted upon you by a god. Like any sensible person suddenly endowed with a ten-year old cosmic starchild that came out of a ball of light you comply and have eight years to properly raise your new daughter.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, you get three blocks of time in a schedule for your daughters time. Each month you must raise money (through conveniently lax medieval child labour laws), send her off to be tutored and level up her stats, and ensure she is healthy and happy. You may also, if you wish, send her off adventuring to loot ancient temples and fight monsters for pocket change and sometimes a nice bit of treasure which also boosts her stats. Prior to deciding upon her schedule you may talk to her, buy things for her for those all-important stat boosts and introduce her to them high-society nobs living in the palace, just make sure you upgrade her manners stat before letting her go near certain people.\n\nSo, how did my first playthrough pan out? Awfully, I ended up bakrupt twice and failed. However once I learned of the Kung-Fu Farmer technique I soon had a teenage badass war-wench raking in the money and kills in a way that wouldn't be out of place in Slayers. So the day of her 18th birhtday came and it was time for daddy's little starsprog to go out into the world and forge her own path in life! Then I found out she utterly sucked at doing paperwork so they refused to let he rinto the army, she established a dojo but had no social skills so she ended up failing as an instructor, she did get married though and I didn't pi*s the gods off by her becoming a delinquent dominatrix (yes... that can happen... don't ask why just try and avoid it...) so, in general, I pretty much didn't screw up entirely.\n\nTo summarise my experience with Princess Maker 2 short of it being about royals shagging it's exactly what you'd expect from the title short of it being called \"Dad Simulator RPG\", if you like the training/tuition/raising aspect of games like Monster Rancher and Digimon World or just have to check it out due to sheer curiosity and a quick laugh I'd wholeheartedly reccomend it. It's a very, very odd duck but i'd say it's worth checking out if you like RPGs or management sims and want something unique. and if Uncle Gabe has put it on sale even better!", "timestamp_created": 1483755590, "timestamp_updated": 1483755724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503946", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29054923": {"recommendationid": "29054923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018647521", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511745338}, "language": "english", "review": "The game that started raising sims.

being rereleased on Steam. I played the original DOSbox PM2 English fan translation endlessly as a child.\n\nHowever, I am disappointed in some of the directions taken with the \"refined\" game. For one thing, the translation is notably worse - several grammatical errors caught my eye in just a few minutes of gameplay, especially in the opening sequence.\n\nFor another, there are several scenes missing throughout the game, for example you (the swordsman) being gifted Cube the butler.\n\nFinally, and this is by far my biggest gripe with the refine, the art. Simply put, no excuses can be made for replacing charming (if dated) sprites, especially those of your daughter that the player will be viewing for 90% of gameplay, with cheap MSPaint-tier knockoffs. They are simply ugly to look at, and very out of place with the original backgrounds.\n\nI will play and likely enjoy PM2R, but I cannot in good faith recommend it to others looking for what I was, which is Princess Maker 2 but a bit shined off and with reliably working audio.\n\n4/10\n\n(Also, I'm a bit disappointed that the cheat menus were not ported as well.

You have some other mini- games such as a simplified battle system you see when wandering the wilderness and there are set events that happen every playthrough. As a game it can be boring if you don\u2019t enjoy stat raising as a main mechanic. \nThe biggest positive to this game is making your own story as you play. Do you raise a saint, a warrior, a housewife?  Crafting your own story is where the fun is at and I find the game enjobable because of it. There is replay value in raising the character a different way, focusing on combat skills, domestic skills, and others.\n\nNegatives\nThere are many problems with the translation. There have not been instances that I couldn\u2019t understand what it meant but it sounds very off. Nothing game breaking but still noteworthy.\nThe end text for me at least scrolled too fast and I couldn\u2019t see much though I think that got patched after my playthrough.  \nIt\u2019s an old game and it feels old. That said if you don\u2019t mind that it is still a fun game. \nThe above-mentioned focus on raising stats may not be enjoyable for many\n\nConclusion. \nI do like this game and think that people should give it a try as it is something different and has plenty of replay value with plenty of endings.  Grab it on sale and give it a go if you are unsure. Watch a video and see if it interests you. I enjoy and recommend it. \n", "timestamp_created": 1480104766, "timestamp_updated": 1480104766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530118", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27436948": {"recommendationid": "27436948", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049183307", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487376058}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[i]Princess Maker 2 Refine[/i] es la primera versi\u00f3n comercial que llega a Occidente. Dicho juego consiste en criar a una ni\u00f1a, tu hija, hasta llegar a la madurez.

En las fases de juego de rol, tu hija debe compeltar una serie de objetivos en un mapa, aunque no ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil porque luchar\u00e1 contra enemigos. A diferencia de otros juegos parecidos, como [i]Long Live the Queen[/i], y otros afines, como [i]Tokimeki Memorial[/i], [i]D\u014dky\u016bsei[/i] o [i]Shin Seiki Evangelion: Ayanami Ikusei Keikaku[/i]; este juego es mucho m\u00e1s completo y variado. Esto lo demuestra el hilo argumental del juegos y sus m\u00e1s de 70 posibles finales. \n\nLos gr\u00e1ficos est\u00e1n actualizados y son m\u00e1s claros. Esta versi\u00f3n permite apreciar los dise\u00f1os e ilustraciones de Takami Akai, aunque este viejo carcamal prefiere los antiguos gr\u00e1ficos de PC98.

Por un lado, la desarrolladora del juego, Gainax, cre\u00f3 las bases para el LSG japon\u00e9s.

I watched it on youtube and thought that's pretty neat, I'll give it a try and so I bought it. I was amazed because this game is very fun. Yes it does have some meh translation now and then but if you ignore that then it's a very good game. The soundtrack is overall pretty decent and the visuals are good for when this game orignally came out. But the gameplay is what is amazing like you can basically make your girl become whatever you want like if you want her to become a warrior or a mage and go into a rpg mode you can do that, but if you just want a normal life simulation you can also get that.

"language": "english", "review": "I've been familiar with Princess Maker 2, mostly due to a Hardcore Gaming 101 article on the saga of this game's near localization back in the nineties. Being a fan of sim games and visual novels. this appealed to me. Then word came that PM2 was coming to Steam. As a port of the redone PS2 release. Well. I promptly bought it. \n\nStory wise, it's pretty simple. At some point, the kingdom the game takes place in got too prideful and full of themselves, so God sent the Demon King and his army after them. A young hero from the east, hearing about the people's plight, takes on the Demon King in battle, and wins. Graciously accepting his defeat, the Demon King leaves, later sending one of his warriors, Cube to serve as your butler. For what it's worth, this tidbit is never mentioned in game, only in extra materials. Anyway, at some point afterwards, Heaven sends you a little girl to raise. You shape her personality through jobs, classes, and errantry. Money WILL be tight, as you only get 500 gold a year, and your little girl helps with her earnings. \n\nFor those who like getting Achievements, this game is a tad wonky when it comes to receiving certain ones.  There's also the translation, which is still a bit off. The developers are working on this, though. The PM community is passionate about these games, and they are considering releasing the others here on Steam (Yay!).\n\nWhat will your daughter grow up to be? Will she survive to adulthood? Will she marry the Prince? A dragon? Your butler? Will her heavenly guardian chew you out for being a bad parent?

I don't really regret it either. I love Princess Maker 2. However, there are a few things that I definitely think can be improved upon:\n\n1) In the orginal DOS game at the end of the game you get a letter from your daughter. She tells you her favorite subjects, what she remembers doing the most, etc. Instead, in Princess Maker 2: Refine, it shows a picture of your daughter, has her speaking in Japanese and absolutely no translation which is honestly super disappointing. (Disregard, I see they did an update last night that should have fixed this issue. I'll have to play through and see how it is!)\n\n2) I wish the menu/interface were a little less clunky? I had the speech setting sped up to 'fast', and I got to the ending where my \"daughter\" became a mistress (oops). I was unable to change the text speed to read the conversation between her, Cube, and the man proposing to \"my daughter\". It kind of detracted from the ending since the speech went too fast and I was unable to change it back.\n\n3) I think the translation needs a bit of work, and I saw in the recent updates that they have addressed that issue. In the original DOS game your \"daughter\" has a \"Sin\" stat bar, in Princess Maker 2 : Refine it's called Karma. It took me 2 play throughs to see that getting Karma up was not a good thing. This is due to the fact that I didn't think hunting would increase sin, and my first play through ended up with a thug ending because her sin was pretty high. I really hope to see an update with sentences and such fixed. I am not sure what it is supposed to mean when you lecture your daughter and she responds with \"but she was not satisified\".\n\nOverall, I love this game. I'll keep playng until I get all 74 endings, I'll do all the marriages and I'll enjoy myself. I think I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't played it in their childhood, but is still interested in raising sims. With 74 endings, and so many different things you can do I don't know how you can't be entertained. I am really hoping the sales of this game will inspire them to translate and bring over Princess Maker 3, 4 and especially 5.", "timestamp_created": 1476318114, "timestamp_updated": 1476318451, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26004885": {"recommendationid": "26004885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013549332", "num_games_owned": 583, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475325903}, "language": "english", "review": "All those Hanako games that we all know and love, this is the game that defined their genre.

You can challenge a specific ending even harder with different settings\n- Errantry! The system from Princess Maker was great, but it gets better in Princess Maker 2\n- Subtitles on endings!

New art, new music, new translation, [b]full voice acting![/b]\n[b]cons:[/b] Got some creepy stuff in it which they made no attempt to remove. This translation is a bit ramshackle. No fast forward button that I'm aware of.\n\nMy narrative is the same as a lot of people: got the unfinished DOS version as a child, played it extensively, rediscovered it later. It's a very cute game that I think ended up having a large female fanbase on accident, kind of like Harvest Moon. I hold it very close to my heart and would recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in this kind of game because I think it's one of the best raising sims out there, but it's not without its flaws.\n\n[b]The story goes as follows:[/b] you're a wandering swordsman, you save a kingdom from demons, God rewards you with a child. You get to raise her however you want, but you don't have a lot of money.\n\nEach month is divided into 3 segments. For each of these, you can either:\n[b]Send her to work[/b] - babysitting, church volunteer, farmwork, etc. more jobs unlock as you get older (raises stats, lowers others, gives money)\n[b]Send her to school[/b] - dance lessons, Science, etc. (only raises stats, but takes money)\n[b]Send her adventuring[/b], a sort of RPG overworld minigame (Yes, you can send your 10 year old into a frozen tundra with no weapons or armor if you really want to)\n[b]Give her some free time[/b] (Work and school will both accumulate stress that needs to be relieved or she will fall ill)\n\nThroughout your play, your daughter's stats will gradually shape into something that determines the final ending she gets. Will she become a member of the nobility? A child of the arts? A great warrior? Or something more sinister?\n\nThe game's most prominent feature, I think, is its replayability. [b]Notably, there are 74 endings[/b], and several possible marriages on top of that. Something as simple as your daughter's birthday and blood type might result in a different starting layout for your stats. There are a lot of hidden secrets, and you might find some of the stats have surprising uses (or consequences).\n\nYou can play the game in a lot of different ways and the game doesn't penalize you for it - maybe you want to be a magical girl and adventure every other week, paying your way through Theology and Magic classes with loot, or maybe you never want to touch adventuring and work her way through Poetry classes by working at a hair salon. Neither of these are wrong ways to play!\n\n[b]Now, for the bad:[/b]\n\n[b]This translation, as others have stated, is not as coherent as the original beta one[/b]. Fortunately and unfortunately, it's the worst at the start of the game and the end of the game, meaning that for the most part the translation is very serviceable, but you get dialogue like [spoiler]\"From there, it would seem she made an excellent turn.\"[/spoiler] during your ending. Uh, what? I only knew it meant [spoiler]\"Your daughter was excellent at her job.\"[/spoiler] thanks to having played the original.\n\nHowever, the localization team seems to be responsive to complaints and committed to making edits to fix the game, including (supposedly, I haven't tested) fixing several broken achievements and adding subtitles to the voiceover-only ending after enough people complained, and there's a suggestion thread in the forums for finding typos or localization errors.\n\nAlso, for those of you hoping they removed the creepier parts of this game: [b]Nope.[/b] You can still:\n\n1. [spoiler]MARRY YOUR DAUGHTER (it's not incest if it's not blood related, apparently!)[/spoiler], something that from the lack of an achievement for it I'd hoped they had removed for the Steam release\n2. see your underage daughter naked in several vacation CGs, even if the beta version made attempts to remove this\n3. hear your daughter talk to her FATHER about how she wishes her chest was bigger (please stop, oh my God)\n4. buy pills that increase chest size from a shady salesman\n\nThese are gross and I wish they'd been removed. Unlike something like the shadier venues you can work at when you get older which you can argue serve a gameplay purpose, increasing your 12 year old's bust size serves no real purpose except being [i]extremely creepy![/i]\n\nIn summation, [b]if you love this kind of game or played it as a kid and are willing to overlook creepiness and translation errors, get it,[/b] it's a hidden gem with a lot of heart and seems to have a good team behind it. [b]If you think you'd enjoy it but you're not sure you want to spend $20 on it, wait for a sale[/b] or perhaps try the DOS version first to see if it's the kind of game you like before coming back to buy it.", "timestamp_created": 1476054092, "timestamp_updated": 1476261258, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25942197": {"recommendationid": "25942197", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976846524", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475999803}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u4eca\u5929\u7d42\u65bc\u53c8\u7834\u95dc\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21(\u7d50\u5c40\u662f\u666e\u901a\u4e3b\u5a66) \u4e0d\u904e\u5be6\u5728\u592a\u4e45\u9060\u4e86 \u7e3d\u89ba\u5f97\u8ddf\u4ee5\u524d\u6709\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\n\u76ee\u524d\u78ba\u5b9a\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u5bc6\u6280\u73fe\u5728\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528\u4e86 \u5e0c\u671b\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u5bc6\u6280\u4fee\u6539\u56de\u4f86\n\u9084\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u4eba\u90fd\u6709\u63d0\u5230\u570b\u738b\u7684\u65b0\u8863 \u9019\u9ede\u6211\u89ba\u5f97\u662f\u56e0\u70baSTEAM\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u554f\u984c \u56e0\u70baSTEAM\u4e0a\u904a\u6232\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u60c5\u8272\u90e8\u5206\n\u53ef\u80fd\u570b\u5916\u7684\u65b0\u8863\u5b9a\u7fa9\u5c6c\u65bc\u7981\u6b62\u4e8b\u9805 \u6240\u4ee5\u624d\u88ab\u62d4\u6389\u5427\n\u6574\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\u9084\u662f\u63a8\u85a6\u9019\u6b3e\u904a\u6232 \u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u628aBUG\u4fee\u5b8c \u800c\u4e14\u8a72\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5167\u5bb9\u88dc\u56de\u4f86\n\nBUG:\n1.\u9812\u734e\u5178\u79ae\u7684\u9812\u932f\u5b57\u4e86\n2.\u6253\u5de5\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u597d\u50cf\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u52a0\u85aa\u4e26\u6c92\u6709\u589e\u52a0 \u4ee5\u6211\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u4f86\u8aaa\u662f\u4fdd\u6bcd \u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u52a0\u85aa5\u5143 \u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u8aaa\u52a0\u85aa\u9084\u662f5\u5143\n\n\u5e0c\u671b\u65b0\u589e:\n\u5e0c\u671b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u5716\u9451\u6a21\u5f0f \u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5973\u5152\u6bcf\u5e74\u8207\u7236\u89aa\u51fa\u904a\u7684\u5716\u9451\u8207\u7d50\u5c40\u5716\u9451 \u9019\u90e8\u5206\u597d\u50cf\u662f\u4e09\u4ee3\u624d\u6709?", "timestamp_created": 1476000789, "timestamp_updated": 1476000789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536858", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25940482": {"recommendationid": "25940482", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995959284", "num_games_owned": 356, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496761716}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u795e\u30b2\u30fc\uff01\u307e\u3055\u304b\u30b9\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u7526\u3063\u305f\uff01\u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089\u3001\u305a\u3063\u3068\u9ad8\u304f\u3066\u8cb7\u3048\u306a\u3044\u30e1\u30e2\u30ea\u30a2\u30eb\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1475991648, "timestamp_updated": 1475991648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25938367": {"recommendationid": "25938367", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246645940", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488121803}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ee5\u524d\u53ea\u73a9\u8fc74\uff0c\u770bsteam\u4e0a\u6709\u4e862\u5c31\u6765\u73a9\u73a9\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u79d8\u7c4d\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u9057\u61be\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u8fd8\u4e0d\u592a\u8981\u7d27\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u6210\u5c31\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e74\u9f84\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7279\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5feb\u70b9\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e5f\u5e0c\u671b\u5176\u5b83\u51e0\u90e8\u4e5f\u5feb\u70b9\u4e0a\u6765\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1475979776, "timestamp_updated": 1475979776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25936328": {"recommendationid": "25936328", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999600153", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 443, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479233002}, "language": "english", "review": "You play the part of a hero that was granted a child by the gods. A pure, innocent little girl who has been sheltered from the world in ways only the gods can shelter. Or at least, only the gods could get away with such treatment of a child. It comes across as being similar to keeping a newborn in the basement for the first ten years of her life, only interacting with her on a basic level and not allowing any contact with the world outside. Someone call heavenly child services! \n\nYou have to raise her from that tender age of ten, arranging for everything from her diet, to her clothes, to her education. Raising a child and giving her a good education isn't cheap, either. How can a single adoptive father, on a stipend from the kindgom of a meager 500 gold per year, afford it? On a normal diet, the girl eats 360 gold per year, and the other 140 isn't nearly enough for all the little things a child needs, or anything resembling an education. Well, the answer is obvious. Put her to work! \n\nFrom the age of 10, your adoptive daughter can do work as a babysitter, watching over other children barely any younger than her and keeping them out of trouble. Or she could work on a farm, buiding up her strength and destroying her appearance. Or, for a penny a day, she could work at the church... she'll even get sundays off! Wait... what? \n\nDoing jobs and taking classes will raise some of the girl's stats and lower others, and the fun of the game is all the different ways your daughter can turn out. A dancer! A painter! A poet! She can become loved by high society, and leave her mark on the world through her arts. Or... an Archmage! A Hero! She can learn to wield might and magic, and even challenge the very god of war in her adventures! Or... A hunter! A... concubine? The [i]demon queen[/i]?!?!

That said, the company has continued to work on the game, and many of the breaking bugs that prevented me from enjoying it have been fixed. If you can't get yourself a copy of the original english game, this one is still very enjoyable. You can easily sink 100 hours into it trying to unlock all the endings.\n-------\nI am an old fan of this game, and played it to death years and years ago when only a leaked, unfinished english translation was available. When I heard it was going to get an official english release, I was ecstatic, and purchased it on the first day.\n\nUnfortunately, I can not recommend the game for purchase in its current state. There are several serious bugs that heavily impact my enjoyment, the translation is /terrible/, and the entire ending sequence seems to have been missed. How do you miss translating the ending? I do not know.

Runs in fullscreen (which the screenshots don't show, it works with widescreen resolutions and looks good)\nHowever, the translation isn't as good.\nThe big difference though is that this version is uncensored, there's nudity where there wasn't in the old one. \nThe game is almost perfect for kids, and the updates are mostly making the game better for that. The nudity and sexual comments and innuendo being more direct now, take away all that.\nHopefully when the other games in the series get translated they're more kid friendly. As if it wasn't for the gross 'fanservice' they'd be the perfect game for kids. \nBeyond localisation there seemed to be only a couple minor bugs and some achievements not being counted. But nothing gamebreaking.\n\nPast comparisons, PM2 is a fun game. Time management with a good story and a fun RPG minigame, where you can strike down the God of War. While theoretically you're playing an offscreen adoptive parent, really you're playing a demigod girl sent to live among the mortals and managing your education till the age of 18 when you find out how things turn out.\nIt's a bit old fashioned in its morals. Marriage and child raising are held above career achievements in measuring success. But thats a small thing, its a game where you can rise to being anything from the Queen, mercenary wizard to the ruler of hell.

I must say... I really enjoyed it! I've never experienced this type of game before so it felt a bit strange. I would recommend this game to anyone that doesn't mind the old style anime appeal and a text based adventure that you play a part in. My ony major complaint is that at the end of teh game, the Daughter says how she felt in Japanese with no translation! I even used a translation app to try and get the gist of what she was talking about, but it couldn't hear her clear enough. Also, I'm not sure if this is a glitch or whatever, but my Daughter, kept failing doing the Inn job, even though I spammed it until I reached max cooking. As everyone mentions, the translation can be bad, but I haven't found it to be distracting at all. But in spite of the downsides, I really loved this game! The girl, seeing her age from 10 to 18 really pulls at your heartstrings and makes you feel like you bonded and raised this (hopefully) great girl thats now a woman. I felt proud knowing that my little girl turned into a noble soldier.\n\nSo in short:\nPros\nFantastic music\nEngaging classic RPG fighting/adventure\nMany Endings\nDiverse ways to play\nTruly endearing\nPacing feels great (8 years to see things unfold)\n\nCons:\nCertain Stats feel a less useful (ie temperment)\nTranslation (Average player shouldn't be too annoyed)\nDaughter's Life Summary words not subtitled (God this is the worst! Please fix)\n\nWishes:\nMore clothing would have been awsome. /thnking about all the playthroughs I could do, seeing the few thats present is kind of dissappointing. The could even have the same stats as clothing already present.Think of them as \"alternative\" outfits.\nAn \"Ending Vault\" so that I can view the Daughter's Life Summary after I unlock it. This would be cool, as the player would feel like even like their Daughter is gone but not forgotten.\nThe other Princess Makers! I saw that Princess Maker 5 was created in Japan. I'm thankful for this one we have, but I would expect Princess Maker 5 to be even more incredible. I would even be happy if we got 3 and 4 first within quick succession.\n\nI hope my horrible review helps someone decide if this game is worth their time. If you enjoy life simulation, I think this \"schedule\" style simulation is a good approach. It really makes you feel like you're raising a Daughter in an anime styled world. I imagine the playthroughs feel uniquely different as you don't have time to make some \"god\" character. Can't wait for tomorrow since I will be making my second Daughter! \n\nIf the Developer's see this review. Please fix that subtitle problem! I felt so disconennected from my Daughter at that time. It was almost sadder then knowing she has grown up and left her Father...\n\n5 Stars *****", "timestamp_created": 1475476448, "timestamp_updated": 1475476448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544472", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25832983": {"recommendationid": "25832983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058740351", "num_games_owned": 1079, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 309, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487702746}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5728\u5fae\u535a\u770b\u5230\u8981\u767b\u5f55steam\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u5f88\u6fc0\u52a8,\u8bb0\u5f97\u4ee5\u524d\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u662f\u5728\u67d0\u9ed1\u7f51\u5427,\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b3e\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5c31\u662f\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u68a6\u5de5\u53822,\u8bb0\u5f97\u5f53\u65f6\u6253\u51fa\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u5251\u58eb\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40,\u5fd8\u4e86\u5566.\u5f53\u65f6\u627e\u4e00\u4e0b\u653b\u7565\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd8\u80fd\u7236\u5ac1\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u5bf9\u6211\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5f53\u65f6\u8fd8\u662f\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6211\u6709\u591a\u5927\u523a\u6fc0!\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8c8c\u4f3csteam\u7248\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528\u4f5c\u5f0a\u7801\u4e86\u54e6,\u6211\u8fd8\u5f88\u671f\u5f85[spoiler]\u201c\u7687\u5e1d\u7684\u65b0\u8863\u201d[/spoiler]\u54c8\u54c8\u54c8,\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6700\u8ba9\u6211\u719f\u6089\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u7b2c5\u90e8\u5566,\u9f99\u65cf\u738b\u5b50\u548c\u9b54\u65cf\u738b\u5b50\u62a2\u6211\u5973\u513f![spoiler]\u201c\u660e\u660e\u5973\u513f\u662f\u8981\u5ac1\u7ed9\u6211\u7684\u554a!\u201d[/spoiler]\u597d\u5566,\u5e0c\u671b\u540e\u7eed\u4ea7\u54c1\u80fd\u9010\u6b65\u767b\u5f55steam,\u8fd8\u6211\u5c0f\u5b66\u751f\u68a6!", "timestamp_created": 1475466613, "timestamp_updated": 1475466613, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25832921": {"recommendationid": "25832921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141209582", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477012763}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e76\u4e0d\u60f3\u8bf4\u592a\u591a\uff0c\u5973\u513f\uff0c\u7238\u7238\u6765\u63a5\u4f60\u56de\u5bb6\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1475466132, "timestamp_updated": 1475466132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25832741": {"recommendationid": "25832741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032044525", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475464505}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Princess Maker 2 combines three of my favorite things: pet-raising simulators, dozens of endings, and playing matchmaker.[/h1]\n\nUnlike a Tamagotchi, your daughter (probably) isn't going to end up dead in a room full of nothing but poop. I can't confirm since I haven't gotten all 70ish endings, but she's a lot more likely to grow up to be the queen of all poops. Or a dancer, which might be worse--I didn't spend [i]eight years[/i] and tens of thousands of gold on a top-notch education just for you to become a [i]dancer,[/i] sweetie.\n\nNow you, too, have the opportunity to probably be a terrible parent without risking permanent damage to your delicate lady parts or 18 years' worth of child support payments. In real life, careless parenting is pretty much limited to leaving your child unattended for hours in the nearest Walmart. In Princess Maker 2, your precious daughter can literally marry Satan when she grows up. Next time, don't let her work at the cabaret and partake in underage drinking, Dad.\n\nYou're (probably) not going to hell after playing this game, despite the old DOS version\u2019s greatly exaggerated reputation. And if you do, at least you have a shot at marrying the supreme ruler of Hell--if your poorly raised daughter hasn't married him first. The only thing removed from the original game is the cheat/debug mode, so you have to actually raise your child and force her to work or explore and fight in the RPG sections if you want a steady supply of cash.\n\nAs I pushed my daughter to the brink of exhaustion and forced her to work on the farm for weeks at a time, I realized I didn\u2019t care enough about her dreams and feelings. I cared about [i]results[/i]: getting her the best marriage partner, raising her to be the strongest combatant in the realm\u2026okay, and the actual game achievements. Right now, some of them are kind of buggy, but they\u2019re all legitimately attainable. I assume they\u2019ll be fixed in a later patch.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the current translation is a bit rough around the edges and your daughter\u2019s speech at the end of the game desperately needs subtitles\u2014unless you\u2019re fluent in Japanese. I am glad for the added voice acting, though it can get repetitive after a while. Setting the text to instant (or \u201cWithout wait,\u201d as the odd translation puts it) helps a lot if you\u2019re speeding through to get different achievements and endings. It\u2019s a shame the Steam overlay doesn\u2019t work, but it might be unavoidable considering the age of the game.\n\nDespite the minor issues I have with PM2, I\u2019d love to see Princess Makers 3-5 on Steam someday, so I can continue to accidentally torment my innocent blank slate of a child as I try to shape her into what I failed to become in my own life.

The graphics while better aren't as charming, the music is a bit buggy and the translation has weird moments (\"Your daughter has been defeated by\" being your victory screen for example) but at the same time, its just as fun as the original game. I wouldn't go as far and say the port is terrible, but take it as a warning. \n\nNow onto the actual game. Its great. You ever play Long Live The Queen? They're fairly similar games. The main difference being that Long Live The Queen being more focused on political and militaristic aspect of castle life, this game is more of a general life simulator set in a castle. You can do so much with raising your daughter, its pretty insane how much content their is in that regard. You can train her to be a soldier, a priestess, a teacher, a dancer, a singer, an artist, a witch, any blend of those and so much more. The game has over 40 endings too!\n\nThe game also has a combat system and dungeon exploration if you chose a more offensive route. They're extremely simple, but they get the job done and are pretty rewarding. I do wish the dungeon exploration had more to it, but its still fun for what it is. On another note, the soundtrack of the game is pretty underrated. While its not the best, the tunes in the game are very relaxing and make me feel at ease. \n\nThis game isn't without its flaws however. My biggest gripe is that your daughter can get extremely overpowered relatively early in the game. I'm only in Year 2 (out of 8) and I'm already one-shotting dragons and winning the Harvest Festival. I think they did it to try to make your daughter proficient at several task at once but its still a bit wonky. The game can also get weird sometimes. You can feed her breast-expanding pills as early as Year 1 and one of the endings involves you marrying your daughter. Weird stuff..\n\nOverall, a great life simulation game. Probably my favorite, even better than Long Live The Queen in my book.", "timestamp_created": 1475318090, "timestamp_updated": 1475318090, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 3,

I can only justify buying this to send a message that the west wants these games.  It's up to you to decide if you want to spend $20 on a worse version of a game from 1993 - along with my hesitant recommendation, I recommend reading into the history of SoftEgg's attempt at bringing the game to the US if you're on the fence.  I may not know how tl;dr works.\n\nLike most of the other reviewers, I played the DOS version of this game a TON when I was growing up.  I consider the story behind that version's failed release to be one of the greatest disappointments in video game history - look into it, if you feel so inclined.  Had the release succeeded, we may well have seen official English releases for many more Gainax titles.  Titles I have never played, and would sorely like to.  The fact that this is actually getting an official release in western markets now, so long after the fact, is surprising.  However, there is one thing that is preventing me from fully embacing this release: the translation.\n\nAs others have noted, the translation is vastly inferior to the unreleased DOS version.  The opening text crawl, which you can see on the Store page, has some amazing Engrish (to be fair, nothing else in the game quite reaches that level).  There are grammatical and spelling errors abound, and in a game that is largely text based it's pretty annoying.  In addition, certain stats and skills now have names that don't really make sense.  Charisma has become Glamour, Refinement has become Elegance, and neither of those are really troubling.  But in a game where the religious symbolism is extremely western (crosses and nuns), why has \"Sin\" become \"Karma?\"  It doesn't even make any sense.  You actually GAIN karma for doing sinful things, and if I hadn't made the connection to the DOS version, I may have thought that was a good thing.  Also, and this is admittedly a minor point, Conversation is now \"Speech.\"  The skill is basically tracking your daughter's ability to engage in witty conversation with people, so Conversation is far more appropriate.  Speech sounds more like she's learning to speak properly... yet, the only way to increase it is by working at the Bar, and proper speech is actually governed by Decorum.  It's silly.\n\nIt makes me sad that such an inferior version of the translation has seen a release that the DOS version never did.  I yearn for the days of the original's nostalgic, pixelized art, though I'm willing to accept that that's more about my own nostalgia - the art isn't really bad.  I think some of the art has altered your daughter's poses as she grows, but that may have something to do with blood type, and I've only played one game, so I can't definitively state that's the case.\n\nAlso, another minor point (not so minor?) - going full screen stretches the game's aspect ratio rather than retaining it via a border or something.  It looks terrible, so play windowed.  And why did my daughter stare lovingly at me and speak Japanese to me for 90 seconds upon completion of the game?  There was no text in that segment, which if I recall from the DOS version, was a letter your daughter wrote to you thanking you for all you've done for her.\n\nHonestly, I'm not sure if I want to recommend this.  The unofficial DOS version is better in just about every way.  I don't condone piracy at all, but it's hard to justify paying $20 for an inferior version of a game from the early 90s.  I haven't looked into what the community is doing with this release - if smarter people than I are going to find a way to crack and fix this game, then buy it.  I bought it solely because I want to send a message to the Japanese makers of games like these that there is a market for them in the west.

And the worst you'll get is gods complaining about you, or getting her raped/killed.\n\nHuh...ya know, Gainax having their hands on this at all makes too much sense now...\nOH and for anyone wondering, cheat codes are gone.", "timestamp_created": 1475188738, "timestamp_updated": 1475188738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499351", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25772961": {"recommendationid": "25772961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061099130", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515713554}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, I didn't expect a full voice or better music than older version\nbut turn out it really good.  \ngive it a try", "timestamp_created": 1475187639, "timestamp_updated": 1475187639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25772325": {"recommendationid": "25772325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041201967", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475483468}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, and the remake adds some good things.

There are also many game endings depending on what events you choose to attend/how you train her. She can end up marrying a dragon, becoming a nun, a court magician, and if you're feeling a bit depraved you can sell her into prostitution or marriage.

Only thing missing is Fast Eddy and the Un-dress, which were not present in the 2004 Refine port (of which this is a translation) anyway.\n\nThe translations itself is... ok... with the opening scrawl being far and away the worst offender.

I first played this game as a child and had a difficult time understanding the terminology in the DOS version. As a result, a child may have an easier time understanding this.\n+ The Art is less grainy and more refined; somewhat brighter. The flowers in the vase change by the season \u2013 which I thought was a nice touch.\n+ 'Olive/Daughter' feels less sexualized in this version.\n+ I liked that I could talk to my Daughter multiples times about various things. In the old version it greyed out after one conversation.\nUPDATE 2nd play through:\n+ The People with bounty on their heads were easier to find this time. In the old version I had to approach the same building multiple times in order to prompt the event.\n\nWhat I disliked about Refine:\n- I'm not sure it was necessary to change the main art for 'Olive/Daughter' in the main gameplay screen. It's not that I dislike the new art, but it felt out of place with the older art. The poses were also different which I don't know if I cared for. The Red Dress seemed rushed compared to the original.\n- When I completed the game and had reached the results the DOS version had a letter that your Daughter had written about how she was raised. Refine has a new image with new art of Olive/Daughter and she was speaking in Japanese with no text. Which I believe is just a bug or oversight currently.\n- I feel like the new art was made to portray her more as a Daughter and not a potential lover; which is for the better really. However, in the Vacation scenes she is still naked in various scenes and poses. If the art was updated why wasn't that updated as well? She also talks about her bust and butt too from time to time when you talk to her. In the old version she would ask: \"Do you think my figure is okay?\" from time to time instead of her butt.\n- The font that was chosen for the text is not as nice as it was for the old version.

This version has non-pixelated art which, although not as charming as the original's, is pretty nice. The game also gives you a choice to use the original MIDI or WAV, and there's Japanese voice acting as well.\n\nFor people who've never played this before, it's basically a scheduling game. You select what your daughter does from month to month: Certain activities build up certain stats, which make certain endings possible, and the fun lies in finding out how your actions play out. There are also brief interludes with simple JRPG-style combat and exploration.\n\nWhile I'm happy that the game is on Steam, the English translation is painfully sloppy. The introductory movie is full of substandard English, and the game itself is full of typos: Amourer instead of armourer, for example.\n\nTypos don't prevent people from playing the game, but because Princess Maker 2 relies on the quality and charm of its writing, I urge CFK to do the right thing and improve the translation in a patch. As it stands, the typos make the game look like a quick and dirty port, which does CFK's reputation no favors.\n\nEdit: Now that I've played a game through, I can see that there's another serious fault. In the DOS version, your daughter would write you a letter when she became an adult, either thanking you or criticizing you for your parenting. In the Steam version, she reads that letter aloud in Japanese, but there's no English text. If you don't speak Japanese, then, you're out of luck as far as understanding what she's saying. This means that what was a touching moment in the DOS version is now just going to leave a lot of English-speaking players confused.

Soon after that you encounter a goddess who tell you to raise the girl as your own daughter. From there you will choose how she dress, whats her diet, what she study, and what she do as a job. The game have a lot of little detail that are nice to see, such as if her diet is poor then she will have harder time work jobs that take more stamina. Or if she go to the beach for vacation, then she'll come back with a tan. You have 8 years to raise the girl (she's 10 when the game start) into a young lady. Really there a lot to do in this game and it will require many playthroughs to see many of the different endings and events of the game. \n\nMy one con to this game is that it doesn't really give you a tutorial or hints to let you know which jobs raise/lower what stats before you do it. So your first couple playthroughs will most likely be fumbling around to see what cause what effect, or what the best way to handle a problem (such as the daughter getting sick or becoming a delinquent). Heck it took me a while to figure out why everyone kept dodging my daughter attacks while she was in combat (yea you can send your daughter adventuring out and fighting monsters).\n\nAll in all, this is a child raising sim with an addictive play style to it.

I have played all PM1, PM2, PM3 (Faery Tales Come True) PM4, PM5 and the cell phone verion PM. PM2 was originally relased as PC-9801 and was then released to support windows 95. \"Refine\" version was then released to support Win XP. Now it's redefined to support more recent OS via Steam.\nI am glad to see the game brought back to life again!\n\nIn this game, you become a father of a girl given to you from the skies. You will be taking care of her for eight years. During those years, you will have her earn her moneys from working, and let her attend classes to boost her skills. To turn her into a Princess is all in your hands!\n\nGame features:\nAdventure mode - Gear up your daughter! Attend classes to boost combat skills.\nOnce a year events - Choose from Cooking / Art / Dance / Combat. Demonstrate your skills to your competitors!\nVacations - Boost those skills. Cute illustrations to make some memories.\nMeet the NPCs in the castle - Let them know who you are. Be the lady they're looking for.\nMany endings - Her future depends all on you. Did her dream come true?\n\nPros: Great game to play repeatedly as there's many different endings. It also has great portraits at the end of the game / Fun adventure mode. Visit all four areas! / Challenging once a year event. Show off your talents! / Full voiced in Japanese (voices weren't available until Refine version) / That nostalgic MIDI sounds and musics / Supports Win 10 - 64 bit / All ending achivements are added (Patch 02/18/17)\n\nCons: Eight years will pass by FAST/ Screen size is 800x600. High resolution even on full creen mode / Some bugs are game braker (Fixed on 02/18/17 patch) Some game bug has been reported + I have experienced myself as well:When you click an item in the 2nd page of your inventory, your daughter's Faith goes down to 0. There's so far no way to raise the faith back above 0. It negatively affects your daughter's daily routine and her ending.\n\n\n\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\u80b2\u6210\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3001\uff33\uff54\uff45\uff41\uff4d\u7248\u3068\u3057\u3066\u8607\u308a\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\n\u65e7\u7248\uff08\uff24\uff2f\uff33\u7248\uff09\u306e\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u7248\uff08\uff37\uff49\uff4e\uff38\uff30\uff09\u3092\uff33\uff54\uff45\uff41\uff4d\u306b\u79fb\u690d\u3057\u305f\u30d0\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u306e\uff37\uff41\uff56\uff45\uff08\uff30\uff23\uff2d\uff09\u97f3\u6e90\u3067\u518d\u751f\u3055\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u5a18\u3084\u5a18\u306b\u304b\u304b\u308f\u308b\u3059\u3079\u3066\u306e\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u304c\u97f3\u58f0\u3042\u308a\u3067\u8a71\u3057\u304b\u3051\u3066\u304f\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u5a18\u3092\u5192\u967a\u306b\u884c\u304b\u305b\u305f\u308a\u3001\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u306b\u52b1\u3093\u3067\u3001\u304a\u7a3d\u53e4\u306b\u884c\u304b\u305b\u308b\u3082\u3042\u306a\u305f\u6b21\u7b2c\uff01\n\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u5a18\u306b\u3069\u3093\u306a\u5c06\u6765\u304c\u5f85\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u306e\u304b\u306a\uff1f\n\n\u826f\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\uff1a\n\u2606\u3000\u79fb\u690d\u306a\u306e\u3067\u7d75\u67c4\u304c\u5909\u308f\u3063\u305f\u308f\u3051\u3067\u3082\u306a\u304f\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u3082\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u3002\u61d0\u304b\u3057\u3044\u904a\u3073\u306a\u308c\u305f\uff30\uff2d\uff12\u305d\u306e\u3082\u306e\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u2606\u3000\u307b\u304b\u306e\uff30\uff2d\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3068\u306f\u9055\u3044\u3001\u5a18\u3092\u5192\u967a\u306b\u884c\u304b\u305b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u2606\u3000\u53ce\u7a6b\u796d\u3067\u5a18\u81ea\u6162\u3002\u6c7a\u6226\u3092\u52dd\u3061\u629c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n\u2606\u3000\u5168\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u306e\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30a2\u30c1\u30fc\u30d6\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\u304c\u5897\u3048\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002(\u30d1\u30c3\u30c102/18/17)\n\u2606\u3000\u30ea\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30f3\u7248\u306e\u79fb\u690d\u306a\u306e\u3067\u97f3\u58f0\u4ed8\u304d\u3002\u97f3\u58f0\uff2f\uff26\uff26\u3067\u3082\u904a\u3079\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u2606\u3000\u30c6\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u8868\u793a\u306f\u9045\u3044\u3001\u666e\u901a\u3001\u65e9\u3044\u306e\uff13\u8a2d\u5b9a\u3064\u304d\u3002\n\u2606\u3000\uff12\uff15\uff16\uff10\uff58\uff11\uff14\uff14\uff10\u30e2\u30cb\u30bf\u30fc\u3067\u30d5\u30eb\u30b9\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3067\u904a\u3093\u3067\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u753b\u50cf\u306f\u9ad8\u753b\u8cea\u3067\u3059\u3002\n\n\u60aa\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\uff1a\n\u2606\u3000(10/21/16

Players fight and possess different monsters to gain new abilities and stat increases. Each monster is effectively a new class, unlocking abilities as the form level ups. Gaining new abilities like Scurry or Envenom is a nice bonus to the stat boost that come with the leveling up.\n\nThe music is nice, and fits well with the dungeon theme. The graphics are nice, but items can be hard to spot at times. Luckily, the game has a feature that essentially highlights the item location to allow for easy pickup.\n\nEach floor that you progress through adds new enemies, some are just varients of previous foes, but some are suprisingly tough. Enemies slowly increase in difficulty, and murdering everything on a floor is usually necessary to gain levels to make up for the difficulty. Also picking the proper monster to level up as is important. Zombies give constitution bonuses, aka more health, while rats give general bonuses. Focusing your levels is important to a long run. Likewise, picking which stat to level up is important, since you only gain 3 stat points per level to be divided amoungst 4 stats.\n\nI originally played MidBoss when it was in it's early alpha stages at MomoCon a few years back. It caught my attention then, and was a delight to play in the indie showcase. Even surprised one of the devs by carefully kiting an enemy around the exit of the floor, slowly widdling it's health down with poison, while I had only 2 hp myself. Won a free copy of the game, and promptly lost the code once I got home. But it's for the best as paying for the game supports the devs to make more interesting games. I strongly recommend MidBoss, or if you don't want to buy it, I recommend at least watching some gameplay of it.", "timestamp_created": 1514556558, "timestamp_updated": 1514556558, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38313675": {"recommendationid": "38313675", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023893421", "num_games_owned": 1330, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511838842}, "language": "english", "review": "Footage of the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeTDgoQJcDQ\n\nMidboss is a fun idea for a dungeon crawler.

Combined with the fact you don't regenerate HP naturally, this means that to survive hairy encounters you have to time your possessions carefully AND choose who you possess carefully.\n\nA pet peeve of mine with roguelikes is that some tend to obfuscate information, forcing you to dig through a wiki to find out what to do with your stats or what decisions to make during combat, but MidBoss is very \"up front\" with information, letting you make tricky decisions in a informed manner. There's some notable exceptions where the game is deliberately obtuse about certain mechanics, but these exceptions don't seem to affect gameplay significantly or at all, which is very much appreciated.\n\nGame length felt pretty long specially for a first playthrough. which can be pretty scary if you're not used to losing a character 6+ hours in, but I see that as a feature. If you *really* don't want to die you can look up a guide so you know what to expect on later floors but it's not as fun that way IMO.\n\nAs of this review I do have to say that backtracking in large levels or going up and down floors repeatedly can get tedious and affect replayability, BUT according to the developer map sizes are being adjusted and there's a fast travel feature coming up soon which would solve that issue. \n\nEven with the aforementioned problem, for my first playthrough there was enough content to go through that I had a lot of fun, I have around 20 hours in this game (not including idling) which is awesome value for what you pay, I definitely recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1510009968, "timestamp_updated": 1510009968, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525102", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36331439": {"recommendationid": "36331439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017791601", "num_games_owned": 266, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499731376}, "language": "english", "review": "An enjoyable little roguelike; I followed the development through its early stages, and it has been fun the entire time from then on.", "timestamp_created": 1510007808, "timestamp_updated": 1510007808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36315049": {"recommendationid": "36315049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021990510", "num_games_owned": 610, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509944701}, "language": "english", "review": "I've only spent a bit of time playing MidBoss currently, but it's a simple to play game that I can definitely see coming back to time and time again.

First is the possession mechanic. It's been done before, but MidBoss manages to make it feel freshby allowing for the use of the abilities of the creatures you possess without requiring you to possess them every single time you want to use them. For example, I made extensive use of the vampire bat's leeching skill in pretty much every form I used.\n\nThe second thing that I took notice of \u2014 and the far more meaningful thing, in my opinion \u2014 is how much thought went into this game about accessability. This naturally includes the color-blind graphics mode, which has never really been more than an afterthought for most games. More surprisingly, though, MidBoss also includes mechanics that help players enjoy the game, even if they aren't a fan of rogue-likes. The presence of Quick Play mode and Death Cards \u2014 which act both as a record of your game and as an assist for your next playthrough \u2014 demonstrate that MidBoss is actively avoiding the insular elitism that plagues genres like rogue-likes. I can only hope other games and genres follow suit.\n\nI should also note that this game is wonderfully easy on low-end systems. I played it on a 2-year-old budget laptop without any notable slow-downs or stuttering.\n\nMy list of cons about this game are few, and mostly revolve around the controls. The game can be slow to accept inputs, and some movements are puzzlingly unavailable: most notably, you can attack diagonally around wall corners, but you can't move that same way.\n\nIf these are the worst problems I have with the game, though, I'd say it's a small price to pay. MidBoss is a fun, engaging game with a delightfully snarky sense of humor and a welcoming approach that many of its fellow rogue-likes seem to fear.

It's satisfying enough although starting at zero again can get tedious. Some of this tedium is relieved by a few other interesting mechanics like death cards and custom games.\n\nPros:\nCombat - The possession system means your available skills and stat build are always in flux, so how you approach each fight changes according to who you are fighting and who you happen to be at the time. This makes combat a fun exercise in strategy.\n\nLoot - There is lots here, tiered randomly generated rarites and uniques. Each playthrough will have you wearing something different and hoping for the next big drop.\n\nGraphics - The graphics are crisp and easy on the eyes. They're not 3d masterpieces, but that's unnecessary in a game like this.\n\nDeath Cards - You die in this game a LOT. Fortunately, you can use a card to use a previous run's seed. This allows you to know what loot will drop, what monsters will be where, what the layout will be, etc. You can also use a card once to give your new imp a piece of equipment that your old imp died with. If you had a favourite unique or legendary you can pass it on and get a headstart. While this can only be done once per card, you can save death cards and use multiple cards for a single run, potentially decking your new imp out in some impressive gear.\n\nCustom games - If the standard mode has got you annoyed, you can always make a custom game with the cards stacked in your favor. This doesn't mean you won't die, it just means you can have a bit higher chance at living. \n\nCons:\nUnlockable modes - I like the idea of \"retro graphic modes\" but they seem to be just overlays. The problems arise when the text becomes unreadable because it. For example, the P&P mode is nice looking, but because it just strips out color the text becomes white blocks with thin black outlines on a white background. In an actual p&p setting the writing would be bold black. Overall I collectively call the retro modes \"aaaah my eyes!.\"\n\nRepetitive - Honestly this is something that all permadeaths inherently suffer from, so it's not much of a con as long as you know what you're getting into. Every death means going through the same motions from the start again and again.\n\nThat's about it.

There is huge promise here.\nThere are also many annoyances here (such as no having no shortcuts for items - wtf?) and the death card mechanic simply not working (I have many cards, yet always the same two ones show up when a new char is created), etc.\n\nBut what really breaks this game is that when you die, it will not be your own fault.\nNow, I know this sounds like whining from someone having no clue what he is doing, but let me tell you, I have played them all: ADOM, ToME, Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup, Caves Of Qud, Dwarf Fortress, Rogue: Legacy, Everspace, etc. And also finished them all (at least those that really have a \"finished\" state). I do know what I talk about when talking about roguelikes.\n\nIn good roguelikes (especially the best, ToME), you will know what you did wrong when you died. You might have been too brave, ill-prepared, used wrong spells, etc. You get punished for mistakes and rewarded for playing well. As it should be.\nIn bad roguelikes, the game may at any point throw random **** your way that you have no way to be prepared against and that will just kill you, no matter what.\n\nUnfortunately, MidBoss belongs to the second category. It doesn't matter how well you play, how much attention you pay to your stats. You can do everything perfectly (as will be evident by having a generally easy time and some momentum) - and then there will be some enemy that has stats so far above anything you could have achieved so far that he just obliterates you. If you manage to get to floor 5, which has no doubt the craziest difficulty spike I have ever seen in a game, you will know what I mean.\n\nNow, Caves of Qud does that, too, but at least the beginning of the game is varied.\n\nIn MidBoss, you will have to live through the first floors again. And again. And again.\nAnd let me tell you, the first floors are ALWAYS the same. Slightly different room layout, yes, but the enemy types are always the same, your loot will always be the same (as the right piece of equipment for you is easily discernable). Everything is the same, always.\nThere is nothing like in Rogue: Legacy or Everspace that would give you a boost after a while so you could at least skip those early levels and get to the interesting parts. Nope. The death cards are a drop in the ocean, since what really matters is your character level. Plus, they seem to be very buggy - as written above, they don't even work right for me.\nYou will grind through the early floors, \"collecting\" the same essential enemies to mastery, leveling up the same stats best for your chosen playstyle... it is a nightmarish version of Groundhog Day with no variance whatsoever.\n\nWhat a shame.

The familiar trappings are all there; gods, tomes, potions, scrolls, weapons and armor, but the way they are presented is somewhat simpler than tradtional roguelikes such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup or Nethack. Potions start off unidentified, but can largely be quaffed with impunity, for their effects are largely unpunishing. Altars exist, but function as a one-off sacrifice mechanic that lets the player experiment to discover each god's preferences.\n\nThis simplicity is carried over into the enemies. At first, Midboss's enemy selection could be seen as meagre, but this is largely mitigated by the possession system; Midboss's main point of difference. Any enemy in the game can be possessed, as long as you possess the strength to defeat it. Each \"form\" you take has its own skills/abilities, and is levelled up independently to other forms. Forms can also be mixed and matched in order to combine the abilities of your fallen foes in interesting ways. The depth of the possession system is what sets the game apart from other roguelikes. Do you take a rat's speed over a Zombie's strength? Do you take a warlock's magical prowess over a minataur's charge? These are the sorts of decisions you have to make constantly in order to survive the game, especially when it starts throwing enemies at you with powerful specialisations.\n\nIn conclusion, whether or not you'll enjoy Midboss is largely dependent on the sort of gamer you are. Midboss functions as a perfect entry point for new and semi-experienced roguelike players, but might not have enough depth to keep veterans of traditional roguelikes interested.", "timestamp_created": 1502855364, "timestamp_updated": 1502855364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552830", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34215796": {"recommendationid": "34215796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198248785444", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 2336, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514122650}, "language": "italian", "review": "ITALIANO\nUn semplice rogue-like punitivo che offre una buona sfida dal concept interessante, devi possedere altre creature per aumentare il tuo potere e ottemere nuove abilit\u00e0.

La chauve-souris vampire pourra par exemple offrir le vampirisme, une attaque \u00e0 distance ou une passive d'esquive.\n\nOn pourra ainsi faire son march\u00e9 sur les monstres en encha\u00eenant les transformations. Passer de monstre \u00e0 diablotin et inversement est une des fa\u00e7ons principales de se remettre de la vie, ce sera donc important de souvent contr\u00f4ler une cr\u00e9ature. Sous forme de diablotin, on pourra ensuite \"s'\u00e9quiper\" des pouvoirs d'une cr\u00e9ature contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par le pass\u00e9. Au d\u00e9but du jeu par exemple, on aura les capacit\u00e9s de diablotin, celles de rats et celles de la chauve-souris simultan\u00e9ment ce qui permet de continuer \u00e0 utiliser les pouvoirs des besitoles pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment rencontr\u00e9es.\n\nDonc au fil du jeu, on va \"farmer\" les cr\u00e9atures qui nous int\u00e9ressent pour avoir des capacit\u00e9s et pour am\u00e9liorer de mani\u00e8re globale notre niveau. Pour s'en sortir, on r\u00e9coltera de mani\u00e8re classique des armes/protections que l'on pourra \u00e9quiper pour mieux tenir avec un syst\u00e8me de raret\u00e9 habituel (commun, rare...). \n\nDernier point, la mort est donc permanente et fait perdre tout ce qui touche \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9rience du diablotin ou des monstres. En revanche, une carte de mort conservera les \u00e9quipements que l'on a eu dans la partie comme une sorte de panth\u00e9on. Celle-ci nous permettra lors d'une nouvelle partie de prendre un et un seul objet/\u00e9quipement associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la carte. On pourra par exemple r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la super \u00e9p\u00e9e de la partie associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la carte pour s'aider \u00e0 red\u00e9marrer. Et si plusieurs cartes de morts sont stock\u00e9es (on n'est pas oblig\u00e9 de la consommer en d\u00e9but de partie), on peut r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer plusieurs \u00e9quipements pour faire une \"grosse\" tentative de progression dans les donjons. C'est assez chouette mais \u00e9videmment chaque carte ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e qu'une fois.\n\nJ'ai bien aim\u00e9 le concept de Midboss pour les 2 heures durant lesquelles j'ai jou\u00e9 (faute de temps). La personnalisation des comp\u00e9tences est assez chouette et renouvelle pas mal les parties et on prend l'habitude de poss\u00e9der les monstres que l'on veut pour tenter de tenir le plus longtemps possible. Les \u00e9quipements n'ayant pas de pr\u00e9-requis, pouvoir embarquer ceux des parties pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes est vraiment pratique et permet d'aborder les tentatives autrement. Le jeu n'est pas forc\u00e9ment simple et les monstres peuvent parfois nous faire assez mal si on les aggro sans les achever parce qu'ils nous courent apr\u00e8s.\n\nJ'ai pass\u00e9 un bon moment sur le jeu, \u00e0 voir si avec le temps \u00e7a ne devient pas un peu trop r\u00e9p\u00e9titif du fait qu'on recommence tout. \n\nJ'ai fait une vid\u00e9o de pr\u00e9sentation du jeu, si jamais : [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YmjMpVUoB4]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YmjMpVUoB4[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1500969752, "timestamp_updated": 1500970324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33781167": {"recommendationid": "33781167", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992747527", "num_games_owned": 421, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511096222}, "language": "english", "review": "Midboss is a highly addictive and fun dungeon crawler with a unique twist and punny sense of humour.\nIt has loads of options and a fun death mechanic.

You can find the full review in my video linked below.\n\nThere are a number of aspects to MidBoss that make it different to its genre-friends, most notably the core mechanic, which sees you possessing your enemies, taking over their corpses to utilise their abilities to your advantage in order to achieve your ultimate goal - showing those jerky jerk jerkface monsters that you\u2019re cool and awesome and can do good things if they\u2019d just give you a chance and you\u2019re gonna be the new boss if you have to kill every last one of them.\n\nImpressively, MidBoss has a some great accessibility features that are considered \u201cadvanced\u201d by a lot of standards. A lot of the options allow you to tweak various aspects of the game\u2019s difficulty, which is so much better than just having a vanilla \u201cEasy/Medium/Hard\u201d selection, because different players will struggle with different aspects. The feature that probably impressed - and surprised - me the most, though, is the \u201cQueasy Safe Mode\u201d. This feature toggles the sound effects and animations for things that players might find gross, or perhaps inappropriate for younger players, such as blood and guts and stuff. The \u201cchild safe\u201d mode is a nice bonus, but what this has another great use for is people with, for example, emetophobia, because this mode explicitly states that it removes all visual and audio references to barfing within MidBoss.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z-1HGG94t8", "timestamp_created": 1499830766, "timestamp_updated": 1499830766, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7,

So many different aspects appeal to me super hard.

It's good ole dungeon crawling, with a super neat possession mechanic. Your base form, Imp, has its own stats, health, stamina, etc. But if you tag an enemy with your Possession spell and then defeat them, you (SURPRISE) possess them. You became that which you killed, replacing your stats with that monster's stats, as well as picking up skills from that monster as you level up in your new-found body. If you max out the level of that form (the level cap varies from creature to creature) you can then equip that form to your main form, assuming you shed it. Gaining bonuses and a neat color swap depending on the creatures you have equipped, as well as access to all the skills you learned.\n\nThis is just a VERY basic explanation to the mechanic, but this mechanic alone is a crazy huge driving point for the gameplay in general and it seemed like the best thing to focus on for this review.

I love, love the rhythm of the possession mechanic in this game - you don't heal by resting or by using fountains, you heal by possessing the enemies you defeat and taking their forms. This is also how you learn skills, get better stats, and become cuter with every iteration of yourself!\n\nBut, okay, let me back up. MidBoss is a game about being a lowly dungeon imp who decides to become the biggest, baddest monster in the dungeon while everyone's distracted fighting heroes. Cue possessing your former allies to steal their skills, killing everyone, and selling loot to the thoroughly neutral merchant so you can buy more powerful equipment.\n\nAs it's a roguelike, the core gameplay loop is simple: explore, get better at learning when to run vs fight, mastery over your skills, etc etc - and then you make a mistake and die. Which is fine! The gameplay is so tight you'll enjoy playing more of it and getting better with every run - or luckier! My last run I found a flaming sword I could possess, and it was really good at killing things! I swapped over to an acid bat when it got low on health, but misjudged if I could take on a zombie or not. That was my fault, and I'll be more careful next time - and the next, and the next!\n\nDeath lets you carry over at least one of your items - and oh, items! You find all kinds of things, equipment, potions, scrolls, earrings - all kinds of stuff you pick up Diablo-style (press alt to make the items show up on the floor with fancy icons) and then throw into your inventory. Here's a flaw: you can't auto-sort your inventory, and it's kind of tight, but it's a minor hassle at most. It's easy to dump stuff and money isn't too tight.\n\nSo! MidBoss is good: it's beautiful, has music, plays really well, and has enough depth to justify going back in again and again. I know I'll beat it someday, and until then the attempts are fun. (And why yes, I do see those options in the \"custom game\" section. Mix up the gameplay? Don't mind if I do~)\n\nFinal note: MidBoss has a unique death card system where when you die, it makes a pretty little image of your final moments and a cute summary of how you played. It's a good way to reflect on your mistakes, and share them with your friends.

If you are looking for an answer to \"Should I buy this?\" my answer would be yes, for sure.\n\nTo add a little more depth, Midboss follows along with the classic rogue formula (permadeath, potion identification, etc.) but adds the twist of learning skills through the possesion of the various monsters you fight while descending through the dungeon.  Throw in some RPG elements such as character progression through level-ups and the result is a very addictive game.  The overall experience is a much more streamlined and focussed game compared to many roguelikes.  This isn't going to replace DCSS or TOME4 for your go-to deep gaming experience, but we all need something a bit lighter from time to time.  This game reminds me a bit of Dungeons of Dredmor rather than Nethack.\n\nThe killer feature of this game is really the death card system.  Every time you die, a death card is generated.  You can use this card to carry over one item to a new run through the dungeon.  If you have multiple death cards, you can pick one item from each (up to six I believe), so even upon your inevitable death there is something gained for another try.  Even cooler, these death cards can be shared with other players.  You can examine another player's card to see how they built that character, what forms they used the most and what skills they preferred.  It is a neat way to learn about the game from other players.\n\nThere is still room for improvement, and the developer is eager to hear from players and is very receptive to suggestions.  A few areas that will be receiving some attention are inventory management and better explanations of the various statistics.  Melee builds could probably use a bit of a buff while magic builds could probably stand a bit of a nerf.  None of these issues take away from a very well made and fun game right now however.\n\nAlso, major kudos for a native Linux build from the start.\n\nThe music and sound effects are also top notch.\n\nIf you are a fan of roguelikes, Midboss should be on your radar (and in your library).", "timestamp_created": 1498250103, "timestamp_updated": 1498250482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523296", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32695686": {"recommendationid": "32695686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013215897", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510042749}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice concept, has potential but falls somewhat short because of its current linearity.\nI have hopes for future updates.", "timestamp_created": 1498247487, "timestamp_updated": 1498247487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32694885": {"recommendationid": "32694885", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990897242", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496263347}, "language": "english", "review": "I'll have to dive deeper into this game in the future, but after completing the tutorial I can say it all feels very solid.", "timestamp_created": 1498246127, "timestamp_updated": 1498246127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500050", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32678707": {"recommendationid": "32678707", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038542513", "num_games_owned": 322, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509832645}, "language": "english", "review": "With Steam being bloated with games touting the Roguelike Genre - it is refreshing to see a game that actually knows what that means.

If you at all like Roguelikes, get this immediately.\n\nFirst off: even if you have played hundreds of hours of ToME, ADOM, Qud, Cogmind, DCSS, etc., don't expect to not die a lot in your first hour or three of this game. It's a very different beast and quite clever. It hides its great complexity behind a very polished GUI (although more actions need keyboard shortcuts).\n\nI really don't want to say more, because frankly a lot of the fun for me was playing this game with really almost no preconceived notions of what it is and how it works and discovering it for myself. However, I will say a few things to whet your appetite.\n\nThe primary game mechanic is possession of other dungeon dwellers. Your powers and skills merely modify the capabilities of the creatures you possess. When you're not in possession of someone else, you can use some of your abilities learned from your possessees, but if your not-in-possession self dies... Game over. (Of course, it's a roguelike.) You also don't have any health regen (nor its attendant food mechanic), which took some getting used to.\n\nThe second really unusual (unique to my experience) mechanic is the Death Cards. From a purely mechanical standpoint, they let you carry one item over from another game. However, more than that they are shareable records of your game, allowing you to replay the exact same seed or challenging your friends to that same seed. And, they look cool to boot.\n\nThe author contributed to a recent episode of Roguelike Radio.

Except instead of hard work and dedication, you brutally kill your way to the top.\n\nTo be fair it does also take hard work and dedication to kill your way to the top. It also makes the company potlucks very awkward.\n\nIt was back in March of 2015 when I first heard about Midboss. I was riding high on the Roguelike express. I was fascinated when I first laid my eyes on Midboss and knew I had to play this game. The idea of possessing your enemies body once defeated was brilliant. Lucky for me, Kitsune Games honored with me a chance to check out their game. It still had a bit to go, but was very enjoyable. Roguelikes were becoming my favorite genre and I couldn\u2019t get enough.\n\nFast forward and now its 2017 and finally Midboss is complete. I am older, wiser, and little bit more cynical. The same could be said for Midboss. The game has changed in many ways, adding death cards and way more customization features. Overall Midboss is as enjoyable as it was back then. So what has come about of two years of development? Let\u2019s dig in.\nMidboss is more your traditional Roguelike than I expected.\n\nIf you have ever played Dungeons of Dredmore, Rogue Wizards, or Crypt of the Necrodancer then you more or less know what I am talking about. If you haven\u2019t, then allow me to give you a brief summary. Midboss is a Roguelike randomized, perma-death game with an isometric view. You start off with basically nothing and build yourself up little by little. If you die it\u2019s back to square one and start over. It\u2019s not going to be every ones cup o\u2019tea but anybody with eyeballs can you tell you the popularity of the genre has skyrocketed and never looked back.\n\nThere are many core familiar aspects in Midboss such as unidentified potions, cursed items, and randomized level design/items. You may find in the first area an epic item that will carry you deep into the game. Other times you will drink a funny looking potion and drop dead. True story.\n\nWhat separates Midboss from the rest of the pack is its theme and progression. You start off as lowly Rat and make up your way to more standard RPG foes. Skeletons, Zombies, and Warlocks oh my!\n\nAs you become your foe you gain their abilities and eventually can even master that form. Carrying their abilities into whatever you possess next. Each monster does have its strengths and weaknesses mind you. Some are casters and some do best in melee combat. Knowing what to possess and when is tricky, as it can lead to a quick death.\n\nSwitching from a Minitaur to a caster monster isn\u2019t going to work well, especially if all your gear is focused on boosting melee attacks, savvy? Play smart and you\u2019re bound to do well, if you possess without much thought you\u2019re going to regret it. As its main feature the progression system is fantastic and fun. I was always on the lookout for something new to possess and play around with. One minor gripe I did have was that anything with healing/regenerative abilities or spells had an edge. Matter of fact it became a down right necessity in later levels to use Vampiric bite to survive. Health potions are rare and sometimes unidentified.\n\nAll is not lost as Midboss also has a unique feature in Death cards. With these cards you can gather one piece of useful loot from your previous run. You can also upload other peoples Death cards. Allowing you to bring that awesome weapon and more into the next session. While optional, I found this to be a really neat feature and very unique.\nSo lets talk about, \u201cThe imp in the details\u201d as it were.\n\nOne thing that Midboss really doesn\u2019t set up much is its universe. You play as a lowly Imp who is picked on by his fellow monsters. You have a pet flame named Mid who serves as your evil Jiminy cricket. Beyond that not much else is given far as details go. There is talking Cat/shop keeper and the Troupple King(Cratefish King) from Shovel Knight makes a cameo appearance.\n\nWhile I can enjoy a simplistic plot, I felt the characters cute design begged for more backstory. I wanted to know more about this sentient flame. I wanted to know more about the Imp. Who was the leader of this dungeon and why did no one like me?\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather simplistic but has layers of complexity. You have a levelling system for both your form and base stats. You can choose between four attributes that raise the usual RPG standbys like crit, defense, attack, etc. The entire keyboard layout is rebindable but doesn\u2019t need it. The game is smoothly designed in the way it works. Spells are slotted to numbers and movement can be done with the mouse or number pad.\n\nYou walk into enemies to physically attack them and collect loot by clicking on it. Clicking on loot can be a bit bothersome at times but eventually you learn to ignore anything that isn\u2019t helpful. The menus themselves are easy to traverse and understand with helpful pop ups. I found item management to slow down my experience.\nBack in 2015 I felt the game was rather bare. All of the dungeons were empty.\n\nThat has certainly changed as the game now has crates, chests, and all sorts of environmental destructible stuff. The aesthetic itself hasn\u2019t really changed that much in two years. There are some nice moments with dialogue but the game has stuck to its core style when it comes to overall design. There is quite a bit of polish on overall magic effects. Magic Missile is by far my favorite spell to cast in this game and you really feel each impact.\n\nWhile I absolutely felt that jamming the dungeon full of stuff really gives it more life, it also makes it incredibly tedious to loot at times. Cratefish boxes are abundant and, while optional, help you gain loot as you free more of them for the Cratefish King. There are also bookcases, treasure chests, and armor racks. If you are obsessive like me and hate leaving loot on the floor then take my advice, Ignore it! There is far too much stuff to collect at times and it will slow you down massively.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, Midboss is a far more traditional roguelike then most. The level design, graphics, and menus hold true to this. While I can appreciate it, the game does have a retro vibe. This is further showcased by random potions that change the color scheme of the game to old gameboy colors, pen and paper and more. Character design is top notch and I really loved the sprites. There are no color swaps when it comes to enemies but the Imp does change color to represent your multi-monster form. Being a flaming red Minotaur is very cool.\n\nIn all while the graphics are retro, they don\u2019t hold the game back in any kind of way. I would\u2019ve of course like to have seen more but hey that is what a sequel is for.\nMidboss has a ridiculous amount of replay value. You can play this game as hard as you want or as easy as you want.\n\nOne big difference from my previous experiences is that Midboss gives you quite a bit of control. Quick games give you a bite sized version of the game that can be enjoyed quickly. You can also use Custom games to make or break the rules of the game. Want a humongous dungeon per level? Easy. Want all items identified and no curses? Done!  \n\nAside from that, the game itself lends itself to multiple play sessions. You may try out an Acidic Zombie or a Ghost Warlock to change things up. There are many different ways to tackle the game with all sorts of different tactics and items. Speaking of items, I never really ran into the same items over and over. They did have similar stats but usually had something different to make them useful in some shape or form.\n\nEven if you alter everything to be super easy, the game is still very challenging in deeper sections where every stat point matters.\n\nFor the rest of the Review check out: https://bigbossbattle.com/review-midboss/", "timestamp_created": 1497842173, "timestamp_updated": 1497842373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32518125": {"recommendationid": "32518125", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977030010", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496260549}, "language": "english", "review": "A well made roguelike with a unique mechanic of possessing enemies.\n\nWhile the sheer amount of information may intimidate new players, you get used to it very fast.\n\nA must have for all lovers of the rogue game.", "timestamp_created": 1497734037, "timestamp_updated": 1497734037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500499", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32488383": {"recommendationid": "32488383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014491126", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498428479}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been following the producting of this game for a little while and am really pleased with the mechanics.\n\nPros:\n\n- Problem solving between staying alive (by possessing a new form) or dealing damage, having a better form, exploring, etc.\n\n- Items are plentiful and feel easy to get so the brutality of the rogue-like-ness of the game doesn't make me feel frustraited\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n- the keyboard controls, I ended up using the mouse\n\n- on mac (at least mine), button hitboxes are slightly higher than the graphics on the screen\n\n- introduction text is ALOT and wordy, but after the first 20min it is gone and fine\n\n- Could use a little more variety of ui and art for cutscenes and dialogue.

But it trips on its own feet too often.\n\nThe most annoying thing about the game is not that you die a lot (you do, a lot).   It's that the deaths are almost always random, unpredictable, and not something you can learn from and play better next time.\n\nAlso annoying is the number of times you read, right on the screen, \"Not implemented yet\" for some feature.   This, in a game that is out of early access.\n\nThe final straw is that the UI is exceedingly clumsy.  For example, there is no quick bar for activating potions or possessions, so the  only way to  use an item is to open the inventory (which covers nearly the entire screen), select the item there, and then manually close it.  Every single time.\n\nAnother UI awkwardness is the way the identify scroll is implemented.   Obviously, since identify scrolls live in your inventory, to use one, you must already have your inventory open.   And yet, when you use the scroll, instead of being able to  directly click on a target, a second popup window of your inventory appears, out of alignment from your main inventory, making target selection disconcerting and slow.   Then after you click the target, you have to scan your main inventory window and re-hover over the item to read its identified statistics.\n\nThere is probably the core of a good game here, but it is not yet ready for prime time.   I hope that the developer, who seems engaged in supporting it, will bring it up to its potential, but right now, I suggest waiting instead of buying.\n", "timestamp_created": 1497490103, "timestamp_updated": 1497490103, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805488", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32333614": {"recommendationid": "32333614", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132788762", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 287, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497867127}, "language": "schinese", "review": "MidBoss\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\u7684roguelike\uff0c\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u9644\u8eab&\u878d\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5145\u5b9e\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u591a\u53d8\u7684\u73a9\u6cd5\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u4ec5\u9760\u89d2\u8272\u73a9\u6897\u6765\u505a\u5671\u5934\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u6e38\u73a9\u90fd\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u6b7b\u4ea1\u90fd\u6709\u7740\u5b83\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u53e4\u7075\u7cbe\u602a\u7684NPC\u603b\u80fd\u8ba9\u4f60\u4f1a\u5fc3\u4e00\u7b11\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0a\u624b\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8bf4\u4e0d\u5b9a\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u8fdb\u5165roguelike\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6572\u95e8\u7816\u3002\n\n\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b[url=https://cowlevel.net/article/1888803]MidBoss \u4eca\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u5f53\u8001\u5927[/url]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1497153583, "timestamp_updated": 1497153583, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.672601", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32297572": {"recommendationid": "32297572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148599667", "num_games_owned": 425, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 27, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496027991}, "language": "english", "review": "Developed by Kitsune Games and released on the 25th of may, Midboss is a tactical strategy game reminiscent of board game style gameplay.

I really enjoy the possession mechanic and the complexity of being able to mix and match them to make a sort of sewer rat bat thing to fly around and murder everyone. the gameplay is pretty fun and the way it works is pretty unique, so I enjoy this aspect.\n\nThe art is exceptionally average, it isn't good enough pixel art to distinguish itself from other games, but it isn't terrible enough for it to warrant a huge complaint. However, that in it of itself is a complaint, because the game's art is so aggressively average, that nothing stands out, or pops amongst the dull color scheme of the dungeons, so as a result, it doesn't look good.\n\nThis game was a bit of a rollercoaster for me, it started out with me expecting a top-down dungeon crawler, but then I received something with a bit more depth, but then the quality of that depth was quickly wiped away with average art and some of the most frustrating controls I have ever seen.

Death cards are a great little feature that shows a little snippet of your character's life, and the game allows you to drag/drop and share on social media. That's not really my cup of tea, but they also allow you to choose an item to take on subsequent lives. You can choose one item from up to 6 separate death cards, which can give you a huge boost.

The opening cut scene shows Mid being picked on by a skeleton and a zombie, who are thankfully called away to occupy their battle stations when the dungeon is invaded by heroes. Mid decides it's time to seek revenge.\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nMidBoss is played from an isometric viewpoint, with the environment made up of square tiles. The character sprites are well drawn, though the animations are very limited, amounting to simple movement in one of eight directions, with no 'internal' animations within the characters. Everything has a retro feel, reminding me more than anything of a good Amiga RPG.\n\nThe game even features a number of retro graphics modes, which you can unlock by quaffing the relevant potions in game. These modes aren't that fun to activate while actually playing properly, but they're a nice touch.\n\nThe interface is exceptionally well done, with hotkeys and mouse button selection available for all of the component screens, and extensive and very helpful tooltips. Though it doesn't look as swish as some games, the interface is one of the most informative that I've seen in any game genre in a long time.\n\nThere are many settings to adjust, though most of them are not related to the graphics configuration. Regardless, I don't expect any modern PCs to experience any slowdown or other difficulties with the game.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\nThere are only very few music tracks, but the general theme has a sort of Soviet orchestral feel to it, like something you might expect to hear while watching Cossack dancers. It's odd, but very good, and fits the off-beat feel of the game to a tee.\n\nSound effects are less impressive, though they get the job done. They're basically limited to item drop sounds and combat sounds, and the latter don't sound very solid at all. There are no voices.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIn true rogue-like style, MidBoss throws you into a procedurally generated dungeon populated by all manner of creatures that are out to kill you. The game is turn-based and played on a two-dimensional grid. You can move about in each of the eight directions using either of two pre-set keyboard configurations, or define your own if you're so inclined.\n\nWhen you encounter an enemy, or anything else you want to hit, for that matter, you simply move into it using the assigned key for that particular direction, and the game makes an attack role, awarding damage against your opponent if appropriate. Some creatures are faster than you, so don't be surprised if you get hit multiple times in a row; the initiative order is displayed in iconic form on the right of the screen.\n\nYou have an inventory (initially empty), and a number of equipment slots (also initially empty) into which you can place usable equipment, should you happen upon any. But much of the best equipment is unidentified to begin with, so you'll need to visit the friendly cat merchant or find some scrolls of identification in order to make the best use of it. You should generally smash every piece of furniture that you find, as you never know where items might be hiding.\n\nItem drops are procedurally generated, too, but they seem to come from a relatively small pool of modifiers -- either that or I've just been unlucky so far. There are rarity levels, too, but rarer doesn't necessary mean better; make sure you check the bonuses on your new and equipped weapons before just swapping them based on icon colour. The interface makes this easy, too, with a nice weapon comparison pop-up.\n\nIf you think this all sounds familiar, you'd be right. MidBoss takes its fundamentals from the classic rogue-like games, like Nethack and Angband, and slaps some retro dungeon-crawling graphics on the top. But that's not all.\n\nMidBoss introduces a new possession mechanic to the genre. You see, Mid is able to use some of his mana to mark an opponent for possession. Kill that opponent and its body will be resurrected, and inhabited by Mid. Mid is then able to use the creature's basic form, and can unlock some of its abilities through continued possession.\n\nIt's a simple mechanic, but it works very well. It also adds an element of tactical forethought to the relatively basic combat, as any creature is restored to full health when Mid successfully possesses it. With healing items being very rare in MidBoss, making use of this free healing is crucial to your success.\n\nThe other new mechanic that MidBoss introduces to the genre is that of Death Cards. The game features permadeath, like every good rogue-like, but every time you die the game creates a Death Card of your character. This card can be shared with others via social media, and friends can import it into their game of MidBoss, allowing them to try the game with the same pseudo-random number generator seed, and show you how it should have been done. You can also use each Death Card once to give you a starting item for a new game, giving you a way to add that little bit extra to your next try at the dungeon. If you complete the game then it gives you a Victor Card, which is similar. But this allows you to start the game in New Game+ mode, allowing another replay starting with all of the equipment and abilities you collected.\n\nIt all plays very well, but I've noticed that each restart feels a lot like the last. Though the levels are procedurally generated, the creatures inhabiting each level seem to come from quite a small pool, at least in the starting levels, so they all feel a bit 'samey'. There's also no customisation of your character or randomly assigned inventory, or anything like that available at the start of the game, so you always start with nothing (apart from Death Card items), and you always possess a rat to begin.\n\n[h1]PROS AND CONS[/h1]\nPros:\n+ Interesting possession-based gameplay\n+ Good interface with very informative tooltips\n+ Great sense of humour\n+ Death cards\n+ Steam Achievements\n\nCons:\n- Not enough variation to begin with\n- Sound effects are not very impressive\n- Character animations are extremely limited\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\nTo me, MidBoss feels like a slightly comical homage to the early rogue-like games such as Nethack. The novel features that Midboss introduces to the genre -- death cards and particularly the possession mechanic -- work very well, and add significantly to the gameplay and replayability.\n\nIf you're a fan of classic rogue-like games you should definitely check out MidBoss.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jbIJ3klVT_0\n\nAutosave\n[h1]Save[/h1]\nSave for Later\nPause\nQuit\nRage Quit\n\nNote: I received this game for free for review purposes.

Midboss is a tactical turn based RPG roguelike. Along with the expected mechanics of looting, stats, experience, and levels, you must also possess the bodies of your enemies to learn new abilities and gain additional power. Not only does possession restore your health, you also have limited capacity to combine the abilities of previous forms with your current form. The tactical implications of this possession mechanic is compelling, and it is satisfying to hunt, collect, and master powerful forms. The character and environment art is simple and mostly static, although it did give me a pleasant dose of Diablo nostalgia. The game does have a couple of questionable mechanics. You must manually rest to restore mana. Although your rest can be interrupted by patrolling monsters, this isn't particularly common, and clicking the rest button after every fight get tiresome quickly. You're also encouraged to smash everything you see for loot and to free the curious cratefish creatures for further reward. Being a game that is tile based and turn based with static animations, smashing things is time consuming and dull*, pulling you away from the best aspect of the game: possession based combat and progression. The game also includes a mild social aspect; run seeds are saved as 'death' or 'victory' cards that can be shared with others, or cannibalized to boost new runs. Midboss is an intriguing challenge with a great balance of the familiar and the novel. Key provided courtesy of developer.\n\n*The release version reduced the number of crates and other smashables, relieving the problem slightly.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D86WFSqVxI4&ab_channel=UnlimitedAmmo] Impressions [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1495936383, "timestamp_updated": 1495936383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458421", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32009240": {"recommendationid": "32009240", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993930568", "num_games_owned": 4464, "num_reviews": 353, "playtime_forever": 103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495998961}, "language": "english", "review": "I have to say that sorry but my first impressions are not positive.\n\nThe main gimmick of the game is possessing mobs which is fine. The graphics are nice enough. Loot is Diabloesque which appeals to certain people (I'm one of them). There's a touch of rogueLITE-ness about it though in the form of \"death cards\", one of which is generated every time you die. You can use this card _once_ to start a new game but keep one item from the run the card is from. A cool feature is that you can post the card to social media and then other people can use it once too. I didn't test that feature.\n\nThe bad parts though:\n\n1. A bit pricey for what it is\n2. Unskippable animations. The standard attack animation is a \"bounce over there, hit it and bounce back\" affair. You have to wait for it every time. Destroying furniture, opening chests and even collecting gold uses this animation! You can speed things up a bit using the options but even at minimum they are still very annoying.\n3.The isometric view may look nice but it makes movement annoying compared to if it was just overhead view. Maybe it's just my brain but 8 way movement in isometric never comes naturally. Since movement is the most basic and common thing in the game it makes playing not a pleasure.\n4. Too many items to destroy. Like Diablo games there are objects to destroy which might give you loot. The trouble is there's tons of them and destroying them is a pain. I previously wrote about bookcases which take two hits to destroy and it was pointed out to me that they drop their loot on the first hit if they are going to so you don't need to destroy them but still. Anvils take a ridiculous number of hits. Even though crates only take one hit to kill you might find 15 of them in a room and going round hitting them with the attack animation is not fun at all. It's a chore. I don't want to play a game that feels like a chore.\n 5. Minorish annoyance but there's some story at the start and when you first meet a merchant.

Well, that's what this game is about.\n\nSTORY - N/A\nNot much of a story going on in the game but more of the idea that you just want to get out of the dungeon. The idea of a story can also conveyed through your game where the player could die and get a death card, in which the card talks about your death.\n\nGAMEPLAY - 8/10\nThe gameplay is pretty simple since you aren't gonna struggle memorizing which key on the keyboard does what. The letters associated to the certain action you want to take are there and key bindings are available to change. You can also just use your mouse throughout the game. The game is kinda complicated since it has lots of stats and numbers. Someone who is not fan of number crunching might have a rough time trying to enjoy this game. Possessing enemies is a unique key feature to the game and it's important to the game since it allows player to get the enemies' powers, buffs, and stats. The game has many items, weapons, and armors where they all have random stats and effects that can boost your chances of survival. Through my playthrough, I don't know if there was an end but there seems to be plenty of floors and I don't know if there is a boss level/floor but would be interesting if it had one.\n\nAESTHETICS - 7/10\nThe rooms are quite simple looking but doesn't distract the players as much. Items look quite plain as well but it also will not distract players and has enough to convey what they are for. Characters for the most part are the uniques bits for the game since some look interesting. Music for the game is also unique because it makes me feel like I'm in medival times.\n\nOVERALL - 7.5/10\nI recommend the game for players who like strategy games or RPGs that has them planning out their next moves. Players will not struggle much at the start but most players will see that struggle as they go through higher floors.\n\nPlaythrough:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaFy0c8OChE&t=25s", "timestamp_created": 1495905108, "timestamp_updated": 1495925222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31997735": {"recommendationid": "31997735", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313198464", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 242, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496551693}, "language": "english", "review": "the best rougue like game i've played yet. very adicting but i wouldn't recomend watching guides or anything because they ruin a big chunk of the exprience.", "timestamp_created": 1495894476, "timestamp_updated": 1495894476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458614", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31990363": {"recommendationid": "31990363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007429976", "num_games_owned": 743, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 79, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495849145}, "language": "english", "review": "Repetitive.\nConvoluted.\nObfuscated.\n\nIn dire need of a much more friendly GUI.\nTragic lack of inventory space compared to the LOOT FLOOD the game is.

There's possibilities for more inventory space, additional modes to get you acquainted with the mechanics (1UP and Story), and etc. Few bits of my original review has been updated. \n\n[i][b]True to its title and description, MidBoss is a game about the evil creature who wanted to become stronger. [/b][/i]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] \n\nMidBoss features a procedurally generated dungeon, with every click and movement counting as a turn. Your fellow enemies are your swords to wield and your shields to bare. Their bodies are at your disposal, their spells are a part of your arsenal, and their stats are yours to improve. [i]Unfortunately[/i], you need it. You're the squishiest asexual fire demon in all the dungeon!\n\n[i]In Death... Improve![/i]\nDeath Cards are a unique feature in this game that saves your progress, inventory and map. They can be activated once to acquire one single item from your previous inventory to take with you in a new game. You can stack a number of different cards before a run to better your odds. \n\nThe consumable potion in the game are always unidentified, requiring the player to test out a vial and place their life on the line or to utilize the rare breed of identification scrolls. Even when discovered for their negative effects, potions cannot be used on enemies and get consumed by the player themselves. While you can sell them, all knowledge you gained about the potions become obsolete immediately after your death. Every new run will randomize the potions and their effects. [i]So what's the point?[/i] Identification scrolls are better kept for items at that point, and every unidentified potion becomes vendor fodder. Unless you're a pack rat, this will feel like a wasted gimmick.\n\n[b]Note:[/b] As of the final patch, many of the useless items that took up inventory space are now useful. Not only that, inventory has gotten an overhaul that wasn't needed, and I (to my shame) can no longer do without it. \n\n\n[h1]Design[/h1]\n\nThe cute humor and art can be misleading in how difficult the game can be. While most pixel games built from the ground up feel retrogressed, this feels closer to 16-bit, and tolerable. The main complaint during dungeon exploring is the isometric view, which does not rotate and leaves you wishing for more control. \n\n[b]Note:[/b] The final patch added additional modes to get you to acclimate to the play mechanics or to get into the game purely for the story progression. This allows for player-scaled difficulty and less controller-throwing stress. \n\n[h1]Music[/h1]\n\nThe soundtrack is worthy of a MidBoss. It doesn't jump at you, or have you whistling cheery theme songs. After a few loops, you will find yourself turning on sportify.\n\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nMidBoss is a definite pick-up-and-play for those who found fun in challenging titles like FTL and Darkest Dungeon. The sense of progression is on par with the aforementioned titles, and you will curse that sting of defeat as much as you will relish in your victories.

By defeating more enemies and playing those characters, you unlock new skills and are able to use their skillsets even when you repossess some other monster. That opens a room for many different skill and build combinations. \n\n[h1]The Good[/h1]\n\u2022\tThe main idea: there are lots of monsters with unlockable abilities (you have to unlock them on every new run) that you combine into your own character builds. Each monster can have up to 3 active abilities chosen at the time. Some of the monsters don\u2019t have 3, others have much more, which makes you choose. Those 3 abilities can be transferred to the next monster upon death, which opens space for LOTS of combinations.\n\u2022\tThe way how new runs are handled: the beginning gets repetitive, but \u201cgrave goods\u201d system that allows you to transfer one item from your previous characters really helps the random factor and introduces the missing \u201croguelike\u201d element: no matter what decisions you take, you will be stronger on the next walkthroughs if you are using the grave goods system properly.\n\u2022\tChallenging difficulty done just right: the game is easy to get into, but hard to master. You\u2019ll have to experiment a lot in order to find valid builds.\n\u2022\tThe art is not bad and is done in a consistent style. It\u2019s a bit generic for a dungeon crawler, but not low quality.\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n\u2022\tRandom generation: the rooms often feel empty and not decorated enough. Additionally, the random generation also strongly affects the loot, so there will be games that you lose simply due to randomly generated items not being strong enough.\n\u2022\tNot many stats compared to other roguelikes. When you level up, you can choose one of four stats only. Those affect your other attributes like dmg / block chance. So in that regard \u2013 levelling up your main character is pretty limited.\n\u2022\tThe UI: Menus are a bit clumsy. You cannot bind items on hotkeys (yes, even activated items). You cannot equip items at once when you pick them (even if you right click on them), you always have to open inventory and choose them. \n\u2022\tThe fonts are blurry and hard to read. The whole game graphics are blurred out (probably by intention), but I\u2019m assuming that the blur shader is applied for the whole scene on rendering. This should not be done this way: the good idea is to render UI / Text after the relevant gameplay scene has been rendered. My eyes were not getting tired, but that overall impacts the UX and decreases the perceived quality of the game.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\tCompared to other roguelikes, this game is remarkably easy easy to get into, but that does not make it easy to play (in a good way). The main possession mechanic is deep and well thought-out, but other aspects don\u2019t feel very developed compared to other dungeon crawlers. I can recommend the game to those who are looking for a way to get into the genre or just don\u2019t enjoy crawlers where you have to read tons of text. However, MidBoss seems quite overpriced right now and I\u2019d personally wait for 66% discount and grab it close to $5 (or your regional equivalent), simply because there are other alternatives on the market.", "timestamp_created": 1495739317, "timestamp_updated": 1495739334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502714", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31957718": {"recommendationid": "31957718", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999613929", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 150, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499030966}, "language": "english", "review": "Midboss puts you in the body of... everyone.

Turn based it might be, but even so Slower zombies take fewer turns, and faster enemies might take an extra one. Your Animated Armour shell might be good to take a punch, but if that magical Bat takes a missile to it - you wont stand long. \n\nEach enemy you encounter has you consider it for a moment, think if you want to take it over and abandon your current shape.. but it also has to double checking if this new form would even work for your current runs stats and gear. This is where midboss shines. \n\nWhere the game loses some of its luster is the procedural generation part of the game... mostly due to the overall feel of Emptiness in the levels. Corridors are good and fine, but i do like a nice statue, or painting, or maybe a vase, carpet or two... hell, at this point i'll take a pile of dismembered kittens to spice up the walls. What art is has and where its available from its generated maze - it looks... fine. But its often very Empty, and that is a damn shame.\n\nThis doesn't take away from the mechanics (or ability to customize the game play to your preference in a myriad of options), but it does make you wish it threw in a particle effort or 50 in there.\n\nOverall - if you enjoy the Rogue Like experience, then this is an example that does a good job at being exactly that and well worth the hours invested for enjoyable experience in being a literal zombie. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1495738864, "timestamp_updated": 1495738864, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40891673": {"recommendationid": "40891673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068749253", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 384, "last_played": 1521356707}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Overall: 8.0/10.0[/b]\n\nVery Fun Game. Casual, and no cognitive stress progressing with the game, or quiting when you had enough.

Maybe levels can do a bit more tricks (such as having to use enemys' abilities to solve environmental puzzle) to make use of game mechanics.\n\nPicking up items is also intriguing. In the beginning, you have absolutely no idea what a potion is meant to do, until you use it, and realize. It's not really a hardcore item hunt game like the Diablo series, and often you won't jump with excitement to find a spectacular item.\n\nThere's a mix of melee-type items and mage-type combinations, depending on your preference. It wasn't quite clear to me, if there were specific tactical needs for using either types. There were a few exceptions though, when facing a powerful enemy, to think more about using the right weapon.\n\nThere's also not much pressure in this rougelike, and there's not much pressure to move on to the next level, such as character hunger or monster respawns. This casual take on the game is also what's relaxing about it.\n\n[spoiler] You could get additional items through a merchant every 2 levels or so.

I have yet to beat the game and it makes some major power jumps between monsters, but it's hard to put down and easy to get back to despite the frustrations.\n\nIf you're a fan of turn-based, dungeon-crawling roguelikes and don't mind a gimmick or two, this one's worth a look.", "timestamp_created": 1520221990, "timestamp_updated": 1520221990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40495154": {"recommendationid": "40495154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009367782", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519934875}, "language": "english", "review": "I've really, really enjoyed this game so far, and it's one that I think I'm gonna keep coming back to.

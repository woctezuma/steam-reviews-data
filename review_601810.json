The game is good\u2026 great even, but it was buried alive by the technical problems.\n\nHere's the quick guide how you should handle things, if you will be still interested in the game after my assessment. You get it and are very careful not to pass 2 hours of playtime first time booting it. If you notice any performance problems during this time, you should probably refund it before it gets worse. Technical issues aren't universal and many people are enjoying a functional game, but FPS drops and many other problems happening are by no means rare. Dev publicly stated that he is unable to fix those and there no patches are in works. Game delved to the realm of unplayable one too many times for me to, sadly, not issue a negative review. No 2D game should have such problems sapping the fun out of it!\n\nThen, you may ask me, why I eventually beat the game...\n\nYes, I struggled through moments when FPS count dropped below 10. That is because, firstly, I'm a fricking stubborn and tenacious guy that won't review the game without beating it and can take some punishment, and secondly, when it works, the game itself is a joy to play. It's far from perfect mind you, but it's nothing that should be easily passed.\n\nSpark's strength lays it the way how flowing and responsive the gameplay is. Keeping its Sonic fangame root at its sleeve, similarly to Freedom Planet, it provides the joy of movement and zooming through stage and enemies with grace, power and speed. Mechanics and physics differ somewhat from those in Sonic and Freedom Planet, so while the game sometimes feels shameless with inspirations, it doesn't feel like there was no effort put into mixing things up.\n\nGood movement, decent controls and somewhat cohesive level-world building are the strong points that helped me power through the frame drops providing bundles of enjoyment when the game didn't felt like it's falling apart in the technical sense. Soundtrack also adds up to the experience, with varied tunes that stay fresh the whole game, despite quite big level count.\n\nWhile soundtrack is indeed polished, the game itself lacks the shine quite noticeably and it extends further than mentioned technical difficulties. While most levels are very good with mixing things out and pulling interesting gimmicks, later stages start to lose a lot of steam in terms of originality and good design. They can feel very samey and blocky if you play for the extended periods of time - constantly repeating some high-speed setpieces and strongly reusing earlier enemies and ideas.\n\nDiscoverable powers that Spark can weld are mostly fun and interesting, but some really feel underpowered for the tasks at hand. Bosses look intimidating, but they are very pattern-based, damage-spongy and are easily disposed by the brute force. Also, dash works very strangely and sometimes it [i]reduces[/i] your momentum in many instances. Story is insane and art is very inconsistent at many spots.\n\nSome of those faults are mitigated by the additional inclusion of second, unlockable character. He has less health and no Jester powers, but it's equipped with insane mobility options and very forgiving parry mechanics. This makes level traversing and boss fights much more dangerous and interesting endeavors. You are actually are forced to learn patterns of enemies and going into fights without a plan and attention will kill you quite fast. This additional mode would be an all-winner if not for the mediocre damage output you are stuck with, but it's still interesting to see unlockable character that feels like it fits the game better than the main one!\n\nThat was a long litany of issues and problems, but that's what Spark really is. Even without framerate problems, it feels very inconsistent and duct-taped, but it would be a giant lie if I would ignore the big bag of goodness that game provides or tries to provide. You can see through all of it - it's not an amazing game, but it's made with effort and good sense for high-speed platforming action that is noticeable despite gameplay and presentation issues.\n\nThis still won't make me change this into a positive review. Framerate issues are too prevalent and intrusive to ignore and the inactivity of the dev will not help this game get any recognition for the time being. This is quite sad if you think about it. If you feel that Spark could be something you would enjoy and if you too are fan of Sonic, Freedom Planet or other action oriented platformers, give this a shot. Use your refund option if you end up as unlucky as me or enjoy the game if it decided to work for you.\n\nThis really shouldn't have ended like this.\n\n[i]Like this review?

the mechanics that it takes from each, and adding its own. I really enjoy Kirby games (and Sonic Mania), but all Kirby games feel too slow for me, aside from Squeak Squad. And both Kirby and Sonic are always too easy. This game starts out at about a Kirby-Sonic difficulty and stays that way for a while, not picking up until the final areas. But once you win, you unlock a different character, who can't use the different powers, but is pretty awesome anyway with a more complex moveset than any single Spark ability. And his versions of the levels contain new hazards, new enemy placements, a few changed level sections to make you use his abilities where Spark needed help from stage mechanics, and harder bosses (plus a few totally new ones). He also has less HP, so with all of that, it quickly picks up the difficulty where the first campaign left off. And then there's the third... you gotta do that again as Spark (with help where needed) with very little HP, and one of the other character's essential abilities has been replaced with one that works well, but requires very good timing. By the time you're done with that (and the special challenges) the first campaign is just a (pretty dangerous) playground. The replayability comes from how fun it is to make use of the quirks of the various abilities (which you can choose from whenever you want at that point) such as their different levels of mobility, and the cool \"charge up a super attack by landing hits a lot\" mechanic. Not the kind that has a long animation and completely wrecks everything, just a nice boosted version of certain attacks from certain copy abilities. And as a result, it charges much faster. It's mainly used for bosses, but I can't complain since there are so many, and they too are playgrounds (they have set paterns, so that's why they can be treated as playgrounds instead of serious challenges). My point is, I love making use of all the different mechanics and whatever 2 powers I have with me to be really fancy (one goes into storage whenever you use the other) which could not be done to nearly as much of an extent in Sonic or Kirby, and there's a challenge here for hardcore people (which I do fall under the category of).\n\nAs for the framerate drops that many people talk about, I only get them on rare occasions, and always in the same places. Other than the first section of level 13, where they persist until I beat the boss (it's just a few minutes of a lagless low framerate) it's literally just a few moments where the game has to lag for a couple of seconds.

However, more technical and completionist players will probably not enjoy what this game offers.\n\nTo put it short and simply, Spark is essentially \"What if we gave Classic 2D Sonic Kirby Powerups and Megaman X Mobility?\" It's a unique take on a 2D Platformer that works surprisingly well.\nThe Music sounds fantastic for every scenario and stage and the Level Design is crafted around the core gameplay with hidden goodies for players who like to explore and rewards players for playing good.\nUnfortunately, the 'Kirby' element of the game also comes with some of Kirby's same trappings.\nFor example, there's an ability you can get called Gravity which essentially is a big tooteloo to the stage because you can fly literally everywhere with the thing.\nThe game also uses Kirby's same mentality for difficulty. After beating the main campaign, you unlock a new one with a different character who has different gimmicks and less health, Basically like the Meta Knightmare modes from Kirby games. Then, there's the challenge run where you have even less health as the main character in the second character's stages. If that wasn't hard enough then guess what, Completionists? You unlock the special challenges where you need to play through certain stages with brand new gimmicks that can make you wanna toss your controller through the wall. I won't go into detail about each of them, but let's just say that what you get after beating those challenges is NOT worth it. Especially since those challenge modes reveal the game's biggest flaw: gameplay hiccups. One time when I was playing the game normally after doing some of the challenge modes, I found myself in a challenge-moded level even though I was just playing the main campaign. That and quite a few other technical and graphical hiccups start appearing while you play the challenge and campaign modes in a single sitting. To be fair, since the game is pretty long, it's doubtful that many players will run into these problems unless they marathon the game in one sitting like I did, but these are still glaring issues that need to be fixed. Besides that, this game is lots of fun, has lots of replay value from it's many modes and powerups and has a fantastic soundtrack.

The boss fights are fun and sometimes a bit of a challenge, but the game nevers gets too difficult.

It's a fantastic game! The visuals are beautiful (though I personally think Spark's design is a little bland), the music is fantastic and the game seems to be a mishmash of all the best parts of other classic games. You've got the speed and movement of a Sonic game, the ability to change your powers with pickup items like in Kirby: The Crystal Shards and the attack execution of Megaman (including wall jumping).\n\nThe controls are very responsive and I personally didn't experience any of the graphic lag some folks have reported, save for one moment in a boss battle where I launched a charged attack while my opponent was launching theirs (my latop is not made for gaming either - it's kind of a POS, honestly). There are also little details that just really bring the game together, like when Spark goes into his Cool (Ice) form and any water under him turns to ice, not allowing him to sink, which can be both good and bad, depending on whether or not you want to go in the water to collect/kill things. \n\nAlso, this is not an OMG hardcore game. I'm a very casual gamer and I suck at most games, and even I didn't find this to be a challenge. But sometimes you don't want to play something that beats you into the ground (I've got Cuphead for days when I'm feeling masochistic). You just want to buzz through something pretty and fun without wanting to chuck your controller through the wall. If that's what you want, Spark is the game for you. I wasn't specifically looking for something super-challenging, but I'm just pointing this out because some players may tire of this game in a hurry if they're looking for something really difficult.\n\nMy only issue with the game is there doesn't seem to be a way to save your progress. There are checkpoints (TONS of them) and the ability to restart from a checkpoint while in-game, but if you quit the game to the main menu or close out of it entirely, your progress isn't saved. There seems to be a level select menu, so maybe it's some kind of a bug? No clue, but for the time being, it seems that if you want to see the entirety of this game, you have to be ready to beat it in one sitting and I have no idea how many levels there are.\n\nBut all in all, I really like this game and I would absolutely recommend it, especially for folks who like the pace and handling of classic Sonic games with a twist.", "timestamp_created": 1514831452, "timestamp_updated": 1514831452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1514881196, "developer_response": "That's odd, the game should save at every checkpoint.\nThere isn't a reason why it woudl't unless your pc somehow stopping the game from creating the external save file."}, "38921593": {"recommendationid": "38921593", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999692916", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514915285}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was incredibly fantastic all throughout!

the Sequel and Sonic After the Sequel. Staring the Titular Spark the Electric Jest that had his Job taken from him by a robot revolution of sorts. \n\nSpark runs, jumps, dashes, and attacks through many stages with a very versatile array of powers that can be found through out levels from blades to gravity everyone of them are fun to use in their own way. Personally I was a fan of gravity and edge traversing stages with those are very fun.\n\nSomething people have not mentioned is the Fark story mode after beating the Spark story\n\nIf Spark is sonic + Kirby + megaman X.\nFark is Devil May Cry Royalguard style\n\n\nFark takes only 3 hits and has a super meter that can be built with Parrys. Thats right theres a parry system that can get you some,alot, or even lose meter if you mess up. Meter can be used to get into Fark's super mode for skilled players. Or in a pinch  Fark can unlock his limiter to get full life back, temporary invinciblity, and a speed boost. \n\nWhiles Fark's levels are the same at Sparks they get Fark exclusive routes and certain moments you swore that you didnt see as spark but then again the levels are very vast. (even without birds for scale I'm glad to not see) \n\nLevels are long, fun, and engaging with fantastic music. Average level can take 10 minutes for your first time through but can beaten faster with skill. \n\n\n\n\nNegatives~These are very minor but noticable\n\nThere are points in the level where certain object in 2 levels hurt you and later are background so I got small heart attack seeing a metal fan return.\n\nSpark and Fark control very well except for a strange momentum when slowing to  a stop. For a split second characters keep walking after letting of keys or thumbsticks go. There a slight slippery which was present in their previous games. \n\nI've mentioned how fun the long levels are. But after 3 or 4 during a sitting I felt exausted and had to comeback to beat more levels. But if you like long levels it great but if you don't or not have the energy it might have cause for burn out.\n\nIf this game ever gets patched or updated I would suggest an easy and hard difficulty. Hard being the current game and easy is 5 minutes of each level. Just to get the hang of these levels.\n\n\n \n\nAfter all of it I am invested in the Spark fanchise. Its a series I will speak highly of to others about it. left a very positive impression on me and I can't wait to see what the next game will be,\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1514486549, "timestamp_updated": 1514486549, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38749105": {"recommendationid": "38749105", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256890951", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516131335}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito Bom Esse Jogo,Recomendo Principalmente para os amantes de jogos Plataformas", "timestamp_created": 1514400686, "timestamp_updated": 1514400686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38726086": {"recommendationid": "38726086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328929971", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515127984}, "language": "english", "review": "Criminally underrated game that seriously suffers from a lack of marketing.

While it is not intended to be a carbon copy of Sonic, Spark: The Electric Jester blends the level-design and overall playfulness of Sonic with additional features inspired by other 16-bit classics. Like the success behind Freedom Planet, what started as years of Sonic fan-projects ultimately blossomed into a developer\u2019s own spark of inspiration that has created a new beloved platforming icon with not only this gem but also a Sonic Adventure style Spark game planned in the future.\n\nTo be quite honest, if I did not know this game was created by the same developer who made Sonic Before and After the Sequel, I would have thought Spark: The Electric Jester was a new IP from a new in-house from SEGA. Back when everything wasn\u2019t about Sonic and SEGA branched out with other IPs like Ryster, Vectorman, etc. Spark isn\u2019t simply a great game as an imitator of the past; it takes all the lessons learned from mastering what makes 2D Sonic games so great, adds its own deviations from other classics, and creates a truly memorable platformer that plays to all these referenced games\u2019 strengths with few, if any, of their weaknesses. If you wish to show SEGA that classic Sonic\u2019s designs remain timeless, then supporting games like Mania as well as fan-projects turned into new IPs like Spark and Freedom Planet are what you should support to bring about that change.\n\n[h1]Spark! The Cyborg \u201890s Dream; Glory to New-Formed IP![/h1]\n\nThis is a game that feels like the SNES/Genesis era never died with its conglomeration of ideas lifted from Sonic, Kirby, Mega Man X and dozens more classics mix-mashed into what may first appear to be too radical of a dream to be true. Instead of being an absolute mess, Spark manages to blend all these elements surprisingly well to create an experience that feels like a time-machine of all that was loved from \u201890s gaming crammed into one game.\n\nAs previously mentioned, level-design and the overall playfulness of sandbox-like levels from Sonic are combined with Kirby\u2019s copy ability given a new spin where each weapon offers a distinct playstyle that can shape how boss-fights are played out. In addition, boss battles take a page from Gunstar Heroes/Freedom Planet where they are massive spectacles that breaks up the platforming focus of the standard levels. Difficulty balances nicely with both player skill and knowledge of move sets tied to abilities that will help to tackle bosses more easily. Movement abilities like wall-jumping, double-jumping, etc. are also mad-libbed from Mega Man X to make Spark feel very versatile while also adding more decisions on the two loadouts you select between Spark\u2019s many hats. Lastly, there is also an ability to ride a hoverboard\u2014you could not make Spark anymore \u201890s if you tried, except for adding Pok\u00e9mon into the distillation of all that was loved from the past\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that while Spark largely borrows many influences it does not one-hundred percent recreate them. It was admittedly difficult to unlearn how Sonic\u2019s momentum should work on slopes as Spark\u2019s normal speed and momentum does not one-hundred percent recreate them. It\u2019s not game-breaking, yet it seems strange for a modder who has made Sonic games for over a decade not to get the physics right. This issue is compensated towards the later half where speed boosters help adjust Spark\u2019s movement to be more Sonic-like, so I have to believe this decision was deliberate. This can also be said of the Copy-ability being limited to many different hats with no combinations nor does Spark always have the same move sets as a steady progression like MMX. These all feel like concessions made to make Spark play as a distinct character. which is easier said about his gameplay than his actual personality and storyline.\n\n[h1]Light is Faster Than Sound, Or Why Someone May Appear Smart Before Speaking[/h1]\n\nWhen it comes down to the make-or-break deal of platformers, gameplay always triumphs over good storytelling and world-building, yet games like Sonic 3 & Knuckles as well as Before/After the Sequel showcases they can be as effective to communicate a narrative. Simple stories like Tails and Sonic becoming friends and using foreshadowing techniques in silence does not ruin the pace of platformers, and it can often tell an effective storyline because of its simplicity. It somewhat baffles me that the masterwork you see in the developer\u2019s previous creations are forgotten for his own IP.\n\nUnfortunately, Spark feels like a confused attempt to tell an overarching storyline between Spark and Fark (another robot replacement). What should be a campy, stupid plot feels like it missed what made the storylines of the Sonic Mods so beloved. Spark's narrative combines a convoluted plot of robots uprising because of some primary protocol about handling humanity while at the same time staying simple to the initial set-up of a robot losing his job to another robot. Some of the dialogue is admittedly so cheesy it\u2019s entertaining, but it makes me wonder how much better of a narrative Spark could have been had the game used only its visuals to tell its story. Perhaps in an attempt to make Spark stand out as a character, the game\u2019s tone makes him out to be too much of a comic relief icon. Even Fark\u2019s journey remains largely the same as his epilogue story is simple another means for the player to enjoy more time in these levels from a different perspective with new mechanics that make him a much harder character to play. It\u2019s quite a shame the narrative quality from LakeFepord\u2019s previous works from about the narrative was otherwise lacking, but perhaps it was to focus more so on the core gameplay.\n\n[h1]It\u2019s Not What You Are That Matters; It\u2019s the Watts You Make That Shine[/h1]\n\nMinor gripes, gameplay and story related, aside, Spark manages to breathe something new beyond appealing to Sonic fans as a passion project. Chances are if there is some aspect about the game that appeals to you this game will quickly become a modern classic as it doesn\u2019t excel as one idea from the past but a conglomeration of the old as something new. The level-design, power-ups and both Spark and Fark\u2019s modes offers enough replay-value to satiate any fan, and there are additional challenges to incentivize skilled players to master the game. There is simply too much to love not to give this strange looking robot a chance to prove himself. \n\nWhether I think Spark stands the test of time or is a greater platformer than Sonic Mania or Freedom Planet is irrelevant because the qualities that make it distinct are worth playing no matter which one is the best. The fact that these modders have made their debut, big or small, shows us that classic-style platformers have never lost their touch, only their spotlight was lost. The potential all these games show is that the horizon only is brimming with future possibilities, and thanks to Spark, the future of modern 2D and 3D platformers appears to shine even a tad more brightly with innovation.", "timestamp_created": 1514126998, "timestamp_updated": 1514127147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579775", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38616213": {"recommendationid": "38616213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011578813", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516783254}, "language": "english", "review": "HOLY SHIT THIS GAME IS AMAZING!\nWHAT A FUCKING RIDE!", "timestamp_created": 1514111186, "timestamp_updated": 1514111186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38571551": {"recommendationid": "38571551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272856995", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518106056}, "language": "english", "review": "i try to play the game, but when i start the game it lets me play a bit but then stop and then i get told that the game has a virus", "timestamp_created": 1514025345, "timestamp_updated": 1514025345, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432570", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1514154345, "developer_response": "Seems like a false positive on your anti-virus side of things.

The game follows the same mindset as the 2D Sonic games. There are normally 2 or 3 paths in each level. The game rewards for exploring. On top of that some power ups can provide shortcuts if you know how to use them. \n\n- Many power ups to mess with. The game has many power ups for you to use. You will find your playstyle within a few levels. Wind and Knight Jester are my favs.\n\n- Music is godlike. All the songs are just amazing. Don\u2019t know what else to say about that lol.\n\n- Romalo is an butt lover\u2026 seriously. \n\nCons\n\n- Pause bug. Can\u2019t unpause the game without it crashing. So no bathroom breaks you gotta use a bottle or a bowl.\n\n- I can clip through a wall once\u2026 don\u2019t know if that can happen in other spots.\n\nIf you love 2D Sonic, Feperd\u2019s fan games, Freedom Planet then buying this game is a no brainer.

Judging by the Steam forums, these issues have been common for the last six months (since at least April 2017) and there are no definite, cure-all fixes. \n\nThe developer has chimed in as well and seems incapable fixing it.

One day robots take over the world. One of the robots is Farky Farky Foom Foom Fan, a clone of Sparky Sparky Boom Boom Man who decides to be a little fark and take Sparky Sparky Boom Boom Man's minimum wage job from him. Since Sparky Sparky Boom Boom Man kinda farking hates life anyway, he decides to go fark up the farking fark who took his farking job. Oh and also there's something in there about Not Sigma and Not Dr. Light, but they're not as important.\n\nI forget where I first heard of this game, but I know that it had something to do with Freedom Planet. And, you know, since I love Freedom Planet so much, this game kinda felt like a given. I for one don't think this game is as good as Freedom Planet (and I swear I'm not biased... probably), it has quite a few issues, and all around the game could really use a new coat of paint so to speak, but I still find it enjoyable despite that. Pick it up if you have the fifteen bucks laying around or find it on sale.\n\n[b][u]The Good Stuff:[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*][b]You can go [i]fasssssst.[/i][/b] Like, ridiculously fast. That is all.\n[*][b]The power-ups are a whole lot of fun.[/b] They add a lot of variety with their abilities and their different methods of fighting and traversing stages, and the method for acquiring and switching between them works really well. Chances are you'll take a liking to two or three and those will be pretty much the only ones that you use, but it's a lot of fun to mess around with them all.\n[*][b]There's no lives system.[/b] You'll always respawn at your last checkpoint, including if you quit the game. Whether you prefer this over having a lives system is going to come down to you, but it certainly keeps the game from kicking your butt too much.\n[*][b]FARKING FARK THE MUSIC IS AMAZING.[/b] It's mostly electronic, but there's also some orchestral pieces, as well as a wide variety of genres that all fit each stage to a T. You'll probably find yourself bopping your head to the beat. My favorites are Smog City, Mare Desert, and Megagraph Fleet, the latter of which is, just, objectively the best song on the soundtrack. It's fantastic.\n[*][b]The narrative is kind of hilarious??[/b] It's like the game's creator knew that he probably couldn't write something very good, so he just made something completely ridiculous instead. Spark barely takes anything seriously, he lampshades everything, all of the antagonists are total hams [i]including[/i] the big bad, and there's just such a blatant lack of effort put into everything, it's amazing. The sense of humor might not be for you, but I'll tell you what, after a [i]certain other game[/i] totally screwed itself over by trying way too hard, it's nice to see a game that doesn't take itself so seriously.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Bad Stuff:[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*][b]The controls feel kind of weird.[/b] At first I thought it was just me and my Freedom Planet bias, but then I looked at the other reviews, and... yeah, the controls are weird. It feels really floaty, especially in certain forms, and it makes platforming more difficult than it should be.\n[*][b]It feels like there could have been some more thought put into some of the forms.[/b] Some of them have movesets and/or controls that could use a bit of touching up. Gravity and Cool come to mind. On the topic, it also feels like there could have been some more thought put into [spoiler]Fark[/spoiler], because his controls feel really weird, especially the [spoiler]wall/ceiling mounting[/spoiler]. All around the game kind of feels like it could have really benefitted from taking advantage of more than two buttons. But I digress.\n[*][b]Some things in this game just take way too long to happen.[/b] Specifically, level transitions tend to be a long time of sitting on a black screen, and sometimes after you defeat a boss it will just sit there for a while before it actually plays the defeat animation. I don't know if this is just my computer sucking or an actual thing, but... it definitely happens.\n[*][b]This game is absolutely full of sound bugs.[/b] As in, I first noticed this the [i]first time[/i] I played the [i]first level.[/i] Sometimes there's music when there's supposed to be no music. Sometimes there's no music when there's supposed to be music. Sometimes it will accidentally start playing the wrong song and then suddenly say \"oops\" and start playing the right one. It also tries to do this cool thing where the music cuts out just before a boss room so it can be replaced with the boss theme, but sometimes there are still other things to do before the boss room, so you're just running around without any music wondering if this is a glitch or intentional.\n[*][b]Some of the cutscenes feel like they go on too long.[/b] I mean it's not like we're reaching Freedom Planet levels of [i]ugh,[/i] and frankly there aren't even that many cutscenes in the game, but sometimes the characters will start talking and they won't... stop. It really breaks up the pacing.\n[*][b]Also the cutscenes still play in Time Attack mode????[/b] Why??????????\n[*][b]I kind of wish there was more world building.[/b] Take a look in the game's art book and you'll find all kinds of information that isn't in the game, about the world and the people in it and the origins of the robots and Jester Forms. I just think it would have been nice if some of this was actually present outside of a manual, but... maybe that's just me.\n[/list]\n\nLike I said, I do think that this is a good game, despite its flaws. I mean, it's fun! And those beats are totally jamming. I think it's possible to look past the flaws, if maybe it doesn't make it as easy as Freedom Planet does.

I decided to buy this because, well, LakeFepered, and I must say, he's gone at it again. I'll explain each story and other tid bit in this review so sit back and relax as you read this review for your own enjoyment.\n\n[h1] Spark's Story [/h1]\nOnce upon a time, in the planet of...\nWell, there are too many names for this planet, call it whatever you like. Anyways...\nthere was a Formie [4me] named Spark. In his whole life, he had his job taken away from him every single time until he went to Jester School, got a degree there (I don't see why not), and became a Jester. That was until guess what, another robot, one which seemingly looked like Spark himself, took the job. (Spark nicknamed the robot Fark) Spark then just quit the job buisiness after that. But not long after, all the robots in the city have suddenly gone on a rampage and Spark just happens to be curious into what is going on, so he goes on anyways. And since Fark is among those robots too, Spark also felt like this was the greatest oppoturnity to take revenger on Fark and eventually get his job back!\n\nNow on to gameplay.\nSpark the Electric Jester plays similarly to mostly Sonic and Kirby games. You got your speedy speed, you got your [b] Cool [/b] power-ups such as the aftermentioned Cool Jester, the Electric Bat for starters, the Wind Jester for mobility (a lot Sonic-y if I must say) and many more. But other than that, you also have charged attacks in the vein of Mega Man where it's the simple way of holding the attack button you Mega Man fans remember and love to do! (There's also Super Charged attacks where you keep attacking enemies until you fill up the blue bar, then try to do a charged shot) The levels themselves have a lot of variety but mostly cliched that I might not to have to go through them. You can see those for yourself in those screenshots. The bosses are a mixture of easy and hard and are not too hard to master (with the slight exception of the last couple of bosses). So that means it's important to learn about every power-up in the game that can potentially help you in your run wothout dying a lot. Speaking of which, there are no lives in this game, which means you are free to die as much as you want. [spoiler] After completeing the story, you unlock \"Wishes Mode\", where with the press of 2 buttons, you can choose any power-up in the game except for one that you unlock by 100%-ing the game. [/spoiler]\n\nPhew, I feel I talked about enough in that section up there. Below this sentince are some extra story information so if you want to find out about the other stories on your own, skip to the non-spoiler section down further below.\n\n[spoiler] [h1] Fark's Story [/h1]\nAfter Spark saved the planet from being rid of from any life forms, he uses all the prize money he got from saving the formies to go to the Himilayas (yes, apparently they have one of those in this planet). Spark invites Fark to stay at his house after Fark turned to the good side. The story starts a month after the first story's ending when one day, Fark was just chilling at Spark's house until he saw that the other robots were on a rampage once again. Fark goes on to investigate on why this is happening.\n\nFark's gameplay is entirely different from what you expect from Spark. Basically, think the Meta Knightmare mode of the modern Kirby games. Introduced in this new story mode is parrying which is similar to that of Bayonetta. (Did I mention this game could have modern gaming references?) Having Fark's Story be like the Meta Knightmare mode of Kirby games means Fark does not have and cannot use [strike] certain [/strike] power-ups in the game. But with having these new abilities comes some great pros. If you keep parrying/attacking, you fill up a static bar (similar to that of Spark's), which you can use to restock on health, become invincible for a short period of time and have stronger attacks. Although, when you get the bar up to the max, you become Super Fark who's not that different from his regular form, except for having longer range in attacks. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] [h1] Spark's Challenge [/h1]\nA new VR game based off Fark's has been released, and Spark decides to play it. But being that guy with attitude, he turns the pain to max and that's how the story starts.\n\nThere's not really anything to say about this mode, except you play through Fark's story with Spark who has 2 health points only. (wow, way to put a coincidencial Mario reference there) It is, however, the hardest mode in the game as these stages are tailored for Fark rather than Spark but it's possible to win the game mode with a bit of practise. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] [h1] SPC Challenges [/h1]\nThe last game mode in the entire game is the SPC Challenges, 10 challenges set up by another robot, Romalo. There are 9 challenges for Spark and just 1 for Fark. If you finish them, that would count as 100%-ing the game, then you will unlock the unlockable power-up in wishes mode. (If you haven't 100%-ed the game, you'll only get to use the power-up at the end of Spark's story) [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Time attack [/h1]\nSpark the Electric Jester also has a time attack mode for the first three modes of the game. You don't really get anything for doing these so just enjoy them.\n\n[h1] Some issues [/h1]\nSpark the Electric Jester, sadly, suffers from framerate issues that sometimes hinder the experience. Even the developer doesn't even know how this happens and doesn't intend on fixing it soon.\n\n[h1] Overall thoughts [/h1]\nOverall, this is a pretty good game with a great soundtrack and I highly recommend getting this game if you can stand framerate issues. It's very unique compared to some other games out there. I would give this game a [b] 9/10 [/b] .\n\nThanks for reading and enjoy the game!", "timestamp_created": 1503466903, "timestamp_updated": 1503466903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34418762": {"recommendationid": "34418762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051843105", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504769012}, "language": "english", "review": "It wasn't surprising to me that this was a good game because I'm familiar with Lake Feperd's previous fan works--with his Sonic After the Sequel being the best Sonic fan game that I've ever played. \n\nWhat was surprising to me, however, was just HOW GOOD this game was! It has great control. The levels are large, beautifully parallaxed environments. It's fast but has great platforming to balance it's momentum. The bosses are engaging. The music is phenomenal--possibly one of the best video game soundtracks that I've ever heard--better than Freedom Planet--hands down! \n\nBecause of games like this and Freedom Planet, Sonic-inspired momentum-based sidescrollers should definitely be separated into their own genre. \n\nPros:\n+ Good balance of speed and platforming\n+ Huge levels that are mapped both vertically and horizontally.\n+ Absolutely amazing soundtrack--one of the best in recent years in my opinion.\n+ Power-ups that are unique and give the gameplay variety\n+ Boss fights go from being \"not too bad\" to \"WHOA.\" (You have to play to see what I mean)\n+ Story is amusing but not the focus.\n\nCons:\n- Framerate/slowdown issues at times\n- (In my opinion) Could use some form of special or bonus stages with rewarding unlockables.\n\n\nBottom line, if you preordered or plan to get Sonic Mania, I HIGHLY recommend this one. If you are a fan of Freedom Planet, definitely get this as this is different in a VERY NICE way. \n\nAnd don't wait for it to go on sale, either. This game is WORTH $15 if not more. It's THAT good. Support this guy so he can make more good stuff like this.\n\n9/10 - Would hunt down the robot who stole my job again. \n\n- LB", "timestamp_created": 1503417341, "timestamp_updated": 1503417451,

Though Spark is more a mixture of sonic, mega man x, and kirby than anything else. It certainly plays great and the characters feel great to control, especially the wind jester. Honestly the game should've been renamed Spark the Wind Jester since that's the power I found myself using 80% of the time - the other 20% being using the electric bat to fight bosses. That's the thing, there are a few powers that are very obviously the best and the others go unused most of the time as a result. There just aren't a ton of viable options.\n\nThe level design in this game also feels... unnecessarily drawn out, more often than not. Stages tend to get quite long but also a bit repetitive and samey, with ideas constantly being repeated just a little too long or sections going on a bit longer than it feels like they should. This is especially noticeable when you're going through the game the second or third time and it gets hard to tell what's what in each level. The bosses though, well, in the normal playthrough you can just mindlessly barrel through them all with no problems but in the second and third campaigns they do get fairly tricky to fight but usually pretty satisfying to complete - there's one or two that feel a bit bleh, and a few others that are easy no matter what, but for the most part they provide a satisfying challenge.\n\nThe presentation of this game is also pretty good on the whole. The various level themes are all pretty diverse, with a few of them feeling kind of bland (and the theme of the first two levels in particular looking a bit ugly - it's pretty unchanged since the original kickstarter demo though I think, which could explain it, but it almost feels like FM Canyon could've been cut entirely and the game wouldn't suffer for it at all, the only level that doesn't have any unique qualities and it's half the length of every other level as well). But in generall the game looks pretty good and there are some levels that look quite great. It's pretty reminiscent of the games it's influenced by, maybe just a bit blockier. And the soundtrack, holy heck, it's really fantastic. I can't really think of a single song I disliked and there's just a ton of great songs, every level has its own theme that fits it really well & a lot of these are just great standalone tracks. There's also the theme for the extra bosses in the second and third campaigns which feels like a pretty great Crush 40 tune honestly, really gets you pumped and makes those difficult fights more tolerable.\n\nThe biggest nitpick I have is that there are a lot of weird technical issues. The timer when switching between level segments will reset to whatever it was the last time you hit a checkpoint instead of persisting across screens. In Luna Base, the checkpoints in the first area reset time for some reason, and when you die you get to see the game, instead of reloading, rapidly scroll to where you are. It feels really hacky, to say the least. There's also the music of Turbulence Plains, which reverts to the theme of the previous stage after the midboss of the level (but resets to the correct music if you die after. And there's one of the challenges in the game's mission mode where if you die the first time through (INCREDIBLY likely given that it's a one-hit death challenge) the game resets the map but adds in some extra hazards that were intentionally taken out of the level to make the challenge less frustrating. So yeah, woops. And these are all just the ones I can remember off the top of my head, I'm sure there's more.\n\nBut overall? Yeah, I did enjoy this game. It can feel a bit easy by the start but gets to a comfortable difficulty by the end of the first campaign and ramps up in challenge substantially from there. And the campaign itself is pretty lengthy - 16 levels of varying lengths, several of which can take over 10 minutes to clear. There's' a fair amount of bang for your buck, and speedrunners will probably have a field day with the movement tech possible thanks to the wind jester (I have watched a run, it's a really cool looking run). And even without really \"replaying\" anything (just going through each of the campaigns) I got 15 hours out of this, which, for a $15 2D platformer, is completely fair. There's really not much keeping me from recommending this, all the issues I have are minor at best, and while I would say check out Freedom Planet first if you haven't, this is only a step or two behind that game and very enjoyable in its own right.", "timestamp_created": 1502342000, "timestamp_updated": 1502342000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632766", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34098695": {"recommendationid": "34098695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026501758", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500541835}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want some Sonic action, then this...might be worth maybe looking like. The game tries very hard to hone in on the feel and theme of the blue hedgehog, but fails on really nailing what makes those games tick. Spark plays similarly to both Sonic and Kirby; Sonic because you are running through colorful levels with a good deal of speed, and Kirby because you can find power ups to fight with.  The problem lies in how nearly everything is executed.\n\nFirst off, Spark doesn't hold momentum properly. Unless you are using Air Jester or the Hoverboard, your top speed is quickly reached on foot, but as soon as you hit an incline, you lose speed incredibly quickly. There is a dash feature you can use to power through it, but it's not smooth. Further more, it is possible to reach speeds faster than dashing, and the dash doesn't scale to your speed. So you can dash to actually LOSE speed. Unlike Sonic, you have a health bar and it almost doesn't matter. I played through the entire game not really caring about taking damage because there's alot of enemies simply tossed directly in your path while trying to run. I only started actually dying in the last two stages or so, and even then, I was doing the bare minimum.\n\nFighting is also kind of clunky. You pick up power ups and can store two of them to switch between. Most of the powers swing heavily between super useful or only okay. For example, the Mage Jester is great for covering large horizontal distances with damage. However, Edgy Jester is only alright with it's short range and kind of bad damage. The Air Jester power is almost worthless for anything but traversal and the Ice Jester is so rare that it might as well not even be there.\n\nThe game's story is easily the worst thing about it. A few typos litter the text and in general, it's hard to care about anything because hardly anything is ever even explained. The game's art style is...odd. In the game, it looks perfectly okay. I'm not much of a huge fan of Spark's overall character design but I can deal. What I can't deal with is how bad the cutscenes look. They look really unpolished and almost like they came out of MSPaint. The music is easily the best part of the game, although I'm not really going to go look up an OST anytime soon.\n\nUltimately, the game is kind of underwhelming for me, but I really think that if the Devs decide to do a sequel, they'll get it right.

The game as said takes inspiration from 90s platformers and off the top of my head, there's a dash of Sonic, Kirby, Shinobi and Megaman X. You can definitely feel the sonic aspects found in the speed and stage design, the power up mechanics from kirby, wall slide and jumping from megaman x and shinobi, and then throws references to all sorts of games with the power ups (including shinobi on one of them.) I'd even say there's a reference to some fighting games as I noticed a move equivalent to Marvel vs Capcom 2 Guile's Somersault Kick. This isn't just in the moves either but sometimes the mechanics too.\n\nWhat's really cool is just how you can go through the stage multiple times not just for the alternate paths but to playthrough with different powerups. The power ups effect a lot of your movement options and sometime can be used in ways you wouldn't think to at first (like thinking a move is primarily for attacking but it's secondary purpose can be used creatively to cross a gap from the attack's forward momentum or upward boosting momentum.) There are times I literally want to go through a certain section a certain way and this game just literally incites me to alone through it's design. \n\nThe music is pretty awesome too and quite catchy. It really captures the moment and matches well with each stage too. I couldn't be happier to listen to the soundtrack even on its own.\n\nThe sprites are also pretty cool and some of the basic motions change slightly depending on the form Spark is in as well. (try looking up and down, you'll see what I mean.)\n\nOverall, it's a great game to play! Don't pass it up!\n\n(people have also mentioned something about fps drops or whatever.

I sorta forgot about it after playing the alpha, and with little fanfare, it came out shortly after. I'm surprised it hasn't recieved very much recognition since its release, given that Lake's previous work was pretty popular, but I'm sure somebody from the youtube community will eventually spread the word. Anyway, review time:\n\n[h1] THE GAME [/h1]\nis overall pretty fun. Others have accurately pointed out that it's a game with momentum-based platforming, kirby powerups strewn about the levels, and a bit of Freedom Planet combat. Also included is a dash button that MOSTLY helps to build and maintain speed, but more on that in a moment. This game definitely did a good job of tiding me over while I wait for Mania/FP2, though I think it lacks enough polish to compete with the other [strike]games[/strike] game of its type. I'd recommend it to anybody who likes going fast or is a fan of a certain blue meme machine.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n+ Given all of the musicians who worked on Spark, the soundtrack was of course going to be amazing. Many of the tracks stuck with me after completing the game, and I'd totally recommend checking out the album on Bandcamp or just following the musicians on their respective soundclouds etc.\n+ Spark's art is overall really nice. I think Lake does a great job of illustrating scale with each stage's backround, and I especially like how much bustle there is in the more urban stages; it really feels like the levels aren't just empty racetracks to run around. Some of the levels are a little clown-vomity, but more color works better than less in retro games.\n+ I love all of the little references here and there, like the Mushroom Hill-style shrooms, the lava stuff and trains from BTS/ATS, and the DNA beams and the giant teal death-laser from Freedom Planet.\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n- I love the idea of access to a bunch of different powerups, and while some of them were fun to use, I thought a lot of them were not that great. I ended up racing through a lot of the game with the board power, mostly because both its vertical and horizontal are pretty insane, and I kept the knight power for all the bosses. I liked a select few others like the baton and the aptly-named \"edgy\" power, but some of the others that lacked mobility seemed inferior to the knight's damage and OP shield. Additionally, I felt like we got an overload of powerups towards the beginning of the game and there weren't that many towards the end, which made me more inclined to just hang onto the two I had. I liked some of the level-specific interactions they had, like walking on lava with the fire powerup, and I wish there were more of those to coax players into trying out different ones.\n- Without a score-system, killing enemies is pretty much a waste of effort. They occasionally drop health, but I found that just jumping over everything was a lot easier than potentially losing life by sticking around to kill all of them.\n\n[h1] OTHER STUFF [/h1]\n\u2022 The dash mechanic is fun to use, but it doesn't seem to do anything whatsoever when spammed on flat surfaces; you only gain more speed when mashing it while going down slopes. I suppose its main purpose is to gain some momentum from a standstill as well as going uphill.\n\u2022 The bossfights are occasionally a bit wonky. The first few guys are same-y and pretty much die instantly, though the later bosses do get more interesting. The Kerana Forest boss was the only one that I died to more than once, mostly because some of Spark's attacks push him off the side of the map. [spoiler]I thought the Fark fight was cool, but a little underwhelming. Also, the final boss was difficult until I figured out you could just cheese him by flying above him with that spin-attack for most of his sequences.[/spoiler]\n\u2022 Filling the revive-gauge-thing takes a long time, and I only ever used it once. I guess it was a cool mechanic, but I didn't get much use out of it. Without lives, I'm not sure what else you could implement anyway.\n\u2022 One of the reasons the game doesn't feel polished (for me) is the general buggy-ness that occured during my first playthrough. On the second part of the Smog City level, I somehow flung myself into a gigantic empty void that ultimately led to the bottom of the level, which wasn't programmed to kill you. Not sure if it was part of the level, but I didn't come across it again. Other kinda annoying glitches include losing momentum in pipes that launch you around by getting hit by stray projectiles and the weirdness that comes along with dashing.\n\u2022 I didn't have any problems with the framerate, but I usually play 2D platformers on a keyboard because I'm a weirdo and I think only controller people had issues.\n\u2022 I guess the cutscenes were alright, though quite clearly low-budget. They get the job done, and we don't have to deal with questionable voice actors.\n\n[h1] IN CONCLUSION [/h1]\nThe game isn't perfect, but it still holds its own; after all, you get to run fast through colorful stages and smash stuff. The fighting mechanics work well in this game, as bossfights where your only attack is to jump can get boring or even trivial if not executed correctly (see Sonic CD). I wish there were more developers in the momentum-based 2D platforming market, but I guess people are still worried of accusations of creating another sonic clone, even though we really didn't see anything of the sort years after the sonic games of the pre-2000s. Hopefully this game and Freedom Planet are proof enough that people still want retro platformers of this sort, and maybe someday we'll get a wave of new developers who are willing to expand the currently limited supply of games in this sub-genre.", "timestamp_created": 1499333232, "timestamp_updated": 1499372895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33297578": {"recommendationid": "33297578", "author": {"steamid": "76561198333680926", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 920, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521139616}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente game, com certeza o meu favorito no estilo sonic, a trilha sonora \u00e9 F*** Demais e empolga em certos momentos, jogabilidade otima e ainda tem a historia do fark que deixa o jogo ainda mais longo, realmente lakefeperd fez um excelente trabalho no game (aguardando sequencia)", "timestamp_created": 1499306529, "timestamp_updated": 1499306529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33294450": {"recommendationid": "33294450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144207727", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508037671}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Tem inspira\u00e7\u00e3o clara em jogos como Sonic, sendo bem pr\u00f3ximo de Freedom Planet, mas cada um tem suas caracter\u00edsticas.

First off, the graphics. It's a very visually pleasing game, though, this may create issues with slower-running computers. Otherwise, the game looks fantastic, and everything looks expertly crafted! This is rather suprising, as this only had around a $9,000 budget.\n  Next up, gameplay is fantastic, but has flaws. This game with the base gameplay is amazing, as I have said before, mixing the different aspects from other games and giving them a spin to make them its own! Though, with upsides, there are downsides. Such as the glitches and bugs. As of writing this, the game is a bit buggy, as of right now, it's normal to experience a few glitches in one playthrough. Also, while many the abilities are very unique, I just don't feel there are enough of them, as eventually it felt somewhat empty in how I could attack.\n  Finally, is the story. This is certainly not a strong-point of this game. It gets the job done, but it's somewhat boring and not very compelling. It's kind of just slapped together, but manages to stitch together the gameplay. Though, this doesn't matter too much, considering how the gameplay makes everything worth it. As I have said, this game is very much gameplay over story.\n  Overall, I would give this game a 9/10, has some flaws, but overall a fantastic gem of a game.", "timestamp_created": 1499219213, "timestamp_updated": 1499219213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33242926": {"recommendationid": "33242926", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142051895", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506038677}, "language": "english", "review": "Yeah, there is a lot of Sonic elements.

It's one of those games where you [i]know[/i] it's flawed, but you just can't bring yourself to dislike it.\n\nThe game is an interesting blend of Sonic, Kirby, and a bit of Mega Man X. Although there may not be as many abilities as you'd find in a Kirby game, the amount provided is fine and the new gimmicks in each level keeps it from feeling monotous. And for this type of game, there's a quite nice number of levels, too, some of which can go on for over 10 minutes. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to you; I personally didn't believe it caused it to drag, but that's just myself.\n\nAnother neat thing are the different modes. I don't want to spoil anything here, but there's some really neat unlockables that completely change the way the game is played, and if you felt the main campaign was too easy, you'll find what comes after to be much more difficult.\n\nBut, as I said, the game is definitely flawed. There are typos galore, a completely broken timer on a certain stage, some framerate issues, and overall it feels like more polish could've been applied. Heck, at one point the game crashed after completing Stage 13 on the second campaign, which I'm not really sure how that happened.\n\nHowever, don't let that deter you. As I said, this is an incredibly enjoyable game if you can get past the flaws and I highly recommend playing it if you enjoy platformers.

Eso s\u00ed, est\u00e9n avisados de que [b]hay algunos problemas con el rendimiento del juego[/b], que al parecer son cuestiones ajenas a LakeFeperd y est\u00e1n m\u00e1s relacionadas con el ClickTeam Fusion y el motor del juego. Yo principalmente [b]he sido uno de los afectados por los terribles bajones de frames[/b], que al parecer est\u00e1n relacionados con Windows 10, mi gamepad y el motor del juego, pero no por ello voy a condenar al resto del juego. Tambi\u00e9n hay [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwACcGgRKoI]otro bug particular que encontr\u00e9[/url], que no es nada severo, pero podr\u00eda ocurrirle a m\u00e1s gente y parece ser algo que Lake se olvid\u00f3 de programar, espero que est\u00e9 leyendo esto y lo pueda arreglar.\n\n\n[h1]An\u00e1lisis completo:[/h1]\n\nLlevo siguiendo a LakeFeperd desde Sonic Before The Sequel, en 2011, y tambi\u00e9n esper\u00e9 much\u00edsimo la llegada de Sonic After The Sequel all\u00e1 por 2013, as\u00ed que cuando anunci\u00f3 que su primer juego oficial iba a ser Spark The Electric Jester me sent\u00ed realmente excitado. Los a\u00f1os fueron pasando y Lake fue sacando algunas demos de Spark en Kickstarter, las cuales juegu\u00e9 a m\u00e1s no poder, hasta que el d\u00eda lleg\u00f3. Y aunque me demor\u00e9 unos meses en comprarlo, tarde o temprano iba a hacerlo igual.\n\nEn fin, la historia de Spark es bastante t\u00edpica (Spark pierde su trabajo, todo el juego es Spark tratando de recuperarlo), pero tiene sus giros inesperados (Spark termina metido en algo much\u00edsimo mayor) y tiene su dosis de humor consciente de s\u00ed mismo, al final de cuentas Spark y los dem\u00e1s personajes conocen de los clich\u00e9s que hay en los videojuegos de este tipo, lo cual le da personalidad al juego. Lejos de seguir una f\u00f3rmula tradicional, Spark busca mezclar, modificar y hasta burlarse de ella. Sin embargo hay un detalle que al parecer s\u00ed lo toman en serio, y lo \u00fanico que puedo decir sin spoilear demasiado es que si jugaron Freedom Planet entonces ya saben qu\u00e9 esperar del villano de Spark.\n\nLuego est\u00e1 el gameplay, y ac\u00e1 es donde la mezcla extra\u00f1a de Spark cobra vida, tomando elementos principales de Sonic y de Kirby, pero tambi\u00e9n con elementos de Mega Man X y Freedom Planet (que a su vez est\u00e1 fuertemente inspirado por Sonic y Gunstar Heroes). Spark corre, salta y tiene su especie de dash, todo esto que puede ser complementado por una serie de powerups que hay en todos los niveles y que Spark puede tener hasta 2 guardados al mismo tiempo para ir alternando sus habilidades. Esto permite una variedad de estilos de juego sorprendentemente elevada, y puede hacer la aventura m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil o m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil. Al atacar a los enemigos, Spark puede cargar su barra de est\u00e1tica, que b\u00e1sicamente es la carga para un ataque especial que depender\u00e1 del poder que est\u00e9s usando en el momento. Tambi\u00e9n hay una mec\u00e1nica en particular que no he visto que muchos hablen al respecto, y es que al juntar suficientes \"cosos\" con forma de rombo se cargar\u00e1 otra barra adicional, que permite revivirte autom\u00e1ticamente cuando mueras. Adem\u00e1s de la campa\u00f1a principal hay otros modos de juego (desbloqueables tras terminar la historia de Spark) que modifican las mec\u00e1nicas y juguetean m\u00e1s con otras ideas.\n\nEn el departamento de la dificultad Spark no es muy dif\u00edcil (incluso con los poderes adecuados puede ser realmente f\u00e1cil), pero s\u00ed va a exigirte que sepas usar bien sus habilidades ya para el quinto o sexto nivel. Los jefes pueden ser el aspecto m\u00e1s \"esquizofr\u00e9nico\" (como ya mencion\u00e9 al principio), porque a veces pueden ser realmente dif\u00edciles y a veces ser pat\u00e9ticamente f\u00e1ciles. Aquellos que son dif\u00edciles pueden ponerte los pelos de punta, pero no he tenido demasiados problemas en vencerlos. La dificultad se acomoda moderadamente bien, a diferencia de Freedom Planet donde llegado a cierto punto el juego no te perdona un solo error. SPOILERS: [spoiler]El jefe final de Spark es el mejor ejemplo de esto que digo, porque no es taaan dif\u00edcil a comparaci\u00f3n de Lord Brevon en Freedom Planet. Brevon se llev\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 30 de mis vidas la primera vez, mientras que el jefe final de Spark me mat\u00f3 una sola vez. Y eso me parece bien en un sentido, porque Brevon pod\u00eda llegar a ser realmente frustrante, pero al mismo tiempo siento que el factor sorpresa que el jefe final de Spark tiene queda opacado cuando te das cuenta que es como pelear contra Brevon.[/spoiler] Lo \u00fanico que puedo decir de este spoiler que escond\u00ed es que la m\u00fasica es realmente muy buena en ambos casos.\n\nFinalmente, y como estaba hablando en el final del \u00faltimo p\u00e1rrafo, la m\u00fasica es [b]genial[/b]. Muchos de los compositores de Sonic After The Sequel regresan, y hay tambi\u00e9n alguna que otra cara nueva. Funk Fiction en particular se manda un trabajo espectacular en mi opini\u00f3n con [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zgEAV4C2Us]Luna Base[/url] (que suena similar a Red Moon, un tema en particular que hizo para Sonic ATS), pero los dem\u00e1s tambi\u00e9n hacen un estupendo trabajo, son todos m\u00fasicos magn\u00edficos.\n\nAs\u00ed que espero que con este an\u00e1lisis haya brindado una mirada m\u00e1s amplia del juego y de por qu\u00e9 lo recomiendo. Capaz no cubr\u00ed todos los aspectos importantes, pero son cuestiones que en lo personal quer\u00eda hacer llegar, y tenemos que darle soporte a LakeFeperd, nuestro hermano brasilero.", "timestamp_created": 1499026462, "timestamp_updated": 1499026462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.642664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33139932": {"recommendationid": "33139932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353397892", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505533327}, "language": "english", "review": "I loved this game. I've been looking into it since it's development started a few years ago. Now, having finally the chance to play and finish it, I can say this game went above all my expectations.

The difficulty, although it spiked a little bit too much in the final levels, was fair enough while keeping it challenging.\n \nMy only criticism towards the game is the lack of a final polish to it, since there are some misspellings, such as the word \u201cMenu\u201d being spelled as \u201cMemu\u201d, the occasional frame drops that occur when there is too much happening on screen and a few visual glitches here and there. Still, those problems aren't too big of a deal in the end, since the game is so much fun.\n \nI absolutely recommend this game, and I hope to see more of this developer soon.\n", "timestamp_created": 1499014110, "timestamp_updated": 1499014110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575616", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33119612": {"recommendationid": "33119612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067247098", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498982287}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0442\u044f\u0436\u0451\u043b\u0430\u044f,\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u0427\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440,\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0443\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u0448\u043a\u0438,\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439 ,\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u044f\u0445 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0442\u044c,\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0448\u044c, \u0442\u043e \u0442\u0432\u043e\u0451 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435 \u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0432\u044b\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0443\u043a, \u0438 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0448\u0430\u043d\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e) \u0421\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442.\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0434\u0437\u044f,\u043b\u0451\u0434,\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043d\u044c,\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f.\u0440\u044b\u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c,\u043c\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0438\u043a,\u043c\u0430\u0433,\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440 ,\u0434\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f,\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043d\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0432\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u043b. \u043d\u0443 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0440\u044b\u0446\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0451\u0442 \u0448\u0438\u0442 ,\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e \u0438\u0434\u0451\u0442). \u0410 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0446\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e,\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043b, \u0432 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0442\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0451\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u0451\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0430\u043b\u044f \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0431\u043e\u043b\u043b)", "timestamp_created": 1498981754, "timestamp_updated": 1498981754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33112024": {"recommendationid": "33112024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036591544", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520146673}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty interesting to me, particularly because of all of Spark's power ups.

Very rarely do I enjoy 2D platformers, and I can tell you now that Spark the Electric Jester is one of few 2D platformers that I enjoyed. \nThe gameplay in STEJ is a combination of Sonic the Hedgehog, Kirby, and Mega Man X. It has the speed of 2D Sonic, multiple abilties to change gameplay from Kirby, and the multiple gameplay aspects from Mega Man X (wall jump, dash, charge shots). If you enjoy at least one of these games series, then you should try out STEJ. The platforms in areas fit the theme, and the music only helps out the stage. Thats something I need to talk about, the music. The music in this game is incredible. Theres not one peice of music that I hate, and I constantly listen to all of them. If your not interested in the game, try listening to the music, as I would have bought the game just for the music. \nThe replay value the game has is a lot. Due to having multiple abilties, you can replay stages (or the entire game) with just one, or no abilties. Along with that, there are other game modes to pick, which I won't spoil, but your'll need to unlock them. Its a mystery! \nDepending on how you play STEJ, is how difficult it becomes. For my experience, it was easy, but only because I knew how to use Sparks abilties to its fullest. The game gives you a tutorial, but it doesn't show everything (such as how dashing at the right time can cause you to take no damage, trust me its good to know this). Theres no touch damage (for most enemies anyway) in STEJ, and THANK YOU for that. You can try to avoid enemies, but there will be times when you trying to avoid them, will cause you to get hit. But if your skilled, you can avoid these situations. \nIts a shame that this game isn't insanly popular. I've done some research, and from what I gathered, the timing for the kickstarter, along with the realease of the game were at very bad times, and this game hasen't sold well due to bad luck. I hope this game becomes a success later on, because I love this game. Its ones of my most favorites game of all time, and I dont even enjoy 2D platformers much.

This game came on my radar because the mastermind originally worked on critically acclaimed fangames like Sonic: Before The Sequel.\n\nBased on this, I decided to pick it up, and already something feels really off.\n\nFirst of all, let's start with the physics. The most important part of any mascot platformer is the physics and this game gets them completely wrong. Spark feels floaty, loses almost all of his forward momentum in a split second when he tries to run up steep hills, has trouble running up loops that aren't tiny, and often ends up in weird situations where he will end up jogging up or down a wall instead of sliding along it to walljump, or even start jogging on the ceiling - which is somehow even more physically impossible.\n\nOn a related note to this, Stage 05's constant suggestions to 'GET DASHY' are quite comical, if you consider the fact that the only way to give Spark any decent momentum on hilly terrain or a loop is to spam the Dash button.\n\nNext are the various powerups that Spark can obtain in each level.The only one that really feels like an improvement to his basic moveset is the bat, which extends the reach of his attacks and allows him to do a rolling attack in the air. Other ones like Wind, Board and Mage feel like they significantly downgrade Spark's moveset and make him much harder to control.\n\nCharged attacks with the Wind powerup do no damage, but they have significant recoil, knocking you away when you charge up and unleash the attack. While this can be useful for gaining momentum, it requires you to constantly turn backwards so that you can exploit the recoil. Mage allows you to charge up and perform a Kamehameha wave, although it gimps your mobility significantly, makes Spark vulnerable to enemy fire, yet still deals very little damage. The board powerup allows Spark to move faster - something which would have been welcomed in his base form - but removes your ability to perform a charged attack.\n\nFinally, the level design is good in places, but is overall quite bad. Some levels force you to wait for slowly moving platforms, while others will have traps like spikes or springs at the end of a long corridor which you're supposed to run through. It's the classic 'trial and error' gameplay we saw in a lot of modern Sonic games where you're punished for running at breakneck speeds by having no time to react to obstacles in front of you. The best example of this is the end of Stage 3 right next to the goal.

(but maybe is just me :P)\n*The performance depending on the hardware that any of us have can either go good, or incredibly laggy, especially on later levels.

Just don't have much/anything running in the background and i'm sure the game will still stay at a smooth framerate.).\n\nWith that said, its time I finally give my thoughts on the game.\n\n[b]Plot[/b]\nI am glad to say that this game has a good plot behind it. Spark's journey is all about getting his job back, and not really about saving the world from a robotic takeover. It has its humor & doesn't take itself too seriously (unlike another Sonic-inspired indie game...), which is really refreshing.\n\n[b]Presentation[/b]\nThis game looks amazing. Character sprites are fluid & animated well, and the enviornments Spark travels through feel like big, fleshed-out areas of his world. Also, this game's soundtrack is PHENOMINAL!!! It has its Genesis callbacks, rhythmic basses, and anime battle themes galore, which gives this game a diverse soundtrack that's worth listening to, even if you've never played this game before. Overall this game presents itself really well.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAs I've said with Freedom Planet, the game is almost entirely worth buying just for the gameplay alone, and this game is no exception. The control is very responsive & fluid with Spark's movement & attacks. Speaking of which, its time to actually talk about the game's protagonist. Spark can do quite a lot in this game. He can wall jump like Mario, dash like X (Mega Man X to be exact), and use copy abilities like Kirby. Also he can run like Sonic, but that was kind of a given since this game is obviously Sonic-inspired. The power-up system is diverse & provides great combat oppertunities for the player, which I for one enjoy. The only fault I have is with this game's stage design. Its either too confusing, to lengthy, or a mix of the two. It really makes the game drag on for far longer than it should. Besides that, this game is still worth its price.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nSpark the Electric Jester is a fun game with a simple plot & a wonderful presentation to back it up. Despite its massive issue with lag, it is well worth your time if you can make sure it doesn't lag too much.

Now I've finally played the missions and have the full review ready to go!\n\nSpark's Story: Honestly I enjoyed Spark, I thought he controlled well. His powers were each special and none of them were too powerful (although Edgy and Magical can get you out of a pinch).\n\nFark's Story: My favorite part of the game. Fark is so much fun! He can't use powerups like Spark can, but he has [b]NEW[/b] powers. He can parry, regain health using Static Mode, and go Super! His bosses are fun and the theme for the special bosses is great! \n\nSpark's Challenge: My least favorite part of the game. You play Fark's Story as Spark and you have only 2 HITS! You also can't regain health in boss fights like Fark can. Not to mention that Spark's dash parry is so picky about working (and if it doesn't work you are going to die a lot). \n\nSPC Missions: These 10 missions are what you must complete to unlock Super Spark. You replay the same stages but with new objectives (kinda like Team Chaotix in Sonic Heroes actually). Some are pathetically easy while others (the Fark one) will haunt your dreams for years. \n\nVisuals: Yep this game looks fantastic! Even the desert level is nice on the eyes (something Nintendo hasn't been able to do for years). Unfortunately the visuals cause a bit of frame loss in some of the levels with a heavier load. Still this game is gorgeous to look at.\n\nSoundtrack: Now while I can't remember any of the stage names, I can remember all of their tracks with ease! I love every track in this game with my favorite being the special boss theme (the one I mentioned earlier). Although there were some tracks that sounded awfully familiar to other games (the laval level's track sounded a lot like Planet Wisp to me). I'd recommend checking out the soundtrack that does have a buyable release.\n\nOverall Story Presentation: The story is ok in my opinion, it breaks the 4th wall a few times.

How will the devolper fair when he can't use pre existing assets and characters? Turns out, pretty decent\n\nFor those wondering I'd give spark a 7/10. This isn't a bad score! Spark is a above average game with a few issues and bugs. It could use cleaner character designs (which hasn't historically been one of fepard's best abilities) and a few gameplay tweaks, but overall is a enjoyable a good 90% of the time\n\nNow for the full review\n\nSo everyone else has already gone over the basics of gameplay so let me give you the short version.\nSpark the electric jester plays a bit like a kirby game with some of the speed of sonic. You  can press various dirrections to do attacks diffrent attacks A la super smash bros. There's a variety of powers to collect and I will say for the most part they feel a bit more varied then kirby. I feel like Fepard wanted the player to ask \"which power is the best for this situation.\"\nThere's some funny ones like edgy and magical which will make you chuckle but they are at least useful and you'll get over the joke quickly. It's a good thing they're actually  two of my favs or the joke would wear thin quickly. Spark can also dash to give a quick burst of speed. The player will need to realize if they're already going quite fast this dash may just slow them down a bit. It's more like using sonic's spin dash to start picking up speed rather then a megaman X dash where you should spam it everywhere.\n\nYou can also collect small diamonds to fill a bar above your hp to give you another shot, reviving you instantly if you die. I only managed to do this once thus far. There's hp pickups as well. Much like kirby the highlight of spark is it's boss fights and colorful enviroments. these were easily the most fun part of the game and I enjoyed them a lot. Also like kirby the levels themselves sometimes aren't the best part. The high speed sonic like sections are always great...it feels good to go fast in this game especially when you first start. But sometimes levels can be too cramped with enimies and I find myself running past them all, just trying to get to the end.\n\nSpark has three play modes. I'm going to try to go over all three without spoilers. Only read the first of the three or stop reading this now if you wish to find the rest on your own\n\nSpark's Story:\nThe basic mode. Your HP bar has 6 segments and after that another hit kills you. This mode is fairly easy. I spent the majority of the first 3 or 4 stages just having a blast trying out all of spark's varried abilities. This fun of course couldn't last forever. I did keep playing though because when the fun stops some the fairly simplistic story starts to pick up some depth. Near the end you get and honestly amazing conclusion that I dare not spoil. Let me say however it was quite the finale. However the last fight itself is kinda bad..not because the boss is but [spoiler] The ability spark has to use is boring, only having two attacks and one is flat out just better, being him spinning in circles to shred the boss's health[/spoiler]\n\nNone the less this is a mostly  fairly easy time that will be a blast to run through..furthering my feeling that this is like a kirby game..especially looking at the next mode\n\n[spoiler]Fark's[/spoiler] story\n\nWelcome to extra mode. Estentially this is like Dedede tour or revenge of metaknight from kirby games. You'll find yourself spamming dash just to go through this mode's stages quickly most likely, as not too much is changed. I myself am not one to replay games often, so having to go through the same stages made me just want to rush through them. This mode gives you only 3 bars of health and removes the usualy static bar for a new one. Filling this one to half will let you drain it for short invinicbility, super charged attacks and speed, and a full health restore. Filling it to full will make your basic attack string much beafier. But filling this bar is hard and the reason is simple: The parry system. Hitting enimies will fill it a little but EX mode introduces parries. By hitting the store power button it now functions as a block of shorts. perfect timing will fill the bar a fair bit, ok timing a little, and bad timing will either drain it but not have you take a hit, or just result in you taking damage. This all takes an easy game and makes it quite difficult, to the point where the first boss gave me trouble and I died quite a lot during this campaign. The level design became awful in some places. taking damage from off screen sources as I dashed into them in my rush  to clear the stages made me fairly frustrated. I'm not sure who's fault that is though, mine or the devs.\n\nThe highlight of this mode is unsupringly the boss fights. Both because of the cool parry system that I honeslty fell in love with end game and the fact that extra bosses are added in as well with some kick ass music. The only music in this game to have lyrics. They deal with [spoiler] Fark's [/spoiler] insecurities and such and honestly I enjoy that kind of cheezy crap. I eat it up\n\nThe downside of this mode is any problems with level design are only made even worse. Fepard decided [spoiler]Fark's[/spoiler] levels had to be even hard, so he threw some new hazards into a lot of them. Honestly I just wanted to fight the bosses. Perhaps it's my fault for playing these campaigns back to back with the kind of person I am but I just wanted to get to the fighting.\n\nOh right the story.. I can't go into too much  detail on this because I do think the idea is really neat..and falls in line with the conclusion of the previous story and it's clear inspirations. But I thought it was intriguing most the way through..but ultimately weaker and there was far less of it..for perhaps understandable reasons\n\n[spoiler] Spark's challenge [/spoiler]\n1 HP. EXTRA MODE LEVELS AND BOSS!\nWHY WHY WHY\noh and no parry for you! Master the perfect dodge or prepare to suffer! See if you weren't observant on your first playthrough the game informs you that spark can take no damage by preforming his dash at just the right time. However, I was and remember this being really hard to do!\n\n[spoiler] thank god for wishes mode, unlocked by beating spark's story. it lets spark choose any power he wants at any time [/spoiler]\n...\n\nThese were my intial thoughts. However, [spoiler] fark's story [/spoiler] prepares you pretty good for this! I won't lie. this is not an easy task. The boss are ready to give you a renewed round of pain. Some of the extra bosses from the previous mode gave me a lot of trouble, especially [spoiler] shadow far [/spoiler] but other then that, while challenging it can be overcome\n\nFinally, we have\n\n[spoiler] svc challenges\n\nthis is a series of ten challenges you have to complete, ranging from don't touch the floor for too long, don't touch the floor at all and play as gravity jester, don't jump, collect hidden idles, and surive a stage with no hp. Some of these are hard and the megaraph challenge took me an hour or two but.. come on you beat spark's challenge. you can do this. once you do you get [/spoiler]\n\n\n[spoiler] super wished mode. you can use super spark in the main game! Intially I didn't like super spark but honestly after spending a lot of time spining as cool jester to beat bosses I can apreciate it. I just wish it had a charge attack. It is a worthwhile completion reward though. [/spoiler]\n\n\nafter 20+ hours of play time, I can definately say spark the electric jester is a game worth playing to completetion and has plenty for you to do. However, don't play the game in one long marathon. If you're like me going through the (mostly) the same stages can get a bit  tedious at time.

It looks like a Sonic game but plays like a mix between Sonic, Kirby and Mega Man. And despite the main concept not sounding very original, it's full of charm and cool ideas, and it's also really fun to play. There are several different forms of Spark and all of them are really fun to use (except for the default one lol), the level themes are very creative and the gimmicks are quite fun most of the time. While the sprites aren't that well drawn the backgrounds are really good looking and detailed, the color choices are usually very pleasing to the eye, and the music is simply [b]AMAZING[/b]. This game probably has my favorite OST in any indie game ever. Even if you don't plan to get the game at least listen to the OST. The dialogue is also well written and very amusing despite some dumb capitalization issues lol.\n\nI have a few problems with the game, though. The first one is the level design. It's not bad but also not as great as I expected. The levels lack memorable moments Sonic games usually have, they can get a bit repetitive, and sometimes it's hard to tell where you're supposed to go. The game also doesn't reward exploration at all. There are some somewhat broken powerups that allow you to climb walls or just fly but doing these doesn't reward the player 90% of the time. In addition to these issues I feel like the levels could be a bit more well designed overall. That doesn't mean they are not fun, there's just a lot of room for improvement.\n\nIt was also a bit hard to get used to the dash move, I always forgot it was there until the 4th zone. I also think the bosses get a bit too long and tiresome near the end. The enemy designs are kinda boring and samey as well. The game also has some technical problems, like the game running at 2 FPS if the gamepad is not connected. But that might be just my PC, who knows.

Many people state that this title suffers from technical issues however I've yet to experience any beyond a short dip in frames that lasted for a few seconds a couple times in my playthrough. Far from anything to worry about. \n\nPros\n- Great variety to gameplay with multiple jester styles that all play very differently with their own strengths and weaknesses\n- Excellent retro game style soundtrack, hype sonic style music all day.\n- Levels have a good flow to them and have a variety of paths for variety. They seem well crafted overall and are\nvery unique to one another\n- Decent length, about as long as freedom planet factoring out cutscenes\n- Has a second story mode as a different character, adding to replay value\n\nCons\n- Rare frame drops (in my playthrough) The severity of this issue however is varied between users, of windows 10 mainly, as some people get it down to 10 fps for almost half the game. There are work arounds that require the use of a second controller or for you to play on the keyboard. A bit of a pain, but the game is work it overall.\n- Story is nothing to write home about.

It does have plenty of good aspects, like the controls are good, the powers are all cool, and trying out new ones is great. The bosses are all pretty solid (although there was one towards the end of the game with WAY too much health). However, the level design, OH the level design. Even though the majority of the aspects of the game are alright, the level design isn't fun, and it makes the entire game suffer greatly. At first it's pretty alright, but as the game goes on it just becomes a bland, repetitive mess with every level taking FOREVER. It just keeps going, and going, and going (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, DESERT LEVEL)! And it just gets worse and worse the farther you go. Although the later levels have more interesting gimmicks, they repeat the same kinds of challenges ad nauseum, so any fun the gimmicks could have provided gets wasted away, or at least wears out quickly. The game doesn't really have much idea of challenge progression, and kind of throws enemies just wherever without much thought, it feels. Especially towards the end, where the final levels literally just throw hoards of all of the strongest enemies at you in straight, bland rooms. The game literally enemy spams like Freedom Planet did with its final levels, where the only legitimate way to get through is to just run past everything and tank hits until you make it through. In fact I'm pretty sure that was the intented way to get through it. Because it'll do stuff like make you fight a miniboss enemy to progress that takes a while to kill, and then immediately after throw the same miniboss enemy with the same health everywhere in the stage as if they're normal enemies, along with tons of strong enemies all around them. It's insane. Another thing is the game has countless sections where nothing happens. Just long stretches of holding right / left where you go from one booster to the next, one loop to the next. It's literally modern Sonic hold right to win automatic sections. I thought the majority of Sonic fans hated those as they wasted your time, and were boring, but apparently Lake Feperd thought otherwise. These sections PLAGUE the game, and can be REALLY long!\n\nThere's this weird thing with the boss health bars. The first bosses in the game have this huge health bar that reaches from one side of the screen to the other, however after a certain point all of the bosses start using this smaller health bar that's just on the bottom right, that takes like the same amount of time to deplete as the original health bars. It's a different design too. It's really weird. It's as if he changed the design of the health bars and forgot to change it for all of the bosses. I don't get it.\n\nThere are two things in the second to final stage that made me bat an eye and go \"really?\" The game literally ripped some things off of Freedom Planet (another Sonic-style indie game). There's a turret enemy that shoots a wave laser like an enemy in freedom planet, and the laser literally has what seems to be the exact same graphic as the one in freedom planet. That, and there's giant lasers you have to periodically wait for before going through their firing path like the last level of freedom planet. That was kind of dumb to see, but there's not really anything else akin to this as far as I can tell.\n\nThe writing is just okay. They try to be all snarky, but sometimes it just doesn't feel like actual dialogue from characters, and instead comes off as stuff the creator threw in just for the sake of being silly. It does land at times. Like more often than not Spark himself has some great dialogue, and is consistantly sarcastic, and detached from what's happening and the characters, while still being true to himself. But sometimes characters will just be like \"I like butts, okay. I have no idea why I was programmed to like butts\" and it's just... what. Like even though a character might be going \"what\" too, it still feels really out of place.\n\nThe story is interesting. You start trying to get back your job, and as you progress you find out that there's a robot who has been reprogramming other robots to take over the world using this giant mega computer he's suppose to guard that was originally used to invent intelligent AI. It's interesting that you kind of have to discover what's really happening as you go, and it's a really cool concept that's executed decently.\n\nThe game is good at world building. It never explicitly explains what the world is about, what happens in it, etc.. Instead it leaves those things to exist as part of the enviornments, and to be talked about in dialogue like people already know about it, and you just have to figure out and learn what's going on as you play. Like in the opening cinimatic thing when you start the game there's this interesting ring thing around the planet, and throughout the stages there's background elements referencing the planet's air circulation crisis. It turns out at the end of the game that there's a huge weather satellite that drives the air circulation of the planet, and the bad guy tries to blow it up as a last ditch effort in order to destroy the world. It gives you all of the pieces that the ring around the planet at the beginning is the weather satellite, and is the thing the bad guy is trying to destroy. The bad guy never explains that there's an air circulation crisis, or says things in ways a charater from this universe would never say. It gives you all of the information naturally.\n\nThe graphics look flat. The sprites look fine otherwise actually, and the enviornment designs and character designs themselves are great overall, but the actual sprites don't have very much shading, mostly utilizing white shines than anything else. It can slightly mess with the perspective on some characters too. It's not too bad, and sort of has its own look, but it leaves something to be desired.\n\nThe music is forgettable. The melodies just don't accomplish anything. They're fine enough when playing the stages, and I'm pretty sure the songs are fine on like all other aspects, but man I can't remember a single song other than the title screen theme.\n\nThe cutscene art is THE DEFINITION OF STYLE CLASH!!! The sprites in the game don't really have outlines, but then all of a sudden the cutscene art has the THICKEST outlines. The cutscenes look like some kind of animation you'd find on YouTube too, with messy outlines, jankey animations, hardly any shading, and occasional pillow shading when it does. Also I remember an attack that the boss against Fark on a hovercraft had where he slammed the ground with a spontaneously appearing blue arm and fist that was the same style as the cutscene art, right against all of the completely different sprites. That was really bad looking.\n\nI really wish there was some kind of music jingle when you complete a stage or die. It's just silent, and it kind of just feels empty. It makes completing a stage less satisfying, and dying less impactful.\n\nThere's some technical issues too. It seems to have the same problem that OG Game Maker has where if you plug / unplug a controller while the game is on it'll slow down to 2 fps, and the only way to fix it is to restart your computer. That, and it didn't recognize my PS4 controller anyway. That was irritating, but after restarting my computer, plugging my controller in beforehand, and using joy2key, I was fine. It also is really weird with fullscreen. I went into fullscreen during the opening animation where it zooms in on the planet, and it froze the display. And when I pause the game in full, it incorrectly sizes the pause menu over the screen, having it smaller than the actual game window, and being able to still see the paused game below and to the right of the pause menu.\n\nOverall, the game isn't worth $15. Spend your money elsewhere, like on Freedom Planet. That's a better Sonic-style game      :Y", "timestamp_created": 1494103658, "timestamp_updated": 1494189737, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468571", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31564862": {"recommendationid": "31564862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192468491", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516640219}, "language": "english", "review": "Spark the electric jester is a really fun sonic/genesis style game that is worth playing despite the lack of polish in some areas(which are very minor).", "timestamp_created": 1494009489, "timestamp_updated": 1494009489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31537461": {"recommendationid": "31537461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103053579", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494818311}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one I would recommend very highly simply cause its like a Mashup of various other 16 bit games like Kirby and Sonic. While the game itself has technical issues and a somewhat confusing storyline that I honestly had a hard time following (and the cheesy jokes didn't help either), that is ALL trumped by the game itself. You are really stupid if you don't buy this game and are a fan of the older 16 bit games. It's astounding just how much care has gone into the game's design itself and as well as the overall combat and level design keep things fresh. The boss fights are easy to follow but gradually get harder as you progress. Don't even get me started on the music, It just has so much energy and emotion in it.\n\nAfter completing one playthrough isn't even the end of it. There are more with their own twists and turns but I won't reveal what they are because of spoilers. They also have that difficulty spike those more seasoned 16 bit game players enjoy. Yet the Main campaign keeps it relatively easy for those who are new to the genre.\n\nLike I said my main issues are the storyline which has some grammatical issues (Which I don't blame the developer all too much for that because he is Brazilian and I'm 90% his first language was not english) and is confusing and hard to follow at some points. To add on to that, like i said before I had technical issues with the game in terms of some really bad slowdowns at some really important points in the game like the Final boss fight and a few glitches and some exploits I have discovered.\n\nOverall do yourself a favor and get this game. You won't regret it if you can get past the issues listed above. Alot of love has gone into this game and the nostalgia trip is all but perfect for me. The developer has really outdone himself this game as his first commercial release and I know this because I played his fan games he made back then and they were really good.

Nota: 9.0\n\n*GRAFICOS*\nEl juego contiene un aspecto Retro al mas puro estilo de la epoca del los 16 Bits, con una escensia pura al Super Nintendo y sobre todo al Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, con un dise\u00f1o de escenario hermoso y creativo, una paleta de colores extremadamente viva y un dise\u00f1o de personajes muy bien trabajado. ademas de que los sprites estan muy bien elaborados y poseen rotacion suave.\n\nApartado muy bien trabajado y sin errores. Nota: 10\n\n*HISTORIA*\nTratare de no dar spoilers, \"Spark, un \"Bufon Electrico\" el cual era un gran haz en su trabajo, se encuentra enojado tras haber sido reemplazado por un robot, puesto que los robots han decidido dominar el mundo, asi que Spark se enbarcara en una gran aventura para vencer al robot que le quito su trabajo, pero durante su travecia, el recuperar su trabajo, sera lo ultimo que le importara\"\n\nEn si la historia apesar de ser bastante simple, esta muy bien para un juego de plataformas, cuanta con uno que otro giro de tuerca y contiene un simpatico estilo del humor y un gran carisma que te sacara unas sonrisitas. Nota: 8.5\n\n*BANDA SONORA*\nEste es posiblemente lo mejor del juego, la banda sonora de este juego contiene una gran composicion que van desde temas alegres y tranquilos, hasta temas epicos sacados de un anime o pelicula.\n\nTemas estilo retro, Rock, Metal y Roster epico, cada tema en este juego es un deleite para tus oidos, este es uno de esos casos donde vale la pena comprar la banda sonora.\n\nMaravillosa banda sonora. Nota: 10\n\n*VALOR DE COMPRA*\nEl juego tiene una duracion aproximada de unas 4 o 5 horas, pues tienes 2 historias para completar y otros desafios. Pero la corta duracion esta muy bien para ser un juego de plataformas, puesto que siempre querras volver por mas y dominarlo. 15 Dolares es un precio bastante razonable, aunque hubiera esperado unos cuantos modos extra.\nNota: 8.0\n\nAntes de pasar a la conclusion me gustaria resaltar los aspectos negativos del juego, los cuales son 2.\n\n1.- Framerate: El rendimiento por lo general es estable, durante los primeros niveles siempre esta fluyendo en 60 FPS con ligeras fluctuaciones, pero del nivel 9 en adelante, se presentan caidas de Framerate hasta 30 o incluso 10 FPS, mantengo la teoria de que eso se debe a la enorme cantidad de enemigos y explosiones que hay en los ultimos niveles. pero de ser un simple problema de optimizacion, espero que se arregle pronto con un parche o actualizacion. Aun asi, el juego se mantiene estable y divertido apesar de las caidas de Framerate que afortunadamente, solo duran unos cuantos segundos.\n\n2.- Sistema de PowerUps: No hablare de los PowerUps como tal, hablo de la forma de obtenerlos, pues no te preguntas si quieres reemplazar el PowerUp que tienes por uno que encontraste, apenas toques el nuevo PowerUp, perderas el que tenias antes, apreciaria que cuando te encuentres con un PowerUp, primero se te pregunte si quieres cambiarlo.\n\n*CONCLUSION*\nSpark The Electric Jester, es un excelente juego Indie, con una excelente y frenetica jugabilidad, un gran apartado artistico y una formidable banda sonora.\nUn claro ejemplo de que las campa\u00f1as de Kickstarter pueden traer cosas maravillosas, si tienes 15 dolares y no tienes nada que jugar durante un fin de semana o durante unas vacaciones, Spark es una muy buena opcion y si eres amante del genero de plataformas, esta es una compra obligada.\n\nNada Mal para ser el primer proyecto original de LakeFeperd. Espero ver mas de este juego en un futuro.\n\nCalificacion Final: 9.1 - Electricamente Sorprendete.", "timestamp_created": 1493783720, "timestamp_updated": 1494036175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31494427": {"recommendationid": "31494427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055268147", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495721770}, "language": "english", "review": "Spark the Electrical Jester. A package of everything that Lakefeperd has done up to this point. \nI can see the influences of all of the Sonic fangames he created rolled into this game. From Sonic: Before the Sequel to Sonic Chrono Adventure, you get a taste of everything he's created all into one amazing package. For this review I will be keeping spoilers to a minimum, but I will be talking about each mode. This review is designed to be fair and informative. \n\n_______\nSpark's Story: \nSo to start things off, the story is kept very minimal at the start of the game. You have a very basic plot of Spark's mission to get his job back. Spark is an Electrical Jester and his job was taken by a robotic duplicate of himself that he calls Fark. Now at first glance you might get see a comparison for Sonic and Metal Sonic and that might be what was intended. \nAs you proceed further into the adventure, you soon meet other characters who will keep telling Spark to turn back and to quit persuing Fark. Spark is on a mission to get his job back so you will be persuing Fark through the entire adventure. I won't be saying when and where you battle him because it would be major spoilers. The only thing I will say is that you will get a nice remix of the game's main theme when you do fight him. \nThe game will take you through cities, forests, deserts, volcanoes, the skies above, and even all the way into space itself. There is a lot of variety for the stages and you will have to play the game for yourself to really see if Spark can get his job back. \n\nGameplay and Mechanics: \nSpark has a health bar of 7 hits. You will only take a hit from an enemy or environmental hazard. You will not take damage from running into an enemy unless they are attacking. After taking a hit, he will have a few seconds of being invulnerable. You can refill your health by picking up health nodes. The health nodes are orange with a white core in the middle. You can find them free floating or in defeated enemies sometimes. \nAlong with Health Nodes you will find yellow diamond shaped pick-ups you can find scattered through out the levels. These fill up a bar above your health bar. This bar is important. If you lose all your health and you have filled up the yellow bar fully, you will be revived and have health restored. I would call this yellow bar your Last Stand. \nIf you do die you will restart from the last save point you touched. This game does not have any lives or game overs.\n\nSpark provides you with a basic tutorial for controlling him and his basic abilities when you first start the game so I'm not going to cover that stuff. \nIn the game you can find power-ups that Spark can use. You will find the mechanic for these to be very Kirby-esque in design. There are a total of 12 in game power-ups to try out as Spark. You can carry two at a time or you can settle for using base Spark and his powers. There is a secret power-up, but it's spoiler heavy so you will have to play the game to find out what this power-up is.\nThe power-ups have a wide variety of skills depending on what you want to use. Just make sure that you take a moment to pause the game to see exactly what each one does. Some have a double jump while others have a mid-air dash. Some are close combat while others are long range. It's up to you the player to decide what you like the most.\n\nComplete Spark's story and you will unlock Whishes Mode (lets you access all of Spark's power-ups in his gameplay mode) and Fark's Story mode. \n\nFark's Story: \nFark has a story? Yes he does. His story takes place right after the events of Spark's story. All the same levels but with added twists. New level routes and harder enemies. Some bosses are brand new. Before you start the story, the game will tell you briefly of Fark's gameplay. Get ready for a challenge. \n\nGameplay and Mechanics: \nFark only has 4 hits on his health bar but you can refill his health the same way you did with Spark. Same goes for the Last Stand gauge. \n\nFark can't use power-ups, but power-up spots are replaced by blue nodes that fill up the Static gauge. Specific to his playstyle is the Static gauge and his unique block move. \nThese two things go hand in hand. To survive Fark's story you will need to utilize the block mechanic. When Fark blocks, he will be rewarded on how well you blocked. When you have a succesful block you will get a matrix-like slowdown and a colored circle will flash around of Fark and he will have temporary invulnerability.\nRed - Dodged in seconds while getting hit. This will save your hit point from depleting. \nYellow - Basic dodge achieved. You will gain a little static charge from the successful block. \nBlue/Green - Perfect dodge. Fark will flash white, has a longer invulnerable period, and the static gauge gets more energy than a regular dodge. \nWhen you attack with Fark, you will slowly build up the Static gauge as well, but blocking is the fastest way to fill up the gauge. When the bar is full enough you can go into Static mode to power Fark up and regain all health or you can fill the bar up fully and use Fark's secret weapon. Be aware that you will lose static bar energy if you take a hit or use the Static mode. \nFor the basic list of Fark's abilities, press start to view the pause menu. \n\nComplete Fark's story and unlock Spark Challenge. \n\nSpark Challenge: \nThe basic plot of this mode is that Fark's story was made into a VR game and Spark wants to try it out on the hardest difficulty. You are basically playing Fark's story as Spark, but you only have 2 hits. Before you start the story, Fark will also tell Spark he has a dodge move and to use it well. \n\nGameplay and Mechanics:\nBasically the same as regular Spark. You have all 12 power-ups to find, but you can only take 2 hits. Before starting Challenge mode, it suggests that you play with Whishes Mode on. It's very difficult to beat without it, but is possible. \nThe most important thing to use is going to be the Dash. The dash move is how you dodge as Spark and timing is everything. You will die a lot.\nAnother important thing in this mode is a sound cue that some enemies and bosses make. This is critical to timing your dodge correctly. \n\nComplete the challenge and you get a teaser image to Lakefeperd's next project and unlock SPC Challenges. \n\nSPC Challenges: \nThis mode is a series of 10 challenges. Complete all of them and you unlock something for Whishes Mode. \n\n_______ \nA few other things. \n\nMusic: \nDespite being a sprite based, 2D side scroller adventure, there is a wide selection of music provided by only 6 musicians. Each music track is unique and I can't find any that I don't like.\n\nBugs and Glitches: \nI have been reading that many people talk about there being framerate issues. I have personally never had this issue. I am using a Windows 7 Pro computer with Intel Core i6 Processor. The only time I had experienced any slowdown was when dodging, but I don't have any problem with that. If anything it makes it look like a matrix dodge with the way time slows down briefly. That's cool to me. \nI experienced a bug that did cause the game to close, but it didn't delete my save or anything so it didn't stop progress. \nNothing game breaking to report from my experience. \n\nAchievements and Patches: \nAt this time, the developer has not planned to make any patches to the game. \nThere are only 4 achievements in the game. You collect them for beating each story and challenge. This is where the game loses some replayability. It's not a bad thing, but there is a stunning lack of achievements and I think this hurts the game a bit. Lakefeperd, if you plan to release any future patches, it would be a great idea to add more achievements. This goes for the SPC Challenges mode too. 10 is a good start, but it would be great to have more Challenges too. \n\nWith that being said, I greatly enjoyed this game and if in the future there are more Achievements and Challenges, I will revisit it to clear and complete them.", "timestamp_created": 1493670428, "timestamp_updated": 1493693950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31488169": {"recommendationid": "31488169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021491385", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508381104}, "language": "english", "review": "Spark the Electric Jester is a game where a little fuzzy yellow man gets angry a robot took his job and swears to kill every last robot until he gets his job back. Truly a classic plot if I've seen one.\n\nTo do this, Spark has to rush through plenty of thematically varied stages with many a Kirby-esque power to use to either help traverse and platform or to use to kick the ever-loving bolts out of whatever robot is standing in his way. You can have one power equipped and one stored away for later, letting you mix up how you play. It's actually a very solid concept, and the implementation of the dash makes it so you're almost never caught on anything for too long and it's just oh-so satisfying to be able to get through a stage and keep your momentum with the help of some of the moves found with each power. This, accompanying with the EXTREMELY great soundtrack and the wonderful designs of the world and sprites themselves make Spark a blast to play through, especially if you're a fan of games like Sonic or Kirby to begin with. The stages jump around thematically as you traverse them as well, adding elements and different looking areas as you continue through a stage.\n\nThe bosses, which they're coming by the bucket full, are all rather varied as well and each usually requires a certain amount of awareness and figuring out the patterns in order to beat them down, especially in the later modes where getting hit is definitely not an option. The dash greatly helps in this regard, not only giving you invincibility frames if timed correctly against an attack but also lets you position yourself where you need to be quickly, and it works really well. Sometimes they felt like they could drag on for a bit too long at times due to their rather extensive health, but it usually didn't deter me from not enjoying it. It does, however, get very tedious if you happen to not have any good offensive powers on you, which can sometimes manange to happen if you're unlucky enough. Some of the placement of the powers are rather haphazard as well, to the point that I managed to miss a whole power for the entire game. These problems alleviate themselves a bit when you unlock the ability to swap powers on the go, but it's a few that persists nonetheless. \n\nThe things that definitely bugged me the most were the story, which there regrettably isn't much of and tends to feel a bit forced at times (there's a character that starts talking about butts and the internet), but it does eventually go for a much darker tone later on and it remains intriguing enough to at least keep playing, especially with the adrenaline rush you get from the platforming alone. There's also frame rate issues caused by the controller support, but it never got bad enough for me to ever be affected by it and hopefully it's something that gets patched out. I've also experienced some smaller kinks as well, usually with music awkwardly starting back up and fading out again after a boss, or boss health bars sticking around when the boss is already beat. All of them never persisted more than a couple of seconds but they were jarring enough to notice.\n\nI honestly fallen in love with Spark as a game (enough to say I liked it better than Freedom Planet), and while there are a few flaws with the game as it is now, I find that the pros far outweigh the cons and with a healthy dose of updates and polish it'll only get better with time. If you're a fan of fast-paced frantic platforming and hectic boss fights with lots of movement, you'll most likely enjoy this game just as much as I have.", "timestamp_created": 1493649484, "timestamp_updated": 1493649484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31472519": {"recommendationid": "31472519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022311251", "num_games_owned": 628, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493527832}, "language": "english", "review": "Full disclosure: I actually backed Spark the Electric Jester on Kickstarter. The game looked like another Sonic homage game, much like Freedom Planet -- another game I enjoyed. I followed the game's development, played the various demos that the developer released and enjoyed what I experienced. The developer, generally referred to by the pseudonym \"Lake Feperd\" was fairly well known within the Sonic fangame community, having developed such titles as Sonic Before the Sequel and Sonic After the Sequel, and decided to make an original property in the same vein of these games. Though this game borrows very heavily from Sonic, as one might expect, it borrows an equal amount from the Kirby games -- another series I've enjoyed.\n\nPlayers step into the role of Spark, an electric jester who was recently fired and replaced by a robot, who he dubs \"Fark\", seeing that he's just a \"fake Spark\". Soon after, all of the robots inhabiting Spark's world revolt against the master, setting their sights on world domination. Seeing that his robotic replacement is among the uprising, Spark decides to defeat the robot, so he can regain his job. That's pretty much the entire story, but isn't that all you really need for a throwback 2D platformer?\n\nThe gameplay is the true star of the show here. Spark is able to run at fast speeds like Sonic -- a fitting power, given Feperd Games' history -- but instead of jumping at enemies to hurt them, Spark has a dedicated attack button. By default, he can slash away at the wind, or if held, he can let loose a devastating charge shot. What's really unique here is the combo meter: if Spark is able to get off enough consecutive hits in a short time and avoid getting harmed himself, he can filled a meter -- which powers up his charge shot significantly. Of course, Spark's also got access to a whole host of different abilities, obtained by collecting various hats and weapons in stages, that completely change his abilities -- clearly inspired by Kirby. The Cool Jester hat allows Spark to skate at high speeds, stand on water with no problem and shoot icicles with his charge shot. The Hammer gives Spark access to a giant mallet, capable of dealing heavy damage, smash fireballs into the air by hitting the ground and gives him a mighty swing instead of his charge shot. Archer gives Spark a crossbow, Board gives him a hoverboard and Wind gives him a triple jump. Better still, Spark can hold two weapons at a time: keeping one in reserve while the other is active.\n\nThe graphics do a pretty good job of emulating the look of Genesis-era character platformers. Everything's vibrant and colorful and the environments never get too busy, easily allowing players to distinguish between obstacles and backgrounds. The character designs are pretty good too: many of the robots have similar features, which reminded me of several Treasure games, like Silhouette Mirage, Mischief Makers, but especially Dynamite Headdy.\n\nWhile I said the gameplay takes center stage in this game, the music is an extremely close second. In fact, the main reason this game was crowdfunded in the first place was so that Feperd could hire the very composers behind the previous Sonic fan-games' soundtracks, and they do an excellent job here as well. Much like the game itself, the Sonic inspiration is clearly there, but it does enough differently to distinguish itself and create its own sound. As I said earlier, I backed the game and my reward package included the soundtrack, which was definitely worth the investment. My favorite tracks in the game would have to be \"Network Coast\", \"Lightoria Bay\", \"Lunar Bass\" and \"VS Fark\".\n\nThe game boasts 16 stages and multiple bosses, but also has a fair amount of replay value. After completing the main campaign, players unlock three extra modes. Time Attack Mode is pretty standard. Players also unlock the ability to play as Fark, who has less health, lacks Spark's weapons but has the ability to parry enemy attacks and Wishes Mode, which allows Spark to switch between all of his weapons at will, likely named in reference to \"Milky Way Wishes\" from Kirby Super Star.\n\nConsidering the fact that I've been excited for the upcoming Sonic Mania and Freedom Planet 2, Spark the Electric Jester succeeded in scratching that particular itch for a Sonic-style platformer for the time being. StEJ definitely lives up to the reputation Feperd has built with his fan games, and I hope we see even more original work out of this developer.  \n\nI've been hearing various reports of slowdown and other errors, but the game worked perfectly fine for me. Only odd issues I've had while playing the game were some odd fade outs with the music, but nothing too major.

Yeah, this game caught my attention quick.\n\nSo, where do I start...\n\nFirst off, this game is a really fun one, easily. There are many memorable levels and moments that just made me want to keep playing through to the end. The music, the powers, a lot of it is just charming.\n\nThe story kind of threw me off, I'll admit. It does devolve into a \"take over the world\" story, but Spark himself? Jeez, you won't find anyone who loves what he does for a living more than that guy. I mean, at some points I forgot that Spark was just trying to get his job back, not to defeat the leader of a robot army. There's nobody more dedicated to his work than him that I've seen.\n\nSpark himself is just a charming character. He's got a solitary goal in mind, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have a personality. There are multiple character interactions he has with others that genuinely made me laugh. He'd outright have conversations with other bosses before they remembered they were supposed to fight to the death. While this may seem like a flaw to others, I find this good. But hey, to each their own.\n\nThe gameplay, as I've summed up, is as if Sonic and Mega Man X had a kid, with Kirby as the babysitter. The levels are easily Sonic-esque, with Spark having abilities of X with his dash and Zero with the attacks. The Kirby aspect comes from the power-ups, or Jester Modes as I like to call them. We have about... Shoot, I lost count, DANG IT... Well, there's a bunch, put simply. Some of these, I have no idea if they were even TRYING to be subtle. The \"Edgy Jester\" has a \"Not-Chaos Blast\" for a charge attack, the \"Mage Jester\" with a \"Not-Kamehameha\" or \"Uni-beam\" as Somecallmejohnny calls it, and \"Magical Jester\" with a \"Not-Star Rod\" as a weapon.\n\nIt may sound like I'm being negative there, but I'm not. I honestly like these references.\n\nAlso, yeah, \"Edgy Jester\" is a thing. I like it.\n\nLevel-wise, they offer multiple paths, encouraging exploration, which I like, but if you want to, they're good for speedrunners, too. I will admit they are on the long side, maybe about the same length as Freedom Planet, though I won't deny they have their charms. Each level offers their own gimmicks, which I felt was a nice touch, and they offer twists within those gimmicks, keeping them fresh.\n\nThe bosses themselves aren't hard, but given the amount of them, it may take time to learn their attack patterns. Some bosses may give you a run for your money, though.\n\nThe music is really good, coming from a guy that has Sonic After and Before the Sequel under their belt. I haven't heard the entirety of those soundtracks, but I got some major vibes from them; it's good stuff, from rock to electronic to fusion.\nSunset Heights was definitely based on Technology Tree: Act 3, though, I think.\n\nI won't deny this game has flaws, though. The frame rate can be really odd at times, as well as some wierdo things that I didn't know was a thing. (Freakin' dying a second after I kill a boss, what the actual crap...)\n\nHowever, looking past this, while rough around the edges, Spark the Electric Jester is a really fun time, and I surely recommend this game for people who are looking for one. (Bonus story's cool, too, but the 3rd one is hard as ****.)\n\nI know I was rambling, but I had a lot to say. LakeFeperd, keep at it!

Of course, not a pure one. As many have stated, it does derive some influence from another classic; Mega Man. In particular, Mega Man X. In addition to your standard run, jump, and attack, you can dash and wall-jump (though it's not quite as abusable as it was in the Mega Man X series). \n\nScattered throughout each level are power-ups, which you can use to change how you play. I have no clue exactly how many there are, but each one feels distinctly unique.\n\nNow, enough blabbering; I should get down to the raw explanations:\n\n[b]THE GOOD[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The level design for the most part is quite solid, allowing for smooth and fast runs for those who want to rush through a level, as well as open enough for those who want to explore.\n[*] The music, while not memorable in any case, is pleasant while playing.\n[*] The power-ups each feel unique and useful in different ways, and being able to switch between 2 at any time is handy and adds an element of strategy.\n[*] The story does not become intrusive; gameplay takes priority.\n[*] There is no lives system; you can die as much as you like.\n[*] Your HP can be easily recovered thanks to life tanks lying around, making it less of a hassle to be hit and you don't end up scurrying around desperately like you would in a sonic game.\n[/list]\n\n[b]THE BAD[/b]\n[list]\n\n[*] The way power-ups are replaced does not seem that obvious. Sometimes you want to keep a particular power only to have it replaced when you grab a new one. Again, some explanation may be good.\n[/list]\n\n[b]THE \"EH?\"[/b]\n[list]\n[*] As mentioned previously, none of the music tracks are particularly memorable. While they are all great to listen to, the lack of recognisability is somewhat unfortunate.\n[*] If you don't read the synopsis about the game being about Spark losing his job due to a robot takeover, the story doesn't quite make as much sense as you'd think - a bit like if, in classic games, you might not know the plot if you didn't read the manual. Not really that important but I thought I'd mention.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nOverall, so far I'm really enjoying this game. It brought back a feeling of fun and nostalgia I haven't experienced in over a decade, since I played Sonic the Hedgehog 3.

After all, Sparks' movement and flow is very familar to those who have seen or played either game. What sets Spark apart is in it's tone and mechanics. Spark may walk the walk, but in the finer details the games' design borrows heavily from the Kirby series. Our hero aquires an assortment of power-ups throughout the game. Each of these power-ups have different strengths and weaknesses that you can use to defeat the bosses, mini-bosses and enemies you enounter in each stage. For a momentum based platformer, The stage designs have a heaver focus on flat, cornered platforms, with most of the slopes used for spectical sequences. The theatrical elements tend to also be similar to kirby, with the main campaign being realatively easy, a stage / miniboss flip flop, and a darker tone as you get closer to the end of the game.\n\nIn that sense, I think those who like Kirby will probably find a lot to like here... if you can stomach the momentum based movement and tonal differences. I think generally the two styles complement each other in a way that makes Spark stand out from it's cousin, Freedom Planet. The developer has clearly put some time into figuring out how to translate one into the other, and while I wouldn't say it always works, it is generally a very fun mash up of ideas. Those who have played the game tend to find prefference in different power-ups from each other and different paths throughout each level. I personally greatly enjoyed the cross of old ideas with a few new ones. While I think Freedom Planet is the better game, there is no reason Spark should not be remembered and generally I recommend it.\n\nThat being said, there are some issues to be aware of. Skilled players, like with Kirby, will probably find the game [i]too[/i] easy, and only find challenge after the main campaign is complete. They may also find it shallow, as (again) like with Kirby, there is clear (and dilibrate) best powers for movement and combat. However the true failings come in the games tone. Kirby is very charming and you can tell a lot of time went into polishing each title in the franchise. Fepard [i]tries[/i] to go for his own charm, but due in part to design shortcuts and poor writing, tends to fall flat on it's face. It makes it harder to forgive the game when technical problems arrise. Which is a shame as there really is a good game here, but I think the technical issues will deturr people from giving this game a closer look or recommending it to others.\n\nI reccommend that people at least give this game a fair shake. It has a quite enjoyable mix of two familar franchises plus a bit of it's own style that creates a memorable if not a bit fallable title that in my opinion is worth adding to your collection.", "timestamp_created": 1493084496, "timestamp_updated": 1493091531, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505122", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31324274": {"recommendationid": "31324274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023954761", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519756932}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful mixture of speedy Sonic platforming, with Mega Man Zero-esque combat using Kirby-like abilities.\nFrom start to finish the game is a romp with unique and well implemented gimmicks to many stages, of which are huge to explore and take quite a while to get through.\nThe soundtrack is fantastic with a mix of Genesis-like tracks, and the story, though minimal, is silly and amusing.\nA strong recommendation for anyone looking for a Sonic kick, was absolutely worth backing this as a Kickstarter.\n\nBe aware that there are a few technical issues with the game which I hope can be resolved in future updates, but you can check the community to see solutions to some of the common problems such as frame drops.", "timestamp_created": 1492966935, "timestamp_updated": 1492966935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31309822": {"recommendationid": "31309822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041006076", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500683066}, "language": "english", "review": "reminds me of when Sonic didn't suck ;)", "timestamp_created": 1492911922, "timestamp_updated": 1492911922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444153", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31296248": {"recommendationid": "31296248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042333041", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 338, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511115746}, "language": "english", "review": "Spark the Electric Jester is a fantastic platformer game.

Now that that's out of the way I can say that I really enjoyed this game.\nIf you're a fan of the old, 2D sonic games and/or kirby games in general, you \"should\" enjoy this game and I highly recommend it. If you don't, then why are you reading reviews for a game you know won't like? Either way, the platforming is fun, the gameplay is fluid and the controls are responsive. The powerups are varied and not one of them felt boring. Yes some of them are stronger than others *cough cough* Bat *cough cough* but that's to be expected in games like this. The story... well... it's there I guess? The story isn't very good but to be completely honest, I don't go into a game like this expecting a story like \"insert story rich game here\" so I suppose that's one thing the game could improve on. The game is much longer than I thought it would be as, despite having completed both Spark's and Fark's stories, I'm only halfway through the gamemodes so my playtime could more than double as after the first story, all subsequent modes are harder than the previous.\n\nThe game runs very well (for me at least) apart from frame drops when a large boss is exploding, however, this may be intentional to add effect but I'm not positive. I have heard and read that some people have trouble running the game so I'd recommend buying the game, playing it to see if you have problems and if so, refund the game.

This marks his first Commercial release of a digital title to hit Steam via from the works from Clickteam Fusion 2.5\n\nMusic by Andy Tunstall,  Falk Au Yeong, Pejman Roozbeh (Funk Fiction), Paul Bethers and Michael Staple (Maxie) Their works are also in various products in the gaming scene not just in the Indie scene either. Remixes and compositions that are pleasent to the ears. Its a treat to listen to the games music. \n\nGame is fluid in play for the most part. \n\nPlenty of powerups aside from the Natural Spark Power. \nCool, Fire, Magician, Magic, Bat, Wind, Gravity, Board, Hammer, Knight, Sword, and Edgy\n\nQuite Challenging multiple playthrus. How about playing as your Robotic Doppelganger who has parry abilities and wall running skills or perhaps taking the challenge of playing the game where 2 hits will kill you. This game is your answer.\n\nCons: Its Lake Fepard first Commercial game that is on steam that has a rough launch along with other releases around it's launch date.  Making it less sought after and buried under the more popular titles like the port of Bayonetta.\n\nNo added OST Add-Onis saddening but FALK is the one who is maintaining the soundtrack so it might be posted elsewhere for purchase. \n\nUPDATE:https://materiacollective.bandcamp.com/album/spark-the-electric-jester-original-game-soundtrack The OST is available for purchase here! All proceeds goes to the composers that created the wonderful OST for Spark the Electric Jester!\n\nBuggy and prone to glitches/crashes due to the coding issues by Clickteam Fusion 2.5, LakeFepard needs to export the game into Chowdren to make the game run more smoothly and less prone to crashes.\n\nSome of the Powerups you will feel most favorable to then the others. Most people often use Sword for the Movement Speed, Edgy for the Wall Run and Air Dash, and Board for the Surfing.\n\nOverall: If your a fan of the 16 Bit Platformers of yesteryear like Megaman, Kirby, and Sonic.

I have always respected the original game and its sequels, however. Sonic games were always enjoyable to read about in Electronic Gaming Monthly and GamePro magazine back in the early-to-mid 1990s when new Sonic games were being produced and released on a Call of Duty -- I mean -- yearly basis. Sonic games were colorful, they were cute, they were fast, they were different. From time-to-time I\u2019d play a Sonic game, absorb some enjoyment from it, then shelve it again. It is a ritual I\u2019ve upheld for many years.\n\nA couple weeks ago during a sale I purchased Sonic CD. \u201cWhy not?, I thought. Sonic CD is the one 2D Sonic game I enjoyed the most out of them all.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, I learned right after purchasing it, that Sonic CD doesn\u2019t play well on my 144hz monitor. There is a limitation in the game that causes Sonic, and everything else in the game, to move too fast on monitors with refresh rates over 60Hz. I could probably fix the issue by creating a compatible Nvidia profile for the game, but I really hate having to prep games to work properly. If a game requires more than a double-click to play, or requires an external profile to work properly then that is usually enough to cause me play something else. I have plenty of games in my Steam library to play that don\u2019t require user hacks to function.\n\nA week ago while browsing Steam\u2019s New Releases I noticed a very retro-looking title named Spark The Electric Jester. At first glance I thought it was a port of a 16-bit era title. Although on closer inspection I learned the game was a new title inspired by games of that era.\n\nSo I decided to give it a spin.\n\nSpark The Electric Jester is, unabashedly, a Sonic The Hedgehog clone but it takes influence from other classic platformers as well. Spark\u2019s own Kickstarter page makes references to Mega Man X and Kirby Super Star as also being influences in its design.\n\nAs mentioned before, the game has Sonic\u2019s DNA all over it. Spark The Electric Jester\u2019s environments even look as if they were constructed by the same environment building crews that crafted the world of Sonic The Hedgehog: The loops are familiar as are the bouncy things (yeah, I\u2019ve seen those before); many of the enemies look like they could have lost family members to Sonic\u2019s attack moves in a Sonic The Hedgehog game. The sounds, the music, all of it would fit well in a Sonic title.\n\nInstead of Sonic The Hedgehog, though, the player controls Spark The Electric Jester. Spark and Sonic could themselves be closely related if not for the fact one is a hedgehog and the other is a collection of charged particles with eyes. So while they may look alike, and both run really fast, they do have their differences.\n\nUnlike Sonic, Spark, the character, can play very differently depending on which \u201cform\u201d he assumes. Spark can choose which forms to retain by collecting special items placed throughout the levels. Two forms can be retained at a time and the player can toggle between them at will\n\nBesides Spark\u2019s standard form there is Mage, Knight, Magical, Fire, Edgy (no, he doesn\u2019t throw Hitler memes), Cool, Wind, Hammer, Bat, Sword, Archer and Board.\n\nEach form Spark assumes modifies a characteristic of his movement or attack; Spark in his standard form attacks with a basic attack arc. Spark in Knight form attacks using a far-reaching lance. Archer Spark fires projectile arrows, Board Spark uses a hoverboard to move really, really fast, and etc. Additionally, Spark\u2019s standard attack can be charged by holding the attack button for a period of time then releasing it to create an even more potent attack.\n\nThese forms also have special attack maneuvers and characteristics players can exploit. In Knight form Spark can charge his lance and lunge across the screen in a devastating jousting  attack at his enemies or he can utilize Cool form to freeze and walk on water like Jesus. There is even a special attack called Blue Balls Spark can execute in Sword form.\n\nYes, Spark has blue balls.\n\nIt is nice to have a lot of variety in forms Spark can assume, especially when each form has its own unique moves and characteristics. But often it seems like there is little reason to use one form over another outside of just personal preference. In any form, most enemies can be defeated by simply spamming the attack button. Therefore executing form-specific special moves, like Blue Balls, is often just embellishment.\n\nAnd that brings me to the game\u2019s difficulty. Spark The Electric Jester is not a very difficult game. I made it to the end of the fifth stage before I lost my first life.\n\nUsually, if it takes me that long to lose a life in a platformer, that would sound the game\u2019s death knell for me. I would shelve it for its lack of challenge.\n\nSpark can take about 7 hits from a hazard or enemy before he dies. And since there are health pickups everywhere, and enemies can drop them after they\u2019re defeated, staying alive is a relatively easy affair. Even the bosses are not that difficult to defeat, many of them can be beaten simply by hitting the attack button quicker than the boss can drain Spark\u2019s health bar. Sometimes you can even get behind a boss and spam attack him to death without losing any health.\n\nMost standard enemies take a couple hits to defeat and many pose a threat only if the player runs into them. Some enemies are just destructible hazards with no attack routines. Some fire projectiles, while a few enemy types will pursue the player until they are destroyed.\n\nWith that said, I don\u2019t feel my time playing Spark was wasted. While I would have enjoyed a challenge, Spark has other qualities that made it worth my time.\n\nThe 16-bit pixel art graphics are charming and the player movement is solid. Spark\u2019s movement can be controlled with the left analog stick or the D-Pad on a compatible controller. The game\u2019s environments are varied, every stage has its own unique tileset and there are 15 stages in total. Each stage is fairly large with several checkpoints scattered throughout.\n\nFor a game that is fairly easy, Spark still took about 12 hours to complete. After completion, Time Attack mode is unlocked and another character\u2019s storyline, a character named Fark, becomes available from the New Game menu. The second storyline allows players to replay the game as Fark. Since Fark can absorb fewer hits than Spark can before dying, playing as this character makes the game a bit more difficult.\n\nThe game\u2019s music was fitting and enjoyable, with the music for stage 2 being my favorite track.

This sounds very well and good in theory, you have numerous options to approach different scenarios making both combat and stage movement exciting and while I think this holds true for movement as you have different powerups that let you recoil yourself with your own shot not entirely unlike Milla from Freedom Planet, run on walls at a great speed or hoverboard around the place, the movement options the powers provide are fun and interesting to play around with and I enjoyed their inclusion on that level but the combat side of things is where it gets super weak. \n\nMost of the powers are bad to mediocre at any kind of damage-dealing and Bat is head and shoulders above everything else at combat to the point where it crowds any other kind of option. I would find this dissappointing but the combat and boss fights in Spark aren't very deep anyway, with most of them being winnable by some variant of standing behind the enemy and mashing attack. For a game that has as many bosses as this game does (read: a ridiculous amount) it's kind of shocking the combat is as lacking in complexity as it is?\n\nFurthermore, the powerup mechanic takes an unnecessary cue from Kirby by copying the rule where powerups will sometimes fly out of you when you take damage, which makes it really easy to lose powers you'd rather hang onto. This combined with the fact touching a new power will INSTANTLY overwrite your power with no chance to reverse the process leads to many extremely annoying scenarios where you accidentally lose/overwrite your combat power and end up boringly plinking away at the game's many simplistic midbosses with a worse power for extended periods of time. This is made worse by the fact powerup distribution across the game is incredibly uneven, sometimes you are drowning in powerups you don't want or already have and sometimes you go incredibly lengths of time without being able to find anything at all.\n\nThe game is also just super easy, you can take so much damage, health drops are so frequent and there's even a full-health reserve revive available to serve to make the combat even more lacking in any depth whatsoever because even the worst player can likely facetank through everything with little issue. It's fun to move around in but seriously lacking in bite.\n\nThe game's general lack of difficulty is not aided by its length. The game honestly feels too long for how many ideas it actually has in it, it feels like it's starting to drag on by the end because a good few of the levels just feel like filler material since there's no particular challenge. The pacing and structure feels like it lacks focus (just like this review) and ultimately hurts the game by prioritising quantity over quality. Special shoutouts to lategame stages 13-16 for having some supremely obnoxious level gimmicks (nobody likes the pinball stage gimmick. Nobody. Nobody likes Collision Chaos and anyone who tells you they do hasn't played it recently.) that go further to just making you want the game to hurry up and end by the back quarter.\n\nThe story is meandering and nonsensical and I honestly have no idea what's happening in it, at all. It's fairly unobtrusive at least, cutscenes can be skipped at the press of a button so it hardly gets in the way terribly much but it makes me wonder why even bother having it if it's literally just something I want to get out of the way so I can play my video game. The entire game's script (including menus and help text) is also riddled with typos, awkward dialogue and total non-sequiturs that come across like just no effort was put into this aspect of the game. I question the value of it even existing if no care is going to go into it.\n\nOnce you've cleared the game as Spark, you unlock the ability to play through the entire game again as a different character, Fark, with an entirely different moveset and some extra bosses. This second campaign actually kind of rules and I found it substantially more enjoyable than the meat of the first campaign. He has less health which makes it harder to gorilla through the entire game, a parry system that rewards well-timed blocks with invincible frames and a health-recovery move and no power system, which immediately removes that entire irritating burden from the game and a better dash which grants you more mobility. The downside is that compared to Spark's peak damage, Fark kills things comparatively way slower, which again does not aid the drag of the game's relatively simplistic combat. The addition of the parry does help to shake things up initially, since the parry move smartly also earns you meter to regain your health which means the only way to recover health midcombat is to be aggressive and parry enemy attacks but the timing on it is incredibly forgiving and it quickly becomes just a simon says of parrying on the beat and then mashing attack until boss dies which will end up taking way too long due to your somewhat shoddy damage output. There's a good core of a platforming game character design there seriously let down by the complete shallowness of the boss designs, it's a real shame. Great idea, somewhat middling execution.\n\nI still found this second campaign far more entertaining to play through because the parry has a ton of interesting applications in stages that actually helps to alleviate some of the more annoying gimmicks. Waiting for trains to pass by on a cycle to not take damage is boring. Parrying trains and dashing through while invincible is exciting! Camping a boss in a corner to slowly plink at its life is boring, getting up in its grill to parry its attacks to recover lost life is exciting! More like that and some more dynamic boss encounters and it could've been a real winner of a campaign.\n\nNow for the final killer here. The game's technical problems. The big elephant in the room is that the game's framerate and general performance may or may not be completely abysmal for you based on some totally arcane factors not well understood. This has about coin-flip odds of making the game completely unplayable for you for no reason. This alone disqualifies the game for a recommendation on principle, but it's so much worse than that even if you can get it to run. My game in particular suffers from fairly noticable slowdown in random areas of the late game and entire bossfights for seemingly no reason whatsoever. This isn't just annoying, it's completely game-breaking, it makes the game feel unresponsive and bad and makes it exceptionally difficult to properly time parries, a key gameplay mechanic. This huge glaring issue alone is enough for me to say I can't recommend this game, even though I do genuinely like it. It makes no sense to spend 15 dollars on a game that has 50/50 odds of not working at all and then even past that, will likely not work to its fullest.\n\nAs a sidenote because I'm running out of characters in this review. Time Attack mode and the timer in general is buggy to the point of being totally useless and the optional challenges don't feel well-designed or implemented.\n\nI like this game, but that's solely because I'm a huge sucker for the kind of fun movement options it presents. Otherwise, it's a technical mess admist some serious design flaws. When it works, it's decent, but that's IF and WHEN it works. Which is not consistent. Thus, I can't recommend it.

You can build up to incredible speeds if you know what you're doing, and most abilities give you the opportunity to go even faster. Very few enemies overstay their welcome, only getting bulky towards the end of the game, and the bosses are fast and furious. The levels are designed to segment high-speed action and precise platforming, though, which is where Spark excels - you'll have to earn your best time.\nThere's a huge variety of abilities, and often a powerful ability can be found squirreled away in an alternate path. What ties it all together is the option to swap between two abilities, letting you focus on mobility, combat or other capabilities as you please.\nThe story is quick and dirty. It's serviceable, it's enjoyable, and it doesn't get in your way. The characters are well-written and endearing. And you can skip every single cutscene. Hell, I accidentally skipped the credits.\nThe music is easily the best part of Spark. Every single stage has a track that'll get into your head, and there's a nice variety of boss themes. Keep an ear out for Fark's theme - it makes that battle all the more exciting.\n\nAll this said, it can be awkward to change keyboard controls, which is no fault of the game - you'll need to go into the menu when you boot it up and bring up another window.\nIf I had to levy a specific criticism to the game, and this is a personal preference, I feel like not enough of the level is visible at once. That's not something unique to Spark, I just feel that makes it harder to react to what's coming up ahead at high speed.

There are even extra modes that open up to you as you progress through the game, such as a Time Attack mode, so there's a good lot of replayability. In terms of difficulty, the game may be a little easy for experienced players, but it should just be right for less-experienced players, and one of the extras in the game is definitely a more challenging experience.\n\nVisually, the levels themselves are highly detailed and really show the developer's finest background work, and the soundtrack is absoutely phenomenal and easily the best thing about the game.

Every power up you collect will greatly modify your abilities, offering extra maneuverability options in some cases, adding new moves you can attack with in other cases, and even charge up moves that can be used by holding down the attack button for a few seconds.\n\nAs you attack enemies you may notice a blue gauge fill up, when this reaching maximum you can activate your charge attack to usually perform a devastating strike. Take the Edgy power for example in which you can do extreme damage to all enemies on screen or bosses through the use of a \u201cChaos Blast\u201d Style screen nuke attack.\n\nThere\u2019s quite a large variety of powers you can utilise here too, such as the Cold power that allows you to slip by enemies at a fast pace, perform a beyblade attack or even run and freeze the surface of water.\n\nYou are able to hold two of these powers at any given time, and switch out between the stock power and the one currently active at the press of a button, so if you stumble across something hard hitting as well as a separate more maneuverable power, then you don\u2019t need to pick and choose and have best of both types of play.\n\nThe visuals in here are also pretty goddamn gorgeous, with stunning set pieces and magnificent sprite work.\n\nI have to specifically point out the soundtrack too which needless to say is quite possibly one of the best OST\u2019s i\u2019ve heard in a game in a good long time, there is not a single music track in this game I dislike, and all of them are set extremely high in quality and rightfully suit the level that they are set to. Heck i\u2019d say the game\u2019s worth a purchase on the soundtrack alone to be perfectly honest, the amazing gameplay is just a bonus to that.\n\nHowever this game is not terribly stable, and I believe that is largely to do with the game engine, as pretty much every game that runs on this engine I have had trouble with in the past, including the likes of Freedom Planet which eventually got patched to sort things out thankfully.\n\nMy main PC with an i7-3770k, 8GB RAM and GTX 980 were flat out unable to run this game at any higher than 20 fps, making the game in my opinion flat out unplayable, this was rectified as I had a shitty laptop nearby that thankfully could run the game, but even then I still had a lot of framerate issues constantly during the game. Although the laptop itself could be to blame for that.\n\nUltimately the game is flat out phenomenal and I have next to no issues with the gameplay itself, however I recommend trying out the demo version of the game before purchasing just as a precaution to try it out, because I cannot guarantee the game will work as intended.", "timestamp_created": 1492170272, "timestamp_updated": 1492465697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455096", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31133193": {"recommendationid": "31133193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012654463", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1898, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516016834}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like Sonic and Kirby?

After completing the main story you will get a Time Attack mode that allows you to replay the levels and another story (which I have yet to complete). This game features hours of play time and consists of the same replayability the titles that influenced it do. This is not surprising as the developer is the same one who developed the acclaimed fan games Sonic: Before the Sequel and After the Sequel.\n\nPros:\n-Fast paced platforming with tons of availible routes and plenty of exploration opportunities.\n-Kirby style power ups, allowing for varied play styles. I have yet to find a useless power.\n-A large variety of enemies and obsticles to overcome.\n-Reasonable difficulty without being too easy.\n-Fun and interesting boss battles.\n-Simple yet entertaining story.\n-Kamehameha! (Or Galic Gun, if that's your preference. I ain't attack-ist)\n-Great soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-The game currently has some varied performance issues. Milage may vary.\n-Some of the obsticles feel like they needlessly punishing in their placement. Mostly a nit-pick.\n-Boss difficulty varies a bit too widely. Some bosses were far too easy, while others felt like health sponges. Overall, not bad but could be improved.\n\nEven with the current issues people (including myself) have been having, I find myself drawn into this game. The colorful landscapes and interesting mechanics make this feel like a 16-bit era game all grown up.

The framework is based loosely on the developer's earlier fanworks: Sonic Before and After the Sequel. \nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=903225565\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nLevel design is reminiscent of classic Sonic games. Soar down slopes and zip through the loops of 16 different zones, each one capped by a unique boss. Levels have multiple branching routes and take an impressive ten or more minutes to clear each. \n\nCombat is where the game's other roots begin to shine. You have over a dozen different abilities/weapons, all hidden throughout each level. You can hold onto two at a time, interchanging at will. If you get slapped hard enough you'll drop the one you're holding onto. The weapon you have equipped greatly changes your role in combat, how you traverse the levels, and how you deal with both mooks and bosses. The gameplay changes as frequently as you take on new abilities. \n\n[b]Visual[/b]\nAn absolutely remarkable improvement over the developer's earlier work. The enemies and backgrounds mesh together flawlessly. I'm honestly impressed they got it to look so good. While some backgrounds and settings are humdrum and average, others grasp me tightly, commanding my full attention and respect as I trench through them.  \n\n[b]Sound[/b]\nNo matter your opinions on Sonic After the Sequel, it seems nearly everyone agrees that the soundtrack is spectacular. The musicians responsible for that ost return for this project to prove their mastery once again. Even if you don't play the game, at least give the ost a try.\n[noparse]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS6AQ68IYbs&index=1&list=PLTsPmYOQxpNZ4e8khiUgJTqBskoSq-06T[/noparse]\n\n[b]Plot[/b]\nA disaster.

The soundtrack is pretty fantastic and jamming too, but that's expected out of the people who produced the soundtracks for Before the Sequel and After the Sequel. The game contains two extra modes after you complete the game so there is a fair amount of replayability. In my opinion, the second mode that you unlock after beating the main story is the absolute highlight of the game, especially in the boss fight department and if anything the purchase is worth it for it alone if you're not satisfied with Spark's gameplay. On the gameplay department, the game is very solid and allows for a lot of freedom and variety in movement with the two playable characters. The level design is very open ended and contains multiple paths and secrets with powerups for those who like to explore. it's also worth mentioning the level design is rather combat oriented, and it's going to put you against really great bosses. It's overall a very damn fun action packed game that is very worth your time.\n\nIt's not a game without flaws however, as the game is severely lacking in polish regarding things such as the script and dialogue. It's often you see a lot of awkward phrases and typos that while relatively charming at first, quickly lose their charm and merely look rather unprofesional as it goes on. Spark's story is frankly put, boring but with a lot of potential that was really never realized. It's difficult to keep track of the plot, which shouldn't given it's rather simplistic, and Spark himself is just a boring character that stops caring about the plot himself as well, making it hard to get invested in the main story. The second mode that gets unlocked after Spark's story, where you play as the rival character is much more interesting, and actually has you a bit intrigued about the plot and it's far more engaging.\nWhile the level design is mostly good, the levels may drag on for a little more than they probably should, sometimes taking over 12 minutes on an average run, though how much this is bothersome depends on the player.\n\nAll in all I very much enjoyed my time playing Spark, and would easily recommend it just for the gameplay alone, it's an absolute blast.", "timestamp_created": 1491889401, "timestamp_updated": 1491889611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526462", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31071715": {"recommendationid": "31071715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042747632", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 428, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492059844}, "language": "english", "review": "i don't even know where to begin\n\nthis game is Amazing. it's so damn amazing\n\nGameplay: Sonic and Kirby were at the Pub drinking and decided you know what would be cool if we tried to make a game together. and than Megaman burst in at the last second and said \"can i get in on this action\" and than through a series of experiments they created the greatest Jester.

The level design is great and flows just right. the bosses are fun and depending on the power you have can either be a real challenge, fair, or down right a cake walk if your good. the powers themselves are all fun and since you can carry whichever ones you want as long as you want (if your good) it allows you to play the game how you want to and all of them feel fast and don't break the pace of the game too much.\n\nVisuals: the aesthetics are amazing. the tone the backgrounds set for the levels is so spot on it's great. every level had me looking at the backgrounds and being so impressed with that i was seeing. the foreground sprites, characters, and enemies all look great. the Visual set pieces were great and had me getting more and more excited for every fight.\n\nMusic: ( \u2180\u03c9\u2180) - Pure Freaking Bliss.

I have been following Lake for the longest time to know the way he does things. It all started with Sonic Before The Sequel, a game that really fulfilled the Sonic fan base\u2019s dreams, and still holding up today, and in my book as the second greatest Sonic game in existence, the first being, well we'll get to that... This game had it all, and the polish and magic of the classic era that Sega has once abandoned, but with his own twist. The physics and gameplay completely catered to the true fans, and the music was nothing short of amazing, like always. The story served as the prequel to Sonic 2, explaining in a quite cute and very creative cut scene fashion, with expressions, explaining the creation of the Death Egg, and how Sonic and Tails have come face to face and all.  Everything about this game was completely unique and done in a fashion like no other. The Sonic community completely exploded when they saw the talent that Lake had, and the things he can do right of the bat, and this was his first fan game (At least that I knew of). Of course, the hype didn't last too long, even though this guy deserves the biggest medal. This is when Lake decided he was going to go all out. When I had heard of a follow-up, my heart completely jumped in excitement, like that one Christmas gift that you had always wanted as a child and it had lain in front of your eyes. Sonic after the Sequel, this is by far the greatest thing in creation, rumor has it that Lake is a decedent of god and has brought this masterpiece to all fans alike. To others this would be the icing on the cake, but to me, this was the cake itself. Sonic after the Sequel is the greatest Sonic game in my book, and not for no reason, this game was the reason I have become inspired to take the path of game creating myself. It never hit me as well as this. This game even changed the way I saw the world as a whole, and it is on that level of magic. Right of the bat you'll already be stunned by the work Lake puts in his game, as it completely takes you by surprise, 10 magical levels, each with three acts each and a boss. Each level is unique in its own way, and will completely take you by surprise. Complete with its own enemies, and stage element that the stage is revolved around, instead of the other way around, which is the mistake that many other games make, but Lake has it down to a tee. In one level you'll find yourself getting quite hyper off of sugar, serving as a speed boost to get you to new heights, in another level you'll find yourself with a fire shield, allowing you to swim through molten lava with ease, and my favorite level, Technology Tree Zone, this takes you to a paradise, much like chemical plant, but without the metropolitan atmosphere, and more comparable to a soothing walk in the park filled with neon lights. AND HOT DAMN, THE MUSIC HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST IN ANY GAME IN EXISTANCE! I can say, I have listened to the soundtrack a FEW HUNDRED TIMES, i'm beginning to wonder if it has reached a thousand yet. Lake's soundtrack team gives Undertale a run for thier money. Hell, Lord Lake himself does. I didn't even mention the many easter-eggs that appear in this game, ranging from Kirby, to Mega-Man, and a special one that features a shout out to GalaxyTrail. This game has even served as a stress reliever, as I would play it whenever something would beat me down, or make me feel inadequate, it would help me combat life again. If you don't believe me, try it yourself, You would also see the return of the beautiful cut scenes, but in more insane detail, completely crisp, and smoothly animated. I find myself obsessive with Sonic after the Sequel, even to the point where I would make it my theme for everything I have or do. It is that good. Lord Lake would then go on to create his own follow-up, and this didn't follow the formula of the traditional Sonic game, but instead, a new take. This is pretty much the base of how Spark started, and in many ways, you can call this the official Beta, since it has a similar combat/platform style that he would later carry on into Spark. This game is known as Sonic Chrono Adventure, and it's a hellova game. It is more RPG based, and the level design is broken up into sections. Of course, it retains most of the magic that After The Sequel had, and this time, complete with a unique story never before seen, and this game was enjoyable as hell, and hella refreshing, since I was quite hungry for another follow-up. Lake decided that it was best to take the magic he had, and create his own game with this, as he couldn't really feed his family off of fan games, so we would have to say goodbye to the gifts Lord Lake has given us... IN RETURN FOR A GREATER GIFT, DAMN! I've been following Spark from the beginning, and sadly, I haven't been able to donate during the 15 day , but I would've donated a few hundred, because this game is literally the greatest in existance. When I played the first ever demo, those Sonic After The Sequel vibes were apparent, it took me back to 2013, and this felt like the true successor. It had it all, plus more. A refined combat system that has been taken over from Chrono Adventure, countless powerups, all with thier own unique twist and sparkle, and THAT ORGASMIC MUSIC. Maestro Lake has done it again. I would go out of my way to catch his streams that he has done, and observe as he blessed us with all of this content, as I would jump out of my seat. I began to grow quite guilty that I didn't give to Lord Lake when I had the chance, and so, I will buy countless copies until I become broke, because this guy deserves every penny of my money, for charming me for so many years to come, and for changing my life for the better, Lord Lake, if you get this message, still continue to spread your magic throughout the world, and claim your title as the greatest indie creator on earth.\n", "timestamp_created": 1491880673, "timestamp_updated": 1491880673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31070780": {"recommendationid": "31070780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023858501", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518822578}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like Sanic and Kirby with some new shit included\n\nThen you'll LOVE Spark the Electric Jester\n\nbuy this shit", "timestamp_created": 1491875842, "timestamp_updated": 1491875842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.411041", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31070573": {"recommendationid": "31070573", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061790553", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502980310}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playtesting this game for almost 2 months and while I think it certainly has its flaws,\nmuch like every single one of Lake's previous games I've gotten tons of hours of fun out of Spark.\n\nThere's a certain mode you unlock after your first playthrough which I consider to be the absolute highlight of the game\nso you can expect a lot of replay value and surprises even after finishing Spark's story.\n\nThe OST is a given.

I also really like Fark mode, the parry ability is really adicting to use once you get used to it and I think the dificulty spike with Fark makes the game some what even more fun and chalanging. \nthe only negatives I can think of is I am a bit mixed about the bosses , most of them are really great and enjoyable and were even chalanging however some were really easy to cheese your way through including some of the very later ones and also the game can suffer from certain glitches and crashing issues (it may just be my pc tho, idk) and that's all I can realy think of from the top of my head\nover all I think Spark is great game and I recomand it to anyone who enjoy 2D platformers and retro games.", "timestamp_created": 1491866861, "timestamp_updated": 1491866861, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576806", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 220, "total_negative": 21, "total_reviews": 241}}

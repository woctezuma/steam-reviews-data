The Sprite art is awesome, Amazing level design with multiple paths.\n\nWhile Doom 2016 was a great compromise of open style shooter and some linear level elements, giving you a choice to explore some or just go right for an objective with help from a map and hud if needed, this really goes back to that old mid-90s take on shooters with a smooth modern feel overtop. \n\nThe biggest negative is having to wait for the full game! \nPlaytime is around 1-2.5hrs with a couple secrets, a lot more if you try to get them all.", "timestamp_created": 1521747395, "timestamp_updated": 1521752626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40974634": {"recommendationid": "40974634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984649158", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 35, "last_played": 1520714259}, "language": "english", "review": "Hey everyone how's it going. I just dropped my Sony Walkman into the bath and the resulting electric shock flung me through the fragile fabric of time and space, thrusting me into the futuristic year of 2018.\n\nA lot of things have changed since 1998, the year I am from, but I'm happy to see Build Engine games are still being made by 3D Realms and boy oh boy, this one is the best one they've made since Duke Nukem 3D which is the last Duke Nukem game released as far as I'm concerned because as I said, I'm a time traveller from the 90's and I'm glad I never got see that classic character butchered.\n\nAnyway this game is incredible fun and an absolute blast to play. It's super short, so it's worth bearing in mind that what you're paying for here isn't a full game, more of a vertical slice; a taster of what's to come in the next six months.\n\nThanks for listening.

Well my question is:  Who DOESN'T need a new FPS game in the Build Engine in 2018?  The Build Engine, the Engine that powered Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior and Blood is back, and better than ever.  It's great to see 3D Realms taking this route and bringing back its iconic engine to power a new game.  The world is basic 3D objects, the enemies and objects are 2D sprites and everything is pixelated, as it should be.  Though, it is 2018 and you can improve how the game looks, if you so desire.  Personally, I'm running it in pixel mode, but in widescreen because I prefer that when available.\n\nSo, in this whole new game, you play as a cop named Shelly \"Bombshell\" Harrison who likes shooting things and blowing things up.  She spouts cheesy one liners when she picks up guns and blows things away.  She battles freaks in a futuristic Earth that's in the process of being destroyed.  You've got to find keys to get out of levels as you battle through...  OK, it's basically Duke Nukem 3D all over again, but ist that a bad thing?\n\nIn a nutshell, this game is legit.  In totally '90s style, you're dropped in the meat grinder with some weapons and absolutely no explanation or map.  There's no arrows or path leading you to your objective, no glowing things telling you to pick them up and interact with them.  Nope, you have to figure it all out by yourself, as it should be.  Right now, the game is pretty basic.  There are a couple areas with enemies and a boss battle at the end, just like the Shareware version of Duke Nukem 3D.  You even get the whole splash screen with the benefits of buying the full version.  It's fantastic in its retro goodness.  I'm looking forward to the full version.  Also, I hope, when the full game gets released, they keep this preview area in there, so that people who missed out on Early Access can still play it and have fun. Meanwhile, until the full version comes out, I'm going to be going back through and finding the secrets I haven't found yet.  I have some, but I missed 18 in the first area and 11 in the second, so there's more to do.", "timestamp_created": 1521724791, "timestamp_updated": 1521725051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40971077": {"recommendationid": "40971077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113206199", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 322, "last_played": 1521790578}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u044f\u0441\u044c \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430 \u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0441\u0432\u043e\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0438\u044e \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b. \u0423\u0431\u0438\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043c\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043a, \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0451\u0442. \u0412 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0451. \u0412\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u044e\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435 20 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043f\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0442\u0431\u044b \u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 (\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b \u0440\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0434, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u044f).\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1521710482, "timestamp_updated": 1521710482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40969818": {"recommendationid": "40969818", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991044191", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 117, "last_played": 1521784484}, "language": "english", "review": "recently been playing blood and shadow warrior, and picking up this game wow\n\nits just feels so much more polished and up to today's standards a bit, the shooting is very responsive and you can pull off headshots on your enemies and the art style looks really cool, dunno why i like the sprites i guess its something different, and looks more detailed than a model in a way\n\nonly played a few minutes and i am already glad i bought it, would love to play a multiplayer game as the earliest major game you can find people playing nowadays might be half-life 1", "timestamp_created": 1521702463, "timestamp_updated": 1521702463, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40965678": {"recommendationid": "40965678", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984922261", "num_games_owned": 347, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 156, "last_played": 1521750375}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely love this game.

You play Shelly \"Bombshell\" Harrison in this prequel to the game Bombshell, and honestly this game should have been what Bombshell as this would have been a proper introduction like the classics... But her character is pretty frickin' great. She is what you would expect from 3D Realms, a one-liner shouting maniac who loves explosives and ridiculous weapons.\n\nIon Maiden's gameplay harks back to the 90s where you can speedrun through levels or take your time to search every nook and cranny for easter eggs and secret stashes. The levels have an A point and B point but they are generally more open than say a 'modern' FPS. I have watched other players who definitely did things differently to the way I did in Ion Maiden and saying that fills me with joy. The enemies right now feel a bit dumb, I love the design (a cult of cyborgs) but they currently don't have anything that makes them stand-out from traditional roles (grunts, shotgunners, veterans and spiderskulls) and sometimes they can get stuck on the environment. The environment is really attractive and feels like it was pulled straight out of Robocop. Perhaps most surprisingly is that the weapons are NOT hitscan, this means you need to aim, and are able to pull off headshots for efficient kills. This also applies to the enemy, they can miss and so can you.\n\nCurrently; the performance can be a bit choppy especially when the screen gets really busy. Obviously with this being a Build Engine game it looks old and the enemies are sprites instead of polygons, but I believe that works in Ion Maiden's favour. The soundtrack is currently pretty good.\n\nI'd say wait until it's finished as two levels isn't really enough, but I love what I have currently played and really look forward to playing the finished product and seeing more environments, and enemies.\n\n\"NO GUM NEEDED.\"", "timestamp_created": 1521590319, "timestamp_updated": 1521590319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40946241": {"recommendationid": "40946241", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972434539", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 113, "last_played": 1521581304}, "language": "english", "review": "VERY cool game.

Rather than trying to recreate what made those shooters of yesteryear so great using the modern graphical technology of new game engines, 3D realms gives us the genuine article by building this game on one of the game engines that started it all. This game is built upon the EDuke32 source port of the build engine, which is best known as the engine that powered such games as Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Shadow Warrior, and Redneck Rampage. This game could sit right along side those others and if you didn't know better, you couldn't tell that this one didn't come out with the others back in the mid 90's. It feels like it has been locked away all of these years waiting for release.\n\nHaving the luxury of all of the extensions that EDuke32 is able to provide, this is by far the best looking build engine game to date, although that does come at a price. The build engine was designed in a world where 3D acceleration wasn't established yet and because of that, it isn't really able to use our modern GPU's for much of the work that it is doing. When playing this game your CPU is going to be doing most of the heavy lifting while the GPU sits idle and those people with lesser CPU's are going to see performance take a hit. It seems like the developers are working to better optimize the engine for modern hardware and hopefully we will see them implement ways of getting our GPU's into the action to smooth out performance but for now don't be supprised if you see dips in the framerate or general stuttering while playing. I personally had issues with input lag and stuttering upon first running the game and they seemed to be tied directly to the V-Sync implimentation in EDuke32. Turning V-Sync of in the in game options removed the framerate limit but seemed to leave its influence on the mouse input behind which made everything feel laggy and imprecise. I disabled V-Sync at the driver level and limited the framerate using Rivatuner and that eliminated all of the issues I was having. There is a pinned performance thread on the steam forums where the developers have offered other performance tips to get the game running better until future optimizations come along.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the old 90's style of FPS or anyone looking to get into the more fast paced open ended shooter scene. If you like this kind of thing, please throw money at them.

First, the raise of the retro style and the praise of classics, that become a model, a standard. Then the Duke Nukem 3D expansion (going to buy it soon, btw I obviously played it back in the days), and the new port for Turok. I asked myself, while playing Blood: \"Hey, when AAA studios are going to publish brand-new real old-school ass-kicking games?\" Five minutes later, I found Ion Maiden on Steam. I didn't know the game or either the character of Bombshell, I checked it out on Steam, and it's not much my kind of game. Au contraire, Ion Maiden IS. I mean: Jesus, seriously? Picking the old f*cking great Build Engine where splendid games like Blood, Duke Nukem and other of my most favourite games of all times run, improving it, and bringing a new super cool game? GUYS I LOVE YOU! \n\nThis game is an instabuy even in preorder. The demo campaign is superfunny and introduces you to the game mechanics, style and mood. I also played today the bombardier mode and had a lot of fun challenging myself to win all the demo without dying (I did it!), and also I understood some mechanics about the Bowling Bombs that I didn't understand before. \n\nBut you're here for the pros and cons, so here they are:\n\nPROS\n\n- Old school gameplay: uberfast action, tons of weapons, enemies exploding to pieces, blood everywhere, challenging fights, thousands of secrets, simple to play but hard to master, everything is excessively badass and more!\n\n- Oldschool spirit and art: super gory, amazing sprites, pixels and explosions everywhere, cool and chunky 2D and 3D effects, doesn't care about your feelings, funny profanities, and more!\n\n- Superfunny and immensely satisfying\n\n- Picking only the best of the best of old school games and mechanics and enriching them!\n\n- Running on one of the best game engines ever, IMPROVED!\n\n- Cool and badass character, enemies and settings\n\n- Very immersive and catchy, also I love the soundtracks, very cool!\n\n- Weapons are just spectacular, they feel super powerful and also realistic. The weapon you choose to use in a determinated situation matters 100%. They're all well differentiated and super funny to use. And they're even bind to the right keys!!! 1 Melee, 2 Pistol, 3 Shotgun, 4 Machinegun... that's class guys.\n\n- Bowling Bombs, the \"ace\", protagonist weapon of the game (check the story to understand why) are very original and never seen. They have more depth than I thought on the first play, the \"Bombardier\" mode made me understand how they interact with each other or with objects. And guess what? They're super funny and satisfying to use. Big surprise!\n\n- Just buy this game and check its quality by yourself, you'll see why all the hype!\n\nCONS\n\n- If you're severely mentally disabled and have no taste at all and also can't play sh*t, you may dislike the game.\n\n- The devs are super humble even after developing historical games. Oh wait, that's not a bad thing. Oops.\n\n3D Realms went back in time to bring us the kind of games that made gamers exist in the first place. The kind of games that you still play and enjoy more than 20 years after their realease. I strongly hope they're going to continue on this path of \"Less shit and more fun\" that was abandoned a long time ago. And I also hope others are going to follow their example. Jesus guys, you can sell a game for half the price of a modern AAA, with a tenth of the people requested for AAA games, developing it in less time, focusing on funnier and more important features, and earn the 600% you would normally earn! That's just a smart way to develop games!\n\nTo conclude, I'm waiting with great expectations the full release, meanwhile I'll enjoy the demo! And I'll also pray for Blood III... now they can bring it in all its glory to its fans, unlike Blood II...\n\nGo 3D Realms, bring Good Old Games back to Us!", "timestamp_created": 1521212969, "timestamp_updated": 1521212969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40845867": {"recommendationid": "40845867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198180552287", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "last_played": 1521196770}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430, \u043d\u043e 1 \u044d\u043f\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0434 \u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u0437\u0430 1,2 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430. \u0437\u0430 \u0447\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c 400 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439?\n\n\u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432, \u0436\u0434\u0443 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0432\u044b\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0443.", "timestamp_created": 1521196983, "timestamp_updated": 1521196983, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383014", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40835613": {"recommendationid": "40835613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057299662", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 794, "last_played": 1521487534}, "language": "swedish", "review": "Im a simple man.

As such, it's an obvious throwback to games like Shadow Warrior Classic, Blood or the before-mentioned Douk. This should be enough to get you interested immediately if you like first person shooters.\n\nThe only obvious problems right now have to do with the fact that it's a work in progress, and so presently it only features one preview campaign comprised of two moderately-sized levels, only a couple of weapons (out of which some require slightly more damage tweaks), not enough voice work, and above all, an AI which is not accurate and aggressive enough to provide you with a sufficient challenge. Even on the highest available difficulty you'll not really be tested and end up with lots of armor, ammo and available portable medkits. There's also the problem of technical issues.\n\nIon Maiden runs off of a modified Build Engine, which is now around twenty years old, and as such it has a tendency to hiccup weirdly whenever something more demanding (like explosions revealing and shifting parts of the level around) happens, which is incredibly annoying, throws your aiming off and screws up your flow. Even after the patch I'd say that this is the biggest problem and is inexcusable for a first person shooter, so here's hoping the developers work on fixing it.\n\nHowever even with the above problems, and even if it's not something you're willing to spend money on presently, what is there is still incredibly fun to play.

The setting heavily reminds me of Shrapnel City from Duke Nukem 1 and already I'm in love with the game. The level design and graphics ooze mid-90's charm and the level of detail is insane given it's using such an old engine. I especially love the colour palette of the game, which seems to focus on a mix of red and blue (possibly to symbolically reflect the heroine's police background). It's definitely on par if not surpassing the detail seen in Blood. The game also pulls some rather impressive scripted sequences that wouldn't look out of place in a Call of Duty game (albeit with the graphics of a mid-90's game engine), giving the game a very high explosive \"Michael Bay\" feel that I absolutely love.\n\nScope is really the key word of Ion Maiden. Instead of going for a linear \"level to level\" approach, the game is structured into multiple zones (with the preview campaign having only one zone) which could be considered the equivalent of an episode, except in this case you can go back and forth between the levels as you see fit, similar to games like Quake 2 and Half-Life. The game will warn you when you're about to enter a part of the zone that closes off the rest behind you though by warning you that there are still secrets left to find in the area if you haven't found all of them, a useful tip for OCD players like myself who want to find every secret before moving on and very much appreciated. This makes each zone feel like one big hub of levels, and given the size of some levels (especially level 2 of the preview campaign is an enormous level with impressively large buildings), it's safe to say the game's scope will be pretty big.\n\nThe game's weapon selection consists of what you'd expect. A melee weapon (Shelly's electric baton), a revolver (the Loverboy), a shotgun (the Disperser) and an automatic SMG (the SMG-9000) in addition to Shelly's signature bowling bombs (essentially heat-seeking grenades). All of the weapons feel really satisfying to fire, and i don't really have any complaints about them. The sound effects are really good as well and give that \"oomph\" feeling that I love about oldschool shooters.\n\nThe game definitely does a great job at feeling like a lost game from 1995 that's been polished up. Shelly's character portrait constantly sits in the lower left corner, looking left and right while also becoming increasingly bloody and damaged as you receive damage, similar to games like Doom and Quake, a small detail that further emphasizes the game's mid-90's tone. Her one-liners are cool and ooze confidence and charisma and I'm happy to see Shelly's voice actress from Bombshell return here and given she doesn't really have to do any dramatic acting, she does a great job just spouting one-liners, which I think fits the character more than the amount of dialogue she was given in Bombshell.\n\n Control-wise the game controls well, although some people have reported issues with the mouse aiming (a common issue with build engine games). If you have played other build engine games, you'll feel right at home in this game although interestingly the game does not have any inventory system like other Build games. You have an inventory for medkits but pretty much nothing else, which makes me wonder if there will be one in the full version.\n\nThe soundtrack is done entirely as mod music, which explains the game's low file size, but is generally really well done, sounding somewhat industrial and techno'y and perfectly fits the game's aesthetic.\n\nNow to the negatives... the game is really unoptimized. Severely unoptimized even. Running in OpenGL mode, even with some of the performance tweaks the devs have listed on the Steam forums I ran into severe hitching/stuttering and the framerate going into slideshow territory repeatedly during gameplay, especially during heavily scripted sequences or just looking around certain parts of the levels (particurarily level 2). Running the game with the Classic renderer fixed most of these issues but the game still runs somewhat badly. I would attribute this to the fact the preview campaign is essentially a beta though and hope they will make it more stable in the full version. I also experienced the game crashing repeatedly on level 2 after playing for a while, though the devs are working on a fix for it.\n\nConsidering the game is still early in development all I can say is that I'm really looking forward to the full version! So far it's a really enjoyable experience, and it's shaping up to be one hell of a shooter!", "timestamp_created": 1520877082, "timestamp_updated": 1520877082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598752", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40767254": {"recommendationid": "40767254", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018745337", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520112555}, "language": "english", "review": "Cannot recommend this game at the moment:\n\nPROS:\n- nice level design full of secrets (a shitload !!!)\n- gore\n\nCONS:\n- too expensive for what you get; come on, DukeNukem 3D demo was more fun to play !\n- camera snaps to some sort of grip, so the movements feel very jerky when you try to aim at something.

Fan service is here !\nThe feedback I have to say now Update 1 is released is :\n\n_ The movement is still too slipery. There's a large ammount of secrets and so platform crossing which is okay, but even stopping ourself at the right time the next second you might fall because a sliperry effect makes us lightly still slidin' in a direction and on a tight platform it's totally nightmare and annoying.\n\n_ Drinking water out of a destroyed Hydrant is not available and it would be cool if, like in Duke Nukem, drinking water could heal.\n\n_ Last but optional in my opinion the shotgun does not look that good. It fires awesomely but when the ennemies holding it the gun looks more sassy. In our hands the thing looks more to a grenade launcher. The picatini rail, this folded compensating iron sight, the red stripes, it's garbage. I like the cylinder system, but also the shells does not look like shotgun shells but grenades. It could be more fun if the shotgun had ventilating holes on the barrel like the original Duke shotgun and have real shells that you can see being ejected beacuse a revolving system that ejects shell or cartridge cases exists and it could looks very \" Future \".

Denn Bombshell, welche in Duke Nukem Forever mal als Sidekick geplant war, dann aber, leider wie so vieles anderes wieder verworfen wurde\u2026 Dann kam mit dem Topdownshooter \u201eBombshell\u201c 2016 doch ein Spiel mit ihr, nur leider kein Ego-Shooter.

Ich f\u00fchlte mich wieder zur\u00fcck in meine Kindheit versetzt, in der Anfangszeit der 3D-Shooter, wo diese noch durch cooles Levelsdesign, viel Gore und schr\u00e4ge Waffend und Feinde beeindrucken konnten!

Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 Arena wer diese Geschwindigkeit mag wird Ion Maiden lieben. Nicht verwechseln mit den Dreck wie Bombshell von 3D Realms.

Ich w\u00e4re nur jetzt Sauer, wenn ich es nie als Vollversion besitze. Ich empfehle das Spiel ab 12 Jahren. Die Gewalt h\u00e4lt sich in Grenzen, nicht zuletzt auf Grund der Grafik, die das nicht hergibt. Der Spiel Sound ist zum Spiel passend, die Steuerung ist auch angenehm und sehr fl\u00fcssig, auch kein ekliges Maus geruckel. Ich habe nichts zu meckern.

The protagonists can afford to be fleshed out a bit more. I know it's new, and or you should't expect deep character or motive for an intentinally retro throwback style game. But this is current year, put some meat on it's bones in the character/story department. I like the idea of a female Duke Nukem type main. Also that she has potential to be tough as nails and enjoy her work. Bring us back to the good ol days of our happy go luck, care free alien killing machine main characters! I also hope to see an \"In honor of Duke Nukem\" Statue somewhere in the game, seeing as Gearbox might have killed him. \n\nBuy this game, show your support.

The enhancements to the engine are making it look better than ever, and the gameplay is just as fun as Duke and the rest. The performance issues that the game currently has mar the experience a little bit, but it is still early access so I'm sure it will be running smooth as butter by the final release. Our new heroine has some great one-liners as well, many even funnier than Mr. Nukem's: \"I spray, you pray\" is one of my faves so far.\n\nDespite the fact that the early access campaign is very short and it has performance issues, I still highly recommend any fan of the classic Build Engine games from the 90s to go ahead and buy Ion Maiden and support the developers.

Bombshell, a top-down action RPG, released a few years back and it receieved a cold reception, with low exposure by games media and mediocre sales to boot.  Before release, word of an FPS prequel for the Build engine was teased, and a couple screenshots were thrown onto forums and twitter.  Those screenshots are what perked my ears.  I silently waited for years, checking periodically on progress, and now the tree bears its fruit, albeit not ripe yet.\n\nPros:\n-Solid core gameplay mechanics with clear vision in mind, bringing forth nostalgia but also a fresh experience.\n\n-Gorgeous sprite-work and textures powered by an upgraded Build engine, giving it a very authentic vibe.\n\n-Shelly has character, as any Build engine protagonist should, and I'm excited to hear all of her lines in the final product.  Plus, cute.\n\n-Secrets out the ass (seriously, there are many more than you would expect).  They definitely require you to think outside the box, and you are absolutely rewarded for it.\n\n-Great sound design with room to improve, killer soundtrack (can't wait to hear more of this especially).\n\n-Level design is very non-linear and engaging, paced well.  It's a blast to explore and check out all of the little things.\n\n-Overall tight package for an early access game.  Meant to tease for now, please you later.\n\nCons:\n-Enemy variety is lacking, and they need more sounds for lurking, death, and pain.  But this IS a preview model game, so this will very likely be fleshed out by release.\n\n-HUD is simple, but functional, could use more flair as an option.\n\n-OpenGL renderer is choppy as hell, software is smoother.  Again, will likely be more optimized in the future.\n\n-UI in the save/load screen needs more polish.\n\n-Levels within a zone have a seamless transition, but I feel some sort of partition (level announcement, map name appears on screen, maybe a message) would be nice, even if it only showed up once upon moving from one part to the next, while backtracking could remain seamless.\n\n-$20 is a steep price for a package this small, and considering this was technically $3 when bundled as a bonus for Bomdshell, it's a pill to swallow in its current state.  \n\nIn a nutshell, this is a 90's Build engine game ripped from an alternate timeline, a companion to classics such as Duke 3D and Shadow Warrior, and an obvious labor of love from a team with passion and dedication.

Ce qui fait en revanche la grande, tr\u00e8s grande force d'Ion Maiden, c'est [b]l'ouverture de ses niveaux.[/b]\n\nC'est bien simple : les niveaux, gigantesques, sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s en plusieurs zones dans lesquelles on peut revenir \u00e0 tout moment (tant que l'on a pas termin\u00e9 le niveau en question).

It is such more than that, and in a great way. It has some issues, but for the price and excitement of a classic genre to return, to me, seems a worthy price of admission. \n\nFor your consideration, the Build engine has seem some stuff, like 'Nam thousand yard stare stuff. There has been many releases on the Build engine, with amazing titles such as Duke Nukem 3D & Blood and not so great stuff like Redneck Rampage and WWII GI.\n\nIon Maiden is a release that pushes the Build to its limits with it's beautiful open vistas, mingy basements and inspiring cityscapes, like a Hollywood Holocaust on [i]Nuke[/i]. To be blunt, the level design is primarily the best reason for this curiosity, and anyone who likes to uncover secrets will find much to do in these couple of preview levels. It also does a lot of great level design checks, such as often being able to see it, means you can get there - or levels eventually returning back to a previous area and creating a believable and full circle environment.\n\nWeapons are very satisfying, which is essential for any first person shooter, you'll find a revolver that asks the question Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk? The SMG is pretty cool and does enough damage to ensure it's worth, and the shotgun folds chairs, period. Can't forget the Bowling Ball bombs, but well get to that. Every weapon has a reload animation, but I never felt that it impeded combat. Especially considering how quick everything is, combat and pacing, the reloads feel  tolerable. A few frames at most, and you can reload whenever you like.\n\nMusic is good, pretty great stuff - but it's quite short for how long the levels are. You're gonna hear the same loops a lot, which might make some people get annoyed. I will be honest, it got to me towards the end a bit, especially while hunting for the [b]33[/b] secrets!\n\nThere are one-liners. Nothing over the top, but I felt they repeated too much, especially when you're blowing up everyone with the bombs. Theres a few eye-rollers but nothing that will make you uninstall. Especially because there's an off/on button but a slider would've been great. But that's probably an option unavailable for Build.\n\n\nEnemies are a mix of hitscan and seeable shots. Their range doesnt seem infinite, so you wont find any Tibetan chaingunners yodelling lead towards you from another planet or anything. But I found getting plinked occasionally. I could be wrong on this. \n\nBUT, whoever decided to have -not- headcrabs BLOOD hands or whatever little enemies, bad move! Who the hell loves fighting small hit boxes? augh so annoying and you'll definitely find these whenever theres a vent around or an ambush waiting to happen\n\nCriticisms: \n\nReboundable Quick Save/Load - Common u goobers! Definitely an oversight. \n\nMusic isn't catchy or lengthy enough to meet the level size.\n\nUnoptimization? Getting crazy frame drops on a 1050ti, especially in combat, seems pretty whack.\n\nKeycards on the ground are quite small, this might not be a ball breaker for the pros and veterans of small detail, but a corpse falls on a key, or in a key finds itself in the shade, I feel that I have a big chance of missing it and then wandering around wondering where I goofed up. \n\nItem placement needs some TLC, or whiskey. Found areas where there was lots of ammo and health, and then large chunks where there were a lotta baddies and no ammo and health. Seems like oversight or rookie mistakes. I just dont want that to be a trend.\n\nThe tracking/seeking on the bowling ball bombs can break. Example: I threw a bomb and it spun around the cyborg soldier indefinetly and was pretty anticlimatic. Rectified by just throwing another. I've also thrown bombs that just fall through some sectors (particularly at the back end of the first level). Needs an alternative fire to explode them on command, much like a pipe bomb.\n\nThat's all I really have to say, for a few hours to complete everything in the review, its a real feel good trip down memory lane for those who want that, but it also stands on its own merits and brings you great level design, gun umph and old school slaughter that many throwbacks fail to fully grasp.\n\nShine on you crazy Ion, lets make this one for the books. \n\nCome Get S- errr you know what to expect!", "timestamp_created": 1520396610, "timestamp_updated": 1520431068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.668030", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40621953": {"recommendationid": "40621953", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961630509", "num_games_owned": 107, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520320580}, "language": "english", "review": "Plays great.

First of all, let me say this:\n\nIf you like 90s shooters, get this game immediately.\n\nSeriously, this game is really good.  There are so many secrets to find in each of the (currently 2) levels, 33 secrets in total.  The weapons are currently limited, but they handle great.  Personally, my favorite weapons are the Loverboy, the disperser, and the bowling bombs.\n\nThe devs are insidious with their placement of secrets.  Some secrets are easy to find, others are hidden pretty well.  Others are easy to spot, but getting to them requires some platforming, some of which I found difficult, though that's probably just me being really rusty at 90s shooters.  There's a certain secret that really caught me off-guard, really made me laugh my ass off.  The devs know which one.  Well played, you magnificent bastards.\n\nThe only cons I can think of at the moment are that it's not finished, but that's really not a con.  The bowling bombs only mode is pretty great, really helps you get more time out of the game, especially if you try to 100% it.\n\nFor the devs, I offer this:  continue the \"Bombshell\" so that it's more in line with this.  If you do that, you'll strike gold.

Stylish. Neon illuminated. Deadly.[/i][/quote]\n\n[h1]Build Engine (or pointless intro)[/h1]\nMore than 2 decades after engine release we get ourselves a new Build engine game. A game that has to compete with [i]Blood, Duke Nukem 3D[/i] and [i]Shadow Warrior[/i]. A game that has to surpass gameplay-wise each and every predecessor or at least reach the same level of quality. Old school FPS games are in demand as triple-A releases barely scratch an itch for some fast-paced hardcore mindless action with badass soundtrack, while indies try to saturate the market with mixed success. So, when you hear [i]New build engine game in 2018[/i] you get hyped. But instead of shouting [i]\"Build Engine. 2018. Old School. F-ing cool. Buy Now.\"[/i], let's calm down and find out, whether it's something worth [i]shooting around[/i].\n\n[i]The following wall of text is about preview campaign (or should we call it preview Zone). The review [b]may[/b] get updated upon full release. tl;dr version, as usual, at the bottom.[/i]\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Movement.[/b] As every other old-school game it is fast as it should be. Whether it is tight dimly lit corridor or a vast open street, you'll be strafing, running and gunning. And it's damn good, as good as it was back in '90s.\n[*][b]Guns.[/b] There are 5 as of now: melee shock baton; triple-barrel revolver called [i]The Loverboy[/i]; shotgun called [i]The Disperser[/i]; sub-machine gun [i]SMG-9000[/i] and [i]Bowling Bombs[/i]. Melee weapon is more of a nostalgic nod than a viable weapon; revolver, shotgun and sub-machine gun are your typical weapons with reloading (controversial design decision for some) slapped on'em; but bowling bombs are awesome homing balls of exploding fun. To each their own, but sub-machine gun felt powerless and useless in every scenario except maybe final boss.\n[*][b]Enemies.[/b] Currently there are 4 and 1 boss. 3 enemies are you generic badies with shotgun/sub-machine gun/crossbow, 1 is spider-like melee creature and the boss is a mech with chaingun and rockets. None are challenging, none are exceptionally unique. That said, right now, enemy variety is underwhelming.\n[*][b]Game and difficulty modes.[/b] There are 3 difficulty modes and sadly they are:\n1. The easiest.\n2. Easier.\n3. Easy.\nSome may argue that the difficulty is okay, but for me playing on Ion Maiden's Hard was like playing something between Doom's \"Hey, not too rough\" and \"Hurt me plenty\". Running out of ammo is never a challenge, getting your health below 50 is never a problem.\nWhat's more interesting is [i]Bombardier Trial[/i] game mode (unlocked after finishing the campaign), in which your max health is capped at 25 and you're given unlimited bowling bomb supply. But again, it's hardly teeth grinding challenge.\n[*][b]Levels.[/b] The campaign is divided into 2 big levels which are comprised of a smaller \"sub-levels\". Most of the time, there are multiple ways to traverse through, multiple shortcuts that can be opened and exploration doesn't feel tedious or tacked on. The itself campaign can be finished in a hour or so.\n[*][b]Secrets.[/b] Glory to the secrets. It's less of mashing \"E\" on every surface and more of observe/think/navigate/overcome. Hidden switches, hidden platforms, hidden breakable object, time-based triggers, platforming sections - secrets are great. Reaching the end level switch and getting slapped with [i]\"you are now missing 10 secrets...\"[/i] winds you up. [i]\"Wow, how the hell did I miss those?\"[/i] and you replay the level only to get [i]\"you are now missing 4 secrets\"[/i].\n[*][b]Replay value.[/b] Bombardier Trial and more than 30 secrets to find is enough reason to replay the campaign once if not several times.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nIn short, the visuals are glorious. The sprite work is notch: the weapons, the enemies, the pickable items are distinct and detailed. The environments are filled with little objects, details and vary greatly. There is never a feel, that you're going through the same room over and over again. The amount of textures and decorations allows to reuse them without player constantly noticing it.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Soundtrack.[/b] 3-4 setpieces, that currently are present in the release, are rather forgettable and unintrusive; nothing to write home about.\n[*][b]Sounds.[/b] Guns, enemies, ambient sound are generally okay, again, nothing to write home about.\n[*][b]One-liner Badassery.[/b] At this point, it's hard to judge whether the protagonist will be able to deliver as there aren't many lines present in the campaign. \"Ka-boom\", \"Holy shit\", \"I spray, you pray\" are just a few examples of what there currently is.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]tl;dr checklist[/h1]\nPros:\n[list]\n[*]Fast-paced action. No \"arena with 6 enemy max\" crap.\n[*]Vast levels to explore with keycard hoarding.\n[*]Environment detalization is great (for 2 decade old engine that is).\n[*]Secrets that are actual secrets.\n[*]Additional game mode increases replay value.\n[/list]\nNeutrals:\n[list]\n[*]Guns are pretty standard.\n[*]Hard difficulty is easy.\n[*]Unintrusive but forgettable soundtrack.\n[/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Currently lacks enemy variety.\n[*]Rather short.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n[i][b]Ion Maiden[/b][/i] has a lot of potential. It delivers detailed environments, fast-paced action, semi non-linear levels, keycard hoarding and brings back actual [i]SECRETS[/i]. But current Preview Campaign lacks in enemy variety, difficulty and sound design quality. If you've played every other Build Engine classic and you are itching for more right here and right now no matter how short the experience may be, then go ahead and buy [i][b]Ion Maiden[/b][/i].\nOtherwise, hold you robotic horses and wait for the full release.", "timestamp_created": 1520164314, "timestamp_updated": 1520164897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40560163": {"recommendationid": "40560163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117752378", "num_games_owned": 720, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520163866}, "language": "english", "review": "Just finished the demo levels, now i want more.", "timestamp_created": 1520163976, "timestamp_updated": 1520163976, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40558456": {"recommendationid": "40558456", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043602285", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1521182718}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played many games in my life, but this game is the worst went it comes to stuttering, slow down, and choppy frame rate that I've ever seen for this level of visual fidelity.

Yes\n\nIon Maiden is essentially the spiritual sequel to Duke Nukem 3D, the classic Build-engine style game and uses the very same engine, but modified and modernized.\n\nCurrently, as of this review, you can only play the first part of 7 proposed chapters of the game. I beat the game on Normal difficulty, and \"Bombardier Mode\" on Normal difficulty, which is a game mode where you only play with bowling bombs and have a mximum of 25 health. Both modes for chapter 1 I beat blind in roughly 1:40:00 (an hour and forty minutes).\n\nWhile this may seem steep to some for 20 USD, the full game I feel will be very much worth it, if what we have to go on so far is any indication.\n\nIf you've ever played a Build-engine game before, this game is like riding a bike, you never really forget how to do it. The level layouts are unique and large, the gun-play is fantastic (the disperser is seriously on the level of satisfying as that of DOOM II's Super Shotgun, yes, it really is) and the difficulty itself is actually really balanced, not too hard, not too easy, just right.\n\nMy only real cons are that Shelly herself has very few lines, and often repeats the same two lines pretty often, so you don't really get a feel for the character, and the enemy variety is particularly low, there are roughly 4 enemy types and a boss that repeat themselves throughout the whole level, while this is not out of the ordinary for a Build-engine game, without the subsequent chapters to play, it does make one yearn for more variety in enemies and powerups.\n\nOverall, would absolutely recommend, Voidpoint and 3DRealms have something special on their hands if done right.", "timestamp_created": 1520157322, "timestamp_updated": 1520157322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40557758": {"recommendationid": "40557758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000234265", "num_games_owned": 317, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520074500}, "language": "english", "review": "RECOMMENDED!!!\nI had a real blast playing the preview campaign!

Reloading in a game like this is ANNOYING, it's \"acceptable\" but it would have been a lot more fun without it\n2.  There's a huge lack of interactive objects, none of the drink machines, coffee makers, etc work, it may sound minor but duke3d was so good because of a lot of little things adding up and it really did make the world feel more \"real\".\n3.  The toilets dissapointed me, you had the perfect chance to invoke nostalgia by having a guy on it when you open the door but instead there's just a line of dudes behind each door standing up with shotguns :/\n4.  The mirrors dont work.  This stood out quite a bit, as they DID in duke3d.\n5.  Armor shards are super hard to see\n6.  you get stuck on geometry more than in older build games, not sure why, i think some things have hitboxes at weird angles, the enemies get stuck all the time like this too\n7.  ammo seems a little TOO scarce early on for the number of shots enemies take....my aim was pretty good, didn't miss much, and i still found my ammo running pretty low most of the early game.  After you get your second gun though you're pretty much a walking armory/pharmacy (i had 6 spare medkits when i reached the boss and i didn't even find many of the secrets)\n8.  the ladders jerk you around quite a bit when you transition up or down, i know it's done for the room over room trick but the transition is pretty jarring sometimes.\n\nThe good:\n\n1. The voiceovers are pretty good\n2. Overall I liked the graphics, a bit rough in some spots though.\n3.

Personally, I was never brought up on 90s FPS games and I came to the scene pretty late. I started with DooM and worked my way up from there all the while playing countless hours of many DooM WADs that are out there on Moddb. \n\nFirst off, this game is a perfect reimagining of the 90s FPS genre, it has brought back the Build engine which has powered some other really good games such as Blood, Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior. \nThe weapons that have been added so far feel absolutely amazing, and each has it's own purpose and is to be used for the right enemy at the right time for maximum efficiency. \nThe enemy types are quite varied and you are able to dodge their attacks if you are quick enough, all the enemies are balanced for an enjoyable gameplay so you feel good when killing them from all the bullets you have unloaded into them. \nGunplay for this game is extremely fun and fluid and you will probably eventually run out of bullets for some weapons if you aren't on point with your accuracy (I personally played with no aim assist whatsoever). There's still plenty of ammo drops laying around and you can get ammo drops from enemies that you kill.\nThe secrets in Ion Maiden are quite rewarding, considering that you actually look around and explore every nook and cranny, or you can just simply constantly press the use key on every surface you come across.\nThe artstyle and atmosphere of this game is absolutely staggering, every inch of every level shows the passion and care that the map maker put into making it and it pushes you to explore all the halls and rooms that may possibly lead you to a secret...\nThe main character and the story so far seem quite interesting and I am intrigued about what will happen throughout the campaign, I also must say that the voice actor for the protagonist has done a really good job.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed any of the 90s FPS classics, although I'd probably tell you to wait until it gets fully released or you'll be thinking about the game every second of the day like I have, waiting for the next update to come out...", "timestamp_created": 1520120093, "timestamp_updated": 1520216752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631512", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40547781": {"recommendationid": "40547781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000527075", "num_games_owned": 176, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520465611}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like Duke Nukem 3D and Blood.

After all, this style of FPS (sprite-based, pseudo-3d) has often been the key gaming experience for people of my generation (born in the late eighties), who are now old enough to make a mark on game development. And so we see a wave of retro shooters arriving that attempt to recreate the style of Duke Nukem 3d, Blood and Shadow Warrior. Ion Maiden is one of such games, developed using an updated version of the actual Build code, with improvements originating from the eDuke32 source port project. Does it succeed in its aims?\n\nAfter playing through the currently available preview campaign I'm happy to report that it definitely is on the right track. The most important element of these games for me was the level design, and here the devs are showing considerable skill. The current stages are set in a metropolis struck with some apocalyptic calamity. We get to travel through an office building with some neighboring city streets and a metro station with adjacent underground tunnels. It's an obvious homage to Duke 3d but the style adds some good 'neon synthwave' elements (with a fitting tracker-style soundtrack). Importantly, the layouts and level of detail are amazing, especially in the first (above ground) section. The maps are sprawling and splendidly decorated with vintage sprites, filled with small interactive elements like light switches and destructible furniture. And there are secrets around every corner, many even requiring environmental interactions, like pushing objects. Completing the preview took me about an hour and a half and I had a great time. Finding all 32 hidden areas is surely a task for a few hours.\n\nThe combat is simple but quick and lethal, as expected in this style. You can make your way carefully and take cover around corners, but a more aggressive circle-strafing style is also completely viable. The enemy hordes of cyborgs don't exhibit any special intelligence and go down easily, but are satisfying to mow down. Arsenal consists of an electrified baton (which actually x-rays the enemies), a revolver, a shotgun and an Uzi-type submachine gun, which all feel reasonably powerful. A more original invention is the explosive munitions, called the 'Bowling bombs', which roll on the ground and home in on monsters. They are extremely powerful and can be used for some tricks, like rolling them under a partially open door. Overall the combat captures the essence of retro FPS and complements the exploration based gameplay. True to the style, we also get a talking protagonist with many sarcastic one-liners (even if I feel that the voice actress could use a more varied inflection).\n\nSo what I would like to see in the full campaign? More variety in enemy types and behavior - like flying ones. Original, signature guns, like old Caleb used to have. Stages that go beyond the urban/industrial setting. And some more technical polish, as the game tends to stutter in intense moments. I was also surprised to see common Half-Life-type mini loadzones. But overall I can almost guarantee that any fan of the classic 2.5D shooters will enjoy the current 2-level mini campaign.

The maps are spacious, full of detailed objects and texture, great enemy placements where spawns don't feel cheap, and alternate routes to take! I'd say the maps are wonderfully and masterfully created. Some of the weapons just feel underpowered. The shotgun feels more like an SMG with burst fire, rather than a shotgun should feel. The spread isn't what I had imagined and it felt like a dissapointment. The revolver is kickass but I can't seem to fan the hammer! If that's a later mechanic added then I'm more than excited to see it. Bowling bombs are a hit and miss with me. Some times they'll lock on and other times, even when an enemy is in front of me, just decides to roll around him and target someone else. It's more like taking out one target rather than a larger group which is the purpose of a grenade.  A few notable problems I've noticed with the engine: \n[*] Framerate drops to 0 for a second or so which can really ruin the flow and intensity of the game. It'll throw your mouse around so you have to fix your aim and get readjusted to your surroundings. I normally clock in at around 1000 FPS LOL so that could be an underlying issue for me to fix.\n\n[*] No quicksaving! Now that's more of a personal nitpick than anything, but I hate having to manually save before I move to a dangerous area and want to, again, keep the flow of the game going.\n\n[*] Reloading in a Build engine game just seems.. unnecessary? Reloads take waaayyy too long and there really is no point in even having this mechanic. Like others have mentioned, if it's kept, at least change reloading speeds?\n\nOther than those glaring issues I've come across, I'd like to say thanks to the team who has taken the time and dedication  to create an amazing throwback to their 90s hits with a modern twist.

With headshots dealing more damage, and shots to the body dealing less damage, unlike the other 3d reams games where it doesn't matter where you shoot them. I love this.\n\nCons:\n\n- The reloading time for the SMG 9000 is way too long. It takes around three seconds or so to reload it, which massively kills the fast pace of the combat. The fact that you need to reload it so frequently doesn't help with this. Please increase the reload speed of it, or remove the reloading entirely.\n\n- Please let us dual-wield the SMG-9000 in the full game. Please. For Lo Wang.\n\n- A few of the one-liners are flat-out bad, in my opinion. \"Cleanup on aisle 'your ass'\"? Jesus christ... please remove this stinker in the real version.\n\n\nOverall:\n\nI tell you what though, you've got something really special going right here. I reckon this will be the Duke Nukem Forever we always wanted. I really like this preview campaign, and I'm hyped as hell to see the full game's release. For anyone looking to buy this, you might think the game is a little overpriced for just two levels, but you couldn't be any more wrong.

I am assuming you will add more, however.\n\nI had a few random spaz outs, where my crosshair flung to the ceiling, bear in mind I am using a PS4 controller.\n\nOn the topic of controllers. I totally get the genre and I know it flourishes on keyboard/mouse. Though I've recently been suffering a bit of RSI and I am no longer using a mouse. It would be great if this game had slightly improved controller support. Like, its not bad at all, but swapping weapons is a little annoying and aiming is a bit of a bitch (I am probably not used to the aiming is all). Maybe there is some way to imrove upon the weapon switching at the very least. Navigating the menu with a controller is also a tad irritating. \n\nOverall, I think this is the best game I've played all year, and I respect you (developers) so much for creating a banger for the fans of the genre and engine.\n\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1519969601, "timestamp_updated": 1519969656, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40502363": {"recommendationid": "40502363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322613781", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6, "last_played": 1520855144}, "language": "english", "review": "Takes me on a trip back to the 90s, which is priceless.\n", "timestamp_created": 1519968285, "timestamp_updated": 1519968285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40502234": {"recommendationid": "40502234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101205921", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1521386934}, "language": "english", "review": "Cant wait for the full game!

The maps are much bigger than what could be accomplished back in the 90's, and the developers have taken a few improvements that modern FPS games use and put it in here.

Gameplay is more tight and satisfying, visuals are more advanced and level design is awesome. Game rewards exploration and attention to details. Secret places are very creative and hunting them down is really fun. Levels are big and complex but never convoluted. You always know where you are and you never feel like you're stuck and don't know what to do next.\n\nMy only real complaint is that when you figure out enemy behaviors and realize that headshots are a thing in this game it becomes way too easy even on hardest difficulty.

Like the enemy variety is a bit low and their sounds are a bit generic. And the enemy deaths don't feel visceral and meaty enough. \n\nI absolutely love the game. It ticks all the boxes for me: little to no loading time, no cutscenes or story that gets in the way of gameplay. You get your gun and the action starts right away. No handholding.

warrior and blood) so I found myself more then pleasently surprised by the existence of this game when i saw the trailer today.  \n\nI came in with high expections and i have to say what i played so far has me very impressed.\n\n-The combat is frankly in a league of its own compared to other classic styled shooters on the market.\n In that it is acurate (You feel like you have alot of control and mobility), frenetic (Theres a degree of predictable unpredictability in the chaos of explosions and gunfire), detailed (There is alot of animations, bottles breaking, headshots, flushing toilets, blood splatter on walls, bullet shells on the floor, etc) and the guns feel like they have some seriously satisfying smack to them. \n\n-There is some added complexity and strategy when you shoot an enemy. You can get head shots that kill them in one shot and if you shoot them down lower that means they will take more hits to kill. It might seem like a no da thing but having that in build engine game really makes combat a joy.\n\n-The music is simply unoffensive and has some stand out moments. It stays away from being distracting and lets the gameplay be the focus.\n\n-The main charater is so far likable. She occasionally spews out one liners and pop culture refrences in a way that makes you roll your eyes but at the same time smile. Time will tell if she stands with the greats like duke or lo wang.\n\n- A few negatives i would say is that i experienced a chopping frame rate that was only resolved when i re installed the game. After that i did not have any technical problems. Another potential negative would be that newer fps fans might be put off or confused by the nature of the graphics being of an old school flavour. Althougth life time fans will certainly get th appeal.\n\nI have played the preview level 11 times and still have a strong desire to go back and play it. It honestly feels like it keeps getting better every time i play it.

Actually amusing one-liners, plenty of secrets in every area of every level, tough and challenging enemies, and alot of cool-looking, kickass weapons.\n\nThe Main character, is hte same from Bombshell, but what Bombshell lacks, this game has, in spades. Art direction looks very competent and good, being partly or entirely (I'm not sure which) handled by the guy who created HDoom, which, whether you like the mod or not, you cannot say he doesn't know how to make a good-looking sprite.\n\nAll enemies look fantastic and the environment is no different. Looking just like a Duke Nukem 3D custom map, the Preview Campaign is a fantastic starting point.\n\nNote: I've only played the first level. I haven't beaten it, only gotten to the yellow key door and... ran out of ammo and died.\n\nThe game has a very critical and major flaw though. Stuttering. Every area past the first autosave checkpoint, will lag you like the game is 9000 pounds of solid garbage, and not like normal lag, but rather, it'll be sparing and spikey. You'll have a few seconds of fluid gameplay, then a second-long freeze.\n\nThe game itself runs at a buttery smooth 60 FPS, but hte engine itself seems to require an absurd amount of CPU just to smoothly display everything. I have a Quad-Core AMD A10-5800K CPU, it's running at a maximum 70 percent when I play this game, and it shouldn't be this bad.\n\nHowever, HDoomGuy has told me that the engine, which is an enhanced form of the Build engine (Hopefully with some easily usable map tools akin to Doom Builder, coming out in the near future after release!), has some kinks, the stuttering being one of them.\n\nIf you have a CPU capable of playing say... Dark Souls 3, or anything of equal level of performance requirements, you could probly play this with no problem.\n\nBut sadly, I can't. In large areas with the most enemies, I have to play like the Polygon journalist who played Doom 4, just to kill maybe a couple guys.\n\nMy recommendation is to wait until some patches go through to fix the engine's flaws and minimize the stuttering before you buy it, or wait for it to go 25% to 50% off before you get it.\n\nThough HDG, DID recommend alt-tabbing via Alt+Enter during stuttering to fix it as a temporary measure, so when I play it tomorrow, I will try that out for certain!\n\nStay Tuned for further updates, I will be keeping a VERY close eye on this.\n\nWithout the Stuttering, this game proves beyond a shadow of any fathomable doubt that 3D Realms has returned to their former glory.\nAnd yet...

But a pleasant surprise it is!\nFor fans of classic Build Engine games, you may know them as such games as Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warrior, Blood - yes those classic violent and gory shooters from the 90's - will enjoy a fresh new game with traditional gratuitous violence and gore! Don your 'Loverboy' revolver and shoot up some cyber-punks in this gritty dystopian world - oh and throw some kickass one liners while your wrecking havoc!\n\nIon Maiden offers everything the classic 90's shooters did best and keeps it as good as them. Ion Maiden can easily be up there with the greats and its already stole my heart with its retro feel and fantastic gameplay. \n\nLevel design is superb! Huge and highly detailed levels riddled with secrets and enemies and offers a mix of close quarters and big open spaces. The smallest details really add to the experience, one instance had me staring at a condom machine in a public toilet because I noticed \"Who wants some Wang?\" Written on it, suffice to say I chuckled.\n\nSprites in this game are probably some of the most polished I've seen, however Ion Maiden has been developed and brought out in 2018 so refining the whole experience is most likely an easier task - ANYWAY, the weapon sprites look brilliant and feel great in hand. Enemy sprites looked mediocre for the most part but I didn't spend a lot of time staring at them as I did gunning them down, blowing them to smithereens, or beating the !@#\u00a3 out of them with an electrified police baton! Oh yeah speaking of guns, Ion Maiden offers a sweet array of weapons to plough through the preview episode with. You'll start off with said electrified police baton and a whopping big revolver called the 'Loverboy'. Eventually you'll find a beefy looking shotgun that packs a punch, the SMG-9000, and these awesome little homing grenade bombs to decimate your enemies with. That isn't even the entire roster, towards the end of the preview campaign you'll pick up a massive chaingun (sadly the campaign came to an end before I could fire the beast - what a tease!) My only issue with the weapons is that they require reloading which can be done manually or automatically, however this is only a minor annoyance and doesn't effect gameplay drastically.\n\nThe enemy AI isn't perfect, a couple of times did I catch enemies wandering off into the distance or trying to force their body through a wall, but who cares - as long as you got the gun, it's all about havin' fun!

Another nice touch is that it tells you how many secrets you have missed before you exit a level, and in this preview alone there are a lot.

throughout.\n\nLevel designs that are drawn from the inspirations of 3D Realms previous games for the better but with that also comes with some spots that I thought i had missed a lever some where.(this part may or may not be right) The ambush in the subway system for example, I feel like I tried to open the door and spent a while searching the level and examing the environment until I tried to crouch and open the door at the same time. In retrospect it seems obvious to do that but it really broke up the tempo of the game for something that subtle.\n\nRemaining on the topic of the level for a brief second, the game's engine still shows its age and looking down or up stretches out the enrionment which can make some platforming and item collection into a mess of warped textures and luck.\n\nThe main characters comments are kept low, perfect direction to have an option in the menu to turn them off, but when I hear the MC say \"bullshit\" I love it. It feels like she actually has a personality.\n\nHowever there are some problems, I was shot a few times from an enemy I couldn't see because the \"fog\" of the game hid them while they were down a long corridor. Only happened once but playing on harder difficulties this can make it seem unfair.\n\nLadders are way too janky, going up them is fine although jarring how you are locked into one. The problem lies when navigating down a later and you inevitably fall off and take damage, try to aim for the ladder while you fall and hope you catch the bottom.\n\nEnemies are designed well enough, the first two do appear a little \"samey\" and their voice lines are repeated quite often. \"fan out\" and \"over here\" As the game progresses more dangerous and swarming types appear which break up the mold.\n\nThe boss fight in this early access version is fun, not challenging and falls into the trap of showering you with armor and weapons before hand which might as well have been a sign saying this is the level's boss fight. A bunch of enemies spawn on the right side of the map and then the boss showes up. The boss has the ability to destory terrain, which is awesome, but besides that I threw grenades at it until it died. I got to pick up a minigun and before firing a single round the level ended.\n\nThis game shines with its 'tude where it will challenge you to kill all enemies and find all hidden spots tucked away within the game's beautifuly retro design but certain aspects still need ironing out. This a game for the fans of 3D Realms previous titles and other games within this genre of 90s shooters. \n\nRemember real players find all the secrets, are you a real player?", "timestamp_created": 1519840432, "timestamp_updated": 1519842565, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40466981": {"recommendationid": "40466981", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961051596", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1521430395}, "language": "english", "review": "Ion Maiden is a modernized build engine game, so if you are nostalgic for games in the Blood, Duke Nukem 3D, and Shadow Warrior variety, you will not be dissapointed at this early preview. There's a lot of secrets laid throughout the levels, some are accessible by moving things like office chairs or trashcans, some are accessed via hidden switches or hard to reach areas.\n\nCurrently this early access game has about an hour worth of very fun gameplay and an additional \"bomb trial\" which unlocks once you beat the sample campaign episode. The bomb trial mode only has the Bowling Bombs as your main weapon, which is one of the most fun weapons to use.\n\nThe sample campaign episode shows a lot of promise for the finished product, the game feels polished, movement feels very quick and it's fun to quickly strafe around enemies while unloading bullets into them. Most weapons feel great, the only weapon which doesn't feel as unique or fun to use is the SMG which just sprays a lot of bullets. I tended to use the \"Loverboy\" pistol the most, with the Bowling Bombs and shotgun as my other frequently used weapons.\n\nSince this is a Build engine game don't expect the most amazing graphics, but this game looks great for the retro aesthetic it's trying to go for. I'm sure being a modern version of the build engine this game can run on various specs of hardware without much problems.\n\nThe game is developed by Voidpoint LLC, which is comprised of fan hobbyist programmers who created EDuke32 years ago, a modernization of the Build engine and its tools.\n\nOverall, I'm looking forward to the finished product, highly reccomend purchasing this if you want to support the devs. I'll update my review once that's out.", "timestamp_created": 1519840239, "timestamp_updated": 1519840239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40466583": {"recommendationid": "40466583", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963600307", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 132, "last_played": 1521559134}, "language": "english", "review": "legitimately sick, this completely and utterly blows the competition away.", "timestamp_created": 1519839141, "timestamp_updated": 1519839141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40466525": {"recommendationid": "40466525", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984188578", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519929179}, "language": "english", "review": "Congratulations developers, you did it.

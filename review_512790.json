The puzzles throughout build repeatedly on the same concepts and ideas in a way that feels like that riven style of satisfaction, with perhaps a little less of the moonlogic.

The game gets a tad too narrative focused towards the end, making the conclusion feel a bit weakened.

It has such bad performance even the starting menu caused my fans to run hot just idling.\n\nAfter trying to get it to work at an acceptable level for an hour over a few days so it doesnt cook my hardware, I crawled the discussion boards for ways to improve the performance outside of the very limited graphic options in game but didn't find anything of value. It's nearly unplayable in terms of minimum requirements and I can't reccommend it to anyone as it looks and plays worse than 5 to 15 year old games that have a good design phillosophy. \n\nQuern is anything but modern, it is made in Unity5, but I don't believe it's Unity's fault the game runs so badly. Quern's unreasonably taxing on any hardware is due to how the devs built the game like 2 ton weights dropped on your GPU and RAM and if your PC can handle the strain the devs consider it 'optimized' which is far from it.. The hardware specifications are very misleading even when hitting the recommended settings, and honestly if the game was made properly it wouldn't need anywhere near them. Indie graphics are one thing but this sort of sub-par performance is another. \n\nWatching the trailer you would expect to be able to run it no problem at at least a solid 30fps when you have played more visually impressive games like I have, but you would be wrong. The game is about 15 hours from the developer's mouth, but they decided to load nearly everything at once on the island into the engine making the game entirely bruteforcing your hardware and it has zero smart use of optimization methods. There's only maybe a maximum of 2 splits in loading Quern. Good luck If you dont have over 8+GB of RAM as it loads everything on the island with no game loading afterwords. The per-pixel realtime rendering (that you cant turn off) causes GPUs far too much work that tanks fps unless you play in tiny fuzzy resolutions because the developer have chosen not to use any modern technique like culling.\n\nPerformance wise is anything but good... when brought up repeatedly, the only thing the developer keeps saying is play it on the lowest resolution at 600x800, avoiding the elephant in the room that the game isnt optimized in the slightest capacity and they actively chose a method that is antithetical to optimization. It has been a year since release... and the optimization patches months apart only make bandaid changes. The dev gave excuses or goes silent when pressed about atrociously bad optimization when compared to other modern or older games. When looking around for reviews, Quern even has big problems and can drop fps to 10-20fps on the recommended specs (again no use of culling, as it tries to offload everything to the GPU all at once)\n\nThere is absolutely no justification to making a game almost entirely bruteforced. It's been the standard for decades, even in the case of big taxing games, to split loading rooms, cutscenes and swap assets out for lower quality ones so this sort of thing doesnt happen. Quern needs to be entirely reworked for a smarter workload to allow seamless loading between much smaller chunks with portals and or allow you to turn off the per-pixel based realtime lighting for baked lighting or pre-rendered scenes, but as is the only video options they allow you to tweak to get better fps turn the game into a gray pixelated mess or a fuzzy tiny window. Instead the devs pursued getting 4k support into the game and leaving lower to middle end hardware out to dry.\n\nNothing in Quern justifies the excessive demand on the hardware, it's just held down due to bad development decisions and until the developer treats these issues with more serious care than just relying on Unity patches I'm giving it a thumbs down. Quern deserves better than this and it's the team's responsibility to deliver on some quality assurance.", "timestamp_created": 1515184267, "timestamp_updated": 1515191220, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515194056, "developer_response": "The quoted discussion: http://steamcommunity.com/app/512790/discussions/0/1620599015912868100/"}, "39080790": {"recommendationid": "39080790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074388120", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 734, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514977968}, "language": "english", "review": "It's rare for me to leave feedback even months after buying games.\n\nThis puzzle-based world is as intriguing as it is beautiful.

I always give a game a chance.  I find things to appreciate because I recognize I'm toying with someone's hard work and creativity.  That said, here's my review:\n\nThe premise and story are contrived, and the puzzles and visuals are uninspired.  In short, the game is lame.\n\nNote:  I didn't play the game all the way through because after having made significant progress with little effort, the game suddenly lost all direction.  It was like, is there even another puzzle for me to solve?  What, where?  More to the point, why do I care?  The game gives no sense of urgency to the player for making further progress, and then it refuses to give any indication of what to do next.  That's not the kind of \"mystery\" you want to design into a game like this.  I didn't care enough to look up a walkthrough online, I just stopped playing and never looked back.\n\nPros:\n-Self-updating map screen\n-Awesome \"Journal\" feature that allows you to take pictures (as \"sketches\" on each page), to which you can add a brief note.  I used it extensively as I went, as if it really was my own journal, and I have to say it was the most fun I had while playing.  Yes, that's as sad as it sounds.  The document I created by myself was the best part of the game.  What does that tell you?\n-The voice acting isn't terrible.\n\nCons:\n-Lazy design work.  For example, every tree on the island is a pine, and it's the exact same model for each.  The size doesn't even vary.\n\nI give this game a thumbs down not because anything stood out as extremely bad, but because nothing stood out at all.  If it had been a bold but failed experiment, I could at least have appreciated the attempt at innovation.  You get a lot of indie games like that.  They're trying hard, but it just doesn't work.  Quern is not even trying.  The creators seem to have picked up the formula for how to construct a puzzle game from the greats that pioneered the genre, and then put their own project together in color-by-number fashion.  Mechanically, they built it competently enough.  But no love went into the game.  Therefore, I consider my time and money wasted.\n\n4/10", "timestamp_created": 1514879797, "timestamp_updated": 1514879797, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38958801": {"recommendationid": "38958801", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400842130", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1096, "last_played": 1516261508}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u662f\u6211\u73a9\u8fc7\u7684\u89e3\u8c1c\u6e38\u620f\u91cc\u9762\u6700\u68d2\u7684\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u771f\u7684\u6709\u70b9\u96be\uff0c\u8111\u5b50\u4e0d\u884c\u614e\u5165\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1514860665, "timestamp_updated": 1514860665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38955704": {"recommendationid": "38955704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006725471", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514850428}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game after reading that it was like Myst, but even better. I have to say that I 100% agree with that statement.\n\nQuern puts you on this magical island, where you follow the foodsteps of professor Maythorn. To find out why you are there you need to solve countless amazing puzzles.\nThe puzzles are at just the right level of challenging where most of them you won't solve right away, but you won't be stuck for hours without and end in sight.\nThe art in the game is amazing. Some models are a bit low on the polygon side, but it does not take away much from the beauty of the game. The lighting is especially well done in this game, it sets a great mood, and really lets the world shine.\n\nThe only minor complaints I have about this game is that controller support is a bit limited, the main menu is not browsable with a controller and some of the puzzles are hard to do with one. I kept switching between keyboard & mouse and controller.\nThe load time is also quite long, but that is only there when you start the game.\n\nIt took me about 15 hours of game time to finish the game, and during that time it kept unfolding and surprising me.\n\nThe only big complaint I have now is, that it's over, and I want more.

Quern is an excellent game.  Well planned out, engaging, with an interesting storyline.\n\nThere were some very fascinating puzzles, like the Alchemy, but there were also some exceedingly frustrating ones.  For much of the game I had to proceed with a walkthrough by my side to tell me the object of the puzzle - so I could then figure out the solution for myself.  There were only 2 that I had to look up the solution because they were so cryptic I couldn't work them out.

Myst 3: Exile is a competantly made game but really easy at times. With Quern, i found the right balance of figuring out puzzles really quickly and being stumped at certain points in time unable to progress. The comparison to Riven is inevitable as the whole world of Quern is one entity and compeonents from different parts of the world solve puzzles in another. This is a solid effort from an indie studio and it never feels like it.

It took about a minute to load the last 20 seconds of which was a frozen screen.   This happened each time I loaded a save, but it would eventually load with no further signs of performance issues during gameplay.   \nPuzzles:  Most were fairly straightforward and made sense, but there were  handful, probably 7 in total, where I lost patience, eventually cheated by watching a playthrough and either was angry with myself for overlooking something obvious or annoyed that my line of thinking did not match that of the developers.  For instance, and I will try to avoid spoilers by changing the details of the puzzle, I see a set two sets of symbols which I correctly identify belong to an object however, my thinking is I need to find pieces to place over lights to recreate the symbols to unlock a key.  That was not the case and I was supposed to look at the symbols and move the lights to match something in the symbols.  There were other puzzles that I unlocked unintentionally and unknowingly because I didn't realize it was a puzzle and was just touching buttons to see what they do and then didn't understand that I had already unlocked the puzzle.\n\nSo with the complaining done, I enjoyed the storyline and despite my above frustrations found myself continuing to play because I wanted to see how the backstory would conclude.   The music had a nice ambient feel that changed as you went through different areas.  The color scheme is kind of gray and bland.  I generally prefer vibrant colors in these types of games, but the textures were nice enough to overcome that.

It has a lot in common with the Myst series (including some definite nods to the franchise), but it's still it's own game. It's like if the original Myst was turned into an adventure game with an inventory. A lot of the puzzles are very self contained--as compared to something like Riven where understanding the world is the puzzle--but there are points where you need to go back and re-use tools from before but in a different way with your new knowledge. Frequently, you'll find yourself approaching some complicated machine and needing to both figure out how it works and subsequently what you need to make it do, which will be familiar for anyone who's played Myst. My one general criticism of the puzzles is that it felt like too many of them revolved around just finding a solution written nearby and spending a little time interpreting it. \n\nOverall, it's a wonderful game with a cool world and lots of cool puzzles, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Myst, The Witness, or any sort of adventure/puzzle game.", "timestamp_created": 1510114875, "timestamp_updated": 1511650512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36365590": {"recommendationid": "36365590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026916042", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510103569}, "language": "english", "review": "With this game, I played a new Myst-like experience with better graphics, and for that I am trully thankful.", "timestamp_created": 1510104055, "timestamp_updated": 1510104055, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36353609": {"recommendationid": "36353609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022747468", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 227, "last_played": 1514928238}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein w\u00fcrdiger Nachfolger der Myst-Tradition.

On my system (i5-3330 + GTX 950 + 12GB RAM), at 1600x900 resolution, I got a decent 50 fps, but the 4-core CPU was at 85%, and the GPU ran at 80C. Even at that, there were often gaps when panning/moving. Changing the graphics quality from Ultra all the way down to Low seemed to have little effect, if any.\n\n- The game checks your hardware on install, and sets the graphics options to what it thinks is best. Unfortunately, once you change them from that, there's no easy way to get those initial settings back. In light of the point above though, this may be irrelevant.\n\n- Controller support is not complete enough (yet) to be used alone - you still need the mouse and keyboard for some things. In the end, I found the best experience was in Mouse + Keyboard mode (only) configuring my Steam controller to mimic the native controller layout (with a few personalizations).\n\nCon (the game itself):\n\n- Like Myst, the story doesn't make much sense until near the end, and even then it's not very deep.\n\n- Again like Myst, it is often very hard to know where to go next, or what to do when you get there. There are clues, but they are often subtle and easy to miss. Many of the clues are relevant to other locations, so unless you have a near-photographic memory, you spend a lot of time re-checking everywhere you've been to see what clue you might have missed. At first, I had to rely heavily on a walk-through. As things progressed, I got better at knowing what to look for and remember, and how to interpret it, so I needed the walkthrough less and less, but I was never able to do without it completely. Let's have a round of applause for those good folks who devote the many hours of time and effort it takes to create those walkthroughs!\n\n- Even a walkthrough can't help with some of the hard puzzles that use random combinations that reset when you fail. One of these requires you to memorize and reproduce a 14-long random light/tone sequence that you see and hear only once. If you find that you can't do that, you have absolutely no way to continue the game.\n\n\nThe bottom line:\n\nIn spite of my negative comments, I still enjoyed it. If you liked the Myst series, you'll almost certainly like this game too.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1510010407, "timestamp_updated": 1510010407, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36311014": {"recommendationid": "36311014", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970572217", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509925104}, "language": "english", "review": "Summary: Worth a purchase when on sale.\n\nQuern takes the best of the Myst gameplay and improves upon it. The graphics and audio narration is refined. The setting is lovely. The puzzles are challenging. In fact, the puzzles are so varied you will undoubtedly need to reference external material (guides and spoilers) to pass some of the more challenging puzzles. But, Quern goes one step further than Myst ever did, introducing some puzzles that are randomized.\n\nThe most frustrating of these was a 12 step simon says. By itself, it was challenging but not overly so. Add in a pencil that kept breaking 6 times and a written mistake for the 7th time (using a pen)-- you (like I) may find yourself incredibly frustrated. Still others require a lot of thought and attention to detail.\n\nQuern also features a save system-- although my experience was that it saved back to a recent save point in the story rather than to exactly where you saved it.\n\nOverall, I was pleased with Quern. I recommend it. I got it on sale and thought it was a bargain. If puzzles aren't your thing, don't get it. If you might be frustrated by the RNG and overly complex puzzles, then buy it only on sale. At full price, it's a bit pricey for the amount of playtime you're going to get.

I personally like to have my grey matter stretched but I do not enjoy having to combine calculus with chess and hope that I noticed a word on a wall discoverable only within the first 2 minutes of gameplay.  I will say the puzzles were tilted towards the mechanical side of the equation as opposed to the theoretical, which is true to the story as they have been physically created as both tests and a guide.  The puzzle progress is linear, but this remains true to the theme of the story.  I did hit the forums near the beginning of the adventure at one point where I could not determine where there even was a path to follow, but in retrospect, there were clues.  This keyed me into noting what might guide me later.  If you are looking for the New York Times Sunday Diagramless, the puzzles might seem dissapointly easy.

I tend to prefer more \"open world\" concepts, where you can work on numerous puzzles simultaneously (taking a break from one when you get stuck to go work on something else). That way, you don't have to completely stop when you get stuck. This one was very chronological, and the \"choice\" at the end wasn't nearly as witty or interesting as Myst. Mostly, the \"letters\" you encounter along the way were redundant. It would have been nice to have a more likeable character to follow. All this being said, if you need a \"Myst\" fix, this is a great choice. The puzzles were mostly solveable without help (although I did need a hint or two here and there), and the mechanics were intuitive (which is to say, there were enough hints that you could figure stuff out.  Nothing more frustrating, say, than a door with a code and no hints whatsoever about how to find the correct code. Trying thousands of combinations is not a fun way to waste hours of your life).

Obviously not going to spoil but the very last puzzle especially was perfect. \n\nAfter playing through it in a single day I consider it to have been a wonderful way to spend a holiday, an experience that has left me feeling thoroughly sated.

If you enjoyed the serenity of being on your own on an island in Myst, you'll love Quern - Undying Thoughts. It actually seems to pay a number of hommages to Myst with its visuals and puzzles that often are represented as mechanical devices.  \n\nThe graphics are great (not perfect, but easily good enough for a very immersive experience). The soundtrack is very atmospheric as well. I really appreciated the automatically expanding map and the notebook which allows one to not only capture snapshots (sketches) but also to write one's own notes so that one can browse through them later to see whether a new found object can be used in a previously visited location, for instance. \n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys exploring abandoned worlds and have only a few suggestions for improvement: I found some of the puzzles rather easy as such, but very obscure to approach. In other words, it was not obvious a couple of time what to do next and there were far too many options to make a trial and error approach to exploration satisfying. In hindsight, every step is logical, but as a matter of fact, other steps would have been logical as well and I don't enjoy trying all those options. Most of the time, one receives enough hints (through notes and drawings left behind, or through properties of objects) that one has a motivation to find another item or attempt a task, but a few times I found there were gaps in driving the next move. Sometimes the search space was confined enough to make educated exploration feasible, but sometimes it was just too vast for my taste.  \n\nI would also have loved to see more organic puzzles. Some of the puzzles in the game are of this type, i.e., you are just trying to create or fix something that someone else would have done as well, if they just lived in that place. But many puzzles involved elaborate machinery that had not other purpose than to present a puzzle to you. Why not, say, fix an elevator that looks like people would use, rather than operate a contraption that purely appears to be an obstacle made for you as a puzzler? The narrative of the game justifies pure puzzles in your path, but still, solving those hurdles does not feel as satisfying to me, compared to accomplishing tasks that actually make sense outside a pure puzzle challenge. \n\nA bit more story along the way would also have been appreciated. This would have added to the urgency, the desire to see what's next. As it is, one basically already knows the path from day one and there are no major reveals on the way. At one point a bit of interest is added but that then remains static as well till the end. So for the vast majority of the time one just wonders what the next puzzle will look like. \n\nIn conclusion, my criticism is a bit of nitpicking at an extremely high level. I thoroughly enjoyed this game and couldn't recommend it any more to the republic of puzzlers. :)", "timestamp_created": 1509453624, "timestamp_updated": 1509453935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36155143": {"recommendationid": "36155143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262540546", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509414052}, "language": "english", "review": "Really good game.

Many will immediately describe it as a [b][i]Myst[/i][/b]-like game, however, I found it much closer in mechanics to [b][i]The Room[/i][/b] series. The game's puzzles are much less obscure than [b][i]Myst[/i][/b], however, it is closer to the [b][i]Myst[/i][/b] series in the adventure and story aspect compared to [b][i]The Room[/i][/b] series. If you enjoy puzzle and adventure games, [b][i]Quern - Undying Thoughts[/i][/b] should not disappoint.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe audio was one of my favorite parts of this game. The sound track is superbly done and was perfectly crafted for the areas you will experience during the game. I personally wouldn't spend more money to purchase the sound track separately, but that is not an indication the sound track isn't worth while. I simply feel it was well crafted to the experiences of the game and I don't think I would listen to it separately.\n\nThe Voicing for the game was also very well done. The voice actors did a great job in delivering the emotion in their lines which fit the story perfectly. The recording engineer also did a fantastic job capturing the performances which resulted in some of the best narrative quality I've heard in this genre. All in all the voicing is just as superb as the sound track and both serve to draw you into the game's world very effectively.\n\n[h1]Visual[/h1]\n[b][i]Quern - Undying Thoughts[/i][/b] will initially feel very drab in it's visuals. As you make your way around the initial square you will undoubtedly get a sense that there is more wonder just beneath the surface of the dull stone facade. As you progress  through the story you will find increasing beauty and complexity in the areas and puzzles that unfold at a pace that is in lock-step with the narrative.\n\nThe graphics are not amazing or photo-realistic, however, they are well done and look great. There are plenty of scenery objects that clip into each other as a simple means to fill areas with some detail without spending a lot of time on things that aren't a focus area. I thought this was well balanced and it shows with the additional details put into the objects that are interactive. The world seems to have been meticulously built around the narrative and the design team built some interesting and beautiful spaces that really help immerse you in the game and it's puzzles.\n\n[h1]Puzzles[/h1]\nThe complexity and difficulty of the puzzles have a fairly liner progression that adherers to the lore put forth by the story. The problems presented vary in type and function, some of which build upon each other. This reminded me of how [b][i]The Witness[/i][/b] built up several core mechanics and rules that then combined and stacked upon one another, however, [b][i]Quern - Undying Thoughts[/i][/b] does not do this at the same scale. With [b][i]Quern - Undying Thoughts[/i][/b] this feels much more like a progression of a mechanic along a story arc and much less like it is a combination of rules for the sole purpose to increase complexity of the puzzle as it was with  [b][i]The Witness[/i][/b].\n\nThe difficulty of the puzzles I felt was less than any of the [b][i]Myst[/i][/b] series due to the puzzles being less abstract, however, that is not to say there isn't a challenge. Nor does this mean solving them is any less satisfying. In fact I felt the progression and more linear arrangement of the puzzles immersed me further into the storyline. The larger \"milestone\" puzzles have several smaller roadblocks that keep you feeling like you are progressing with little victories as you solve the larger puzzle to progress the story and unlock new things. The pacing will obviously vary depending on you as an individual, however, I felt this was one of the strongest points of the game. There wasn't any point that I felt I wasn't able to progress because I might have missed something earlier. They did a good job making you feel like everything you need to solve a puzzle is available to you.\n\n[h1]Adventure[/h1]\nThe story is well thought out and is similar in concept to that of [b][i]The Room[/i][/b]. The lore is interesting and the narrative feeds this to the player in a fitting mechanic that is rewarding as you progress through the puzzles. It wasn't shocking or all that unpredictable, however, it was very enjoyable. Once you get about 3/4 of the way though its not hard to predict the general concept of the end, however, the details of how that plays out are fun and interesting. There are even a couple nods to a couple of my favorite adventure books/movies which I won't name to prevent spoiling things for you.\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Fairly linear progression to puzzle difficulty and complexity\n    [*]Good challenge while trying not to leverage obscurity as a difficulty mechanic\n    [*]Very well balanced mix of problem solving and story telling\n    [*]Very good audio & visual use to set a compelling mood to envelope the player within the game's lore\n    [*]Good sound track that may be worth picking up if you enjoy listening to VGM outside of games\n    [*]Great voice acting, sound engineering, and sound design\n    [*]Very polished, I didn't experience any glitches or bugs\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Has a couple plot holes that defy logic, however, I didn't find this took away from the game significantly\n    [*]Some people have reported issues running the game with minimum specs, however, this shouldn't be much of an issue as the recommended specs are fairly entry level for a gaming PC\n    [*]The developers missed some opportunities for potentially interesting puzzles or branches in the storyline\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI'd highly recommend [b][i]Quern - Undying Thoughts[/i][/b] to any one who is interested in puzzle or adventure games. Its well worth the price and should provide you with around 10 - 30 hours of a fun and enjoyable story. This game nails the high notes of adventure that made the [b][i]Myst[/i][/b] franchise so great. It could have been a little more challenging, however, the developers did a wonderful job balancing difficulty with the progression of the story.

Nothing is too hard, I got lost not knowing what to do next a couple of times, but that is all part of the fun of the hunt and exploration. What starts out a mysterious and unknown becomes familiar and puzzles which start out perplexing will become mastered by the end of the adventure. Like a lot of games the player is presented with a choice at the end and it is very arbitrary as to which yo choose, which is a shame, but Quern's story is interesting for the most part.\n\nGraphically it is a very nice looking game with the exception of a few textures here and there. The soundtrack is quite muted, which is a shame because there are some good tracks. My biggest gripe with the music is that it doesn't reflect the environment very much and when you move between areas the soundtrack doesn't blend like it should do in this kind of game.\n\nIf you are a fan of first person puzzle games, or even puzzle games in general, I can highly recommend Quern.\n4/5", "timestamp_created": 1509231633, "timestamp_updated": 1509231633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36069826": {"recommendationid": "36069826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030341003", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509180027}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been waiting for a game that could carry the torch of the Myst series from its root games and aesthetics.

The puzzle difficulty is just perfect, and the puzzles are intertwined beautifully. Each breakthrough brings a bit of excitement, as new areas and possibilities unfold, revealing new mysteries and challenges.\n\nThis work is everything Myst could have been, had the technology existed in its time. The setting, themes and story line are original, though clearly inspired by Myst, but you do not have to be a Myst fan to appreciate the quality.\n\nThe developers paid very close attention to little details, and it makes such a difference. The voice acting, lore items, maps and story art are sumptuous, and they have innovated a great new notebook feature that allows you to sketch a screenshot. It is the first time I have seen it in an adventure game, and it's a beautiful idea.\n\nSpeaking as a Myst fan myself, I was thrilled to discover this title.

(more like yes and no)\n\nIs it as good as very good? No\n\nThe game is a little rough around the edges, but works well enough to enjoy.\n\nLinux performance is not good. With my humble GPU and a 6 core CPU everything has to be put to low or off in the quality settings. If you have Windows, there's only one real choice: Don't play in linux!\n\nWindows performance is approx 75% better and can get in between med and high quality with the same hardware.\n\nBut performance in general is just horrible compared to AAA titles with far greater draw distance and detail. Edit: With linux this is how I feel. In Windows with the higher quality settings the game looks better than it did at first. It has grown on me and I kind of like the way it looks now. There are some well done parts later on and some glitchy parts as well.\n\nAnti-aliasing is horrible here. Enabling it removed jagged edges but makes objects highly blurry. Tree detail becomes that of the blind.\n\nThe story is interesting (maybe 1-2 minutes of story in about 2 hours). Is it done in a way that is anywhere near that of Myst? Not even close. Later on the story gains more ground and I found myself quite bored during it because of the way its done - a rather import part and long part of the story was done in a really boring way.\n\nThere's jump ability but plenty of invisible walls. You can't fall off of anything despite having jump ability and so far it feels like they just left it in instead of removing the ability. It has so far only helped to get out of a boat without trying to walk in a different angle. After 20 hours I've seen no real need for jumping excet to get out of glitchy spots where the player gets stuck.\n\nI do like the fact that you can view letters and close them while the voiceover continues.\n\nArrow keys are default bound\n\nIts rather bland looking. Edit: It improves later on after some areas are unlocked and further from there. There are some really nice looking places and its not all rock and overcast sky.\n\nWhat about the puzzles? You start off right away with one. Every door seems to be locked! So you're solving puzzles opening doors to new areas. They are varied and kind of interesting. Some are more like adventure games where you put an object into the holder or whatever and that's the puzzle finding where it goes. Then there's sliding blocks around to get the blocks in a certain place or directing light. And more.\n\nSome puzzles are really annoying. Some are fun. Some puzzles are redone. Some puzzles will make you confused. Some will not be what you wanted but its what you get.\n\nThere's one puzzle where you literally need to use the zoom click of the middle mouse button to read the symbols well. Not terriblly fond of that, but its functional. I'm sure someone will liken it to a magnifying glass in the real world but whatever.\n\nThe inventory ... edits.... Sometime after 2 hours I realized that the scroll wheel allows srolling through a use inventory. So that the object chosen is the one that is used in the world. This is necessary at times when there's multiple objects in the inventory as sometimes multiple objects can be used with the same use point.\n\nThe game can't be completed without using the inventory in everway possible.\n\nEdits... After 20 hours (took 23 hours for me to complete) and seeing how the game changes, being longer than I expected (so many puzzles everywhere, more and more) and the better performance and quality provided by Windows, I still recommend this game and at 20 hours have not completed it yet (and I feel I'm solving every puzzle at a good pace).\n\nIt could be better, it could be worse. Its not Myst but its along that line. Myst has a better told storyline - though its interesting - and it takes some time to like the game more as the first bunch of hours are somewhat lacking but the game has some great moments. After completion, I feel that it has some moments that may even be better than Myst.\n\nSome people may get fed up with some of the puzzles. They even have a puzzle where you need to know something about chess which I found to be rather off and another one that seems out of place. And some parts are annoying because you have a difficult time seeing. So these are some points where it could be better. There's more, but they can be overlooked and dealt with (just annoyances perhaps).", "timestamp_created": 1508901007, "timestamp_updated": 1509401009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550369", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35940195": {"recommendationid": "35940195", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972354609", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490544674}, "language": "english", "review": "For those who wish to relive a game such as Myst or Riven but with visual graphics that are worthy of today's titles.", "timestamp_created": 1508746858, "timestamp_updated": 1508746858, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509575", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35823493": {"recommendationid": "35823493", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015679822", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 742, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506155031}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0442\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \"\u0422\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0430\" \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u043d\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e Witnessa - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0433\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u0430! \u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c!

Each puzzle is also elegantly designed and will have you bursting with glee at every \"ah-ha!\" moment.\n\nOne aspect of the game I did not expect to be drawn into was the plot. Quern is a very unnatural place where its inhabitants don't age or require nourishment, and to them, time outside is frozen. The location sets up many interesting questions about the importance of mortality and the corruptability of man, in addition to being the source of friction between two interesting characters, both steadfast in their beliefs but neither with the clear moral high ground.\n\nThis isn't just a game for Myst lovers. This is a fantastic play for anyone who can appreciate a quiet moment, amidst some very pretty scenery with the waves crashing gently in the background, to get the ol' brain working and figure through some sweet puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1505192205, "timestamp_updated": 1505192277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34876398": {"recommendationid": "34876398", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030497001", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505102893}, "language": "english", "review": "Funded this game through Kickstarter and finally found time to play it.

I finished Quern a few days ago (as an adult and possibly smarter) and must say that I really enjoyed it! However, there are a few issues that takes away from the experience.\n\nThe first two or three hours of this game are great: stunning visuals, great sense of mystery and excellent puzzles. Walking around the strange world of Quern and noting the different puzzles, clues and locked doors is an amazing experience. The puzzles are varied and range from easy to quite difficult. The best puzzles are those that require you to remember something you've seen in another location and combine, alter, or place items in several different locations.\n\nAfter a few hours, you will go from being [spoiler] mostly outside to being mostly inside [/spoiler]. At this point, the game takes a turn for the worse. For some reason, the puzzles go from being varied and very clever to being highly repetitive and almost completely based around [spoiler] mechanical panels [/spoiler]. It feels like ZadBox just ran out of ideas for the puzzles. Some puzzles are so difficult at this point that I end up googling them. They are mostly based around logics or maths, and require you to write down equations. While this is a cool idea, I feel like it's going a bit too far. I don't mind spending a long time solving a puzzle, if it involves walking around the world looking for clues. I just don't enjoy standing around in one place, trying different combinations and writing down sequences (not when you have to do this for every puzzle).\n\nEventually more of the story gets revealed, and it's just not very good. It feels forced and boring. Up until this, my imagination had run wild: where am I? What is this world? What's the backstory? Then I found out and it was just \"meh\". [spoiler] The voice acting of the wisp is quite poor as well. [/spoiler]\n\nI would definately recommend this game, and am looking forward to ZadBox's next game, but hope they have learned a few things from Quern! I would give this game 7/10, but want to acknowledge that it could have been a 10/10 if the puzzles kept the same quality throughout the game and the story wasn't so disappointing.", "timestamp_created": 1501574757, "timestamp_updated": 1501574757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540976", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33916891": {"recommendationid": "33916891", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997354975", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 963, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503071769}, "language": "english", "review": "As someone who loves Myst-like games, Quern is a masterpiece.

The inventory system is a fun addition to puzzle games, and the picture taking with the journal to type in game notes is better than some puzzle game implementations of just taking a picture. This game certainly has a lot going for it.\n\nThings I didnt like:\n\nThere is a line between giving clues and giving solutions, and unfortunately Quern steps over this line frequently. Most puzzles felt less like puzzles and more like \"follow the instructions\". For instance, the code to the first combination lock you come across, maybe 5 minutes into the game, is found on the first 2 notes the professor gives you. No clues or anything, you either brute force the combination or are given the solution. That trend continues throughout the entire game (I could give tons of examples, but don't want the review to be too long), though it does somewhat redeem itself in the latter portion once you lower the tower and access the underground area (more on that later). I also wish the inventory system was utilized more, pretty much all of the things you manipulate in it are keys with moveable parts in order to fit into the key hole. Thats not really a puzzle, its a toddlers \"match the shape\" game.\n\nThe story is also very flat. The notes the professor leaves for you gives you very little story other than \"I discovered a thing and want to share it, and I've decided the best way to do that will be to trap someone here and make them solve puzzles culminating in completing my work because I left it incomplete due to boredom\" (literally all he had to do was wait for a computer to finish a calculation, but that was too big an ask for him). There is also another npc who gives you somewhat of a lore dump later in the game, that can be summarized as \"the discovery is dangerous. Seal it away instead of sharing it\" only done in an over dramatic way. And the end of the game is a let down no matter which advice you chose to follow.\n\nConclusion/Going beyond the thumbs up/down:\n\nI really wish the entire game played like the latter portion underground as a lot of the puzzles there felt like actual puzzles. My favorite is a key with 4 places to put differently shaped segments, only unlike a lot of other keys in the game you don't manipulate it in your inventory. You have to figure out which segment goes where, and instead of spoon feeding you the answer the game simply gives you 2 rules on how to figure it out. Its great stuff! If the underground was its own game, I'd recommend it in a heartbeat.\n\nBut its not its own game. Its stuck on the end of a rather boring \"follow the instructions\" gauntlet of weak game play, and the entire thing is layed on top of a weak story. As a result, I find it hard to recommend the entire game.

Myst is a coherent whole with many interlinking parts.  Quern is a loose narrative delivered in cryptic notes from a meglomanaic.  The puzzles have nothing to do with the narrative, except for the stated \"to delay you\".    I can't see why:  the guy has been gone for 100 years and probably dead by the time You \"complete his mission\".  Why slow you down, if it will benefit everyone?   I never bought into the story he presented.  Gamana, on the other hand, told a compelling story of how absolute power, and its concomitant corruption, destroyed her world.  It took me 27 hours, and using hints, to complete this game.  Without some of the hints, I would never have finished it.  Maybe I'm not the brightest bulb on the string, but I enjoyed Myst, Riven, Uru and got through those without hints.  I complained a lot about Obduction, but even it is more logically put together than Quern.   \n\nNow, having said all that, I will say the game is good looking and sounds good as well.  I understand how difficult it is to produce new sorts of puzzles and tasks to make a game different and enjoyable at the same time.  In that respect, Quern has broken some new ground.  Some of these puzzles are so complicated it sometimes seems impossible to do.  If you like a challenge, though, this is just the game you've been looking for.  Take notes, take lots of \"sketches\", and refer to them often.  Don't leave the game for long periods without playing it:  A lot of the immersive thinking and history fades and it just makes it harder.\n\nI'm giving it a thumbs up for innovative thinking, a good challenge, and nice environmental looks, sounds, and music.", "timestamp_created": 1498519891, "timestamp_updated": 1498519891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580019", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32829048": {"recommendationid": "32829048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169531793", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501180222}, "language": "french", "review": "Une merveille du genre !

I WILL replay it, eventually, and I can only hope that the developers make more of the same. In time, I'm pretty sure they'll hand us a gem that'll remain in our hearts and memories as do the classics. \n\nShould you wish to be transported to a magical land where zen and your mental fortitude are the tools of your survival, then look no further than Quern.

At no time did I feel the solutions were arbitrary or otherwise \"unfair\". My only real complaint about the puzzles is that (with a couple of exceptions) the solutions aren't randomised, so notes from one playthrough will still be valid the next time around.\n\nThe visuals are pleasing, and while the dusty palette may be a bit much at first, there are always at least splashes of colour, and it definitely changes up towards the end. The architectural and mechanical design is excellent, and the mechanisms you interact with have a pleasing clunkiness to them.\n\nThere is one scene that may affect people prone to motion sickness, but it is mercifully brief, not interactive, and does not repeat, so if you are susceptible then merely looking away from the screen for 20-30 seconds will get you through.\n\nIf you like the Myst series or Obduction then this game is for you. Personally I'd rate it as better than any of those individual offerings, the only aspect in which it comes off worse is lore, but then again Myst had a whole series to build its universe.

Quern is a true successor of Cyan's classic MYST series of exploration-driven puzzle games with lush worlds, great music, challenging logic puzzles, and emphasis on learning both sides of a story to draw your own conclusion.\n\nThe premise is that you have been abducted to an ostensibly timeless land somewhere at the end of the world chain by a previous explorer who needs your help to reconnect the world's gates and share its wonders. The explorer himself is long gone, but guides your own exploration through his letters and the locks and obstacles he left behind to teach you about the world, nicknamed Quern. In these travels, you meet a second guide who opposes the explorer's values and asks you to protect the world chain by destroying what she sees as a cursed world. There are subtle logical fallacies with both of the guides' stories, so it's up to your own imagination and judgement to write the ending.\n\nGameplay in Quern was enjoyable; curiosity and tinkering are essential, though there's no reward for parkour. You can get one or two neat views, but all of the actual puzzle hints and tools are in easy reach along the visible paths. The puzzles range from the simplistic (picking up a puzzle piece and fitting it to its hole) through ciphers, recipes, mazes, and sound puzzles  of varying difficulty to the fiendishly difficult (a certain Mastermind-like logic puzzle that resets every seven tries springs to mind). The clues to completion are always at hand, but may require you to revisit old sites or take a step back and review your evidence, then run through possible solutions until one sticks. Keep a scratch pad handy! There's an in-game journal, but paper beats it any day of the week.\n\nThere aren't many downsides to this game. You do have to be a true puzzle lover (as I assume you are if you've read this far) and enjoy a game that will take some solid time and thought. Sadly, you  can't interact with things that aren't directly part of a puzzle, which was probably a great design feature given the volume of puzzles and their complexity, but took some of the joy out of searching for little developer easter eggs. That said, the solutions to a few puzzles will give you a chuckle, and if you're paying attention you'll find a punderful nod to the kickstarter backers. \n\nAt the time I write this, the game is only a few months old, so there are one or two bugs still being worked out, but the developers are extremely supportive and have done a great job.  They've put out a beautiful, multi-tiered and rich story that will give you several evenings of enjoyment. This isn't just another MYST clone.

I am a die hard Myst fan from way back.  I haven't enjoyed an adventure game for well over 7 years.  I have been disappointed with pretty much all the \"adventure\" games I've tried as they are very low level, hidden object style.  I mean they are great games and offer a mindless enjoyment, but sadly not what I was looking for.  I'm old school, I don't like using the in game notes, I prefer to draw my own diagrams and write my own notes.  With Quern I took my time and refused to use a walkthrough.  I can assure you that at times I was tempted but walked away and resisted the urge to do so.  I wrote over 30 pages and drew all the diagrams, I took my time and spent 64 fantastic hours with this game.  When I finally finished it I felt like I had lost a friend.  I had invested so much of my time with Quern and even when I wasn't physically playing, I was thinking about my next step or a possible solution to a puzzle I was stuck on.  I didn't think I would ever find another game that even closely resembled the Myst series but with Quern I found a game that is the best Myst clone I've ever played.  Please make more games like this.  I've tried Obduction and yeah, it's great but it's not the Myst of old.

The final nail in the coffin was when Obduction came out.  It made me wonder if what I felt the first time playing Myst with my 2x cd-rom on soundblaster speakers could ever happen again.  Was I going to experience this same feel only through nostalgia?  Then, I saw Quern on sale.  I decided, eh, why not, nothing to lose.   I have to say, the best 19.5 hrs I've ever felt spent on a game for the past years.  Quern made me realize that all the times playing Myst, it could happen over again.  There are puzzles I'd have to think hard over, and some I'd beat my head on my desk.  But once I figured it out, it was a true inspiration to realize I still had it.  The puzzle-solving I longed for since Myst and Riven lives in Quern.  \n\nNow, I do want to point out two things that I hope the devs might be able to work on if they are thinking of making a sequel.  First off, please give a bit of a break in between puzzles.  I felt that right after solving one puzzle it was within a matter of seconds already moving onto the next.  Try for some vistas or interesting things to view along the way as you're solving these puzzles.  Second, I felt one or two of the puzzles were too hard to figure out only because I had no idea that the game would allow such mechanics.  Maybe have a drawing somewhere in a book or wall that could give the player a hint of what can actually be done. \n\nOther than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the game.  Just a bit of warning, though.

Long story short: I didn't like it. Spoilers ahead.\n\nQuern: Undying Thoughts is truly a hymn to gray mediocrity of Myst-wannabe games. The storyline is shallow and predictable, conveyed through plain uninteresting letters with some voiceover, the puzzles themselves don't even pretend to fit organically into the world, instead, all this busywork with pushing buttons that light another 2 buttons while turning off another button (there is literally more than one puzzle just based on this ancient tedious concept), serves the purpose to test your \"worthiness of knowledge\" by their creator who was a dude on the island before you and who supposedly discovered some Powerful properties of some boring-ass colored crystals. And guess what? Gray crystals are the most powerful, because of course they are. I obviously didn't finish the game, but I can already see what we're dealing here with and I don't expect some great mind blowing revelations down the road. And, frankly, at this point I don't care if there are any.\n\nI also have a problem with the game's performance. My PC gets stable 40+ FPS in games like The Witcher 3, Rainbow Six: Siege, Obduction on medium-high settings and those games have much more graphical fidelity than Quern, while Quern dips into low 30s and less shall I try to enable medium SSAO and AA at the same time. I understand that it's an indie studio, but come on, it doesn't even look that good.\n\nI don't understand people that put Quern into some sort of comparison to Obduction. Obduction is on another level entierly, it actually brings new ideas to the genre, it's gorgeous while being fairly well optimized, it's of a much larger scope and it doesn't just rehash old genre tropes such as beaten to death 2 lights on 1 light off puzzles.\n\nI wouldn't call Quern a bad game, it's a fairly well made Myst clone, not nearly one of the worst, it's just boringly mediocre at everything it tries to achieve. I had no fun playing it and I realized this too late to ask for a refund.\n\nTL;DR: I do not recommend this game. If you're still so curious - play it for an hour and a half. That's the game.

But while Quern is basically Myst + Inventory puzzles, *most* of the inventory puzzles are clever or obvious. I won't say every single puzzle is perfect, because there's about 50 of them, so there's bound to be one or two \"meh\" puzzles here, but they are all fair. \n\nOn difficulty, I'd say this is right between Riven and Exile. I completed no puzzle wondering how the walkthrough figured it out, but I certainly did refer to a walkthrough a few times just to make sure I was on the right track. \n\nI would recommend this game without reservation to fans of Myst.

This game is better than Myst 1 and it's A LOT better than Myst 5. Quern makes great use of modern technology to enhance the Myst-Genre experience. \n\nQuern is a lot longer than I expected, I got 14 hours of gameplay before the credits without a moment a boredom and I'm going to go back for more. For such a small environment it's amazing how rarely the game feels repetitive, there are many things to do just for fun and curiosity. I always had a growing list of things to try in my mind and I'm looking forward to getting into exhausting every little permutation on my second playthrough.\n\nPuzzles:  9/10\nI expect Quern will be a trendsetter for this genre in the years to come, the inventory system and the way it interacts with the environment adds an extra dimension to puzzles that I haven't seen before.\nThe puzzles feel as though they are designed to be solved, their structure and difficulty are such that you feel you are growing as the game progresses, some games have puzzles that feel as though their purpose is to stop you dead, all the puzzles in this game feel as though they are designed to educate and enlighten you.\nWhile not as difficult as The Talos Principle, the puzzles in Quern feel organic to the world, as though you are learning to use tools and machines built for everyday use rather that unusual puzzle rooms like The Talos Principle and Portal. More like Myst III: Exile than anything else I can think of, but in Exile you feel like a student or a prisoner, Quern makes you feel like an archaeologist or explorer.\n+REUSABLE PUZZLE MECHANICS!!\n\nStory, Characters and Lore: 7/10\nFor a standalone game Quern has a beautifully deep and well explored Lore that all the puzzles are built around, the story is an exploration of this told through very well voiced monologues. There are very few characters with very little character development or backstory so I can't give a very high rating here but I wouldn't change a thing about this game, it's rare that a game will give you a chance to be alone with your thoughts and emersed in the environment, Quern feels perfect from start to finish.\n\nSound Design: 8/10\nImmersive and Relaxing\n\nControls and UI: 7/10\nIt controls like a typical first person shooter but with the option to temporarily decouple the mouse and camera, allowing you to stand at a workstation and interact with all the levers and buttons without dragging the camera around with you, not a new concept for the genre but a necessity. The UI could do with a little polishing, I'd frequently turn a wheel in the wrong direction or think a lever is inactive because I wouldn't be gripping long enough. I think a toggle grip would improve the UI as would the ability to pick something up without shifting the inventory.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nI was disappointed with the perfomance I got on low and high quality graphics settings, I wasn't expecting photo-realism on high settings but I've managed to get more FPS out of much better looking games, this issue didn't effect my immersion and I loved the beautiful lighting effects.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10\nQuern fills a serious gap in the market for me, the puzzles, their mechanics and their integration into the narative is exceptionally good and could only be improved with a little more difficulty. Series I once thought of as puzzle series like Tomb Raider have become so simplistic and easy these days, and to make it worse they give immersion breaking hints through the HUD.

La musique accompagne parfaitement le p\u00e9riple.\nJe pourrais continuer longtemps \u00e0 lister tout ce qui fait de Quern un si bon jeu mais je pense que si vous \u00eates encore en train de lire cet avis au lieu d'y jouer, soit je suis un mauvais vendeur, soit vous \u00eates atteint(e) de folie.\n\u00c0 noter pour les non anglophones que le jeu est disponible en fran\u00e7ais si vous ne l'aviez pas vu.\n\nAu niveau des d\u00e9fauts :\n[list][*]J'ai eu quelques soucis techniques avec une utilisation cons\u00e9quente de la RAM (mais je suis le seul ayant ce soucis pour l'heure). Un peu trop, si bien que \u00e7a a men\u00e9 \u00e0 3/4 crashs.

Me concernant, s'il y avait une mise en \u00e9vidence \u00e0 faire, se serait surtout sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qu'on peut ramasser, plus que sur tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments interactifs (histoire de laisser un minimum de recherche).

It's buggy, the UI is bad, the writing is bland and the puzzles are mediocre.\n\nSo the good:\nThe sound design and music stand out.\nThe game looks pretty good for a Kickstarter title.\nThe voice actors are quite good, I enjoyed listening to Maythorn speak.\nThere is some visual storytelling going on in the game that was interesting to see.\nManipulating objects in your inventory is novel.\nThe environments are nice.\n\nNow the bad:\n\nThe worst is the game's stability.

The \"Ah-Ha!\" moments are few, the puzzles themselves feel more like busywork than anything else (Especially the puzzle in the Library and all the Alchemy puzzles). There's a few times when there is absolutely no indication on what you need to do next beside wandering around aimlessly.\n\nThe story is trite beyond measure. It is yet another rehash of \"The power will consume you\" storyline while providing poor evidence of it within the game.\nI'm willing to forgive a cliche plot for characters, but there's no reason to like or hate the characters because they're so bland.

The other is a generic [spoiler]energy being[/spoiler] who is only interested in a \"balance\" and keeping people out of Quern because she sucked at her job.\nWhat little is explained in the world is not explained well.

There are some great, inventive puzzles that challenge (especially enjoyed the green crystal bits) and the best part is that they are completely fair. I did not need a walkthrough at any point. There is an inventory system, but the items are not used in obtuse ways (like, say, using an elephant tusk to remove an electrical panel a la The Dig). The puzzles are not always easy--there are head scratchers--but they do vary in scope and difficulty, and can be satisfying to solve, which is the hallmark of a good adventure title.\n\nReception has been mostly positive, but sober your decision to purchase this title with the knowledge this game was developed by a team of four. You will spend 3/4 of the game in the same small, drab brown area going back and forth, and back and forth. The environment gets a little more interesting past that. While there are nice puzzles, they often feel stitched together without logical justification, which doesnt help sell the world. The story is paper thin, and will do little to motivate you. Sound design is mostly good, but the soundtrack is forgetable, even grating at times (I played with the music turned off). The graphics are compentent, but generic in many spots.\n\nIf you like adventure games *and* are conscious of all the shortcomings, then I would say give Quern a chance.

Did you enjoy complex puzzles that require you to sit down and take time to process what the hell is going on with these weird characters and chemicals in front of you? Do you enjoy having a pen and notebook nearby to scribble down notes and clues? If you answered yes to any of these, buy this now. There have been many indie devs who attempt to capture the unique feeling of Myst, but few have ever managed to capture it on the dot like Quern has. \n\nThe puzzles and the logic behind them require a vast amount of processing. They will have you writing down things, expirementing like a child seeing something for the first time trying to figure out how things work. These aren't a bunch of random hard puzzles thrown together in a hastly manner. These puzzles took time and effort and affect the entire world around you each time you beat a puzzle is one of the most gratifying sensations I have had in gaming for quite some time. That feeling of being watched all the time is also in the game, which makes the game feel almost spooky, without actually feeling spooky.\n\nThe graphics & visuals are striking and unique in a very good way. Many developers have tried to make a unique looking world but end up with stereotypes that just make the world feel bland. In this game, the world feels very unique, buildings have a never before seen look to them, while throwing in some buildings that give it a Myst/Riven feel. The look and feel of the world just feels perfect yet unsettling all at the same time. I would personally recommend this higher than Obduction (Cyan studios new game), it feels like the original 2 games in the Cyan series, but managed to do it in such a unique way. It honestly feels like playing something Cyan Studios made back in 1998, but with a real game engine. This is a great game and should be ranked one of the highest in the puzzle solving genre. I am curious to follow the developers for their next enteries. \n\nJust a warning, for those of us who have issues with Audio Tones, there is a puzzle that requires this in game.", "timestamp_created": 1488075615, "timestamp_updated": 1488075615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.747725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30132890": {"recommendationid": "30132890", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155451414", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495305261}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that truly makes you think about each move you make, each step you take and each puzzle you solve, this is it.

It\u2019s basically an updated version of the old game. The artwork, puzzles, and music is all VERY similar. That, however, is not a criticism in the least bit. While the puzzles are not so integrated into the story as in the games that inspired it, they are more than delightful enough to work your way through. Some of the set pieces are stunning and even surprising. For an independently produced video game, the creators really made a huge effort to impress and they do.\n\nThe game play is very simple, but not without quirks and even a few bugs. You can take notes but the resolution is low and they are not really much help. Pen and paper will be needed. I got stuck at one point and contacted the developer and they were great in helping me. Yes, it was a bug and when it couldn\u2019t be fixed immediately they sent me a file taking place just after the puzzle needing to be solved so I could continue. We are talking only several hours before I was back to the game again.\n\nSpeaking of puzzles, I like solving them to a certain degree but after a time a few get tiresome and I just look at a walk through to get past them. Same thing is there are millions of steps, and Quern does have several puzzles that require far too much back and forth for my tastes. I play these things to relax, not get aggravated and frustrated so I feel perfectly justified in \u00ab cheating \u00bb when it keeps me from getting angry at the game.\n\nThe story is bare bones, typical puzzle adventure game stuff. Well thought out - but not eye opening or too surprising. Like the game it pays homage to, there is a choice to make at the end but unlike that game, the choice does not really change the ultimate outcome. That\u2019s about all I can say without being too spoiler-y. I did hit a small bug at the end that made me think I had really screwed myself, but it cleared up. (A door that was open was closed but turning around and going back it was suddenly open again.)\n\nPros:\nGreat artwork, music, structure, support\n\nCons:\na couple bugs, no built in hints (which I think are essential for this sort of game) a weak ending.\n\n* I would also liked to have the chance to just walk around the environment, like the old Cyan games did after finishing the story and be able to discover little hidden places and extras that don\u2019t affect the game in any way.

There have been plenty of pop-up studios that tried to copy Myst\u2019s formula, since on the surface, it seems like it should be pretty easy to make that kind of game. What they end up producing are glitchy pixel-hunters whose puzzles have the logic of a concussed, rabid badger, and stories that would embarrass grade-schoolers. And we\u2019ve all probably been burnt by one of these offerings, sooner or later.\n\nQuern \u2013 Undying Thoughts is not one of those games. On the contrary, this is probably the best puzzle game to appear in perhaps a decade, and it easily ranks among top-tier classics such as Myst and Riven. It gave me almost everything I\u2019ve been desperate for in a puzzle game since the genre faded to a niche.\n\nI have to start out by noting that, from a simple gameplay standpoint, it runs and looks fantastic. This is a modern, fully-navigable, three-dimensional world, and it feels perfectly seamless. For a debut release of a small developer team, the assembly of this world shows astounding game development mastery. I would swear that this game was built by a team maybe three times as large with decades of titles under their belts. Bravo!\n\nThe story, I will rate as \u201cabove average.\u201d It is leaps and bounds beyond some of the slapshod efforts I\u2019ve seen put together to try to justify a puzzle game\u2019s existence, and even taken by itself, it\u2019s satisfactory. It\u2019s aware of what it is and the job it has to do. This makes it a little obvious that it was crafted to justify the world it\u2019s set in, but it does it very cleverly. There are sprinklings of science fiction and high fantasy both, just enough to give you an idea of what this world is and a larger universe it belongs in (the latter of which was something Myst and Riven never quite accomplished gracefully). There\u2019s even a touch of philosophy.\n\n(Very mild spoilers in discussing the end) [spoiler]There are multiple endings, yet I actually feel you can choose any ending in accordance with how you feel the game has guided you. There\u2019s not really a heavy-handed moral judgment of one ending over another. I at least don\u2019t believe there\u2019s the infamous \u201cbad\u201d ending at all. Whether the subtlety of that was intentional or not, I loved it.[/spoiler]\n\nThe music is excellent. I won\u2019t deny, I own the soundtracks for Myst, Riven, and Scratches, another excellent gem from the days of point-and-click. The ambient masterpieces Robyn Miller and Cellar of Rats composed for those games remain without equal. So it\u2019s probably wise that the music in this game doesn\u2019t really sound like anything Robyn Miller wrote. It\u2019s distinctive, provides great atmosphere, and while it was slightly intrusive on the more lively tracks, I really do mean only slightly. Music, to me, makes or breaks these games, and Quern succeeded here as well.\n\nYet where Quern truly shines is its puzzles. That\u2019s what we\u2019re really here for, isn\u2019t it? And this game is worth buying just to study these puzzles alone. This, I assert, is how puzzle games should be done. I don\u2019t know how the developers composed such perfect puzzles in a debut release, but the experience and devotion they brought shines through like the sun.\n\nIn most puzzle games, the player is presented with a puzzle. It can be anything, and it can be built well or not. But once it\u2019s solved, it\u2019s over. The player leaves the area, and the object or room is never important again. Top-tier puzzle games like Riven\u2014and Quern\u2014build incredible, layered complexity into everything they use. It\u2019s how they put such incredible experiences into such small spaces. Quern\u2019s puzzles start simple, and environmental clues will guide players into solving more and more complex riddles, training them what to watch for and how to even anticipate the game. Then, the player will find a new item, and suddenly that same room, that same tool, will do something entirely different. There were rooms in the game that were visited again and again because a new item unlocked a new level of complexity and used the room in an entirely different way. When puzzles guide players and build this complexity, it gives players a satisfaction in success unlike almost anything else, and Quern does it with astonishing perfection.\n\nThis was actually an issue I had with Obduction. Yes, the game that was the modern brainchild of the makers of Myst itself, and their reintroduction to modern games. It\u2019s hard to know what went wrong, but the puzzles in Obduction were almost always absurdly simplistic, fixated on finding a hidden key to get behind a door or spinning a room until a hall lined up. Yes, getting into new rooms is kind of what all puzzle games are about, but the good ones like Quern, Riven, and Scratches obfuscate it behind story and a variety of puzzles beyond finding a key or code written down somewhere. Quern has puzzles involving light, mechanics, math, sound, logic, language, music, to name just the ones I can remember. The variety is unbelievable, and it\u2019s what made every step of this game feel like discovery from beginning to end.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to guess how satisfying the difficulty will be for everyone. I was able to get through in about 15 hours. Others report 25, some as low as 8. In any event, though, for the current price of $25? Worth every cent. This game would have been a must-own back in the heyday of adventure games, and it\u2019s a steal at that price right now.\n\nIt\u2019s earned my highest recommendation, and I have the utmost hope that the development team will make a few more of these marvels.

Laggy performance is usually caused by one of few reasons:\n\n1; You resolution is set too high. On Macs with retina display the native resolution of the game is QHD, and we strongly advise against running the game on a resolution that high, unless you have one of the new nvidia gtx 10 series cards.\n\n2; your computer might not have a dedicated GPU, only an intel iris card. These cards do not have the capacity to run Quern with good performance.\n\n3; your computer has a dedicated card, but it does not meet the set system requirements: NVIDIA GTX 650 2GB or AMD HD7770 2GB\n\n4; your computer has a dedicated GPU, but Quern is not using it. To make sure Quern is using your dedicated GPU; Try disabling automatic gpu switching (Apple menu > System Preferences and click Energy Saver.

If you want the summery skip to the last paragraph.\n\nThe first issue I had was the [u]Inventory System[/u]. \nWhen you add an inventory system to the game you need to make it clear which item can be used where, and what item can be picked up, they've done that for the most part but I still found myself trying to pick up everything that seems useful but ending up with some random objects that had nothing to do with the current puzzle I was on. It probably stand out to me because most puzzle games of this kind don't use inventory, and for that exact reason.\n\nThe notebook was nice at first, but it doesn't remember which page you left it on and has a two seconds animation every time you want to take a look, it makes me want to use pen and paper instead, which to me means it failed as a feature.\n\nThe story is acceptable, but the charcter feel fairly flat and unrealistic, there is no living curters on the island, and very soon you get the idea of who is the \"bad guy\" and \"the good guy\", nothing really inspering or worth remembering.\n\nThe final and biggest problem was the [u]Puzzle Design[/u].\nFor  an overworld full of puzzles the game is extremely linear, you have to solve every puzzle in order so it unlocks the next one. So if you get stuck in a puzzle; tough luck! you may as well just quit the game because there is abselutly nothing you can do but stare at the screen until you notice that item you didn't see or that lever that disappear when you default the puzzle, or that fuarmula you could notice only with blue light, or that item that didn't look like it can be picked up, or that place for a torch that was usefull 20 puzzles ago... You get the idea. \n\nThis wouldn't be so annoying if there was a hint system or an acceptable walkthough, but there isn't!, the only walkthough the develepors offers is in the form of videos with no commentry or text, while you skip to the puzzle you're stuck on good luck avoiding spoilers. You only  get to an unexplained solution and continue playing until the next time you're stuck.\n\nThe linear design, the annoyance with the inventory and walkthourghs, the oversights with the notebooks...I tried to enjoy the game, but most of my time I was just getting annoyed.

So wanted more puzzling and noted the reviews of Quern and I can only add to their positivity of this game.\n\nIts fairly linear but at the start there is a bewildering array of things to see and manipulate.  Some puzzles are devious, but what elevates this game from good to great is everything is in plain sight.  There is nothing hidden, no tiny dust covered key to discover, no very slightly different lamp you have to twist, if you cant progress its because you've not throught through what you need to do with what you have in front of you.  \n\nIt doesn't hold your hand directly but clues are everywhere if you know what you are looking at. \n\nMy only gripe was that the difficulty of puzzles (for me) varied somewhat wildly.  Occasionally a puzzle was so trivial it served practically no purpose other than to delay moving to the next.  Others had me stumped for ages.

There is an interesting story, some really ingenious puzzles that are fun to solve (and they fit into the story), the graphics are beautiful, the music haunting, and most of all, there is a lot to explore in a seemingly small space.  Like ROOM, the world of Quern unfolds into more and more levels as you solve puzzles, but you get there by just opening doors rather than using the Myst artifice of book linking.  A very nice touch that puzzles are re-used.  There are also a couple of endings to choose from.  All in all a solid effort and a fantastic contribution to the genre.  I will now be seeking Quern eqiuvalents!\n\nMost of the puzzles can be figured out with some decent thought - it is nice being able to think \"what would I really do in this situation\" and have that work.  There are a few times I found myself a bit stumped about what next to do, and typically all I needed to do was visit everywhere I'd been, and think about what I had on hand in inventory and how it might be used, or things I had seen previously that seemed to have no immediate purpose.  Everything has a purpose.\n\nMy toughest times were figuring out where to aim the lighthouse light and with which crystal,  the inverse of the puzzle with the concentric circle segments, and figuring out how to get to the second story of the lab - I did need to get help a few times - but once I got underground below the tower I sailed on through without any issues.\n\nThis was fun in the purest exploration/puzzle adventure sense.

Ich habe die Videos gesehen, einiges interessantes gelesen und konnte es nicht abwarten. Zwischendurch kam dann Obduction von Cyan raus - welches ich auch sehr gut fand, und dann endlich war Quern dran.\n\nIch habe Quern direkt in den ersten Minuten nach dem Release gekauft und war von Anfang anbegeistert... Und jetzt, wo ich es nach 13 Stunden Spielzeit durch habe, bin ich einfach nur hin und weg :)\n\nWas sind die Punkte, die mich am meisten begeistert haben?\n- Story: die Story ist spannend, l\u00e4uft durch das ganze Spiel - zuweilen ist man hin und hergerissen, versucht seinen eigenen Schl\u00fcsse zu ziehen und wird zum Ende hin gnadenlos vor die Wahl gestellt. Was bei Obduction von Cyan zu komplex war, ist bei Quern relativ simpel gestrickt. Aber es reicht - es braucht nicht mehr. Wenn man Myst oder Riven als Vorbild nimmt, kommt das der Einfachheit der Quern-Story am N\u00e4chsten. Und Riven ist eins der besten Puzzle-Spiele \u00fcberhaupt. Oder doch Quern?\n\n- Puzzles: von heutigen Puzzle-Spielen ist man sich oft gewohnt, dass die L\u00f6sung relativ simpel ist, nahe gelegen ist und z.B. auch keine Backtracks (zur\u00fcckgehen an fr\u00fcher gefunden Orte und R\u00e4tsel) ben\u00f6tigt. Aber nicht bei Quern... die R\u00e4tsel sind knackig und werden schwieriger. Aber: in vielen F\u00e4llen sind sie fair (obwohl auch ich 2-3 Hints ben\u00f6tigt habe). Das Sch\u00f6ne ist: einige R\u00e4tse-Teile laufen wie ein rotes Band durch das ganze Spiel und kommen immer wieder vor, andere werden pl\u00f6tzlich ganz anders wieder genutzt. Und manchmal muss man sogar um 3 Ecken denken, um \u00fcberhaupt auf die Idee zu kommen, was der n\u00e4chste Schritt ist. Man hat wirklich genug zu r\u00e4tseln ;)\n\n- Grafik und Sound: schon von Anfang an, war Quern ein \"Wow\"-Effekt. Sehr sch\u00f6n gestaltet, bis in die Details. Nach 2-3 Stunden ist dann vielleicht ein \"jo, die Insel sieht halt \u00fcberall gleich aus und aufm Meer ist es eh grau\" aufgekommen. Aber lasst euch nur soviel sagen: \"auf\" der Insel ist nur ein Teil... und die anderen sind grafisch teilweise sogar noch toller. Man hat genug zu sehen - und zu h\u00f6ren! Akkustisch, sowohl Ger\u00e4usche wie auch Musik, ist das Spiel beeindruckend. Die Musik hat \u00fcberall sehr gut gepasst und man hat sich manchmal einfach darauf gefreut, ein St\u00fcck wieder zu h\u00f6ren, wenn man an der entsprechenden Stelle vorbeikam.\n\n- Interface: ein sehr grosses Lob geht meines Erachtens hier an das wirklich sehr gut gestaltete Inventarsystem bzw. die Benutzung der Gegenst\u00e4nde. Die Idee, mit dem Scrollrad ein Inventar-Teil direkt ausw\u00e4hlen zu k\u00f6nnen ist schon ziemlich genial :) Einziges kleines Manko hier: die Objekte k\u00f6nnen zwar um die eigene Achse gedreht werden, aber nicht nach oben/unten. So kommt es bei ganz wenigen Gegenst\u00e4nden dazu, dass man deren funktion nicht sofort erkennt. Aber das ist ein Meckern auf sehr hohem Niveau :)\n\n\nMein Spielen habe ich auch in einer Playlist auf Youtube festgehalten (Videos sind noch nicht bis ans Ende vorhanden, da ich diese St\u00fcckweise online stelle).

It\u2019s not too large and every area is very memorable, which is great because you\u2019ll have to travel to each area of the island several times during the game.\n\nThe puzzles actually make sense! Unlike so many poorly designed puzzle games, you will never need a walkthrough so long as you\u2019re willing to chew on the puzzles long enough.

This by itself isn\u2019t a problem, but what ends up happening a lot is when you enter a new room you\u2019ll see a whole bunch of buttons and levers and machines that look like a lot of fun to mess with, but you\u2019ll promptly be disappointed since you\u2019ll have to go somewhere else to actually turn on the machines before you get to play with them. Sometimes this takes so long that you\u2019ll have forgotten about them by the time they are ready for you to play with.

It clearly visible that these original games were an inspiration for this game.\n\nThe puzzles were pretty hard, just like in the original myst games, and might even get frustrating sometimes if you're not used to those. However, I do think that being able to solve these puzzles is a huge satisfaction and it feels so much better than if the puzzles were easier. Something I also loved was the fact that puzzles/ideas can be reused, which I thought was quite an experience.\n\nQuern is also a longer game than you might think after a few minutes and even hours. At one point I thought that the game was almost done, having done most of the puzzles in the area, but than a new section opened up full with more puzzles.\n\nIf you can handle the game on high settings it is a stunning piece of work, even on the lowest it looks pretty impresive. However, that is if you can. Quern is pretty heavy on your computer and mine could just handle it as its lowest settings. This is something you should keep in mind. If your computer can handle the graphical demands then don't buy it. The lag will pretty much ruin the experience of exploring and puzzles in which you have to move something.\n\nSome of the other reviews mentioned a very linear story and I have to agree that that is true. The game really wants you to solve most of the puzzles in a particular order. However, I do not think this is really a bad thing., but might make you backtrack a few times to find old puzzles that you couldn't do and have to remember where they were. It's not that bad, but if you really don't like a mostly linear game, then this might not be the game for you.\n\nWhat as the biggest letdown for me was actually the conclusion of the story. The voice over work was pretty good and nice to listen to. I found the story not the most amazing story, but still a pleasure to unravel. The story was building up to the end, but I thought didn't conclude the story well. Both the endings weren't really satisfying and left to guess if what you did was any good at all with both of them.\n\nOveral I still do recommend this game if you are a fan of the original myst and would like to play some myst-like games.

There aren't any bugged puzzles, the game's internal logic makes sense most of the time, the environments look good.\n\nMore than half of the puzzles are some variation on carrying a key to a lock, or entering a code on a pad. Most of the rest are also pretty stale, you do pipe puzzles and lights out puzzles, you follow recipes. There are also a handful of puzzles where you rotate things two at a time and try to line them up, which I found a little more interesting.\n\nYou have to trek back and forth across the island a bunch of times over the course of the game, which gives the appearance of a more open game, like Obduction or The Witness, but Quern is very, very linear. There's usually only one puzzle at a time that you're equipped to complete. Occasionally you're given two that you can do in either order before progressing, and sometimes you're allowed to fiddle with something later on the path that is missing some part or needs a code you'll be given later on.\n\nThe story's not great at the start of the game, but it stays out of your way. The pages you pick up don't stop you moving or interacting with the world, you can skip the audio if you want to. In the second half of the game, you are frequently interrupted by a green particle effect that locks your camera to face it and then bobs around for minutes explaining the game's still-not-great backstory at great length. These are unskippable, and very annoying.\n\nArtistically it's almost really good, but it's let down by a few small things. There are serious problems with shadow flickering (probably caused by the pixel light limit, if I had to guess,) and the post-processing's too much for my taste. The above-water parts of the island are almost greyscale, with bloom so intense that the whole sky turns white if you look anywhere near the sun. There's places where the end of the draw distance is visible even with it set to max. All of this could be fixed if the graphics settings were a little better, probably, but as-is you're stuck with them. \n\nIt's a shame because the developers hearts are clearly in the right place. They set out to make a Myst-style adventure with a very small team, and in many important respects they pretty much did it. It's a huge accomplishment.

While I appreciate the game having launch-day Mac support, it was buggy to the point that it would not load (the discussion board has at least two other reports of the same issue with no given solution). Two of my playtime hours were trying to get it to load. The solution was Boot Camp with Windows 7, and while it did run, it was still pretty buggy. It crashed at least once if not twice per playing session once I got into the latter half of the game (there's a point where the game loads again on its own, this is when the issue started). It also ran my fan pretty hard and I couldn't get the game to run in anything more than super low res and settings, so sadly I didn't get to see the full graphic experience.\n\nBut with the technical issues aside, I truly loved the game. It was leagues above Obduction (which I loved, but it fell flat three quarters through) and felt like the game I've looked for since Myst III: Exile years ago. The puzzles were clever but not obnoxious (except for one puzzle about three quarters through that I just could not get my mind wrapped around, but that could've easily been me) and well placed. I've played games where there are puzzles for the sake of puzzles and that wasn't the case here. Everything was for the sake of the story, and I truly enjoyed that. It was very much in the vein of Myst in that it didn't hold my hand. I could've used a couple of more hints here and there, but again, I think that's just me. I adored the story, and loved the character story and how it was delivered.\n\nThe only complaint I have about the story is the ending. I know it was supposed to be open-ended, but it felt too loose for me. I'm someone who likes to have closure, and it felt like an \"oh well that was it\" thing instead. It wasn't unsatisfactory, but I would've liked more of a conclusion. I'm sure that's a personal preference, though.\n\nOn a technical note, there were some places where I'd get stuck on the terrain or where the dialogue didn't match the subtitles.

You're on your own, so this will test your noggin' for sure.\n\nIf you're looking for a hidden gem, I highly recommend Quern.", "timestamp_created": 1481588184, "timestamp_updated": 1481588184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28319986": {"recommendationid": "28319986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040533365", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 760, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481504220}, "language": "english", "review": "This has to be one of the best damn puzzle games I have played in a while.", "timestamp_created": 1481505721, "timestamp_updated": 1481505721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504981", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28313406": {"recommendationid": "28313406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009919818", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481474935}, "language": "english", "review": "The Good:\n\nTrapped in a magical world by a hidden antagonist who communicates through messages left on pages of a book? Researching the secrets of a lost civilisation, learning their writing and numbering system and solving puzzles involving rotating stone discs and balls? Spinning brass generators, balancing scales, bizarre alchemical equipment and pencil sketches of clues, positioning lens to focus the sun?  Any of this sound familiar? \n\nIf you liked the Myst series you will like Quern. It looks and feels identical.  The setting, aesthetic, story and puzzle types are exactly the same. Right down to the U\u2019nnec\u2019essar\u2019y apostrophes in the names of everything from the ancient c\u2019Ivili\u2019sation (not the D\u2019ni, but it might as well be).  \n\nQuern is undoubtedly easier than any of the Myst games and is also a lot uglier. However, the puzzles are good and I\u2019m glad I backed it. Nobody said Kickstarter was meant to encourage originality! It\u2019s a solid game if a bit rough around the edges, it was realised on time in a reasonably polished condition. With the following caveats I would recommend it to anyone who likes Myst\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s a game \u201cinspired by Myst\u201d in the same way as Concordski was inspired by Concord.\n\nThe Bad\n\nApart from the total lack of originality in any aspect of this game, my only complaint is that I didn\u2019t always manage to entirely suspend disbelief. It has all the classic puzzle-game tropes used to funnel you through in the right order, one area at a time. For example: the world is full of complex, powered machinery from a long-abandoned civilisation which inexplicably all still works perfectly (including the first button you press which moves a good two-ton block of stone aside to let you pass) and yet a couple of missing rungs in a rope ladder not half a meter above the ground renders the area impassable. Of course all doors can only be opened from one side by a lever (which is a fire evacuation hazard). Which lever, although within easy reach through the sparse iron grating, remains stubbornly locked until you approach it from the correct direction. \n\nA cool idea, badly executed, is the sketchbook. In the game you can press P to draw a pencil screenshot. It\u2019s all very artistic but I can already press F12 to take a Steam screenshot. So I have the choice between taking a really blurry artistic image which necessarily overlays the puzzle it relates to when I open it, or a clear image which I can keep open on my second monitor. The sketching also somewhat spoils the impression I had of an artist drawing all these things, rather than the game just applying a Photoshop filter to them. I liked it in Obduction that they used a camera. \n\nQuern has another classic puzzle game problem : that of making lots of pretty background objects which can\u2019t be interacted with but which would be very helpful for the puzzle if only they were more than just scenery. These things therefore serve first to annoy and then to distract from real objects camouflaged amongst them. For example: I\u2019m in a crystal laboratory and there is crystal testing equipment with lots of generator paddles and electrodes expecting to receive a crystal, and the room is full of likely looking crystals, but they are all background crystals which I can\u2019t use. There _is_ a change of icon between usable and unusable objects but really this should be clearer. \n\nFinally the game is fairly empty of scenery in places. Except for logs. There are lots of logs. I can imagine the designers making a second pass of the rooms and thinking \u201cthis looks empty\u201d\u2026 \u201cwhat to do\u2026?\u201d \u201cI know, more logs!\u201d What are the logs even for? I haven\u2019t seen a fireplace yet and everything is powered by crystals anyway. \nAnd finally: it\u2019s a still a bit buggy. I got caught in the clippings a few times, but it\u2019s easy to load a save to get free and this is a very early release so I expect that will get sorted quickly.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nThis game is superficially quite pretty. However it doesn\u2019t take long to realise it\u2019s lightyears behind any of the Myst series (except perhaps the first one but that was released in 1778 so it\u2019s not really comparable). \n\nThe water animation is\u2026 really not good (to put it politely). I know moving water is difficult but this is 1990s Tomb Raider bad. \n\nA lot of the other graphics are a bit ropey. For example the rope. If you look at the texture of rope it frequently passes through the things it is meant to be binding. \n\nAnd whilst I think of it, all the chopped trees have exactly the same \u201csplits and cracks\u201d texture on their exposed ends, where they are supposed to have been cut. And they are cut very cleanly cut too, as if by an industrial logger. Which has no place in this world. I hope. I haven\u2019t finished the game yet. \n\nThe draw distance is bad. I don\u2019t know if this can be changed, but by default I\u2019m moving faster than the graphics are rendering. \n\nIn terms of graphics I would place this somewhere straight after Riven in the Myst series, when they just started to go with free movement rather than zipping from still to still.", "timestamp_created": 1481477211, "timestamp_updated": 1481568344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28308031": {"recommendationid": "28308031", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993761343", "num_games_owned": 1979, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502671222}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm not much for giving in-depth reviews, so I won't go into details, but I have to say something about Quern.

Many are similar, but very few hit that particular tone and feeling.  Quern definitely fits that ever-growing Myst-shaped hole in my soul.  \n\nA great but somewhat subtle detail is that as you progress through the game, the puzzle elements and invironments you interact with become more and more technologically advanced, which nicely parallels and illustrates the growth and experience of the mysterious Professor you learn more about along the way.\n\nAnother amazing element to this game is the way new challenges you encounter continue to use previously solved puzzles, locations, and items in a way that makes everything feel more connected and relevant, rather than simply being a bunch of isolated puzzles.\n\nI would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves puzzle-based adventure games.\n\nIn case you'd like to see my playthrough of the game, this link is a good place to start:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdmm5UWA-t0", "timestamp_created": 1481457574, "timestamp_updated": 1481508108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28299942": {"recommendationid": "28299942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028004126", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481471221}, "language": "english", "review": "I was skeptical at first.\n\nAnd I was wrong.\n\nI can say, without hubris or exaggeration, that this is one of the finest games I have ever played in my 30+ years of gaming.

When Obduction came out, I bought it instantly and played for days whenever I could.  And while I was happy with the game, it was lacking.  Cyan reached to far with the story line- so many different species and things going on that the solid core of the story seemed much weaker than the intrigue genereated in Myst / Riven.  \n\nNow we come to Quern.  I've been thinking long while playing how to best describe this game, and all I cacn think of is \"Amazing\".  I can't speak to the intentions of the developers at Zadbox, but what they have created here is a masterpiece in the grand tradition of Myst-likes.  This is what Obduction SHOULD have been.  Lets break it down as best I can without giving up to many of the secrets- this is a game of exploration after all.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe story moves you through a mysterious island world seemingly frozen in time.  The islands previous resident, a 'professor', has brought you here to learn about his work and the secrets this world hold; as well as to help him complete an experiment of unknown scope.\nWe learn the story of Quern in pieces via notes scattered throughout the world. Fantastically rich and well written, and the voice acting is just outstanding- really helps set the atmosphere and progress the story in a meaningful way.\n\n[h1]Puzzles[/h1]\nThe thing that made Myst, and later Riven so unbelieveably successful was the thoughtfulness and integration of its puzzles.  in this type of game, having a puzzle exist for no reason other than to have a puzzle is game-killing. \nQuern takes that page from Cyans old playbook, distills it, and creates puzzles so well integrated into the story, landscape, and lore of the world, that they're challenging to even find.\n\nI've had so many \"I know EXACTLY how to solve that puzzle... I just can't figure out how to GET TO that puzzle!\" moments I've lost count.\n\nAnd the puzzles themselves, once found, play perfectly off the lore of the world, and are so well designed that they act almost as story-progression devices all by themselves.\n\n[h1]The Atmoshpere[/h1]\nAnd i find myself apologizing to the devlopers-so many comparisons to Cyan when their game is just as noteworthy.  But hell, if you're a fan of Riven, you know how the music, the story, and the graphical design play off each other to create a world that feels almost real.  This game blows them out of the water.  Zadbox has really perfected that art of immersion and brought it all into the world of Quern.\n\n\n[h1]conclusion[/h1]\nI rarely write reviews, and when I do, they then to just be a short paragraph.  With over 700 games in my library and 7+ years on steam, this is the FIRST game I've felt deserved a brain dump of this length.  This is something that ANY fan of the original Cyan series, and anyone that was slightly dissapointed in Obduction but didnt quite know why should experience.  \n\nQuern is an absolute 10/10 in every category.

Progress is quite linear but very satisfying and fits the story well. The voice acting is great, unfolding the story towards the end without having to actually read. The music is wonderful and accompanies the game very well. Plenty of different interesting puzzles to solve to reach new and varying areas, resulting in satisfying, well worth game-time (\u00b115 hours).\n\nThe developers have done a great job, not just at wonderful graphics and soundscape in a beautiful fictional world. The clues given are clear and the tools provided are very useful. The world was built in a very smart way, giving or restricting access where needed or wished for. Very well executed to give direction to the player, avoiding backtracking or long repetitive walks.\n\nOn a final note and certainly no biggie, the only downside that really comes to my mind is replayability value. Due to the linearity of the story and the choice being at the very end of the game, both possible endings are easily accomplished due to the - although useful - (auto-)save feature. I would have loved to see the story hinting at a choice to make at some point in the game, followed by different game-play depending on the chosen path to eventually come to a climactic ending. In comparison, although the ending in Quern did not feel rushed like it did in Obduction, I felt similarly disappointed.

In navolging van deze twee klassiekers zijn er veel ontwikkelaars geweest die geprobeerd hebben vergelijkbare spellen te lanceren met wisselend succes. Sommige Myst klonen hadden amper een verhaal en waren niet meer dan een verzameling puzzels. Andere spellen hadden een interessant verhaal, maar eentonige of obscure puzzels. Het is niet eenvoudig om een spel te maken met de juiste mix van goed verhaal, slimme puzzels en voldoende hints, zodat je niet vast komt zitten. Een van mijn favoriete van Myst afgeleide spellen is TimeLapse (recent ook op Steam verkrijgbaar) dat een interessant verhaal wist te combineren met slimme puzzels, een uitgebreid journaal met achtergrondinformatie en hints voor puzzels en een camera waarmee je foto's kon maken van hints die verstopt waren in de omgeving. Een ander goed voorbeeld van een recente ode aan Myst is Haven Moon. \n\n[b]Over de puzzels in Quern[/b]\nQuern is geen letterlijke Myst kloon, maar combineert Myst-achtige puzzels met veel meer traditionele 'point-and-click' achtige puzzels. In tegenstelling tot Myst kunt allerlei voorwerpen oppakken en deze moet je op de juiste manier op de juiste plek of plekken gebruiken. Dat is meteen een tweede punt waarin Quern (in positieve wijze) verschilt van Myst. Sommige puzzels komen verschillende malen terug, maar dan gecompliceerder of op een onverwachte manier. Een voorbeeld hiervan is de puzzel buiten het kristal-laboratorium. Dit begint als een schuifpuzzel waarbij je een zwaar blok vrij moet spelen, zodat het mechanisme dat de valbrug laat zakken, activeert. Later moet je deze blokken opnieuw manipuleren, maar dan met een ander doel en een ander resultaat.\nNet als in Myst spelen allerlei apparaten en mechanieken een belangrijke rol en moet je met de hints in de omgeving en met wat uitproberen de oplossing voor de diverse puzzles zien te vinden. \nQuern weet mijn aandacht beter vast te houden dan Obduction van Cyan. Dat komt waarschijnlijk omdat ik in Quern steeds subtiele (maar wel duidelijke) hints krijg die me verder helpen, zonder dat ik bij het handje wordt gehouden, terwijl ik in Obduction steeds geen flauw idee heb wat ik eigenlijk moet doen. \nDe puzzels zijn ook heel afwisselend. Zo is er een laboratorium waar je diverse planten en bloemen vindt en waar je verschillende recepten kunt klaarmaken. Er zijn puzzels die draaien rond het gebruik van kristallen waarmee je je kunt teleporteren en andere puzzels focussen op het ontcijferen van hints om mechanismen te manipuleren. \n\n[b]Het verhaal van Quern[/b]\nHet verhaal wordt voornamelijk vertelt door middel van brieven die zijn achtergelaten door een ontdekkingsreiziger/wetenschapper die alle puzzels voor je heeft achtergelaten. Hij heeft daar een doel mee en op het eind van het spel wordt je voor een morele keuze gesteld. Je kunt het pad van je voorganger volgen of je kunt luisteren naar de smeekbede van een mysterieus wezen dat je op het eiland ontmoet en dat je vertelt over de geschiedenis van het eiland. Het is geen complex verhaal, maar het is goed uitgewerkt. Er wordt ook ruimte gelaten voor een vervolg, waarin je misschien (hopelijk) meer afwisselende locaties bezoekt.\n\n[b]Spelduur[/b]\nNa bijna 17 uur spelen heb ik 16 van de 18 achievements weten te ontsluiten. Het spel uitspelen kostte me ongeveer 15 uur, de rest heb ik nodig gehad om een aantal achievements vrij te spelen. Ik heb een enkele keer een walkthrough moeten consulteren, omdat ik geen zin had om twee uur te zoeken naar de oplossing van een puzzel. Dat is geen kritiek op het spel, de hints die worden gegeven zijn duidelijk genoeg, maar mijn geduld is beperkt, net als de tijd die ik beschikbaar heb. Daarmee komt een belangrijk kritiekpunt dat ik had op Haven Moon te vervallen. Haven Moon is mooi, goed doordacht, heeft slimme puzzels, maar is ook over voor je er erg in hebt. En de hints voor sommige puzzels in Haven Moon waren te goed verborgen of obscuur. Hoewel Quern qua oppervlakte niet groter is dan Haven Moon, zijn er veel meer puzzels in verwerkt, waardoor je langer bezig bent. En omdat dit goede puzzels zijn, voelt dit niet als vuller. \n\n[b]De graphics van Quern[/b]\nQuern ziet er grafisch indrukwekkend uit en doet qua stijl sterk denken aan Riven met gebouwen van klei, steen en hout en overal kristallen die op verschillende manieren gebruikt worden om licht te geven, apparaten aan te drijven of machines te manipuleren. Omdat het hele spel zich afspeelt op een enkel eiland is de afwisseling in omgeving beperkt, dit is gecompenseerd door een aantal mooi en gedetailleerd ingerichte locaties, zoals het kristal-laboratorium, de werkplaats, het alchemie-laboratorium en de bibliotheek.\n\n[b]Kritiek en waardering[/b]\nHeeft Quern ook minpunten? Een paar kleine: de afwisseling in locaties is beperkt. Gedurende een groot gedeelte van het spel ben je vrij om alle verschillende locaties te bezoeken, maar als je eenmaal ondergronds gaat, kun je niet meer terug. Hierdoor zul je het spel geheel of gedeelteijk opnieuw moeten spelen als blijkt dat je bepaalde achievements niet hebt ontsloten. Dit wordt versterkt door het feit dat je het spel een beperkt aantal keer kunt opslaan. Als je dit niet goed verdeeld, zul je een groot gedeelte van het spel opnieuw moeten spelen. Wat ik echter heel goed vindt van de ontwikkelaars is dat ze goed luisteren naar kritiek van spelers en kort na het publiceren van het spel een aantal storende bugs hebben verwijderd en zelfs sommige puzzels hebben aangepast, zodat ze voor minder frustratie zorgen. Hulde!\n\n[b]Conclusie[/b]\nAls je houdt van goede puzzelspellen in de stijl van Myst, zoek dan niet verder.

Cian failed spectacularly with Myst 5 / URU / Myst online for the reasons completely unknown to me. Obduction was a very good comback, but let's face it, it was lacking. Puzzles wern't as good, loading time was slow, and the end of the game was quite rushed.\n\nI struggled for years trying to find substitution to the Myst / Myst 3 and every single game failed short. (like Schism or Aura).\nThe Witness was probably the closest one I managed to find even despite the storm of negative review of people who did not quite get it. And also The Room.\n\nSo when I saw Quern, I thought it would be another small budget adventure game inspired by Myst with the couple of puzzles and a few hours of gameplay at best. Nothing special, but given the price I decied to give it a try.\n\nOh my. Boy I was wrong.\n\nThis game bleew my mind. A game that I was desperately searching for years. This is a top notch quality product of tremendous effort and tremendous love.\n\nLet me summarize what I like about it and what makes it good.\n\nPROS:\n\n* Production quality is terrific. Great mbient music, amazing world design, very soft and atmospheric lighting, small neat particle effects like ocean breeze and sparks of fire, I love it.\n\n\n* Every single puzzle is hinted and telegraphed. This is a signatural Myst approach where game shows you on some small samples or simpler puzzles how world mechanic works. \n\nThere are a couple of puzzles that don't quite do it right (alchemy lab book and stone wheel for example). As I recall devs are aware of it and plan to slightly adjust  them. \n\n\n* There are no NPC, no inventory combination and no pixel hunting. All puzzles are elegant and very concrete (i.e it is always a mechanic puzzle with a meaningfull way to solve it).\nAt first I was concerned when I noticed inventory, but devs managed to make inventory management really straightforward. There was *never* a time where I had to brutforce items hoping one of them will fit and do somethign useful.\n\n\n* Backtracking is an interesting concept, and it is difficult to explain. Think of it as a metroid crossed with a quest - a lot of areas are not accesible untill you solve some puzzles or unlock certain items, but more importanly some previously solved puzzles can be reused in an interesting and unpredictable way. This is a first myst-like game I'm aware of pulling this trick.\n\n* The game is fucking HUGE. By huge i mean incredibly huge. I have no idea how did they managed to fit so much content in two years. (I have no idea how they pulled a development of a game of this quality). Think of your average indie quest and double it. Then double it again. I would say it easily matches Myst and Riven, and tops Myst 3 and Obduction.\n\nNow some CONS:\n\nThere is only one game world, and it is mostly done in gray pastel tones, so after 5-6 hours of playing it may start look a bit dull.\n\nThe game world is well connected and has a lot of shortcuts, but sometimes it is rather tiring to walk around it. I mean, there is so much backtracking that it can be nauseous.\n\nThere are a couple of puzzles that don't quite well telegraph how you are supposed to solve it.\n\n(Also, devs, if you are reading it and planing a sequeel/ addon, please for god's sake don't include sound puzzles. I beg you.)\n\nFinally, the story felt very nominal and green sprite narrator did not put the same impression on me like Myst characters.\n__\n\nThis is a minor stuff though.\nOverall this is an amazing game and I love the hell out of it.", "timestamp_created": 1480998616, "timestamp_updated": 1481089606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28206961": {"recommendationid": "28206961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147336090", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484510272}, "language": "english", "review": "when I first saw this game on steam my immediate thought was that cyan the maker of myst and more recently obduction had already released THIS game too!

I've been a huge fan of the Myst franchise (Myst, Riven, Uru, etc.) for my whole life, and this appeared to be a love-letter to those games. It absolutely is.\n\nIf you enjoyed any of the Myst games, this is of immediate interest to you. If you haven't tried the Myst games, I'll try and break down the magic behind these types of experiences for you. There are no enemies to fight, no platforms to fall off of, and no danger. The driving force behind continuing to play these types of games is to understand a beautifully crafted and complex world, and to lose yourself in the environment and the intrigue it generates. It will tease you with mysterious machinations, and reward you by letting you activate them and see everything spin into action according to your design.\n\n[h1]Synopsis[/h1]\nMuch like the Myst games, Quern will start by dropping you off unceremoniously on the porch of a completely foreign world before it drives away. The first things you see when your eyes open in this world is a small table with an envelope upon it, carefully placed and sealed with wax. The insignia of the seal is a \"W\", which you will promptly learn is the mark of the enclosed letter's author. In this letter, the author introduces you to your task and frees you to explore his world.\n\nThe author of these letters allegedly requires you to undertake a task of great importance. But before he can let you do so, he wants to ensure that you understand everything he's learned while spending time in this world. To this end, he has locked the task away, beneath locks that can only be opened by demonstrating understanding of the mechanics of the world.\n\nIn order to complete your objective, you must follow the author's footsteps in understanding this world and understanding why he considers your task to be absolutely essential. Whether you agree with his ideas, however, is entirely up to you. \n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nQuern is not an exceptionally difficult game, but it will not hold your hand. It will not give you a hint if it thinks you're stuck. You will always have all of the tools you need to complete your objective. You are never required to look up an answer online. You are never required to brute-force a puzzle's solution. If you are confident that you are where you should be, and you are confident you have found all the things you can, but you still find yourself stuck... then there is something you have overlooked. An item that can be used, a secret left locked after you obtained a new tool, or simply an incorrect assumption on how a device operates. These are all things that happened to me while I played this game.\n\nBecause it was newly released, a part of me worried that I had encountered a bug of some kind whenever I found myself stuck and unable to progress. I was confident I had encountered this at one point, actually... but I found later that I had left a key part of a puzzle on a scale in a hut. A foolish error that I didn't make again!\n\n[h1]Puzzle Quality & Variety[/h1]\nThe variety and quality of puzzles in Quern is wonderful. The developers have clearly put a lot of attention into designing a game with varied interactions. Sometimes, some great exploration and puzzling games can get ruined (in my opinion) by the presence of only one or two types of puzzles repeated throughout the game with minor variations. It detracts from the intrigue, it eliminates the curiosity of what challenge could be coming next. Quern does not fall victim to this phenomena.\n\nApart from a few staple actions that allow you to identify interactable elements and points of later progression, practically every puzzle you encounter while exploring Quern will be unique in some manner. While there are instances of forcing you to explore the implications of a mechanic before being tested on it, the tests always introduce a new element to challenge your understanding of the basic operation of the game mechanic.\n\nThese puzzles are themed by simplified versions of electricity, biology, chemistry, and mechanics. Few puzzles felt out-of-place in the world, they all seemed to be integrated with the environment and the story as it unfolds.\n\n[h1]Environments[/h1]\nThe environment quality is astounding. I couldn't play the game on the highest settings, sadly, but even despite that I found it stunning. Even most of the 'plain' exterior areas were, in some manner, magnificently designed. Some of the unique interiors and other novel environments were stunning. If you like seeing beautiful scenery, this game rewards you for each solved puzzle with a new sight.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nI must imagine it's very difficult to write a compelling story for a game primarily based around puzzles being solved. I find it difficult to come up with scenarios in which puzzles must be solved before operating simple devices in an environment. In a lot of cases, it [i]can[/i] end up being kind of ridiculous. If you've played any of the Professor Layton games, you might know what I mean... puzzling becomes a crazy obstacle to the otherwise simple actions a normal person would perform.\n\nFortunately, Quern handled this well. Any way you slice it, it's difficult to imagine a scenario in which you're being so aggressively challenged by performing the day-to-day operations in an environment... so Quern decided to frame it in the context of you being forced to understand the significance and potential applications for the machinations found in the world. It does this to prepare you for a decision you must make, about your role in the story and your beliefs in the nature of man.\n\nIt's for this reason that, despite Myst and Riven being legendary in my mind, I might actually place Quern above it for the purposes of this review intended for others. The Myst series had depth and complexity in their story that I love, but there were many instances of \"puzzles for puzzle's sake\" in their worlds. Meanwhile, Quern seeks to provide a reason for the insane complication seen in the environments, and I think it succeeds well.\n\nI can't yet speak to replayability. I'd like to go through it again to make different choices and to get some achievements I missed, at least. I don't know if some puzzles are randomly generated, yet. I can tell, however, that knowing the way to solve the puzzles won't necessarily make it any easier. Some things in Quern require careful thought before action, regardless of how well you understand the mechanisms at play.\n\n[h1]Technical Quality & Performance[/h1]\nTechnically, Quern is outstanding. I experienced only one instance of an obvious malfunction, and it wasn't even technically in the game: Upon completing the game and viewing the credits, it returned me to the menu with no mouse cursor. I had to alt-tab out and back in before it would show. The developer seems active on the game's Community Hub, and seems to have already confirmed that they're aware of the issue, so I doubt it will persist for long.\n\nPerformance-wise, I can't really speak to. I don't have a conventional gaming set-up, so I would not feel qualified to indicate that the performance is above- or below-par. I could not run the game at maximum settings, but it seemed to run fine as I dropped the draw distance and SSAO down. It's my understanding that this game was made in the Unity game engine, which might introduce some performance overhead. In the end, though, I can clearly state that poor performance could never ruin this game. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIf you enjoyed similar games (Myst, Riven, Uru, etc.) or if you enjoy solid puzzles and great environments, I [b]highly[/b] recommend this experience to others. I see a lot of love and care put into this game, its world, and the puzzles within. This love and care clearly resulted in a great game and an awesome experience, and I'm really glad to have played it.

The game runs smooth as glass with a high frame rate.\n\nThe puzzles are some of the best puzzles I've encountered in a puzzle game since the original Myst and Riven games. Your eyes won't be bleeding from eye-strain scouring every pixel in the game world to try and uncover clues. They are often times right in front of your face.\n\nUnlike most puzzle games, the focus isn't simply on finding the clues. It's figuring out what the clues mean, to which puzzle they belong, and how they help solve the puzzle. Yes, this is a puzzle solving game, not a clue finding game.\n\nThe puzzles are so well designed that you probably won't even need any walkthroughs to solve them, yet will still find them very challenging.\n\nThe in-game notebook and sketch feature are absolutely genius. While I did use some hand written notes for certain puzzles, I found the in-game notebook to actually be quite usable. That's the first time I've ever found an in-game notebook to be worthwhile in a puzzle game.\n\nI think it's important when considering if a game is worth a certain price tag, you think about the quality of the hours played, and not just the quantity. I will have about 20 hours sunk in this game when I've beat it to my liking. However, the quality of those 20 hours will have been higher than any 20 hours I have sunk into another game not named Skyrim or Witcher 3. This game is compelling.

The soundtrack is very well laid out to fit the scenery you are in currently.\n\nIn my opinion, the puzzles are very well designed. In almost all cases,  you get appriopriate clues concerning what your next goal should be which is crucial because espescially at the beginning of the game you have so many things that need achieving (basically gaining access to locked areas). The puzzles incorporate symbols, letters, numbers, sounds, shifting items, etc. To my recollection there were only two puzzles that required trial and error but these puzzles were really simple to solve. All other puzzles purely require logical thinking.\n\nNow, I have to add that occasionally the game makes it difficult for you to find the next step you have to take. That is due to the fact that some of the machines and items available to you have to be used multiple times in different ways. So if you get stuck you need perseverence/patience to figure out what you may have missed. And that also means that you have to pay close attention to the many details you see in the game world and preferably remember them.\n\nThe gameplay itself I found to be very smooth with the standard moving controls (WASD or arrow keys) and the mouse for interaction and scrolling through your inventory. What some players may enjoy is the notebook function that let's you take screenshots for later reference, however, personally I prefer pen & paper (which is also an achievement) because it facilitates combining clues.\n\nHaving said all that Quern is a definite must-have for all lovers of puzzle exploration games. In this genre, it plays right up there with games like Obduction or The Witness. It took me about twenty hours to complete the game and with all the content I got it was well worth the price.", "timestamp_created": 1480586110, "timestamp_updated": 1480586110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28112118": {"recommendationid": "28112118", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993537005", "num_games_owned": 647, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 1364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480546446}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][u]See written review below[/u][/b] or watch it here: https://youtu.be/s0CkeEuVdX8\n[h1]TL;DR: SKIP TO CONCLUSION![/h1]\n\nQuern - Undying Thoughts is a fantastic first person exploration adventure completely loaded with puzzles.\n\nYou have been brought into this unfamiliar place, and you are trapped against your will by an unknown man. He has some purpose for bringing you here, but you have no clue what it is. You are left alone in a beautiful world to explore, as your captor leaves puzzles everywhere to test you. I found the story intriguing, and it\u2019s told through the letters left by your captor to give you some guidance.\n\nGameplay wise, this game is filled to the brim with all sorts of different puzzles. The puzzles make use of everything from numbers, to codes, to hidden messages, to sounds, to using the environment. You don\u2019t have any clear cut objectives, so you need to be observant, and pay attention to all the clues around you. Some of the puzzles I was able to solve quickly, while others were very challenging, and had me searching for clues for hours. At times I felt utterly clueless, only to realize I missed something that should have been so obvious. Perseverance and determination certainly pay off, and this is a game where I never wanted to give up. Although, I did facepalm a few times for having missed a few blatantly obvious things.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed almost all the puzzles, except for the one sound puzzle, and the \u201cSimon Says\u201d puzzle where I actually had to grab a pen because the sequence to remember was 14 digits long! The way you explore the island, and find your way through to open up new areas is satisfying, and I was surprised at how many different parts of the island there were.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list][*]puzzles are plentiful, diverse, challenging, and seamlessly crafted throughout the world\n[*]exploring and solving puzzles is very satisfying; there are also some secrets to be found for achievements\n[*]very intriguing story\n[*]sound effects and the voice acting are done well\n[*]the soundtrack is great, and the music changes as you move between the different areas; I found it to be quite soothing, especially while I was struggling to solve some of the puzzles\n[*]graphics are beautiful, and the scenery looks fantastic[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list][*](nitpick) there is backtracking later on in the game; it wasn\u2019t too bad, but it was a little bit tedious going a long distances to test things out (usually when you mess up or are unsure of what to do)\n[*](nitpick) sometimes you'll get caught on the terrain as you run over uneven areas\n[*](nitpick) some minor texture popping issues (but it's easy to ignore since you're so focused on the puzzles at hand)\n[*](nitpick) while most of the keybindings are customizable, the movement keys are not, and there is only partial controller support right now (most people will be fine with this)[/list]\n\nThe game took me over 17 hours to complete, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. As with the nature of puzzle games though, they lack replay value because once you know how to do the puzzles, there\u2019s not much reason to play it again.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nQuern is an excellent puzzle exploration game. I was impressed from the start through the finish by the multitude of diverse, and challenging puzzles. This game is a must have for any puzzle-lovers out there.\n\nIf you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AzralynnReviews#curation]here.[/url]\nYou can also view this review on my website [url=http://www.azralynn.com/review-quern-undying-thoughts-game/]here.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1480563892, "timestamp_updated": 1491777754, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.753376", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28110783": {"recommendationid": "28110783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024908549", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1918, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510378547}, "language": "english", "review": "Visualy stunning and wonderfuly challanging.

Do you like games that make you think and don\u2019t hold your hand when it comes to progression?  Do you like taking notes during games or having to remember clues/noteworthy places?  If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to any or all of these questions, then [i]get this game[/i]!  \n\nHeck, even if you\u2019ve never played Myst or anything like it and don\u2019t know where you stand on puzzle-based games, I\u2019d recommend you try it out.\n\nIn the time-honored tradition of all adventure/puzzle games, Quern unceremoniously dumps you on a mysterious and seemingly deserted island with no clear way of getting off.  Your only clue is a letter from someone claiming to have trapped you the island for a purpose.  From there, you explore the island, learn more about its (former?) inhabitants, and solve puzzles that range from relatively straightforward to fiendishly difficult.  (NOTE:  That point about taking notes above?  Do that.  A lot of it.  There are codes to decipher, diagrams to read, and information to remember.)\n\nThe mechanics aside, the game is gorgeous to look at and provides a consistent picture of the mysterious world that you\u2019ll explore throughout Quern\u2019s storyline.  The spot-on visuals are augmented by solid sound design that not only provides atmosphere, but also give the player solid feedback when interacting with objects/puzzles.  This is all wrapped up in a wonderful score that sets the pace and mood for the game: It\u2019s not a game about rushing from one puzzle to the next.  It\u2019s a game about taking your time, noticing the little things, and drawing conclusions from your observations and notes to progress.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the game to anyone who is interested in or might be curious about games like Myst and Obduction.  If you\u2019re still on the fence and/or want to see what the game looks like before purchasing, take a look at the below video where I play through the first ~25-30 minutes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqFA8TNzg4E", "timestamp_created": 1480431220, "timestamp_updated": 1480431220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.736714", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28055082": {"recommendationid": "28055082", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998305769", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480553521}, "language": "english", "review": "Recommended 10/10\n\nGraphics: Stunning\nSounds and music: I just start the game for listening to the sea an the music\nPuzzles: Challenging and fun.\nAtmosphere: Epic\nNarratives: amazing\nGame mechanincs: i love the interactions in the items menu\n\nOverall: Buy this game if you like puzzles!", "timestamp_created": 1480428341, "timestamp_updated": 1480428341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502793", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28032481": {"recommendationid": "28032481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005473292", "num_games_owned": 555, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 681, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480827972}, "language": "english", "review": "The puzzles are nice and challenging, the scenery looks great and the music is pretty damn good as well.

After realising that holding ALT button highlights them (or you can enable them forever in settings) things become much simpler.\nThen rapidly puzzles become much harder. And altough during the storyline some puzzles may still seem easy/obvous the overall complexity is decent.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou move fast enough (no slow walking like in other similar games), controls are very responsive and user-friendly, you can jump (some other puzzles don't allow it, for me personally it's a big deal). And the game doesn't feel repetetive at all.\n\n[h1]Graphics  & Sounds[/h1]\nGraphics are quite nice, fresh. In some places there are very nice models and light effects. Ambient music creates a good mood, at the same time doesn't bother much. Dialogues (although there are not many) are well written, you probably won't even want to skip them.\n\n[h1]Storyline[/h1]\nAs usual you get pieces of information after each puzzle.

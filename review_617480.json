Dialogue and story are great, exploration is fun.  The Real Time with Slow Time combat is well done and enjoyable, I like it more than Real Time with Pause.  I'm playing on Normal and I've had to replay several battles, but only once, to win.  So, some challenge is there, it's just about right for me.  The graphics are nicely done and I enjoy the art style.  I had one crash, since addressed by the devs, but, other than that the game runs smoothly and is very responsive to input.  Each party member has it's own personality, reflected in dialogue, which adds to the atmosphere.  The leveling system doesn't depend on XP to advance your characters, so there's no farming to gain XP.  Rather, you have to explore and find gold and blueprints to level, a nice change IMO. In short, there's alot going on under the hood that seperates this from your usual dungeon crawler.

Story is intriguing, but other parts of the game need work or even some alteration.  First each battle plays out almost the same and becomes boring fairly quickly.  This is the same for the loot for the most part.  Although, the character skills are interesting enough and do add some flavor to the battles\n\nI think the game needs more tactics to up the challenge level.  Instead, of having the enemies always come out of little portals where the archer and the mage can pick them off quickly, maybe have them closer to switch the batlle up a little bit, or give some enemies the ability to dodge attacks or even reflect them.  Have some enemies teleport in and out of attack range.  The battles just need to be made not so damn predictable.  I think the best way to make loot better is to make it more randomized and more unique  so it changes the way battles play out\n\nI am giving the developer a positive review because this game is so promising and I think the dev needs some positive reinforcement to make it better.  I deleted it from my hard drive but may re-install if I later see an update that makes the battles more interesting.  \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1506285705, "timestamp_updated": 1506285705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35044652": {"recommendationid": "35044652", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983083878", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505738499}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall this is a pretty decent game. The story is massive (the dev clearly cares about this), and there is great attention to the details of the backstory, dialogue between characters, and lore that can be found around the game. \n\n\u2028\u2028For me the battling is the best part. While it is not without its problems (sometimes tricky to pick the correct enemy - units pass through each other), in EA status it is clearly already in good form. It is tense and have genuinely felt my heart race to survive the onslaught.  Took me a few battles to get used to the mechanics\u2026you really do have to make use of slow time, and be tactical, which is satisfying. I understand there are more battle modes to come, so looking forward to that.\n\nGraphics look great, particularly when you have loads of enemies in battle, and I only ran into a frame drop once while running through the first proper level of the tower. (I am running it on Ultra settings though at 3440x1440 on a fairly decent card so not a surprise). I love the use of light and shadows in exploring, and understand this is to improve further. Use of particles is great. Visually it pops very well. \n\nAudio is decent. Sound design is clear enough and helpful in battle, though some things are missing (here\u2019s a noisy waterfall, there\u2019s a silent one) - and I turned all the levels up in the settings. Music is good  to keep you playing, though I wish there was more orchestra, and sometimes it needs to have more punch. Particularly going in or out of battles, so you actually feel impending danger or success! \n\nI think there is a lot of detail to the leveling up of heroes, inventory, skills etc which I was left to discover for myself. The city \u2018menu\u2019 idea is good and clearly shows the dev cares about connecting it all together with the backstory - will be interesting to see where the story goes. It\u2019s promising a lot.\n\nFrom what I understand from the dev, this is going to be a huge game in terms of content, and it is already well on its way.  In over 4 hours playing I only got to end of the tower\u2019s first floor, so still got 3 more to go just in this current EA build! The dev is clearly committed to the game based on the responses here, so looking forward to seeing how much more it grows.", "timestamp_created": 1505739102, "timestamp_updated": 1505739102,

It looks like devs are really trying hard to fix everything what players report and also theirs response time to bug reports or questions is pretty fast. So if every early access game would be like that, the world would be much more nicer place. :-)\n\nWhat I really like:\n- graphics, videos, etc. looks really awesome\n- time slowing in the battles (to me it feels more engaging than classic pause system)\n\nNeutral feelings:\n- At the beginning I was really excited how the battles looks like (you have battleground and you have to killing enemies whose are comming from multiple doors and wanna kill you), however after some time (I'm in half of second level) I feel like it's so repetitive and I would really like to see more battle modes as well (I know there are boss fights, but I mean something really different)\n- I would prefer wider choice of skills (every level a new skill is opened and then you can choice one from two specializations for that skill).. so at least two skills per level would be nice, to let player select in which way should character goes\n- Difficulity definitely needs little more balancing ..

I'm really enjoying it, certainly more than Torment 2, even more than  Pillars of Eternity actually.  Come to think of it, I don't believe I have had this much fun playing an isometric RPG since the original Neverwinter Nights and that is high praise coming from me.\n\nThe combat system is fun, similar to RTwP you see in Pillars of Eternity, but instead of pausing the action completely, it slows down to a crawl when you activate the tactics mode.  I'd say the combat requires good tactics and reactions even on normal difficulty.  I've wiped a couple times on bosses, but  overall I'd say Normal is challenging, but not too difficult. There is a good variety of enemy types with varied abilities and your party members each have multiple skills that they can modify with different properties.   So far (about 1/2 through the first act) I found the story engaging and interesting, and I'm enjoying it more than PoE.  The story is mainly told through conversations between your party members and various books and notes scatered around the levels, but there are occasional cut-scenes during important moments.  As for the visuals, the level design is really great for an Infinity engine game IMO, vibrants colors, water effects, lighting effects and overall good variety in tilesets.  The characters models leave a bit to be desired though, they are somewhat blocky and have no visual customization besides weapons (update: while individual pieces of armor do not show, there will be 5 skins per character based on the quality/tier of armor they are wearing).  \n\nI would highly recommend this game if you are into old-school RPGs like Baldur's Gate, IWD, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights.  I am certainly enjoying it far more than other recent efforts to bring this genre back such as PoE, Torment 2, and Divinity:OS.

So I thought perhaps there should be a negative review that almost sounds like a positive review. \n\nI see a lot of promise in this game.  And after my first negative review I spoke directly with the developer so they could further understand my issues.  The one huge problem I have with it so far is that your people do not take up physical space on the battle field, allowing enemies to run right through your people.  They give you interesting battle fields to fight on but then when you close in on a choke point the baddies just waltz through to your people in the back.  Taunt lets you grab their aggro for a minute but what\u2019s the point of maps \"tactical\" positioning possible if you\u2019re just going to have to use an ability to do the same thing anyway.  This is something I've been told they want to change but there are currently technical hurdles.  I understand this and hope they are able to overcome them but the not taking up space on the battlefield might be a deal breaker for me if it never makes it in.  \n\nSome of the 2d art is really great, but some of them are not to the same standard it seems. so I give that a mix bag. The 3d art is not going to win an award but it is 100% good enough to portray and interesting and nice looking world. \n\nThe story is interesting but pretty linear early on, and overall there are not going to be many options but what few choices you do have with the story is aimed at having larger more meaningful choices which I think is a good thing so I hope to see the story develop too. \n\nWith what problems there are here, and the price tag it's hard not to recommend this game but at it's current build I'd say wait.  However all that being said, I'm not going to return it even though it's elibible because I wanna see if it will get better, and if you're the kind of person that is interested in the development process of a game and supporting the game makers then this really might be the gem for you.", "timestamp_created": 1504333584, "timestamp_updated": 1511023898, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.633618", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34618161": {"recommendationid": "34618161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078211419", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504697823}, "language": "english", "review": "Just putting in a review of my experience so far.

I find in most RPGs you can spend a lot of time and energy looting hundreds of pieces of gear and you'll still end up about being at the average of where the game wants you to be, so why waste the time?  Why not just give the player 1 outfit and quit the pretense of loot?

I'm not involved in the secret war going on since the dawn of time between turn-based/rt with pause, a combat system should be what fits the game.  I find that the higher difficulties have been difficult (because I don't care to deal with the stats of armor-choosing often) and the easy settings seem a bit bland.  I haven't found the strategy beyond managing the basics of mana and cooldowns and moving units around to spread the damage out.  Perhaps it takes longer to find the strategy.  I would say thus far it's not that exciting as a Starcraft or not as fun or tactical as Grandia II, but there seems to be potential here.\n\nThe environment is nice.

Descubran a la joya oculta del 2017 mientras todav\u00eda est\u00e1 en early access.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITqNMtJBD1g\nAn\u00e1lisis completo publicado [url=https://www.simpatiaporlacritica.com/single-post/2017/08/11/Tower-of-Time]aqu\u00ed[/url]\n\nHay una serie de juegos que r\u00e1pidamente se nos viene a la cabeza cuando hablamos de RPG. Por supuesto que tenemos a los de acci\u00f3n (ARPG) cuyas mec\u00e1nicas responden a un combate inmediato, intuitivo, que lo emparentan brevemente con otros g\u00e9neros como el arcade y el hack & slash. Y la otra gran familia de RPG es la cl\u00e1sica, con combates en grupo por turnos. Hay un universo entero de puntos en com\u00fan entre todos los juegos que se consideran de rol, aunque hasta ahora nadie hab\u00eda intentado modificar el sistema de combate.\n \nTower of Time m\u00e1s que una torre es un puente que viene a unir los dos mundos. Con la arrogancia del indie no s\u00f3lo plantea un sistema de combate absolutamente novedoso, sino que reescribe muchas reglas de oro que hasta hoy se consideraban sagradas dentro del RPG. Empecemos por lo que ya ven\u00edamos hablando: combates. En ToT controlamos un grupo de 3 h\u00e9roes a elegir entre 7 (siete!) clases distintas con \u00e1rboles de habilidades \u00fanicos. Si bien la presentaci\u00f3n de las peleas son las cl\u00e1sicas de los RPG por turnos, una vez que comienza el combate todo cambia. Podemos controlar a cada uno de nuestros h\u00e9roes tanto es sus movimientos como en sus ataques, adem\u00e1s de elegir qu\u00e9 skills usar y en qu\u00e9 momento. Aqu\u00ed es donde m\u00e1s se acerca al ARPG, aunque mantiene una idea mucho m\u00e1s t\u00e1ctica, ya que hay que diagramar los movimientos de tres personajes a la vez. Para resumirlo, es una mec\u00e1nica RTS dentro de un juego de rol.\n\nEl sistema de leveleo tambi\u00e9n es ins\u00f3lito, y no sigue el mandato divino del rol, es decir, aumentar de nivel eliminando enemigos y ganando experiencia. Una vez que nuestros h\u00e9roes avancen de nivel por primera vez (esto s\u00ed es a la vieja usanza) tendremos que conseguir planos para mejorar un edificio de entrenamiento, donde los personajes entrenar\u00e1n para subir de nivel. Dichos planos son \u00fanicos por clase, as\u00ed que adivinaron: los level-up ser\u00edan como el resto de los \u00edtems, sujetos a un sistema de loot cl\u00e1sico. Para compensar esta dificultad, de cierta forma, el sistema de crafteo con cristales es muy sencillo y poderoso, permiti\u00e9ndonos forjar items legendarios muy r\u00e1pidamente en el juego. Hay que decir tambi\u00e9n que en las primeras dos horas de gameplay no fue tan necesario subir de nivel.\n \nEl nivel de inmersi\u00f3n de la historia y los personajes es s\u00f3lo comparable al universo Witcher. Hay una complejidad narrativa que es la delicia de los m\u00e1s fan\u00e1ticos de este tipo de tramas, y les proporcionar\u00e1 unas cuantas horas de diversi\u00f3n. De hecho, hablando de tiempo, actualmente la campa\u00f1a dura m\u00e1s de 40 horas, a\u00fan en early access.\nLa dificultad del juego es adaptable a las habilidades del jugador y se agradece, ya que de otra forma ser\u00eda un monstruo incontrolable. La versi\u00f3n f\u00e1cil es realmente f\u00e1cil. Ideal para los que no tienen mucha experiencia y quieren disfrutar de la historia. La dificultad normal es desafiante. Esto quiere decir que habr\u00e1 peleas ganadas y perdidas, pero con varias alternativas para superarlas. Ya en este nivel de dificultad los novatos se sentir\u00e1n ahogados. Finalmente, para superar el modo dif\u00edcil, en palabras de los desarrolladores, para ganar ciertas batallas la \u00fanica forma es tener un set-up espec\u00edfico de items y skills en los personajes elegidos. No hay mucho para agregar.\n \nEl costado art\u00edstico del juego est\u00e1 a la altura de todo lo dem\u00e1s, y tanto el motor gr\u00e1fico como la banda sonora original son placeres divinos. Faltar\u00eda quiz\u00e1s algunas animaciones del entorno (cofres, piedras de loot, etc) pero confiamos que estas caracter\u00edsticas se ir\u00e1n sumando al juego. De hecho, los \u00fanicos parches que se implementaron hasta ahora son mayoritariamente en el sistema de combate. \n \nNo hay punto flojos en Tower of Time, salvo quiz\u00e1s ser un juego orientado a jugadores hardcore, lo cual no es algo necesariamente malo. El g\u00e9nero de RPG suele tener muchos t\u00edtulos pero pocos que realmente dejen una marca en sus jugadores. ToT llega para patear el tablero y consagrarse como uno de los mejores.

I highly recommend this game.\n\nThe most compelling aspect of the game for me is the cutscene artwork.  The still images are breathtaking.  They somehow manage to simultaneously show you how beautiful and developed Altara once was and the dire situation of the world today. The images manage to evoke strong emotions \u2013 a feat that few games have accomplished.\n\nEach level is beautifully designed.  Heavy particle areas, such as waterfalls or long-distance renders, will tax your GPU.  It is easy to be immersed in each level and forget that everything you see is within a magic tower.\n\nThe story line is top notch and genuinely creative.  You, of course, are the main character, however, as the main character, you sit on your throne and do nothing.  Everything is accomplished by your heroes.  I won\u2019t spoil the novelty of how this is done (from the context of the story).  The story quickly brings together the five races (humans, dwarves, elves, ice giants, and shadows) to give you plenty of options for creating your ideal party.\n\nEach hero has a unique set of skills to give you an edge in combat.  You can easily customize the skills before each battle for a nominal fee.\n\nThe approach to combat is certainly unique.  The \"slow time\" gives you minute control over every detail.  In the early stages, I found this wasn't needed.  As the enemies became stronger with more abilities and combat lasted longer, events happen so quickly that my heroes would die before I realized what was happening.  Trying to micro-manage each hero without the slow-time would be near impossible due to the fast-paced nature of combat.\n\nI would argue that gold is the most precious resource as it is the only resource that cannot be farmed.  You have the option of working through the main story or completing challenges.  Each challenge can be repeated, but you only get the gold and crystal reward once.  The item, however, can be farmed and deconstructed for crystals.  Need to make some new rare armor, but short on crystals?  No problem.  Do a couple challenges and you\u2019re set.  The economy in general will need improvement.\n\nBeing an early access game, it has its own set of growing pains.  Improvements that are surely on the developer\u2019s to-do list: no mini-map, can\u2019t remap key assignments, moving around the city can be a little awkward, can\u2019t make notes on the main map (can\u2019t make notes of any kind, for that matter\u2026not that the game is complex enough to require notes, but would be nice to know where certain things are that you think might be important), and can\u2019t adjust the camera \u2013 to name a few.\n\nEven with the growing pains, I\u2019m truly excited for the release of the full game and see the storyline thru to its end.  If you are looking for a story to lose yourself in, this is a game you don\u2019t want to miss!\n", "timestamp_created": 1502332470, "timestamp_updated": 1502332470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687062", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34106163": {"recommendationid": "34106163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069771409", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511271144}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't like turn based RPGs anymore.

Je trouve n\u00e9anmoins le jeu prometteur (assez pour \u00e9crire une critique). \n\nIl a le bon feeling des RPGs \u00e0 l'ancienne, et un syst\u00e8me de combat original dans le style: on affronte des vagues d'ennemis, un peu comme dans un tower defense. Les personnages  sont bien diff\u00e9rents les uns des autres et ont des r\u00f4les tactiques pr\u00e9cis. Je trouve les combats un peu faciles pour l'instant mais je n'en suis qu'au d\u00e9but du jeu.\n\nQuestion immersion, le jeu a su trouver le bon compromis: initialement fan de jdr tels que Baldur's Gate ou Planescape Torment, je n'ai maintenant plus la patience de lire de gros pav\u00e9s de textes pour rentrer dans un univers. Ici pas de gros pav\u00e9s \u00e0 lire mais des interventions r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et courtes des membres de notre \u00e9quipe qui commentent les d\u00e9couvertes de l'univers, ou des descriptions courtes associ\u00e9es \u00e0 certains objets du d\u00e9cor. C'est assez sympa.\n\nJ'\u00e9sp\u00e8re que le jeu saura \u00eatre aussi int\u00e9ressant sur la dur\u00e9e et qu'il saura \u00e9voluer au cours de l'early access.", "timestamp_created": 1501185434, "timestamp_updated": 1501185434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33810012": {"recommendationid": "33810012", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203108243", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509557701}, "language": "polish", "review": "Wci\u0105gaj\u0105ca fabu\u0142a, ciekawy pomys\u0142 na walk\u0119, czas potrzebny na przej\u015bcie gry nie jest przesadzony, wi\u0119c\ngracze z mniejsz\u0105 ilo\u015bci\u0105 czasu na zabawe b\u0119d\u0105 z pewno\u015bci\u0105 zadowoleni.

Amazing graphics, cool story, a very atmospheric soundtrack. AND underneath all this eye candy is a very cool and unique battle system. This has all the polish of a AAA game and is something you need to keep an eye on! My one and only gripe is the loading screen. I hope the developers can reduce the loading times between scenes and battles.\n\nGame Details:\nTower of Time is new take on classic RPG - trying to bring something fresh to this genre. It has a rich story and a novel real-time combat - a blend of RPG and RTS - on higher difficulties meant to be challenging. Maintain a complete control over the battlefield or be crushed.

Many of the puzzles in the game involved noticing tiny details and clicking on them. For example there is a statue hidden in vines that I did not see even when I walk past that location 5 or 6 times. There are also hidden rooms that are behind thick vegetations and journal updates that are hidden in libraries.  The landscapes are also very beautiful, including ice-covered caves, mechanical gadgets and a mix of technology and magic. \n\nThe game mechanics might be a bit difficult for those people that are used to turn-based RPG games. In fact, the games happen in real time, but you are given the opportunity to slow down time. However, even so, the fighting will keep you busy and you need to micro-manage them if you are playing on hard or epic levels. There is also the option of playing the game in easy or \"story\" levels as well. The player is given the choice of playing the game at any levels that he is most comfortable with.\n\nThe game world is extremely huge and consists of dungeons of many levels. Each level is made up of multiple sectors and the map is interspersed with teleportals to enable easy travel. Currently the game is in Early Access and more than half the contents are still under development. However, the contents that are currently release has given me many days of pleasure and enjoyment.\n\nThis game is like an exquisite gem and I would highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1500850390, "timestamp_updated": 1500850390, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.681179", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33742759": {"recommendationid": "33742759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017883718", "num_games_owned": 1584, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502026126}, "language": "polish", "review": "Ta gra niszczy mi system.

It really feels like your decisions matters at every moment.\nWhat's more music is just great, super climatic, even gave me goosebumps couple of times.\nOn the other hand graphics are a little poor in here and there, but cmone, it's early access.\nLongs story short I higly recommend Tower of Time for every RPG fan out there.

Even though it's early access, there's still plenty to do and there will be more story added. The combat was a little difficult at first, but after a while I needed to raise the difficulty. Combat is a separate entity to exploration, you know when you're getting into a battle The skill system has a Dragon Age style of levelling up, an ability then a choice of A or B to add to that ability. The devs also answer questions on the forum section of Steam, which is nice to see. I even saw them offering to edit someone's save if they encountered an unsurpassable bug.\n\nPros:\n\n-Loot based system has that familiar rpg feel to it.\n-Teleporting is instant.\n-Enemy analysis before battle, shows resistances/weaknesses.\n-Beastiary shows every enemy you've faced, so you can learn how to take them down for next time.\n-If you fail a battle, you can retry or load last save.\n-Crafting system is simple and effortless.\n-Soundtrack is enjoyable.\n\nCons:\n\n-No controls option. Although they are simple, but it would be nice to have an option to check them.\n-Low amount of save slots - 5 and an autosave (I prefer to have as many as I require but not a dealbreaker).\n-Sometimes you may need to click more than once for an ability to activate, minor bug but it will be fixed.\n\nDo I recommend this game?

Each floor of the tower has a theme to it, and that, mixed with the music makes the game feel very atmospheric. The story is one of the strongest aspects of this game and you will get most of it through the main play but will find little extra tidbits of story hidden throughout each floor of the tower. There are more than just story hidden around the tower though, there are also hidden treasure stashes and some secrets to uncover. \n\nCombat in this game is much more than just using the best spells and blowing your oppenents away. There are tactics that should be considered on each group of enemies and different enemies have different weaknesses. It will take more than just the best gear to overcome each encounter. You have to plan out how to get the most out of each spell/skill you have at your disposal. I feel this kind of combat is rare in most RPGs and I like how challenging some of the fights can be. But even if you fail the game lets you restart that fight again without having to go back to the last time you saved. \n\nThere is also a crafting system in the game that is simple but effective for gearing out your champions. You will get gear drops from treasure chests and encounters. You will also get crafting crystals which can be used to craft more gear. Old gear you no longer want can be disassebled to gain more crafting crystals to make more gear. \n\nOverall this game is really good and I am looking forward to seeing it through to completion.\n\nIf you would like to see gameplay of this game I have a full playthrough playlist on YouTube that you can check out here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEBxDBAj5nU&list=PLS31VRbZGLdbjmpuUL8Ff-fsEVXnWoKdV", "timestamp_created": 1500129478, "timestamp_updated": 1500129782, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655276", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33558334": {"recommendationid": "33558334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008423537", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509472943}, "language": "english", "review": "Wow, quite nide!

Big thumbs up to the developers for not being afraid to try something complety new. My only comment is that some of the things could be explained better, like how exactly armor works. Also, ability to view details of the enemies to check their stats while in combat - not only before the fight -  would be nice.\n\n\n- add\n\nAwesome!!! I just found my first enchant.

The environments are hand-crafted, beautifully detailed -- the quality and care of the designers shows from the very first second of gameplay!\n\nThe tutorials on how to play -- explaining skills, the points system, equipment, combat, etc. -- are very easily understandable and make it easy to pick up the game without struggling in ignorance or needing to consult a wiki.  \n\nControls are quite natural and fluid with Diablo-style movement.  I really like that you can view the entire battlefield in combat, without the camera being locked on your character.  This enables you to position your characters optimally, planning for enemy movements and attacks.\n\nPoints put into character skills, (special attacks), can be respecced at any time, which is nice if you come across a particularly difficult group of enemies and need to change your strategy on the fly.\n\nThe dialogue, story, and found bits of text are EXTRAORDINARILY well-written -- easy to read, yet interesting and entertaining.  Some games have repetitive dialogue or become boring within the first 5 minutes... not so with Tower of Time -- it reads like a lovingly-crafted novel -- a work of literature unto itself.\n\nI am still at the beginning of my journey with the game, but it has already impressed me to no end!

I recently bumped into an indie title called Tower of Time, developed and published by a small developer in Poland called Event Horizon, and had quite a bit of fun with it.\n\nEvent Horizon launched Tower of Time as an Early Access title on July 13. The game is a single-player, isometric top-down dungeon crawler with RTS elements that takes place inside a huge, multi-level tower that was unearthed during an earthquake in a dying world. \n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\n\nYour character was drawn to the tower as a child, and you briefly entered the structure and talked to a presence that said you\u2019d return someday to claim the power waiting there for you. Many years later, you indeed re-enter the tower in search of resources to help the citizens of your city, where continuous failed crops and the scarcity of clean water have threatened your people\u2019s future.\n\nYou initially return with two trusted friends and warriors, a prototypical male fighter and a female archer. They encourage you to let them go ahead and scout the tower and make it safe for you, which works out as you have a date with a large crystal throne you first glimpsed as a child. From that point on, you direct your companions\u2019 actions via the power of the throne, and as the game progresses you are introduced to new characters to add to your party of up to four.\n\n[H1]GAMEPLAY[/H1]\n\nYour team will explore the tower, fight monsters, and gain valuable insight as to what your world was like before its decline, as well as what caused it to begin dying in the first place. Most battles you can choose to initiate or postpone, as you can see many of the monsters in the tower milling about and waiting to kill you. Some battles, though, are unavoidable: sometimes your party is ambushed, and other times you have to engage an enemy force to progress further into the tower and solve its mysteries.\n\nOnce you enter combat, the game switches perspectives to give you a broader view of the battlefield, and you are allowed to position your adventurers wherever you like prior to starting the fight. This is advantageous for getting your ranged fighters and casters where they can be most effective, although you\u2019ll need to move all your characters around quite a bit during some fights. Once you start each battle, enemies will spawn from multiple locations on the map and attack, and you\u2019ll control your team members\u2019 movement and abilities in real-time while managing their health, mana, and ability cooldowns. The game\u2019s combat isn\u2019t unlike the Tactical View in EA and Bioware\u2019s Dragon Age games, and although you can\u2019t freeze the fight completely, there is a Slow Time button that you can use as much as you like when things get hairy. And things will get hairy; the first few fights might suggest otherwise, but once you have a full party and have to manage ranged DPS, melee, and healing/buffs in real time, you\u2019ll be glad you can slow things down occasionally.\n\n[H1]CONCLUSION[/H1]\n\nThere are plenty of time-worn fantasy tropes on display in Tower of Time, and I ran across a minor glitch or two, as well, but given its Early Access status and its very budget-friendly price of $15(also, 15% off until January 15), I think there\u2019s more than enough fun in this game to outweigh such concerns.\n\n[quote] This review was submitted for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/gaming_until_end]Gaming Until End[/url], through the generous contribution of [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/HellCowON]HellCow.[/url] [/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1515837103, "timestamp_updated": 1515837744, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39265975": {"recommendationid": "39265975", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993666152", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 232, "last_played": 1515883532}, "language": "english", "review": "For once an early access game that is playable not full of bugs and something that i want to return to.. nice !!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1515705981, "timestamp_updated": 1515705981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39186201": {"recommendationid": "39186201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112314609", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 763, "last_played": 1515967750}, "language": "english", "review": "Im realy suprised how good is this game.

Like drawing fire walls or cracking the earth or various other things.  It should be done more )\nEasy of Understanding - It's interface is easy to understand and get you right into the game.\nChallenges - Having the ability to get extra coins / gems if you can not progress is a good idea I had to use this a few times to get to next map.\n\nMIXED ATTITUDE\nLoot - doesn't feel special \n\nCONS\nFighting Maps - somewhat boring after continues sessions envirorment / fight repeative.\nVoice overs - None as of yet but it's early access yet few are avilable.\nChoice of Char -  I wish you could have some kind of choice or customization of your first character with it's voice or powers or any choice is gone.  \nUnlocking Char -  Since you can not choose your own character makes you somewhat annoyed you can not get more characters to choose.  \nStory Line - Somewhat confusing your going into a tower for a person yet was a boy yet  he's not a king yet somehow met this king,  made this guy a lord yet somehow, it's end of days or something ... LOL  I just started to go WTF is this story about... I don't like RPG that have endless texts and I enjoyed the smoke scenes but somewhat extra non-sense Fantasy story line.

Also i wish i could scroll in not just in combat but when exploring the levels in the game. I also do think that the game could benifit from allowing the use of a control, as there is not that many controls for the game and thus they could do a port to the consoles.\n\noverall Tower of time is a fantastic game that is due for release in april and all i can say its a must buy, i think it will become a cult classic, but because of the load screens in to combat and also in combat i could see the coding for my attacks in combat i can only give this game a 9.1/10", "timestamp_created": 1516539702, "timestamp_updated": 1516539702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}}}

I was pleasantly surprised.  The story is much more developed compared to SiM, and I enjoyed exploring Anna's phone.  The concept of the game was much more interesting than SiM, though I feel like it could still be better developed and hope the devs continue with this idea.  While the text speak used by the main \"players\" of the game was perfectly realistic, I felt that the primary antagonist of the game [spoiler]Simulacra[/spoiler] would not have the spelling errors I encountered in that character's texting.  For instance, the character used \"lead\" instead of \"led\" and \"it's\" when \"its\" was intended.  I know, I know, others might not have noticed or been affected by this, but I felt that the character would not have made those errors.\n\nOverall, the characters were better developed than SiM, definitely.  Anna was three-dimensional, and so were the characters we encountered.  Omitting Iris [spoiler]though of course allusions can be found in the website, thanks to the phone number and Morse Code[/spoiler], was a good decision.  I don't know if the plan is for DLC or sequels, but I look forward to a continuation of the Simulacra and/or Iris story-line, in this world where technology has a mind of its own.\n\nFor the devs:\n[list]\n[*]The ambiance is brilliant.  I love the room behind the phone, the lights flickering and the sounds around me.  It definitely creates an aura of suspense.\n[*]As far as jump scares, I agree with Night Mind, unnecessary, kind of lame, and ineffective.\n[*]What did solving the puzzles accomplish?  I mean, I don't know if I had to unscramble the photos and texts to progress, I just always do it to get it out of the way, but they don't, in the story, progress anything, really, [spoiler]until the Spark conversation with James[/spoiler].  Also they were really easy.  When you present me with a four-word scramble...come on.\n[*]Where is this supposed to take place?  The accents were peculiar.  It seemed like you were aiming for American, but you were using British spellings, i.e. favourite.  Is it meant to take place in Canada?\n[*]I did love the multiple endings, and felt much more invested in them than I did in SiM.  In particular, [spoiler]I just achieved the happy ending, and afterward, stared at the screen and said, \"Did I just get possessed?  I think I just got possessed.\"[/spoiler]\n[*][spoiler]Even if you're interviewing through text (for reasons?), why would you consider hiring a person to be a copywriter who makes that many spelling and grammatical errors?  I kept looking at my response options, and they were painful.  Yes, I understand you're not really applying and just trying to get information about James, but still.[/spoiler]\n[/list]\nAll that being said, I do hope you continue and would love to play any other games set in this world.  If you appreciate nothing else from my review, let it be: less is more.  Subtle horror is better than overt horror.  The idea that somebody might be in the room with you, where you're holding that phone, or the idea that you might lower the phone and see, I don't know, a floating disembodied head, was so much more effective than momentary flashes of the screen turning into something scary.  And if [spoiler]the final image had been the player lowering the screen and something vague and shadowy, or even a representation of the Simulacra, being there, and then moving toward the screen if you simply must jump scare, it would have been better than the shift in Anna's picture.[/spoiler]  It's the suspense that gets you, not the actual scare.  You don't have the suspense before the jump scares on the phone, just an image shift.\n\nNevertheless, public who have reached this far (or TLDR), I do recommend this game.  It isn't a long game, but I've spent...7 hours in it so far?

For such a low price I don't think it is a very risky investment, and if you are interested in narration in video games it could be a shame to miss it.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a perfect game, there is still room for improvement, especialy in how the game handles the player doing things out of order. But I would lie if I didn't say that I was glued to my screen from start to finish. Video games are truly different from non-interactive art forms, but sometimes it takes a game like SIMULACRA to remind us of it. To remind us that video games can create experiences that have never been made possible before.\n\nDespite some flaws, this game is a truly unique experience that I would encourage you to experience.  And to maybe leave a review when you are done with it, even if you didn't like it. Because I firmly believe that this is one of those games that can push the medium forward.\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE SCARY ASPECT : for people who are put off by the \"horror\" element of the game. THIS IS KINDA SPOILERIFIC, SO DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU ALREADY WANT TO TRY THE GAME.\n\nI am a bitch when it comes to horror games, and it is actually kind of a miracle that I decide to play this game.  Honestly, aside from a few jumpscares every now and then, this game is pretty chill. All of these jumpscares happen when going back to the main screen, so just lower the volume when pressing the HOME button on the phone and you'll be fine. Moreover (SPOILER) there is no jumpscare after the second backup reset, so don't worry after that point ;). All in all, don't be put off by the scary aspect of this game.

I had two minor complaints but in the end they didn't really interfere with my gameplay.\n\n1. Grey sounds like a cartoon character. However his voice acting can actually be averted by just hanging up on all his calls since he doesn't say anything meaningful outside his texts LOL\n\n2. Some of the text messages you 'fix' have multiple orders that make sense but the game only accepts one. But I found it;s not necessary to solve all the photos/texts to advance in the game. Usually the characters not-so-subtly tell you the minimum ones you have to solve to actually get info. At times I did feel like the text completion was a mechanic just to add more 'gameplay' besides just 'choose the answer'. But overall the messages were pretty easy to solve and it didn't really bother me.\n\nEdit: oh the other thing is that here are a LOT of typos in the text messages.

The game is not difficult: picture puzzles, word arranging, and some light fact searching comprise the bulk of the challenges. The meat of the game is in the dialogue choices, and this is where the replayability come from. You don't really get locked out of most options when taking/talking different ways, so you can express your moral flexibility without fearing that you'll reach a dead-end. As for content, they did a decent job of fleshing out with stuff that makes it feel like a \"lived with\" phone. The game does a good job of simulating smartphone usage with the apps, pics and their poses, vids, and social media content. A nice touch, is that there is a checklist of tasks that would help the truly clueless and serve as a guide for those looking for certain keystone events to play around with on subsequent playthroughs. This checklist is out of the way though for those who don't want hints on what to do next.\n\n\nOn the negative side, some of the voice acting, for me, was off if not \"unsuitable\". The delivery of the voice only lines truly felt and sounded \"rehearsed\". The VOs not sounding natural kind of sticks out like a sore thumb amid the aptness of the pictures and videos to a phone setting. The worst offender of this, sorry to say to the voice actor, is the Greg character. Truly, to me, it sounded like he was voicing a cartoon character instead of making a call, and it kind of took me out of the general mood of the game.\n\nI think, the ending, will be pretty hit or miss for some people as well. I want to liken how the ending progresses to one of the scenes in a movie, but that would probably spoil it a bit. It's just that most people that saw it back then went \"Wait what was that again?\" Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with the endings I got (two bad endings), but the way to the climax was tedious, especially since I don't know if there is a message skip button for when you are doing a replay and you know what is going to be said. A note on the endings I got, it seems like you get locked to a set of outcomes after some threshold. I know my choices at the end didn't end up changing any of my final options. \n\nAll in all, a decent casual horror sim game with some replayability, a fleshed out setting, hit or miss voice acting, and an endgame sequence (not ending, the stuff leading up to the ending) that'll make you go \"excuse you? whowherewhenhowwhywhatnow?\". \n\nFor now, at full price, it would depend on your affinity for games like these to buy it for around a 5 hour single playthrough (worth it if you go with the $1 per hour of gameplay mindset).

this game is probably \nBecause of it's story \n\nI myself might be too stupid to really understand the ending \nBut it seemed as in the ending i got the first time seemed to try to suck you into the ending to make you feel something i sadly didn't experience this\n\nI really like this game because i have a lot of questions to it too \n\nSPOILERS (sort of) \n\nWhat is the thing that kills them? \nHow does it work? \nWhere does it come from? \nIs it a demon or our own fear? \nWho is James? \nWhat happens really to Anna and Taylor? \n\n\nI don't know what to say\nBut after the first patch this game did something \nIt sort of made me scared of technology \n\nThe game showed us how dangerous the Internet can be\nSpark aka rebrand tinder\nShowed how dangerous it could be to meet a stranger

Sometimes, you just want to come over to your place. make yourself a cup of tea and just relax on comfortable chair and just enjoy some kinda easy game. Preferably, with a mouse only controls.\n\nBut to be honest, you need to be ready that games will be strange, or better call them weird or maybe even creepy in some kinda way, cause variety of the titles, that can be played with mouse only is pretty limited and you should expect only chinese visual novels, or some nonsense clickers, or easy tower defense games, or some puzzle logic games.\n\nOr it can be a game like Simulacra. I am not even sure how to call this genre, but what I really do know for sure - this game is completely stupid :) But, in a good funny way. They call it a simulation game, which is kinda fair, but doesn't cover the whole idea of this game. \n\nSo, you start the game playing as not a man, not a woman, just whoever the hell you are, sex is not specified in this game. You found a smartphone and this is where the whole stupid part is about to start. I mean like, imagine you are that person who found a phone, okay? What you gonna do? For me it's completely obvious and easy - if phone is unlockable, you simply need to find someone with a name Mom, Dad, Sister, Boyfriend, Dog in a contact list, call one of them and let them know that you found this device and return it as soon as possible. In case phone is locked, you just need to go to the police station and give it to them for the further actions. Easy as that, don't you think so? But not for our protagonist! Instead all of this, he/she decides to play around with this phone and read messages/mail, check web history, tinder-alike app - I mean like literally everything what you don't have to do, when you find someone's phone, cause this is simply embarassing. For the whole game I had that feeling that I was playing as a retard, who had no job, no personal life, no entertainment sources, literally nothing, so that phone was a greatest relief ever. \n\nBut, on the other hand, if that person wouldn't be that miserable and pathetic and wouldn't check that messages and videos on the camera roll - he wouldn't realize that phones belonged to someone who was desperately crying for help, stucked in some kinda danger. The more you click on that stupid phone the more stranger and uglier everything becomes, and you have to solve some kinda puzzles. All these puzzle things are more like \"choose the right answer\" in dialogues with a random people, talking about phone's owner, which is also a random person for you lol, which you shouldn't care about at all and all these combinations of answers lead you to different endings. Plus you have to recreate some corrupted messages, by putting words in the right order and renew corrupted photos by clicking on image pieces at the right order. Time to time, you will see ugly screamers on the phone, whose aim is to scarry you and like, to be honest, this one of the most ridiculous things in this game, cause I was laughing all the time when that was appearing on the screen, so I can't say that this game is a horror experience, it's more \"wannabe horror game\" , trying to be mysterious and creepy all the way ends up with a pretty shallow and a bit boring idea.\n\nHowever, I can recommend this game. It brings you some fresh new experience and can be funny a little bit plus you can relax after a busy stressful day by just clicking on the dialogue options and solving pretty easy puzzles trying to figure out what the hell is going on there. \n\nSo, to sum everything up!\nYou should grab this game if you: \n\n+ Feel like playing some easy game, where is no need for high concentration\n+ Are a Black Mirror TV show fan and like all this paranoic idea about how it can be bad somewhere in the future for us with all these high-tech devices\n+ Don't agree with me, that carrying a phone to the police station would be the best idea in this situation :)\n+ Just looking for a new experience\n\nAvoid this game if you:\n\n- Don't like illogical games, with a stupid protagonist who has no idea what the hell is he doing \n- Have no desire to try something new and unusual\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1516637633, "timestamp_updated": 1516637633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.600323", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39536551": {"recommendationid": "39536551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302543888", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1090, "last_played": 1516818797}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, very fascinating how they did it!", "timestamp_created": 1516633540, "timestamp_updated": 1516633540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39535793": {"recommendationid": "39535793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355087980", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 332, "last_played": 1516632747}, "language": "english", "review": "I enjoyed the mystery and the actual mystery-solving in this game.

Also, the spelling and grammar errors went a bit too far, beyond what one might consider realistic.

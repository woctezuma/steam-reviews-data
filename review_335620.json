You get quests to do with factions and you build rep and lose rep with others. There is a lot on the surface to keep you busy like adding skills to your crew which can be over 30 members as well as a few officers which get extra skills you can promote from within your ranks. The combat and Ship battles i found to be too easy. Once you have upgrade your weapons you will never die this is EAG i am sure they will balance the final product. \n\nI like the quests and the main quest line. problem is they offer quest that you can't do once you have purchased new ship you have no cabin or prison so you can't do any of the quests that need those, no way of adding those compartments to your ships at this point either.  \n\n I was hoping to find something with a bit more depth especialy with crew interactions and the way you interact with other ships. You can't hail them to ask what they are up to talk things out. Just blow them up or fly past/retreat. The game reminds me of a shallow lake. It's fun until you have explored all the lake when it's time to jump out the boat to explore the bottom it's only waist deep. I'd like to see more animation during rpg battles to bring up the excitment.  Sound and sound track are great. More Crew managment and rift between members to add to the dept.\n\nThis is the best space/crew manament game i have found. i believe it has a ton of promise. 8/10 so far they are working hard at the game and for and EA game i put in some time because the game is on the right path\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1516342654, "timestamp_updated": 1516342654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39450932": {"recommendationid": "39450932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264290267", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4223, "last_played": 1516413628}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game with lots of depth and complexity that is not forced on you; you can go as deeply as you'd like.

Les combats sont au tour par tour, relax, \u00e0 la souris, par Action Points et Talents, un syst\u00e8me proche de Smugglers sauf qu'ici, c'est pas r\u00e9p\u00e9tif, sans int\u00e9r\u00eat et trop long. Il y a plein de Talents, de tactique et de fa\u00e7on de mener le combat entre vaisseaux.\nIl y a aussi des combats terrestres, par exemple, quand on aborde le vaisseau ennemi, l\u00e0 aussi, c'est du tour par tour, dans le genre de Darkest Dungeon.\n\nMais il n'y a pas que du combat, loin de l\u00e0 !\nOn essaye d'ailleurs souvent de l'\u00e9viter ou de s'\u00e9chapper parce que les r\u00e9parations, \u00e7a co\u00fbte cher, l'\u00e9quipage \u00e7a se blesse, \u00e7a meurt. Il faut bien choisir ses combats.\n\nAlors c'est un jeu d'aventure/jeu de r\u00f4le avec de la strat\u00e9gie. Free roaming/Sandbox.\nLa vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de Jobs, vaisseaux, \u00e9quipage, talents, traits de caract\u00e8re permet plein de styles de jeu m\u00eame moins violents.\n\nAvec la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de cartes, la rejouabilit\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s \u00e9l\u00e9v\u00e9e.\nLe jeu r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un environnement vivant.\nJ'ai commenc\u00e9 plusieurs saves et j'ai vraiment le sentiment que c'est une aventure diff\u00e9rente. M\u00eame un membre d'\u00e9quipage de longue date n'est pas le m\u00eame qu'un autre. Il y a un soin apport\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er, comme \u00e7a, un environnement avec du caract\u00e8re.\n\nJe recommande, pour la premi\u00e8re partie, de commencer par la difficult\u00e9 la plus facile pour apprendre un peu les ficelles.\nC'est tr\u00e8s simple \u00e0 prendre en main et on s'amuse tout de suite mais, comme dans les bons jeux, il va falloir du temps avant de bien ma\u00eetriser.\n\nIl y a un autosave, on ne revient pas en arri\u00e8re pour faire autrement. C'est bien, chaque d\u00e9cision est importante.\nMais ce n'est pas un roguelike pur et dur. On peut faire des erreurs et s'en remettre. Le jeu ne cherche pas \u00e0 \u00eatre frustrant \u00e0 tout prix. \nLes membres d'\u00e9quipage peuvent mourrir et aussi les officiers et le Capitaine aux difficult\u00e9s plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s. L\u00e0 aussi, c'est jouable et pas trop hardcore, attention \u00e0 ne pas prendre trop de risque avec le Capitaine, sa mort est la fin de la partie.\n\nPour moi, \u00e7a se joue comme un jeu d'aventure.\n\nOn cr\u00e9e un Capitaine ou on prend un des mod\u00e8les. On parcours le monde \u00e0 la poursuite de son destin, l'avenir est incertain, il faut survivre. On va pouvoir commercer, combattre, voler, rencontrer des contacts, remplir des missions pour leur compte, gagner leurs faveurs, \u00e9quiper nos combattants, am\u00e9liorer le vaisseau, peut-\u00eatre en acheter un autre, explorer des mondes sauvages pour en piller les ressources, espionner les factions pour revendre du renseignement, patrouiller les mondes contre les pirates et les espions, bloquer les mondes pour voler les marchands ou les contre-bandiers, vendre des biens ill\u00e9gaux au march\u00e9 noir, escorter des personnages importants, \u00eatre l'envoy\u00e9 d'un contact pour n\u00e9gocier en son nom, prendre parti dans un conflit, etc, etc, pour manipuler le monde pour notre b\u00e9n\u00e9fice.\n\nOn peut faire un peu de tout au d\u00e9but mais, \u00e0 terme, il faut mieux orienter son vaisseau et son \u00e9quipage pour \u00eatre efficace sur quelques activit\u00e9s.\n\nIl y a des missions Story mode mais totalement optionnelles, le jeu est vraiment sandbox.\nLe jeu ouvre sur la premi\u00e8re, comme un forme d'introduction. La premi\u00e8re mission, genre \"taxi\", est courte, rapide et paye bien.\nApr\u00e8s sans spoiler, on peut faire ou pas mais \u00e7a va devenir, bon pas tout de suite, mais relativement vite relativement chaud, c'est plus pour des joueurs d\u00e9j\u00e0 avanc\u00e9s. A chacun de voir, il faut juste savoir que \u00e7a n'apporte pas d'avantage particulier pour d\u00e9marrer et qu'il y a plein de choses \u00e0 faire \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nOn peut faire rien, tout ou partie du story mode, les histoires avancent et se terminent ind\u00e9pendamment de ce que fait le joueur.\n\nLe c\u00f4t\u00e9 jeu de r\u00f4le.\n\nC'est un parfait sandbox pour roleplay les Jobs. En choisissant bien les Skills, les Talents, l'\u00e9quipage, le set-up du vaisseau, avec les bons contacts, le capitaine peut devenir un tr\u00e8s efficace chasseur de t\u00eates qui accepte des contrats pour traquer et ex\u00e9cuter les criminels. Ou bien un pirate ou un espion ou un explorateur. Toutes les carri\u00e8res sont vraiment viables. \nLe Capitaine et l'\u00e9quipage gagnent de l'XP, montent en niveau, am\u00e9liorent leurs Skills et, de temps en temps, apprennent un Talent qu'il est important de bien choisir. Au d\u00e9but, il faut pas mal de Talent Skill saves. Plus tard, il y a des Talents qui vraiment facilitent la vie.\nParce que, h\u00e9 h\u00e9, il se passe des choses en arri\u00e8re-fond m\u00eame pour un simple voyage d'un syst\u00e8me \u00e0 un autre. Il y a des jets de d\u00e9s permanents qui sont check contre les comp\u00e9tences de l'\u00e9quipage ou du capitaine. Il peut y avoir un incident, un malade, une bagarre, etc qui endommage un composant du vaisseau ou la sant\u00e9, le moral de l'\u00e9quipage. Il y a parfois des (mauvaises) surprises. C'est surtout au d\u00e9but, \u00e7a se calme quand tout le monde s'aguerrit et avec les Skill saves. Il y a un log qui permet de voir dans quel domaine les jets de d\u00e9s ne passent pas pour y rem\u00e9dier.\nC'est int\u00e9ressant d'explorer la panoplie des Talents qui est tr\u00e8s large pour obtenir le build que l'on veut.\n\nEt heu... le contexte politique.\n\nIl y a 9 factions qui contr\u00f4lent leurs syst\u00e8mes et quadrants. Il y a aussi des mondes ind\u00e9pendants. Et on d\u00e9couvrira d'autres factions mais chut ! Et peut-\u00eatre d'autres trucs aussi...\n\nLes moeurs interdisent aux factions de se mener une guerre ouverte et les conflits sont r\u00e9solus en suivant des r\u00e8gles que l'on appelle la Shalun Law. En bref, la guerre est codifi\u00e9e et limit\u00e9e pour \u00e9viter l'auto-destruction de la race humaine comme cela a failli arriver par le pass\u00e9. Pas de Death Star ou d'invasion plan\u00e9taire mais essentiellement des combats de vaisseaux et des assassinats cibl\u00e9s.\n\nLe Capitaine gagne et perd de la r\u00e9putation aupr\u00e8s de chaque faction en fonction de ses actions.\n\nG\u00e9rer la r\u00e9putation est s\u00fbrement l'aspect le plus difficile au d\u00e9but car on en perd facilement plus qu'on en gagne si on est un peu bourrin, et m\u00eame sans l'\u00eatre.\nAlors, on apprend vite que d\u00e9truire un vaisseau et son \u00e9quipage est un acte tr\u00e8s grave m\u00eame si c'est de l'auto-d\u00e9fense. Il faut mieux neutraliser le vaisseau en d\u00e9truisant ses composants vitaux et en l'abordant. Tuer le capitaine adverse, si on a la chance de le rencontrer est une victoire instantan\u00e9e.\n\nUne bonne r\u00e9putation avec une faction permet d'avoir de meilleures relations avec les contacts, d'avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de meilleurs services, meilleures recrues, d'acheter des grades, des permis.\nUne mauvaise r\u00e9putation fait progressivement perdre le droit de commercer, de refuel, de r\u00e9paration, de soins, on devient un criminel, on nous tire \u00e0 vue, on a un bounty sur la t\u00eate et si on nous attrappe, c'est l'ex\u00e9cution sommaire.\n\nEt donc les tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressants contacts.\n\nCe sont des personnages qui d\u00e9tiennent des positions influentes au sein d'une faction, un juge, un ancien espion, un prince.\nIls offrent des missions et des services qui d\u00e9pendent de leur fonction et de leur influence.\n\nLe Capitaine a une r\u00e9putation personnelle aupr\u00e8s d'eux qui se conjugue avec celle de leur faction.\n\nOn commence avec un petit carnet d'adresse que l'on d\u00e9veloppe au cours des voyages ou en \u00e9tant introduit par un contact connu.\nC'est par eux que l'on peut obtenir par exemple des recrues \u00e0 job rare, des permis ou, dans le cas de types plus louches, un acc\u00e8s au march\u00e9 noir. \n\nLeur influence varie, elle n'est pas toujours suffisante pour obtenir ce que l'on veut d'eux. On peut les aider \u00e0 en gagner en travaillant pour eux et ils peuvent en perdre pendant qu'on a le dos tourn\u00e9.\n\nJe trouve cette partie particuli\u00e8rement bien r\u00e9ussie, c'est random d'un save \u00e0 l'autre et \u00e7a donne donc beaucoup de vari\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame sur la m\u00eame carte.\n\nPerso, je suis compl\u00e8tement conquis par ce jeu.

I have a habit of rambling. If I can turn a Civ V review into a six paragraph diatribe about the merits of the refined policies system, I'd surely turn any review of Star Traders: Frontiers into an epic that would require at lest five full to-the-character-limit reviews worth of space.\n\nInstead I'll try to hit the overarching points. Just know this: This game is HUGE. It is INTRICATE. It has more to it than I could ever effectively gush about in a single review. That said, here are some of the most pressing points:\n\n+ The world feels alive. Each system you generate comes together in an organic and realistic way, with countless characters vying for position within a handful of factions which themselves are competing for resources and influence... and any one of those characters could potentially be a contact who gives you work and helps you advance your own position in the galaxy. It all comes together so beautifully.\n\n+ With so much meat to the game, it can be a little overwhelming to orient yourself at first. Once you do, though, everything actually feels relatively tight and sleek to play. All the information you need is at your fingertips at all times, you just have to get familiar with which buttons to click to get what. Combat feels reminiscent of games like Darkest Dungeon, which was one of the immediate appeals for me, but that's only such a very small sliver of what you can do in this game.\n\n+ The quest system even goes the extra mile in making the world feel alive, letting you choose a variety of options that kind of feel cosmetic, yet can have an effect based on stat rolls make for your crew. Will you meet with your mission-giver in the public square, with a bunch of pomp and pageantry as you pass off the parcel to him? It'll take less time if you meet him in a shady spice den, but you'll generate reputation if you do it with all the ceremony. Or maybe you want to make him come to you; really show everyone how important you are... at the risk of offending this person who your actions just helped make more influential in the galaxy. These are the kinds of decisions you make.\n\n+ You know what? I can't even. I'm already starting to ramble. If you really want to know about the game, watch at LEAST three hours worth of a Youtube Let's Play on it, and then you'll BEGIN to scratch the surface of the content. Words truly can't do it justice, and that's not hyperbole in this case.\n\nThe few issues I have with the game all have counterpoints that offset them:\n\n- It's too bad the factions aren't also procedurally generated, but having them preset does allow for better storytelling and inter-faction dynamics. Fortunately, their position in the galaxy IS different with each new game; all that's pretedermined seems to be their aesthetics and mentalties.\n\n- I'd love to see this game in full 3D, but such a project would be MASSIVELY ambitious. On the plus side, the 2D aesthetic the game uses is wonderful and at times downright gorgeous planet-side. The variety in customizable crew appearances is respectable; I'd like a bit more, but I'd ALWAYS like a bit more. Objectively there are a solid handful of options that make each crew member feel like an individual, and I'm very happy with both the variety and the aesthetic itself.\n\n- The lack of a tutorial can make things seem rather overwhelming, but I honestly don't know how one would IMPLEMENT a tutorial for a game this open and chock full of content. Fortunately, there's a nice, immersive way to call up some help dialogue about any screen in the game via calling your officers for \"advice\", at which point they'll regale you with most of what you need to know about what you're currently looking at.\n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve, but I wouldn't call it \"steep\". I got comfortable with the game's basic operations within about an hour. But do be aware that when you're getting into this one, you're getting a TON of stuff, and you might find yourself lost and confused for choice. My advice is to come in with a plan. Know who your captain is, was, or will be, and let that guide how you play. You might find yourself deviating from that and that's fine, but having that clear concept helps in getting your feet wet.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, I STRONGLY recommend it. The blasted thing is underpriced if you ask me. I've paid $40 for games with a quarter of the depth this game has; fun games, too. But I'd recommend maybe looking at some Youtube footage first to make sure you're ready for the deluge of cool stuff the game is gonna throw your way.\n\nObjective 8/10, 9/10 within the space game genre, 10/10 within its genre/subgenre/aesthetic niche.

You buy and sell things to trade, you doctorize your crew to fix illnesses, repair your ship, fuel it up. Your crew can leave, you can recruit more, they level up and you can train them in jobs and skills. There's a BIG STORY THING which is presented in visual novel-ish way and you can choose different options with different risks offset by your various skills.\n\nThe initial impression I got after playing about an hour and a half is that this is a huge world filled with people and it's very Crusader Kings IIish in that you have factions and royalty and allegiances and stats and people with traits and so on. I'm not sure how much of this is procedurally-generated and how much of it you could change by interfering. I'm also, obviously, not aware of how much the story could change if you do different things. At least at this stage though there seems to be a world of possibility out there.\n\nMy very first impressions of the presentation and interface were a bit disappointing. The full body view of a person with 2D bone mechanics and an \"idle animation\" that makes them look a bit like a stringed puppet coupled with the almost total lack of sound effects and something about the UI made me think of it as a mobile game. There are tooltips on things though, which is a relief. The escape key seems to be used as a universal \"back\" shortcut in addition to there being back buttons on the interface (although there is a small bit of confusion as some screens have an x at top right to back out and some have a \"back arrow\" at bottom left). It would be nice if the right mouse button could be used to do the same thing as the escape key so the game could be played with the mouse only without having to move to the back buttons.\n\nI quickly got caught up in the abundant stats and skills though and mostly forgot about the presentation. The music is in a similar vein to FTL but obviously not as good.\n\nI didn't manage to get into person-based firefights yet but I got to test the ship to ship combat which is very nice. Rather than being tactical and grid-based the ships are shown facing each other with a number representing the distance between them. Different weapons work at different distances. You have options to move your ship towards or (I think) away, or maybe just escape. You can use weapons and you can use various skills you have as if they are cards in a board game to mitigate damage, cast off disabling effects, increase weapon damage and things like that. It's not like FTL where you walk your crew round the ship closing doors and putting out fires if that was what you were expecting, it's more like the turn-based combat you might find in a 4X space game although from the interface I'm guessing (could be wrong) that it's only ever 1 v 1 in ship battle. Animation of weapons being used was pretty good.\n\nAll in all it seems very good and I'm looking forward to playing more when I get time.

Whether following the story or playing pure sandbox, the world in this game feels very much alive by way of economy, politics, and your own network of contacts. As a captain of a starship, you're in control of a crew and the ship itself. From there, what you do and who you become is entirely up to you. In that regard, it is a great RPG. It is also a turn-based tactical combat game when it comes to the ship-to-ship and crew-to-crew fights. Finally, there are serious strategy elements similar to Mount & Blade in terms of how you position yourself within the hierarchy of characters in the galaxy. (But, similar to games like The Witcher, your character is a Star Trader, a class unto itself, who will never go on to lead a faction or become Emperor of the galaxay.) The game is immediately accessible for anyone who wants to jump in and start exploring the galaxy, but it is also deceivingly and rewardingly complex; after all these hours, I am still figuring out the various nuances of the game. \n\nLastly, the game developers deserve a special shout out. In Early Access, they're very active on the discussion boards and are very good in responding to questions and suggestions.

Definitely worth a buy. I will only focus on the (minor) negatives here, in hopes the devs might take a look at them:\n\n- It is very annoying to pay wages every month, considering that is approximately every 3 minutes in this game. Why do I have to land to pay my crew? That makes no sense. Why is there no auto-pay like there is auto-refuel? It makes a little more sense, although only a little more, that even if I have tons of medical bays in my ship, that I also have to land to heal my people (or get into a ship combat so I can use skills). In general, it feels like you are forced to land much more than is natural in this game. Somehow I can have a doctor trait to cure the local population with my medical bays for rep and simultaneously be unable to cure my own people.\n\n- The achievements are all time-limited, and some of them are quite difficult and luck-based (find 15 xeno artifacts in 5 years? good luck w/o L11 exo-scout skill, which is hard to get in that timeframe). There should be a mix of \"gimme\" achievements and harder ones. And I think most of them should not be time-limited, because there is no possible way currently to get all the achievements without restarting many times.\n\n- Some of the quests are literally impossible, like do 4 jumps to a target and 4 jumps back in 32 weeks.\n\n- I broke the main arbiter quest at some point by failing a check to bribe some guards, I think I was supposed to rescue some prisoner. Once I failed, I couldn't try again or progress in any way I could find.\n\n- Ship encounters seem somewhat too frequent. You will likely run into 3-4 ships per quadrant. I would gladly take an \"autocalc battle\" option for ship and crew combat, even if it meant I took more damage, because it would save me lots of time on easy encounters.\n\n- It can become really tedious to assign skills to all your crew. There is a checkbox on character creation for \"auto-assign traits\", but that apparently only works for the initial crew. A feature that auto-assigns skills for non-officer characters (possibly excluding certain designated, useful characters like merchants and spies) would be useful.\n\n- Despite the game being called \"Star Traders\", trading is a fairly unprofitable activity, at least measured in terms of real time per $$$. And it took me awhile, but I finally realized that there is really no major effect of supply or demand other than \"buy in a supply zone type and sell in a demand zone type\". If you trade basic goods with a skeleton crew, you will still run at a (major) loss, which should not be the case. If you get high-level trading permit, you might find that at most 20% of income will come from trading.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, and I'm excited to see it realize it.

Or maybe fire almost all your crew, buy a tiny ship, fit it with a luxury passenger cabin and pretend that it's your captain's retirement.  :D\n\n* The number of possible paths in terms of things to do is promisingly high (trading legitimately, trying to cultivate contacts with black market access, playing space pirate, spying and selling the resulting data, exploring wilderness; staying in the service of one faction, floating around to others, etc), although it remains to be seen how well one can interact with the story-related events if, say, you're going as a pacifist merchant.  At the moment, it appears easier to interact with if you build for combat power (e.g. Bounty Hunter start) rather than something more subtle like a Spy captain.  The main story is also not yet complete (EA!).  Interacting with the story isn't mandatory, but it would be good if there are many ways to do so.\n\n* It would be good to have documentation aside from the wiki, but... EA.  Systems, mechanics, UI are still being worked on, so there's definitely stuff to do before working on an official manual or tutorial or what-not.\n\n* You can't be primarily a landlubber, though; nor are you a fleet commander.  You're the captain of one ship at a time, who may own other ships (but they'll be staying in drydock when you're not using them).  There's no option for being the ruler of a planet or anything like that.\n\n* Combat is one-on-one for space combat, with certain ship and crew builds possibly favoring specific ranges; and with choice of crew/officers mattering a lot for four-on-four crew battles.  It's all strictly turn-based with some hidden information (e.g. you don't know what talents -- abilities -- or exact equipment your opponents have, although you find out when they're actually used).  It's not exactly \"Silent Storm\"-complex, but it's not pretending to be.\n\n* There is a risk of RNG playing a bit of an outsize role with hit locations and critical hits at least in ship combat -- e.g. loss of your one engine -> loss of fight.  Playing on lower difficulties will mitigate said risks if those bother you; e.g. on the lowest difficulty, you and your officers are basically immortal (can be defeated in a fight but will always survive) even in events that would lead to loss on high difficulties (like surrendering to a faction that hates you so much that they'll execute you given the chance).   You can also avoid a lot of combat by bribing your way out relatively cheaply, or by having skills that significantly increase your ability to escape a fight once it starts.\n\n* Dev team is small but extremely responsive as far as I can tell, and updating frequently.

Very repetitive gameplay starting from the start everytime i die (all those lvl ups for the crew every time). It is a Rogue-like with no manual in game save system; only 1 auto save per game. Perma death in hard ++ mode. While not 'bad' it does mean that every time you do die in perma death, it takes ages to build up a crew again . . . only to have 1 bad RnG event wipe you out again.\n\n The dev's are very active, so i feel confident they will eventually get to a better balance pass. But right now, if you have high blood preasure you may want to wait a little.\n\n\n----------------------------\n\n01 / 02 / 2018 ------ 12 hrs in. Still getting rekt on ~BASIC~ lol. Though i think i'm almost ready for normal.

It's here!\n\nI'm not going to focus on the flaws of the game because, honestly, what can you expect when there's still active development? \n\nDon't let its Early Access status scare you away though, the Trese Brothers are hyper vigiliant in updating content for fixes and bugs and incorporating most requests. They are active and listen to their fans and you're guaranteed nothing but improvements and enhancements. As it stands, for being Early Access this game already has a TON to offer and I'm impressed with the depth of gameplay already. You can easily get lost in the universe as is and enjoy a full gaming experience. The game runs smoothly and I've yet to encounter a glitch. There's a bit of a learning curve if you're new to the Star Traders franchise, but there is a lot in the way of resources here and elsewhere on the webs in with an active player base and the Trese Brothers both being quick to answer questions. \n\nIf you're new to the Star Traders franchise I'll try my best to give you an idea of the game. It's a rogue-like sandbox rpg where you are your own star captain in charge of a ship trying to make their way in the galaxy, you can do that however you like, my favorite is to go for spying and or bounty hunting with a dash of exploration. You may just find it better to become a merchant instead. There's really no correct way to play the game except to strive to survive and then strive. \n\nNow, as I said, this is a rogue like game, what that means is that you must be very careful because there is no save point. Your game gets saved when you exit, but if you screw your ship up and have 0 creds and are stranded in the middle of space with a ship about to blow up, you can't simply restore a save point, it's game over. I bring this up because I notice a lot of individuals requesting a save system or complaining that none exists, that's as intended because the game was not meant to play like a game where your actions have limited consequences, and tbh, that detracts from the alure of the game and reduces the imersiveness of the game so, if you are absolutely tied to the hip to save points, maybe this game isn't for you, but maybe you give it a go and realize you enjoy this type of play to :-)\n\nI may update my review as time goes on, but right now all I can do is rave incoherently. \n\nTL;DR \n\nEven if this game is in development, it's very well in depth and provides immersive sandbox rogue-like rpg gameplay. \nIt'll only gain more depth in the coming months and even after its official release\nIf you're a vet of the ST franchise or Trese Brothers Games, I encourage you to buy this game now because I'm sure you know it can only improve and gain features like all their other games.\nIf you're new to the ST franchise or Trese Brothers Games, this game is supported by highly dedicated devs looking to always improve the game and your experience and they listen.\nIf you're new you'll also want to sit back and ask yourself if you're okay with a game that does't have a save point.\n\nMore updates to this review when I can think of more things to say.", "timestamp_created": 1514701751, "timestamp_updated": 1514701751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38863978": {"recommendationid": "38863978", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961453170", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514658642}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm a pirate.", "timestamp_created": 1514647067, "timestamp_updated": 1514647067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459915", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38850364": {"recommendationid": "38850364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187265291", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5403, "last_played": 1516439917}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is deeper than any screenshot or video can show you. \nIt's deeper than the impression you get even 5 hours into it.\n\nThe only games that come close to building a dynamic, interlinked world simulating economy, strife, and intrigue is the paradox games of EU4/CK2. I'm not going on hyperbole here - the world in this game is alive. \n\nit is a roguelike that will last you a day, a week, a month, or many months depending on success and failure. \n\nit is a roguelike unlike any other game. I honestly cant make an elevator pitch to illustrate what you'd be getting into. the only thing i can say is that it makes Original Star Traders look like a simplified, Mobile hack of this game - and considering Star Traders for mobile was the deepest strategy game ive played on mobile - this is no small praise.\n\nThis game is a min/max'ers dream because you can never 'get it' and coast. Every action is not linked to one stat, but 2, or 3, or more. A simple first pass min/max attempt for 'ezwinz' doesnt exist, here. The world is alive and you cannot tame it by doing a middlign effort min-max to get OP status. If you coasted through Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2 in a breeze on highest difficulty - this might be for you. If you loved the complexity of interlink/connectivity of RimWorld but needed a visceral RPG element where you had immediate goals to stay alive - this might be for you. if you are looking for a game unlike any other strategic RPG - this might be for you\n\nIt's an open world unlike any other open world.\nMy biggest issue with open world games is they come in two flavors: amazing combat and theme but lacking a 'real world' at all (See Wasteland2 - amazing game). it's just a series of boss fights and baldurs gates style maps to loot. the world is completely scripted, unmoving, unbreathing, unchanging, and the factions, npcs, events are all disconnected from your actions through it. any second playthrough is lackluster. then there's another open world game type: the Skyrim/Witcher - these games give you large, expansive worlds - but are again stagnant, unmoving. They dont live. Did you spend 10 hours waging war between City B and A for two different nations in Skyrim? nothing happens to affect the that nation or the neighbors. They just feel like chapters you walk through, a world that is at most a haunted house, and by no means alive.\n\nST is alive. It's just not easy to see in those pictures. It's again not easy to see as you go through the galaxy and see this chaotic spam of events (news) coming at you - but later, when you are no longer getting your sea legs, and you are big enough to understand the game of houses you realize that this is a dynamic, wartorn area and you have to ride the waves of conflict and intrigue to make money and grow. and you can do this in soooooooo many ways. more on that later.\n\nmany open world games have the problem of \"ok, its big, its grand. but its so non-linear that i am BORED\" sandbox games suffer from this - without a direct goal, you kind of lose urgency. in ST just staying alive and succeeding pigeonholes you into succeeding at all costs, through any means you can, to progress or die. Unlike too-open sandboxes, you always have immediate and long term goals. and in achieving those goals the world around you helps you, and hinders you, as it goes about its chaotic game of factions. there are missions (quest like) but that is not what you 'do'. The missions you take from NPCs are but a quarter, or less, of the missions you do for YOURSELF. You know you have to jump 4 sectors - in these 4 jumps you will plan out one way Trades where you pick up from one supply Market, dump to a demand Market, so that you are running cargo for profit just traveling the sector, you will be listening to rumors to take a detour in case there is a conflict or event that triggers rare success in specific mission types, you will hunt down VIP targets like smugglers, you will look for upgrades, and note prices.... in other words, this is a game wher eyou are giving yourself quests dynamically as you do a main quest, or pursue a main goal. This is the next innovation in gaming instead of 'go to npc, get quest, complete quest, collect reward' snooooore.

It's not at all terrible!  ^_^  But it'll need some polish before getting to 1.0\n~ Graphical distinctions for weapons, armor, etc.  Currently there is a lot of rubber-stamp ships staffed with rubber-stamped characters.\n~ UI is in rapid development, but will need more Ease of Use work before it's truly ready\n~ While the graphics are passable, they'll need to go just a bit further than they already are in one direction or another.  Either towards the flat Tactical RPG style, or the cell-shade Story RPG style.  Currently dabbles in both (and looks good!) but still needs to level up a bit.\n~ Extreme expansion of weapons, armor, and equipment (reluctant to mention this, as it's already planned!)\n\nNegatives:\n- Old School design, lacking in any real deep instructions.  (I take this as a positive... but many may not!)\n- EA bugs (mostly script / visual / balance, not crashes or glitches)\n- Some storylines abruptly end (again, see EA)\n\nSuggestions:\n?  Would definitely suggest distinct factional traits, strengths, etc.\n?  Desperately needs a proceedurally generated, random loot and equipment system.  A little Diablo or Torchlight would go a LONG ways in a game like this.\n?  Ships need to be more empty than they are currently, and rely more on tonnage and less on 'slots'.  This allows more lateral customization and variations of a single design (... but also min-maxing, for better or worse)\n?  Consider mod support.

(This is something that needs to be addressed soon, there needs to be a way to save what you are doing on a planet and be able to go back to the main menu and log out of the game.)\n\n2. Your crew CAN and WILL be damaged while flying through space, as the game generates events that the crew will have to roll against. So make sure to keep track of how damaged they are and visit the Medical facilities on planet to get them healed up.\n\n3. Money will be tight in the beginning including if you are an actual Trader. So make sure to try to stay on top of your money intake and outlays.\n\n4. You are on your own in the beginning without any explanation to what is a normal guideline for Key Stats, and Skills.

This increases rep and then opens doors to better rewards and more missions.   Your basic RPG style.   You can choose just to trade, smuggle, or be a pirate if you like too.   But you will have the chance to do all these things when completing the missions.   So why not make a little extra?\n\nYou upgrade your character as you level up by earning XP.   You use money to upgrade your ship and pay your crew.   And that's where this game really shines to me.   Crew Management.\n\nCrew management means that along with your Captain Character, your crew will level up as well.   Your captain and your officers can have three jobs.  All other crew have can only have one job.   Jobs open access to special use skills for combat, mini games (smuggling, exploring, spying, etc. are all minigames), and back ups in the event of failed saving throws.

If you take your small ship against a much bigger ship and expect to win cause your a speical kind of snowflake, then surprise!! You will die. I have always hated games where you can number crunch and make an all powerful snowflake, or replay your last mistake instead of taking the hit and learning from it. I think you will find the hours fly by when you start playing this game.\n\n2) This universe can grow. we could see the rise of new houses or empires. New aliens races or cults could be added in also. New ships, armor and weapons. I think this game will have alot of support in its future.

Trese Brothers has a long history of updating their games well after release, so I fully expect they will continue to work on it until that potential has been realized.\n\nIf you rage at rogue-like games where a couple bad decisions or random events could cause a death-spiral, then this is probably also not the game for you.  (Save-scumming is possible with a little technical know-how, but there's no manual saving as I write this.)\n\nThere are legitimate complaints that there can be an annoying mixture of hidden complexity, purely random outcomes, and a lack of options/control.  (Complaints that the developer actively listens to and  engages in fruitful discussions.)\n\nBut if you're looking for a single-player, moderately open-world, turn-based space adventure game, you're in luck.  If you'd like to help influence the development of such a game, now would be the time to get it and join in.\n\n[h1]Personal History/Take[/h1]\nThe original Star Traders on Android was my first and deepest experience with Trese Brothers.  I've bought every game of theirs since, either on Google Play or Steam.  I did it because I believe they needed rewarded for the sheer commitment they show to their games.  That original Star Traders game?  It's [b]still[/b] getting updates, even years later as they work on the sequel.\n\nUnfortunately, Trese Brothers games were in a sort of awkward place for me--too involved to be a \"play it for 10 minutes every other week\" mobile game, but not involving enough to compete with \"real games\" on the PC.\n\nST:F changes that for me.  Even in this early version, I see the game as a worthy addition to my Steam list and it's rapidly climbing my game list in terms of time spent playing.\n\n[h1]A Mostly Open-World Space Adventure[/h1]\nJust create a character and go.  You start out with a ship (including crew) and get introduced to the game's storyline.  Run with that story or completely ignore it and go do whatever you want to do.  You can be a simple trader, a privateer, a hired gun, a military officer, an explorer, a spy, or any mixture of the above.\n\nJust be prepared:  Probably at least 1/3 of the galaxy will end up hating you.  Most missions are going to be against a faction (who aren't going to appreciate it).  Selling goods could cause someone to hate you.    Hell, just passing by a ship can cause you to lose a little bit of reputation.\n\nYou are not alone in flying through space.  Your ship has a crew and officers.  Your crew level up as you do things and can gain \"talents\" which are special abilities such as saves for certain bad conditions, special attacks, and the like.  Each crewmember has their own traits and morale.  Too many bad things happening at once or just continued neglect (such as not paying them) may cause a crewmember leave--or, if enough of the crew becomes demoralized, you could literally have a mutiny on your hands.\n\nThe overworld portion is definitely the highlight for now:  Flying through space (with the game tossing dice in the background to see if you pass skill checks).  Landing on planets.  Managing your ship/crew.  Maybe a little trading.  Talking to contacts to get services and missions.\n\nContacts are a key addition over the original mobile game.  They are your interface with a given faction.  If you don't have a contact with an associated faction, you can't get missions, get ranks/permits, or even pay to absolve your transgressions.  Getting in good with a contact generally gets you better/more of what they offer.\n\nThere are a few different mission types, but most are the usual fetch/carry quest or kill/capture something quest.  There are some special-purpose quests like \"spy on someone\" or \"explore this unpopulated area/planet\".  Again, usually a mission will gain you reputation with the issuing faction (as well as the contact), but at the cost of reputation of another.\n\nMissions lead to what is probably the weaker elements of the game at this early stage.\n\nExploring, patrolling, and spying all use \"cards\".  You're shown five result cards.  You press a button and four cards slowly disappear.  The remaining card is your result.  The result may trigger a battle or a save roll.  Some crew talents let you modify the cards before pressing the button, but that's it really.  The process has all the strategy of pulling the arm of a slot machine.\n\nShip battles offer a little more in the area of strategy.  Each turn you can decide if you want to advance/retreat, then what weapons to use, and finally if you want to activate any crew talents.  Both sides execute their selected actions.  Rinse and repeat until one ship escapes or is destroyed/disabled.  The only variation is the ability to send a boarding crew, which takes us to crew combat\u2026\n\nIf you've played Darkest Dungeon, you know the basics of crew combat--4v4 turn-based battles where individuals have special abilities, usually tied to party position.  It's the most strategic of the \"doing stuff\" part of the game.

Their games ooze charisma, style, and they cater to tactics and strategy gamers (you owe it to yourself to pick up Templar Battleforce).  I will even admit I have not necessarily enjoyed every game they made, and that's ok, my two personal favorites TB and ST:F are beyond amazing.\n\nBoth the bros are friendly and respond to every comment on the forums.  Not only that, they will support their games long after release with bug fixes and free content updates.  I've been apart of EA for games like Darkest Dungeon and Battle Brothers, and if it means anything to you, the Trese bros utterly destroy the other indie companies I mentioned in terms of how they've handled their EA title.\n\nIn an industry where games will nickle and dime you in their best attempt to get you to drop +$100 on their AAA titles, the $15 for ST:F is more than worth it.  These guys get better and better with every game they make and I'm happy to see they're on steam and making titles not just for mobile devices any more.\n\nSo, support the Trese bros, enjoy their amazing games, and pray they don't kill themselves coding and designing these works of art.", "timestamp_created": 1512776827, "timestamp_updated": 1512776827, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.647590", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38146951": {"recommendationid": "38146951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008288736", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3901, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513844684}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a good game, i played mostly merchant, and its fun to balance out reputation and make tradepermits with every faction, it needs a lot more content and easter eggs, like different weapons, alien loot, more upgrades , ship variety, and stuff to do once you become big enough to handle every situation, like endgame content so you have something to keep playing and hunt for , like rares or legendarys or specials, that are hard to find....at least the game has a lot potential for a rather simple game.There are some annoying things like even highest trade permits sometimes dont allow you to trade something but when the game is finished it could be great.", "timestamp_created": 1512716988, "timestamp_updated": 1512716988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38140083": {"recommendationid": "38140083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027971581", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512692325}, "language": "english", "review": "Very bad, avoid like plague.\n\nAny space combat will cripple you and no chance to repair.\nEncountered neutralexplorer, only interaction option: surrender or fight.

Even after dozens of hours of gameplay I am still learning new things and reaching new thresholds and seeing there is more. The game gets more complex as you face the concequences and rewards of your choies.\n***END***\n[TLDR]\nThis game is basicly Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader d20 RPG Rule Set in a Procedurally Generated Map with a ton of Factions arguing over who shoudl be in charge of the galaxy. \n\n***Overview***\nThe Meat of the game is doing missions, trading, and a card based mini game that shows you all the possible outcomes before you try something and allows you to use your crews abilities to give you some rerolls on the card choices. It is actually quite terrifying as you can see your objective on one card, and your crew dying on the card next to it and know that either one is a possible outcome. You use this mini game for 3 activities whcih take place in the Orbital layer of gameplay. You can try to SPY on people. Maybe hack into nearby comms systems or satlites and learn some stuff people don't want you to know. You can PATROL the area and attack smugglers and pirates to increase your faction standing or to complete a mission objective. When you BLOCKADE you are trying to find a smuggler or merchant to rob them of there cargo. All 3 of these mini games use the card based system. Other then that there is alot of talking to people and gaining information or making choices based on how you have decided to play. \n\n\nThe story so far is amazing. If you decide to just skip the story missions and start flying around someone with a story mission might come find you or you might just accidently end up on a planet that has a story mission and they will contact you while you are on the planet and talk to you. If you simply choose to help no one the story goes on and at any time you can decide to intercede but your inactions have consequences too. For example if you help them deliver things but aren't willing to attack people jsut yet then they will not send anyone out to attack there enimies and eventually there enimies will come attack them. Someone might lose. They might send word to you to help with the new side of the crisis they are dealing with. Ignore the again and the story moves on. Help them and the story changes. Help them but fail a bunch of skill checks and the story changes again. It feels organic but you know its not and it made me really appreciate the work that went into a section of the game that isn't a labor of love for other simulations like this one. The story is not completely implemented yet and some of the side characthers and quests will simply tell you that if you try to access them but I am excited to what they do with these opportunities.\n\n\nWhile flying around the game is constantly rolling skill checks for piloting, repairing accidents as they come up, special ablities are being used automaticlly and going on cooldown for 3 weeks. Its all happening, you can see its going on, and even effect it by getting more expierenced crew, incresing your ships systems, etc.... But the idea that at some point your going to fail a bad skill check and your ship is going to be damaged, one of your awesome crew might die due to suffocation during a fire, or someone might make it to the doctor and die because the doc saved somebody last week automaticlly so he has 2 weeks more on his cooldown and he only rolled a 2 on his skill check. He needed to roll a 10 or better. And all of that can be simply ignored. The game can be played without focusing on this information.\n\n\nYou get into this weird rythm every time you land on a planet.You buy gas, repair your ship, have everyone healed at the doctor on planet as long as the planet has enough medical supplies, you get everyone stoned on space spice (again as long as they have enough drugs to supply you), you pay there wages, recruit new crew for anyone that has left in the dead of night or died by being decapitated and then sell your goods and check the exchange prices to see what is being sold here and what people are buying. All of this makes your crew happy, makes them want to train hard at there job and gives them xp, and ensures that they will listen to you when it counts and stick around for the hard times. You really start to care about your crew. They are so valuable and you can really customize them to fit certain rolls. Some of your guys are so awesome that they are given there own room on the ship. They command respect from the others and act as leaders, keeping them inline while in combat, or on shore leave. They gain access to alot more classes and can take up to 3 classes total. Captains can be 1 out of maybe 6 or 8 options as a class in the begining, regular crew are normally 1 class out of maybe 6 - 8 different classes then the previous mentioned ones. When a charcther is an officers or captain they gain alot of extra levels and can multiclass taking any of the 12-16 total classes available. All of these classes gain skills every time you take them. Its small but it progresses quickly. And every couple of levels you gain an ability. This could be soemthing like a save when you fail a roll for something specific. Lets say you make an engineering check, your mechanic knows a skill that lets him pass a failed test once every 3 weeks. After that the mechanics ability goes on a 3 week cooldown. But if you have more then one crew member with the same save you can use more then once in a 3 week period. Or the ability could be something to buff your ship in combat or an attack you use when fighitng in combat.\n\nThis brings me to the last subject. The Combat.\nThere are two types.\nShip combat is a 1v1 fight with another ship. Every hit counts and lucky shots can cause, you guessed it, skill checks, and failing these could lead to something really bad happening. If the engines go out or you lose alot of your hull or crew during a fight then the fight is over. Depending on the difficulty of the game this could mean simply going back to the map with your crew badly beaten and a loss of all of your cargo and/or fuel and limping back to port with an angry crew if you are playing on easy. If you are playing on harder difficulties then everyone dies, the ship explodes, you all vent into the void. I AM HOPING IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EDIT AND CUTOMIZE THE DIFFICULTY SETTINGS!!!!!\n\nSquad Based Combat ala Darkest Dungeon is the other combat in the game. Somtiems you will land on a planet for a mission and you end up running thru the city getting chased by guards after failing a skill check during diologues. You fail another skill check and you go into combat vs 4 other guys. Anyone in your crew can be chosen for combat. Anyone who dies in combat will have to roll a death save depending on the difficulty setting with  2 possible outcomes. They are really messed up or they are dead.\n\n***Verdict***\nAll of this adds up to a game that is awesome.

First, you choose a class that can offer various benefits and skill bonuses at the start. Then you choose what facet of your character is the most important and set up priorities for things like your starting ship, starting experience, personal attributes, skills, your pre-existing contacts in hte world. The higher you set the priority, the better quality/quantity of it you receive.\n\nWith your ship as the topmost priority for instance, you can claim one of the largest starting ship and have some spending cash to boot. If your contacts were the highest priorities, you get a handful of them right off the bat.\n\nThe game itself revolves around making saves against hazards and the game will roll against events and situations in the background, based on the total of your crew skills where applicable, or your personal skills and attributes in some cases. \n\nShip to ship combat is simplified into an overhead view of both involved vessels exchanging fire in a turn based mode. If and when boarding occurs, you pit four of your best crew to fight against four of the enemy's, which will then result in either a positive or negative outcome. Crew combat is turn based as well and reminiscient of Darkest Dungeon in its presentation.\n\nThe economy and trade is straightforward but even there you can use your captain's or your officers' and crew's skills to negotiate a better deal. This goes for missions as well as diplomatic situations.\n\nOh yeah, you have a handful of officers who fulfill critical roles on your ship, level up more than simple crew members can. Each crewmember is also represented as an individual that has a class and skills, all contributing to the overal performance of your vessel!\n\nOverall this game has RPG leanings and yet feels like a proper space game to me.\n\nThere are a few aspects that are sure to receive some polish - check the roadmap to be certain. The interface is occasionally glitchy but servicable and for a tooltip addict like myself, there aren't nearly enough! Expect a few trips to the wiki until you can memorize what each skill and attribute does for you.\n\nOther than that, you know what you're buying into, this is an early access title, so expect the occasional bug and missing content near the end of your play time, but at the time of writing, there's more than enough to do in the game right now and for the current price of \u20ac15 this is definitely well worth it in my honest opinion.\n\nAlso, the developer is active in the forums and judging by their past releases, this game is going to be well supported after full release.", "timestamp_created": 1512337259, "timestamp_updated": 1512337259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38041909": {"recommendationid": "38041909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030885506", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512316178}, "language": "english", "review": "As many people have already mentioned the game isnt ready really to be played yet.

Crew combat pits 4 of your crew against 4 enemies, and you can have access to healing abilities and powerful attacks based on how you trained your crew. I have often heard STF crew combat is very similar to the combat in Darkest Dungeon, but I cannot confirm that as I haven't played DD.

As\u00ed que cuando se anunci\u00f3 este nuevo Star Traders me interes\u00e9, y cuando empec\u00e9 a ver todo lo que iba a tener, me gust\u00f3 m\u00e1s.\n\nEl juego mezcla exploraci\u00f3n, comercio, espionaje, pirater\u00eda, combate espacial, combate terrestre, y lo mezcla con un estilo muy \"vieja escuela\" en lo que a contenido y variedad se refiere, pero con un estilo gr\u00e1fico fresco y moderno. \nEl universo del juego bebe de Dune, Warhammer 40k y otras muchas obras (he pillado referencias a Heinlein y a Asimov mientras jugaba). Y para mi es algo en lo que los hermanos Trese excelen, en amalgamar ideas en algo propio, como para mi pasa con Templar Battleforce.\nEl juego promete muchas horas de exploraci\u00f3n, comercio, pirater\u00eda, etc, y tener una trama considerablemente elaborada, que unido a todo el contenido comercial, pol\u00edtico (con muchas facciones continuamente evolucionando y enfrent\u00e1ndose) parece que va a dar para mucho y que tendr\u00e1 un cierto grado de rejugabilidad. \nEso si, el juego no tiene una curva de aprendizaje suave (principalmente por la falta de tutoriales, un resumen de las reglas o similar). Entiendo que en gran medida esto se debe a que est\u00e1 en Acceso Anticipado y que es algo que en la versi\u00f3n definitiva se solucionar\u00e1, sobre todo porque se que en los otros juegos de los hermanos Trese es as\u00ed. \nAdem\u00e1s, mi experiencia con ellos es que responden enseguida y solucionan los problemas. Encontr\u00e9 el primer d\u00eda un error en linux, lo comuniqu\u00e9 y a los minutos me respond\u00edan que no era prioritario pero lo corregir\u00edan en cuanto pudiesen, y una semana despu\u00e9s estaba solucionado. \nY otra cosa a tener en cuenta (al menos para mi) es que dan soporte a Linux.\n\nEscribo esto con solo 6 horas de juego a mis espaldas, que no es mucho, pero suficiente para poder decir que yo estoy encantado con el juego y no puedo recomendarlo m\u00e1s. Est\u00e1 claro que no es algo que vaya a gustar a todo el mundo, y recomiendo buscar v\u00eddeos en youtube para ver como se juega, pues con poco que veas enseguida te dar\u00e1s cuenta de si es un juego que te puede gustar o no. \nA mi me est\u00e1 encantado.", "timestamp_created": 1512215461, "timestamp_updated": 1512215461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37993572": {"recommendationid": "37993572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973613568", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1515812374}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very oldcore and hard school.

Star Traders Frontiers is about a lot more than just trading. Piracy and privateering, spying and smuggling, battles in space and on strange planets, you pretty much do it all, from epic quests to shake galactic politics to mundane fedex legwork and space uber. You have the freedom to roleplay the kind of starship captain you want, and the game mechanics support a variety of playstyles and preferences, though some are more developed than others right now and others are no more than a simple minigame. \n\nThe most ambitious part of the game is the political simulation of NPC actors. Although the territories and borders of the map are disappointingly static, the landscape of factions, cliques, and agents is dynamic and ever-changing and makes you feel like you're part of a living universe. Factions are always in conflict, sometimes in a hot or cold war, sometimes allying against another faction, and your actions as a player can influence the outcome of these conflicts. Those outcomes then affect the individual actors within the factions, making some more powerful and others less. Strong actors can then use their influence to pursue their agendas based on their procedurally-generated characteristics, possibly creating new conflicts, whereas weak actors become vulnerable to the agendas of their rivals. While the player's actions have a larger significance, the depth and complexity of all these interlocking systems makes said actions have butterfly effects that are hard to predict or understand. The result is richly emergent storytelling over a backdrop of war, conspiracy, betrayal, and assassination. \n\nNow the bad news. The early access build is really rough around the edges. The interface is frustratingly obtuse and a lot of important mechanics are poorly documented (if documented at all) or halfway implemented (though this is changing as the devs implement more tooltips and QOL changes.) There isn't even manual/multiple saving, which might make sense for a roguelike with quick turnaround but is completely absurd for an RPG with lengthy campaigns, and strongly penalizes the kind of experimentation that would truly demonstrate the depth of the abovementioned systems. Game needs a lotta work, for real. \n\nStill, the game has tremendous potential and the simulation is interesting enough that I am able to overlook these problems and keep playing in the sandbox, even if it means having to externally manage save files.

I am genuinely enthusastic about the developement of the title. Devs are outstanding!*\n-----\n I do look forward to seeing the card mechanics either thrown away or redone. It's too shallow for my taste. The experience of spying, blocading, exploring, and all of it's potential for fun is dulled away by just clicking one single button to roll the dice for cards. This is shallow. This is cheap and it needs attention. Beyond that the other complaint that I have is how missions are given out. If I am playing as a faction then I want the missions to matter. I don't want it to be a numbers game of where I just see the reputation number increase, and nothing of great import happens beyond the fact that my number for repuation with said faction is now higher. If I am given a mission I want an experience to happen to me that is memorable. I don't want another video game with side quests that don't matter and are only good for gaining more numbers in my xp bar or loot. I want meaningful experiences now. I'm too damn old to be entertained by just dull and lifeless side-missions in my games! Make them interesting or throw the idea away. I wouldn't mind the game being full of this great writing that you have started already. If each mission mattered, was an event that counted in the grand scheme of things, and was interesting then I would smile and carry on. The campaign story line missions are excellent so far from what I've seen in terms of telling a story. Mechanic-wise they are basic and crude. Go here, click mission, read, watch the dice roll, move on. If there was more interaction while doing the story missions this would make it more exciting. I don't necessarily mind the combat way of doing things, but lets be honest. What are the 10,000 other games out there doing? The exact same thing which is \"go here, kill x, talk to y, and get your xp and loot.\" Diversity of the content and mechanics is desired here. We don't need just another run of the mill combat/mission system. The crew combat system is crude and needs to be fleshed out more. Ship combat is better than crew combat, but I'm certain there's ways of polishing the idea up a bit more. \n\nDevelopers, keep up the good work.

I will update it in a few months if things have changed.[/b]\n\nStar Traders Frontier feels a bit like Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates\u2019 big brother, or maybe it is related to Mount and Blade? It has the same free roaming as a lone captain and doing pretty much anything you want, except its bigger, more complex and interesting, but also a whole lot harder, confusing and more often than not plain old frustrating in the way it likes to randomly pit you against impossible odds without even the option to reload your game.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: there is a vast, interesting and complex game in there, I know it. But it is currently hidden behind layers after layers of obtuse mechanics, tentacular interface screens, frustrating minigames and loads of ways of forcing you to restart your game from scratch because you took one bad decision at the end of a 4 hours session, or, even worse, because the RNG decided that yep, that\u2019s it, your time is up. So I cannot in good conscience give Star Traders: Frontiers a positive rating right now.\n\nThat was the short version. Below are two long lists of pros and cons if you want more details.\n\n\n[b]Why the negative review:[/b]\n\n- The UI is a mess. Big useless icons everywhere, menus inside menus inside menus making the simplest of actions take way too many clicks, several buttons on a single screen leading to the same thing, and extremely unintuitive screens that really don\u2019t help you understand what you are looking at. \n\n- The learning curve is a cliff. Not only is there no tutorial worth mentioning, the tooltips tend to be unexplanatory fluff or just plain not here. So you are left to learn the ropes by trial and error. In a game where ironman is the default and only mode, meaning every \u201cbig\u201d mistake you make while learning to play will send you straight back to the title screen or leave you stranded in space.\n\n- Not helping the previous issue, the game starts punishingly hard, and extremely unfair at times, but gets easier and easier as you level up and get better crew and equipment. I know it's a rogue-like, but still, a smoother, handheld start would be welcome.\n\n- Difficulty levels don\u2019t matter nearly as much as they could and probably should. Thanks to the game, er, encouraging me to restart multiple times, I had the opportunity to try 4 out of the 7 difficulty levels. And I really didn\u2019t find much of a difference. You\u2019ll get more XP and take less damage in one, your officers will be able to permanently die in another, sure, but at the end of the day, those are details compared to the game-shattering, half-random circumstances that will lead you to a restart. And yes, ironman is always on, even at the lowest difficulties.\n\n- Some of the minigames manage to be both uninvolving and extremely frustrating. I\u2019m of course talking about the card minigames. It basically goes like this: \u201cHere are 5 cards. One of them is mandatory to advance your (timed!) mission, 2 of them will hurt you badly, and the last 2 will give you a small inconsequential bonus to whatever. Now click on that button and I\u2019ll chose one randomly for you. Too bad ! You lost ! And time is ticking ! Want to try again ?\u201d So, yeah, almost pure luck (some crew skills let you remove a card before the draw, but since you can only use them once per draw, they only mean you now have 1 out of 4 chances to win instead of 1 out of 5). Even worse, that same minigame is recycled everywhere, from orbit patrol to land exploration to spying to finding a black market, here are 5 cards! Click the button \u2018til blind luck allows you to resume playing or you run out of time/ressources/patience!\n\n- Hand to hand fighting and space battles are the two other, more fun and involving, minigames. But fighting, and especially fighting in space, against any enemy, will cost you tons of money, lose you characters you\u2019ve been levelling up for hours, and possibly force you to restart the whole game from scratch, all for meager potential rewards. Even when you win a space engagement, the rewards quite often don\u2019t even begin to cover the costs of the repairs or the value of the well-trained crew members you\u2019ve lost. There are health (well, hull) bars in those fights, but since every single enemy shot can kill a crew member (player character included) or damage a vital and costly ship module, they are pretty useless. I won\u2019t pretend there is no strategy involved in those fights. What I will say however is that said strategies can and eventually will be rendered completely moot by a random lucky hit. And the consequences of space battles, win or lose, are so terrible and random that you\u2019ll spend most of the early game actively running away from one of the funniest part of the game because you simply do not have the money reserves to even afford a victory. \n\n- You are on a timer. Always. You know what I loved about Mount and Blades ? The feeling of freedom. Of being able to go wherever I wanted and do whatever I wanted. And Star Traders really felt that way, at first. Until I realized I would always be on the aforementioned timer. There is a global timer you see, that makes the game harder and harder with time, so you need to constantly improve in an efficient fashion in order to stay competitive. There is also a time limit on every single quest in the game. In fact, said time limits starts ticking when the quest is [i]offered[/i] to you, not when you [i]accept[/i] it. So if you get offered a quest you feel your ship or crew won\u2019t be able to accomplish (for example, [i]anything involving space combat[/i] in the first three years of the game), you can\u2019t postpone it until you are ready : either you accept it right now and wreck your game, or you let it go. And while that\u2019s annoying but acceptable for the randomly generated quests, the same system is also applied to story, pre-written quests, that will only ever show up once in your entire playthrough and, in some case, are automatically \u201coffered\u201d to you (looking at you, Arbitrator/Faen Family questlines), meaning the timer starts without you even asking for it. So either you take up that quest the game thrust on you too soon and you deem impossible in the faint hope of winning it and seeing the rest of the story at the risk of having to restart your whole game if you lose, or you let it go, never to see it again. \n\n\n[b]Why I remain hopeful, and plan on coming back to the game in a few months to see where it\u2019s at:[/b]\n\n- The game universe, the background, the writing are top notch. The setting is both believable and rather original, and the story quests are involving and integrate seamlessly in the procedurally generated world. Which kind of make the previous point feel even worse, but still.\n\n- In the same way, the mechanics underlying the game are complex and involving. There are dozens of skills, traits and attributes, there is crew morale, there is diplomacy, relationship building, ship upgrading, dynamic interplanetary trading and economics\u2026 Behind the clutter of the UI and the frustratingly brutal randomness, there is an extremely detailed, working simulation.\n\n- I played Templar Battleforce, from the same creators, and I loved every minute of it. It could be hard depending on the chosen difficulty, but never felt unfair, frustrating or random : when you lost, it wasn\u2019t for lack of luck, but due to some clear mistakes on your part, and you could always retry your mission.

This game is in early access so it is a bit short on content, but the developers are working hard getting more content in. If I had to compare this game to any other game it would be sid meiers pirates but in space and with a lot more mechanics under the hood. At the very begining you can design your captain or pick from a template, you also get 4 offciers and bunch of crew members who all specialize in certein areas to help maintain your ship. You can later level up your captain, officers and crew memebers and pick their talents that will help you out in many different ways, such as exploring, trade goods, ship combat, hand to hand combat, missions, discounts on buying ships, repair cost, morale, and other areas as well. When you level up your captain and officers, you can also multiclass them into other professions that help you in many ways in the game. Your crew however can only level in the class they were recruited into, but you can promote them into officers, if your ship allows it. Every ship is allowed a max number of officers, small ships being around 4 to 5, larger ships around 6 or 7, every ship is different, and can be cuztomize in  different ways, so be sure to check them out. This game does have a certain difficulty to it that can really make you frustrated, when you dont understand the basic mechanics, and yes these are basic. Such as ship checks, getting your crew paid, morale, gas for your ship and ship repairs. In my first 10 hours of playing, I absolutly hated this game so badly I wanted to punch the developers right in the face, all because I couldnt get my head around the Simple basics. One basic is the ship checks, in which your ship is under going a constant check and making sure your crew can pass them, if you cant, well lots of things go wrong from crew memebers getting hurt causing morale going down, and taking ship damage. Once you level your crew up to pass these ship checks that no longer becomes a problem. Another basic is obviously making money, this may seem difficult at first, cause the early missions dont pay too much at first but they get better and pay a lot more as you do more missions. Trade can seem difficult at the begining as you need to get trade permits to trade the more expensive goods, but once you get these trade permits the cash will literally start flowing in and money no longer becomes a problem. The only problem I had with this game was its lack of content, but then I realize this game is early access and of course its gonna be short on content and the developers are working on more content to be put into the game. Overall I think this game is pretty good and the developers are doing a good job. I hope theres going to be a lot of dlc for this game and cant wait to get it.

There are similarities. \n\n-->  Not really a reward for all the (crew-) micromanagement. \n\nIt takes time to build your ship and especially your crew. It's not unusual to have a crew of 30+ you need to level up constantly, especially in the beginning). Since they die quickly or lose morale after a fight and quit (even if they win)  I did not grew attached to them like in Battle brothers. They are too generic at the moment. It might work with a smaller crew and a different, less harsh, morale system. The whole skill system is based on a larger crew though. \n\n--> No sense of control\n\nEven if you are careful not to over extend and get in difficult fights / quests early you might get a few bad fights / failed quests and lose it all very quicly. I did not feel to have any control over these circumstances (RNG). Just to make sure: I played Battle Brothers for countless hours because I always felt my actions and choices mattered despite the RNG elements. \n\nSince it's early access I hope some of these issues are tackled.

It's such a wonderful starship captain RPG game. This isn't a twitch game. All of the combat is turn-based, somewhat JRPG style. There's a lot traveling around and micro management of your ship and crew. It's a bit like Sid Meier's Pirates, but in space.\nIn my current save, I'm an Explorer/Spy. My ship is quite small, and I'm skilled for stealth and escape. So I'm not looking for a stand-up fights. I'm in it to prosper around the edges: gather intel, court contacts, look under rocks.\n\nI'm having a blast with the game, even though it has some rough edges. Because it's early access, that is to be expected. But let's talk about early access here as well since, at this point, many people have likely been burned by abandoned early access projects: these devs are in the forums responding to the players, they're on a discord server responding to players, they're updating the game frequently. In short, they're awesome. \n\nPros: \nChoose your officers and recruit a crew. Want more options in a space fight? Grab a bunch of pilots and gunners. Want a more military crew for boarding? Recruit more soldiers. Want none of that? Hire exo-scouts, merchants or spies. Your officers and crewmembers all contribute to the type of options you have at your disposal in any given situation.\n\nA lot of character customization options for you and your officers / crew. You can choose the appearance, gender and name of every crew member. They've got their own traits, And as they level up they'll gain various talents and job skills (21 different jobs). Is one of your crew members in possession of exemplary skills and talent? Get rid of your greedy, disloyal quartermaster and promote that crewmember to officer instead!\n\nPlay it like a sandbox, or play scripted missions. If you want to run cargo back and forth to make some money, you can. If you want to explore wilderness planets or spy on a faction, you can. Of course if you want to patrol around spoiling for a fight, you can do that too. But if those things get a bit repetitive, talk to your contacts and get some quests.\n\nThere is a web of politics and intrigue to navigate as you try to earn enough to keep your crew happy and ship in one piece. When one faction likes you, the others probably don't. You're going to need places to fuel up and repair though, so managing faction relations is a major component of the game.\n\nProcedural universe creation, in case you want a different sandbox to play in!\n\n\nCons:\nIt's early access, so there are some bugs. I've not encountered any crashes yet, however.\n\nThe UI isn't always friendly, but they're working on it!\n\nThere's no manual at the moment, so it may take a game or two to understand the mechanics (I just figured out what the little dots under the combat talents meant after 10 hours played...).\n\nNeutral:\nThe game can be difficult at first. Playing on \"Normal\" is quite challenging. I haven't tried anything harder than that.\nI don't see the difficulty as a pro or con as long as each player can find a level that is challenging without being excessively punishing.\n\nWho should get this game:\nAnyone who wants to run a starship around and cobble together a trusty core of officers and full crew. Anyone who likes bouncing from planet to planet, trading, doing missions, levelling up skills, random encounters, exploring, and micromanaging their ship/crew/faction relations.\n\nAnyone like me :)\n\n*edited typos", "timestamp_created": 1511405606, "timestamp_updated": 1511405836, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36904329": {"recommendationid": "36904329", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964121070", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511400737}, "language": "english", "review": "([EDIT 11/24] I am impressed with the professionalism of the devs. They take comments in stride and really seem to be working to make the best game they can. I'll probably check back from time to time and edit this review if things improve a lot)\n\n------\n\nSo ... I'm on the negative side of neutral here, but Binary Thumb Choice is Binary.\n\nI genuinely had a lot of fun working through the mechanics and figuring things out - lots of [i]oh, so thaaaaaat's what that does![/i] kinds of moments, and getting more competant at things for new runs had a kind of wonder for me.\n\nAt this point I think I've figured out at least 80-90% of the mechanics of this game (not mastering, just ... I know what they are), but as things are now I sadly don't think it will hold my interest. I mean, I want it to, but ...\n\nThis is one of those titles that stitches a bigger game out of a variety of smaller minigames, a method that brings [i]Space Rangers[/i] to mind for me at least, though there's no further comparison between the two titles to be made after that. In this game, it basically boils down to 5 RNG-driven minigames that you'll be rotating through to varying degrees as you progress: space travel, ship combat, crew combat, missions, and ... card flipping stuff.\n\nI'll start on that last one - as you can see in the trailer, there's a bit where you're presented with a semi-random selection of 5 cards. You press a button and RNG decides which cards flip over and dissipate and you're left with one card that gives you a bad thing or a good thing or some combat opportunity or whatever. That's the extent of player interaction here, though: you press one button, and some cards flip over. You can try to stack this in your favor through the occasional crew ability ('remove a negative card before flipping') and (I [i]guess?[/i]) maybe stack the RNG more in your favor by stacking up crew attributes, though the mechanics of such aren't clear right now (early access and all). \n\nBut even after all that: button, cards. That's the gameplay here.\n\nAnd this mechanic is used [b]a lot[/b]. Patrol shipping lanes? Flip some cards. Blockade a planet? Flip cards. Explore wilderness? Flip. Spy on a planet's networks? Cards. Gain access to black market? Flip some more cards.\n\nThe crew combat feels like a JRPG-lite where each character has ... one ability. You just spam attacks until things die, and the opponent does the same, and it's a spam race to see who can make the enemy dead first. To be fair, I think I'm probably missing the finer points of this system, but honestly - this stuff is [i]dull[/i].\n\nShip combat is more enjoyable by far, though still fairly simplistic. You have a variety of abilities (given by your crew) that you can use per move, and you assign weapons to fire, and there's some range mechanic of sorts that determines weapon/tactic availability ... but just about all of this again comes down to RNG.\n\nMissions, which I am straining to define as a minigame here (though I had to strain equally as much to call the card thing a 'game') boils down to basically one text choice followed by some dice rolling to determine if your choice failed or had some benefit ... maybe some ship combat or something similar happens as a result of this.\n\nThe overworld/space travel mechanic, to which I'll also tie the inter-world trading mechanics, is a mess of RNG stuff happening all at once; and once you figure out what you're supposed to be doing to manage your fuel and crew and all that, it eventually becomes a very tedious affair of repetitive clicking and decision making.\n\n\"Oh, I've traveled from point A to to point B. I land on this planet. *click* I need to buy fuel, because there is literally no reason why I would not want to do this *click click*; now I will pay my crew to prevent them murdering me *click* *click* *click* and send them on some shore leave *click* *click* oh wait I need to click like 15 times to make sure all of them do it I guess *click* *click* *click* *click* *click* *click*; some of them got sick, so I need to go to the doctor tab *click* and heal them all *click*. In the meantime, all this pay and shore leave made my guys level up, so I need to go the status tab *click* and then the crew submenu *click* and filter my crew to show leveling ones only *click* *click* and then click through every single one of them to assign new job levels and assign tasks, even for the junior crew that have a singular job path *click* *click* *click* *click* *click* *click* *click* *click* *click* ........\n\nAnd when you travel from point B to point C, get ready to do that whoooole thing over again. It's weird, with all the automated RNG in this game already, that I'm wishing they'd automate this stuff more at this point.\n\nAs for Trade, in a game called Star Traders, this mechanic feels very disadvantageous, at least at the early stages with the stuff you can trade in. You can fill your trade ship with some sort of commodity at an A+ price, and sell it off at an A+ price on a nearby planet, and feel good about yourself for making a cool $1K in profits - until you realize that the fuel cost you $600, your crew are demanding about $800 in wages, and demanding shore leave to the tune of $200 more. And you can't really trade in more profitable stuff until you buy very, very expensive licenses - in this manner, Star Traders basically funnels you away from trade and into doing the missions. Why travel from point A to B to try and pull off $1000 profit of trade (that gets swallowed by expenses), when I can travel the same distance for a mission that will give me a $22,000 reward? This is probably the most disappointing part for me, because I was keen to try my hand at some trading. I mean, it's in the title ...\n\nAt the end of all this, I can only feel that this title is really not geared towards someone like me, and more towards someone with a heavy background in D&D-like games who love them some dice rolling and RNG.

Playing this reminds me of Sid Meier's Pirates! which I enjoyed a long time ago. \n\nSome key features of the game:\n\n0) You travel in a spaceship in a universe of systems connected with jumpgates. Each system contain planets you can visit. You experience random encounters in travel and take up missions and make decisions on the planets you visit.\n\n1) Combat is turned based\n\n2) Missions is card based\n\n3) Both Missions and Combat is affected by jobs (classes) and traits (abilities) \n\n4) Your Captain and Officers and Crews all play an important part in the mix of Jobs and Traits you get and this will heavily impact the outcome of the missions and actions you take\n\n5) You have a very large range of Jobs you can take.\n\n6) There are different ships and modules you can upgrade, you can also equip your crews with different weapons for Land combat\n\nThe Pros:\n\n1) The developers have an excellent track for completing and launching their games. I bought this game based off the pleasurable time I had with Templar Battleforce. They are extremely responsive to suggestions on improvements to the game and have issued 4 patches with of bug fixes and improvements in under 2 weeks since EA! Expect a lot of development activity in EA!\n\n2) The game right now is deep enough to have fun with the still evolving gameplay. In EA, it contains enough content and working game systems to shame some indie fully released games.\n\n3) Support them early. Success is the best motivation to a good team in EA! There's a discount that's ending soon =).\n\nCons:\n\n1) As it's in EA, the documentation is a bit thin. Most of the information is in the forum. The WIKI is still lacking in detailed explainations of some game systems.\n\n2) The game is still evolving and content is still to be fully fleshed out. So expect an uneven experience. You milage may vary, but some may find the free roam + make my own adventure structure of the game off-putting.\n\n3) There's still bugs to be ironed out and UI to be enhanced. \n\nIt's a really good EA title.

While there are still plenty of things for the developers to improve upon, the game is playable and more importantly, a joy to play.  As you get to be the captain (customizable) of a ship (customizable), you have a lot of freedom for what you want to do.  Follow the campaign missions - go for it.  Ignore them and do you own thing - Go for it!  \n\nGet to know you crew.  Find out that many of them have interesting traits.  Why does this junior office cost so much - got the greedy trait.  That officer that got knocked out of combat now has the battle-tested trait.  And your contacts, do you really want to take a mission from the one with the Traitor trait...\n\nMake money trading, smuggling, pirating, or exploring just to name a few methods.\n\nSo far, in early access, I've found the game to be enjoyable and fun to play.  The developers are responsive to feedback and the game is getting better because of it.  I've been burned by many an early access game before, but this one has been the very pleasant exception.\n\nRecommendation: Purchase", "timestamp_created": 1511259627, "timestamp_updated": 1511259627, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503058", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36671083": {"recommendationid": "36671083", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984257946", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511721686}, "language": "english", "review": "The Good;\n- INSANELY deep gameplay for an early access $11 game. Like seriously, it's fucking insane, like, I cannot even start to list all the traits, contacts, reputation etc etc for every single planet / faction in this game. It's utterly insane.\n- Tons of different play styles you can go after (ship to ship combat, trade, spying, ground combat etc)\n- Nice art style with customizable visual appearence for each crew member along with heavy customization of crew talents / professions and ship gear.\n- Did I mention this game is INSANELY deep?\n\nThe Bad;\n- Learning curve is basically a vertical asymptote. There is NOTHING that explains to you what in the FUCK any of these stats, attributes, debuffs etc mean. Even when designing your captain, there's pretty much zero explanation of what anything is, so you're essentially flying blind through most of the game through trial and error figuring out what crew does what, why you need them etc\n\n- So theres about like 7+ mini games between ship to ship, ground, spy, patrol, MUDD style quests etc. but once again, you have no idea what the rules are or how anything works, so you'll find yourself getting demolished in one of these game modes and you have no idea what you're doing wrong or what you should even try to do to not suck.\n\n- Although the game is insanely deep, none of that complexity really DOES anything. You basically just fly around progressively longer distances having the same random events occur where you either choose to fight the ship or just run away. And there's like almost no reason to fight the ships because you lose reputation and will rack up hefty repair bills, have crew die etc. So the game becomes really boring as you click from warp-gate to warp-gate, having to stop every so often to refuel and pay your crew on a planet somewhere.\n\n- Unrelated to the above, the story elements that do exist are pretty weak and the script for the text base conversations is pretty painfully bad, you will skip all every single time.\n\n- RNG for losing crew and stuff is probably a little *too* steep as it stands now. I had high levels crew leave because I didn't land intime to pay them because I was doing whatever, and after like spending the entire game on my ship they bounce. Worst part is there's no like progress bar for when you have to pay your crew, so you're just blindly stopping at planets trying to pay them everytime you can. Plus the game CONSTANTLY auto rolls anytime your ship is moving for bad shit to happen to you and your crews skills / talents are the only thing that stop it, but bad shit will still happen because of RNG. I think it'd be a bit nicer if you had a chance of some beneficial RNG to happen to mix it up instead of just wondering when there's gonna be some sort of electronics explosion or w/e that mames half your crew while you're running for you life from a pirate.\n\n\nIN CONCLUSION / TL:DR\nGame is undeniabley INSANELY complex, with a learning curve that more akin to a brick wall. After spending 7-8 hours messing around, I can say the game has a TON of potential moving forward. But as it stands now it needs a LOT of tweaking to make it live up to that potential.\n\nThings it needs before I'd recommend someone buying it;\n- A decent tutorial for the different game modes to explain the basic rules so you don't keep losing crew b/c you don't understand wtf is happening\n\n- MOTHER FUCKING TOOLTIPS for stats etc to give you an idea of what % increase or decrease in whatever it provides\n\n- Tweaking gameplay to involve less fetch / deliver and more ground / space combat / spying etc. It's incorperated to the story based missions but like 75% of the auto generated missions are fetch quests.\n\n- Did I say some decent fucking tutorials and some tool tip explanations?", "timestamp_created": 1511249406, "timestamp_updated": 1511279089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504902", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36671019": {"recommendationid": "36671019", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970267539", "num_games_owned": 559, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511255263}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm having a lot of fun with this game so far.

Something about this caught my attention and I am glad I took a chance on it.  The game still needs to flesh out the content and improve some quality of life issues but it is already in better shape than some \"finished\" games I have played in the past and updates have been common since I started playing.  This is a fairly straight forward turn based game where you create a ship captain as an avatar but includes both ships officers and crew.  The officers and crew offer different options in various situations and need to be managed and levelled to make the most effective team while the size of the team is dictated by your current ship.  Game play includes various missions that have a large RNG outcome (5 different outcomes selected randomly based on the mission that you see before choosing to proceed in what I have seen so far) that can be influenced by captain, officer, and crew skills and combat that consists of ship to ship and 4 on 4 crew battles.  Where the game offers some great twists is the Captain template character creator and the faction/contact mechanic.  The Captain template allows you to trade off different aspects of your starting character by requiring you to rank different categories which dictates the available pool you get to invest in that category so some tradeoffs are required.  If you want the best possible starting ship you need to sacrifice somewhere else.  The faction/contact mechanic dictates which missions are available, upgrades and bonuses, and some services that are available in star ports.  The contacts have both personal interactions and faction interactions that can change during the game and through your actions which provides some added consequence to many of the random encounters and missions throughout the game.

But at every turn, it beats me down with nonsensical and unexplained game mechanics, confusing UI layouts, some painful repetition, and where are the hotkeys to make any of this more palatable?\n\nBut of course, this is EA.  So I can't really blame the incomplete thing for being incomplete.  I can only hope that it gets better over time so that I don't have to resort to writing batch files to manage my save games as I agonizingly gain glimpses into its mechanics through sheer trial and error.\n\nThings that would make this experience more palatable right now:\n1) Documentation.  The tooltips from your officers are not sufficient.  Combat traits and personal weapons are full of undocumented limitations that prevent their usage in certain situations.  A multitude of ship equipment has undocumented functionalities.  \n\n2) UI.  Ship movement and map dragging should not use the same button.  I noticed you even programmed movement to be both right and left click, while map dragging only uses the left mouse button.  Just leave ship movement to the right mouse button alone.  Also, leveling up is pretty agonizing.  Instead of making me click on the spice interface, then into my ship details, then into my character list, and then filtering my character list on newly-leveled characters, just give me a button to look at my new leveled characters straight from the spice interface.  And give us hotkeys for all of these actions-- inform us what they are through tooltips.  And while you offer sorting characters on a few conditions, why didn't you offer sorting on HP or MP?  And those random events that tick off constantly during space travel... I don't care if I passed or failed a roll.  I care what actually happened.  Did my officer hide our emissions, preventing a nearby ship from detecting us?  Let me know.  Did my helmsman spill water on his console, electrocuting himself?  Let me know that too.  \n\n3) Mechanics.  Reinforced Armor 4 on my ship claims to add 45% to my armor, yet it raised my ship's armor from 6 (Block 26%) to 20 (Block 54%)... what is going on?  And no amount of deflector arrays (or anything else I can figure out) will raise my shields at all from 3 (Block 8%).  Character attributes... how do they affect anything?  There's no feedback to tell me which crew benefit from which attributes.

The Dev seems really dedicated to the game, so maybe things change. But for my part, I won't be waiting for it.\n\nI have played previous titles of the devs (Templar Battleforce is actually pretty good - Heroes Of Steel not so much). At the moment it suffers from the same problems as the previous titles: \nThe game mechanics are not explaind. It appears the devs don't at all care whether you understand how to play their game and how the mechanics work or not.\n\nMore specifically:\nYou get no idea how a character's attributes and skills affect performance. It is not explained. At all.\nYou see regular rolls in a little window on the lower right, but there is no explanation what they mean, how they affect your ship, your crew, whatever. You have no chance of understanding what is going on nad how affect that is going on.\nCrew members get hurt, but you only know that when you receive a warning their health is low. Why that happens, how it could be prevented, you just won't know, the game won't tell you. \nYou find yourself suddenly with crew members gone. You don't why, or maybe you might, if you could look it up in that little window, if messages hadn't been so small and passed by so quickly, you just didn't notice (and because other windows were on top of it).\n\nI have given the game a few more hours to win me over. I wanted to like this game, but eventually came to the conclusion that the game mechanics are so opaque that it is just frustrating.\nYou have to make decisions in the game, but the game gives you no basis to found your decisions on. You cannot make informed decisions, because you dont get information (or none that makes any sense).\n\nAnother thing that is extrmeley frustrating: Your character may train in three jobs, which improve certain skills. So if at some point you want to learn another skill, that's just not part of one of the three jobs, too bad, you can't. Riiiiight. That makes sense. I cannot learn how to use a rifle, because... well, I have three jobs and none of them includes rifle. On the other hand, since the game doesnt explain to you how a skill affects rolls, it doesnt really matter, does it? \n\nAlso to everyone who thinks about buying this game: BE WARNED. YOU CANNOT SAVE.\nAll progress is saved automatically and immediately for you. There's no going back. You didn't understand how a roll works and couldnt make an informed decision? Too bad, live with the consequences of not knowing what you're actually doing. \n\nThe - by now informed - decision I made: I stopped playing. Too bad that I decided to give the game a second chance instead of getting a refund while I still could, but I really really hoped there could be a good game hiding somewhere underneath, because I so much wanted to have a game that felt like the old Traveller RPG and I felt that this was exactly what the game strived to be.

It takes the mythos Trese Brothers have been building from the original Star Traders through Templar Battleforce and builds upon it.  The moment I saw the KickStarter for this game, I knew I'd back it.  That's how much I believe in the setting and Trese Brothers in general.\n\nThe universe is rich and vibrant, the artwork and music are solid, and the UI is easy to work with, once you learn it.  I like the sense of depth they've given all the crewmembers you pick up (primarily through traits that influence what improves or detracts from their morale rating).  The attention to detail with regard to ship operations and crew relations is wonderful, but still manages not to overwhelm the player with minutae.  The main narrative is well made, too, and I'm impressed how they've managed to make the sandbox missions impact it. The card games to simulate Patrols, Spying, Exploration, and the like are a nice twist, too. To wit, there's a lot to like about this game.\n\nAnd yet, I can't recommend it unreservedly, but I must add a caveat:  this game is unforgiving.  One wrong move, one spate of bad luck in a combat, one random encounter that goes south, and you can go from \"Hey, I'm doing pretty well\" to \"Welp, better start a new character because I'm screwed six ways to Shalun\".  If you run out of money (and it's a probability on 3 to 5 hyperjump missiions, especially if you have to go through a hostile sector), your problems snowball quickly.  I've gone through three characters already, and I've been playing on Basic difficulty (the lowest setting).  Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for a cakewalk.  I'd just like to be able to recover from misfortunes when they occur.  \n\nTo that end, I humbly ask the developers to maybe make paying missions a little less hard to come by.  In the original Star Traders, you had at least the possibility of finding gainful employment in every port (either from the Palace or the Spice Hall, sometimes from the military wing of the Spaceport).  In Frontiers, if you run out of money multiple jumps away from your nearest contact, you're looking at several crew mutinies and a ship damaged from hyperjumps without fuel before you can get a new mission, and then you have to do the mission before you get paid (requiring more flying, mutinies, and ship damage).  When you finally do get paid, you have crew wages, fuel costs, repair costs, doctor bills, and rounds in the spice hall to buy before you're back to where you were (and chances are, you didn't get paid enough to cover all of those expenses).  Those are all reasonable consequences of failure in the Star Traders universe, mind you, but only being able to get paying work in a tiny fraction of everywhere you can travel makes it more arduous than IMHO it ought to be.\n\nSo, to sum up: I like this game and would still recommend it to fans of sci-fi RPG games in genral and Trese Brothers fans in particular.  I just don't *love* it, at least not yet.  A few anti-frustration features would go a long way toward helping me love it.\n\nRating: 3.5 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1511104323, "timestamp_updated": 1511104436, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.725013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36625030": {"recommendationid": "36625030", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007527579", "num_games_owned": 471, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510876110}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't normally review games, but I'm really enjoying this game.

From traveling space , to basic trading everything is well thought out.\n\nCombat- 8.5/10\n-While combat is well done, I find it might be difficult to people just picking the game up. That being said you can choose how you fight, where you fight, and what you fight with from cannons on the ship, to the guns in the crews hands. Everything matters.\n\nReplay-ability- 10/10\n-This game is a sandbox with a story. How you complete, or don't complete the story is entirely up to you.

If you like the genre and like supporting indie devs there's tons of gaming value to be had here.\n\nI suspect I'll be sinking a good few hours into this title, I haven't even scratched the surface yet.\n\n[u]Pros:-[/u]\n\n+ Complex and engaging RPG design with multiple characters (you, officers, crew), each with multiple classes, skills / perks and levels.\n+ Lots of design choices when it comes to upgrading your ships and character loadouts.\n+ Free form play with plenty of avenues to explore and exploit - trading, piracy, smuggling, spying, going off the beaten track to explore and so on.\n+ What looks to be an interesting and engaging main plot arc (that I haven't got very far into yet), with the promise from the devs of lots more to come.\n+ Interesting reputation and faction systems to navigage.\n+ Even the low difficulty levels are challenging.\n+ A very helpful community, particularly on Discord with responsive devs who obviously care passionately about their game.  As an example I pointed out a bit of friction in the GUI and one of the devs came back five minutes later and said \"just changed the code, it will be fixed in the next patch\".  In some ways quite minor, but that responsiveness to something that will eliminate hundreds of unecessary mouse clicks from any one game playthrough impressed me.\n\n[u]Cons:-[/u]\n\n- The depth and complexity isn't always matched by an interface that makes things accessible.  Most of it can be figured out but you need to work at it (having to work at an interface means, imho, that something's not right).  Some of this may be caused by the fact that the game has been designed for multiple platforms.  Still, as noted above, the devs are aware of some of the criticism here and very responsive to ideas about how to improve things.\n- I think I'll get my head around most of the gui quirks, eventually, but in a perfect world I wouldn't have to.\n- Occasional opacity or lack of feedback eg I buy commodity X on a planet for n% less than the galactic average and take it to a planet where demand should be high, but can only sell at a loss.  There may be many reasons for this, but I haven't found a way to find out what they are. \n- Obviously a personal opinion but I find the bright colours used everywhere to be too garish for my tastes.\n- Similarly I'm not a huge fan of the cartoonish nature of the art but a) I can see past that and b) we're talking about an indie studio so expecting Star Wars Battlefront II levels of prettiness would be ridiculous. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511001235, "timestamp_updated": 1511001235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587302", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36590782": {"recommendationid": "36590782", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982999259", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 237, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510981420}, "language": "english", "review": "   Star Traders is a complicated space faring sandbox that proved addictive despite some tedium and weak UI.\n   In a fractured galaxy, the player character has inherited the writs to authorize him/her to become a star trader, an independent explorer/trader/pirate/privateer. Then the game pretty much lets you go. You are given an initial mission to begin the narrative, but you are free to ignore it if you'd rather just explore.\n   Both ground and space combat is similar to Darkest Dungeon, except not quite as pretty or intricate. Exploration and misc orbital activites are resolved through a card draw. Skill and talent checks (such as diplomatic actions) are resolved by dice rolls. Every action is influenced by the skills of your captain, officers, and crew. The development of this crew and their impact on your adventures was one of my favorite aspects. Crew skills are constantly being checked to influence events and actions. This selection and development of your large crew allows for some emergent gameplay.\n   My complaints would be the occaisonally weak UI and time consuming maintenance. The game doesn't elaborate on why there are constant skill checks or what the consequences are. Tooltips are sparse at best. Your ship and crew require frequent maintenance that you must authorize manually. I would love to see the UI given some love and options for automated maintenance to be added, at least for the easier difficulties.\n   Overall, Star Traders is an ambitiuos game that doesn't always hit it's mark, but is close enough to provide (presumably many) hours of playable space drama.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH45GdE0jv0&ab_channel=UnlimitedAmmo] Impressions [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1510992901, "timestamp_updated": 1510992901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482585", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36588983": {"recommendationid": "36588983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005879531", "num_games_owned": 1043, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 5197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1516082212}, "language": "english", "review": "Star Traders RPG Elite was the first mobile game I ever purchased.  6 years, and just as many phones later, it is still a game I go back to time and time again.

By all the fun gods: Yes!\n\nStar Trader is essentially a space sim that neatly falls between the two typical lines of the genre, that is:\n1) Hand-held, berates you for even thinking about deviating from the safety zone until you've traded hours of your soul away for the scrap tier fighter.\n2) No direction, but you better grind tedium if you want any hope to live.\n\nStar Trader gives you every option a captain could want without forcing you onto one path.  Heck you could even do many things at once, for while the game does recommend trading goods - you can right out the gate get stuck into mischief, profitting from the misfortune of your rival factions - or even independents - while cozying up with your faction of preference.  There is risk, but that's half the fun!\n\n^ Edit2: Just for the record: Entirely possible on Brutal difficulty - one from the hardest - Ironman. :3\n\nSynopsis is as follows; bear in mind this isn't a comprehensive list:\n\nPROS\n1. Absolute Freedom of Style - Fighting things early game? Is profitable and fun!\n2. Neat Artwork Style (Though some models do look mutated or way too smug, hmm...)\n3. Engaging Combat System, made better by a delightful OST as well.\n4. Intriguing storyline that does a good job of easing you into the game-world, both as tutorial and lore guide, and avoids being overly patronizing on either count.\n5. Very Active Dev Support - this cannot be overstated enough, most OP postive really. :)\n\nQUIRKS - May be CONS\n1. Worse morale than the Imperial Guard; your crew *will* desert you until you have enough Commander skilled officers to keep them in line.  This can seriously impair your early game fighting ability, with enough bad rolls it can end a run prematurely. For whatever reason, spice does little to stem the pain either, how dare they be clean.  Also the Captain has the worst morale recovery ever, period.\n\n2. Spontaneous Major Health Fail RNG.  Could just be bad rolls, but are the full health crew playing with scalpels and baking in radiation while we're travelling? Those hospital trips aren't cheap!\n\nX (Reviewer Derp). Trading - This segment has proven slanderous to the name of Shalun.  Redacted; spice is also off the menu tonight, bad reviewer. :P\n\nCONS\n1. Possessive Rename UI.  If you ever want to rename your crew into a more easily trackable roster, be prepared to spend 20 minutes wrestling with the game.  This is not an exaggeration.\n2. No quick map references when taking contracts, having to exit the planet and everything eats a small amount of fuel, no big loss but it is annoying when all you want to do is check if you're heading 29 AU west, or north.  If there is a way already, it's not easily identifable.\n3. Hotkey tooltips could stand for some display speed improvement, maybe even a config list.\n\nSee! Even when bad-mouthed this game doesn't come off so bad.  Still, ultimately the choice is up to you gamers if this is your cup of spice coffee.

Definitely worth the sub-$20 pricetag.\n\nThings I like:\n-In depth crew simulation, with over a dozen classes, and their effectiveness is tied to the overall type of captain you're trying to be (trader, pirate, etc), as well as the type and tech level of the ship components you use, In each game, you're managing a handful of officers and literally 2 dozen crew members as they level up and gain talents every 3 levels or so.\n\n-In depth individual class, each class has a unique set of talents which are all gamechangers. Each class has something like 12 unique talents.\n\n-In-depth ship management, with over 75% of ship being modular - you can change out cargo bays, weapons, sensors, crew quarters, brig, armor plating, weapon lockers, fuel bays, for each other and a variety of other components.\n\n-In-depth contact/mission simulation - where a contact is a person who gives you missions, as well as 1-5, out of maybe 20, other things, such as missions, black market access, trading permits, bounty permits, pardons, introductions to others, discounts, special gear and special crew. The missions also vary widely depending on what contact you use, and if you are a trader and going to a military officer for attack contracts, you won't really have to the skills to succeed; similarly, a bounty hunter, unless specially built for non-bounty missions, won't do well on intelligence missions that require a lot of stealth and quickness, and you will fail skill checks and have the agent you were supposed to smuggle onto a planet discovered because you couldn't sneak past the port authorities\n\n-In-depth faction reputation mechanics - each action you take is affects a variety of factions in a logic fashion. Patrol and find an enemy pirate - gain rep with the faction that controls the area. Blockade and intercept a merchant in the same area - lose rept\n\n-Open world with a variety of ways to make money. You aren't forced into missions, and trading is very lucrative. You can also go exploring uninhabitated worlds, go spy and sell intel for income, you can smuggle, you can pirate, you can go bounty hunty, you can mine resources\n\n-The beginnings of a promising story arc. The game's in early access, so the story isn't done yet, but it is filled with interesting decisions.\n\nIn short, I love the game.

So far, I have been very impressed. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n- Incredible variety of customization options for both your ship, your captain, and your crew. Not just how they look, but all their gear, their traits, their talents, and more.\n\n- The game encourages a variety of playstyles and they all actually work:  I have restarted six times so far due to my own failures and have played as a bounty hunter, a merchant, a pirate, and a silver-tongued diplomat. You can mix and match roles and change your focus at any time, and your crew can be tailored to support your captain's weaknesses. There are many jobs I still have not gone deep with that I am looking forward to trying.\n\n- Very interesting relationship mechanics where you have to be introduced to contacts to receive missions, equipment, or favors from them. When you begin, you only have two or three contacts available, but by the time I failed my latest play-through, I had more than twenty and had barely scratched the surface of exploring the galaxy.\n\n- Challenge! As I've mentioned, I've failed six times for multiple reasons (usually because I get too greedy while in a sector of the galaxy where I have no allied stations/planets to land at). There is only Ironman mode with no saving, which keeps me from being the save-scumming baby I usually am and makes the game much more tense and amplifies mistakes. I have not felt frustration from these failures as restarting is not painful, but I have yet to invest many hours into a single playthrough, either.\n\n- The developer so far has been very active with addressing and fixing bugs. I submitted one through their forums and it was fixed the same night.\n\n\nTHE BAD:\n\n- The UI is currently clunky. I could not figure out how to move the map with my mouse for several hours, for instance. I expected moving the cursor to the edge of the screen would scroll it in that direction as is typical in 4X games, but it does not. I eventually figured out that you are meant to click and drag. Additionally, at some battle conclusion screens, I had details/options that ended off the edge of my screen and I expected scrollbars to appear so that I could access those. They did not and again it took me several hours before I realized you could click and drag there. The UI could do a better job of making it obvious how to navigate through it. The developer has made some very good strides here already, but more can be done.\n\n- Lack of a useful tutorial. When I was first dropped in the game, I had no idea what I was doing and I stil have only a basic understanding of some systems. The wiki is informative, but I would like to see more of this information in game.\n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI've already played the hell out of this game and have zero regrets with buying it.

It excels in sticking to its intent. Although, there are some UI refinements that would make gameplay for new players less confusing, I believe that I will be play this game for many hours and highly recommend it to those who are looking for an in depth Rogue-like game.\n\nI especially applaud the high level of developer interaction with the player community and thier desire to quickly squash any bugs and to tweak the game to make it a better gaming experience.", "timestamp_created": 1510945973, "timestamp_updated": 1510945973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36577032": {"recommendationid": "36577032", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964522341", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1515206480}, "language": "english", "review": "It's got a steep learning curve but is super rewarding.

The combat sysytem is streamline but tactical. Sound and msuic is very good. Yes there is a shead lode of text to read, wich for me, is a problem as i have dyslicea. So whots the problem? \n\nThe game is open ended and yes its desined that way, its not my first pick in a game.  There is a good starting story line but at the moment its not very long and there is not a big over arcing story. I have read that is to to come but i am review it as is, and as is its not whot i would call a fully fleshed out game from a story perspective. Also there is no custome dificulty as of yet. Why is this a problem? permy death is reserved for the higher dificulty wich can be brutl and the easy is so basic that there is littel to no risk. personly i would like the opshon to make aspects easy but have a real sence of mortalty, Like say Inviserbal inc.\n\nThe key think to remeber is that i have been told the company dose have a good track recoled of seeing a project throw.

This is not a sponsored nor endorsed review. I received my Steam key for Early Access on November 16th, 2017 that was accounted for by my backing tier on Kickstarter. Please do not let the amount of time shown played be a real reflection of the 30+ hours I have already put into this game. \n\n\n     Have you ever read a good science fiction book, watched a engaging sci-fi TV show, or been into a riveting movie so much that you wish you were there? With this game, Star Traders: Frontiers from Trese Brother Games, now you can.  This may seem like a game you have played before, but it has a few new tricks up its sleeve. An ambitious game that seems nearly improbable for a team of just 3 to pull off, Frontiers is the direct sequel to 2009's Star Traders RPG on Android/iOS/Amazon for mobile. This is the 5th game in the series and shows how much detail that TB have added to their lore in addition to their coding and art skills. If you liked the first game and/or have played Elite, Lightspeed, and other \"Space Traders sims\"; you will most assuredly find a lot to love here.  \n\n     Each new captain you create will have their own career story. You may choose not to follow the tutorial storyline, but it is there for you to get a better grasp on the mythos that TB have painstakingly worked on. You will captain an entire ship full of crew that aren't just drones. Each person in this game has their own motivations and character growth. You decide how to shape them in addition to your captain as you all face the Frontiers of a new galaxy together. There are lots of choices and even more things to customize.  You'll be surprised at what might just be possible. \n\n     It has to be stated that there is no wrong way to play this game. It can also be seen as a rogue-lite in some comparisons...especially at the higher difficulties. Be prepared to lose captains somewhat often in earlier difficulties and most assuredly in the highest ones. There is a growing Wiki for information for new players and veterans alike. This game is not set in stone and as with their other games, TB will certainly continue to support this game for quite a long time to come.  {as I was typing this, they posted an update for ST:RPG. That level of loyalty and compassion is missing from most devs and especially on an android app that is nearly 9 years old.)\n\n     Finally, please know that their community is one of the safest and most fun communities around. They have worked even harder on their community than on their games and it shows. You can reach either dev on most days in the forums, on their discord, or other avenues. They are always willing to talk to fans, answer questions, accept bugs found, and have even been known to take player suggestions into the game. \nFinally, you will never find any P2W Microtransactions, nor even any loot boxes ever. \n\n     My name is LordofSyn. I am a staunch supporter of the Trese Brothers and their games since I found them years ago on Android. I would love to see other dev teams, big and small, match the level of success and the level of communications with their fan base as the Trese Brothers have and continue to do day in and day out. I also post Let's Plays of many of their games and have a current series for this game too.

I guess they didn't get the message that said two brothers shouldn't undertake such an ambitious project that trangresses and remixes many of the traditional genres to create an epic sandbox space trading rpg set in an evolving almost 4X like universe that has a life of it's own far beyond the actions of a single captain. Whether they didn't get the message or just refused to heed it is a very good thing, because they've succeeded amazingly with the initial release of Star Traders Frontiers.\n\nSeriously who hasn't been playing an RPG and just wished that they could quit the story and go for a romp around the world and still have fun and progress and influence the outcomes of various events from a different angle, and then maybe pick up the story again after it's progressed some without you. STF offers that and so many other ways of playing and engaging the with world that it's hard to believe it can all be held together. The game manages to bust the boundaries and yet it still provide an environment that will demand a high-level of focus from the player in order to accomplish whatever goals they're pursuing. \n\nHaving played the game considerably in the alpha stage, it's worth saying that this, like other deep games, requires the player to take some time to learn to swim. It's not one that you pick up and immediately know how to play. It is, however, definitely worth the investment to figure it out. Playing in Early Access you've also got the opportunity to help influence the further development of the game and work out this kinks that aren't working for you. These developers are probably the most responsive devs to their community and if something is working, or fully implemented right now, you can be sure that they will get it smoothed out, sometimes in 24 hours, sometimes a bit longer ;). \n\nEither way I can't wait to see what this game will be like when it reaches full maturity.

First its a Trese Brothers game. These guys do WORK. Templar Battleforce, SteelHeroes RPG, Star Traders 4x, etc. etc. We are talking about updates that are FREE, and last about as long as Paradox updating. We are talking YEARS of polishing, free updates, a fantastic community, and a downright amazing developer response time. These guys are up there with Soldak, CD Projekt RED, and Spiderweb software when it comes to amazing post-release support. Templar Battleforce recieved a rediculous amount of content and is to this day one of my favorite Space-Hulk/XCOM type games.\n\nSo what are you getting with this title, its current release, and future plans. First, lets discuss what the game is. You are a space trader. Its a 2D top-down strategy game where you fly around, accept missions, trade goods, fight pirates, and generally whatever you want to do. All while maintaining your ship, your crew, and your rep with the various space factions. Escape Velocity Nova, Space Rangers 2 HD, Endless Sky, Oolite, Star Nomad 2, all do similar things. So what ELSE are you getting? ST:F offers a living, breathing galaxy. Not quite X3:Terran Conflict, but far more than Freelancer. You have warring factions, blockades, contacts for missions who you build relationships or play against one another.\n\nThen you have the crew. Your crew consists of regular joes who help on the ship or in combat. Your officers are like the captain and can have 3 jobs, everyone gets levels and talents. Which is good, because space is dangerous. I'm not just talking starship destruction. Crew in-fighting, sickness, mutiny, all kinds of things can go south very quickly, which is manageable with said talents everyone gets. Think Sid Meier's Pirates. You don't leave port without a time limit. Same applies here, fuel, supplies, etc all play a part in day to day life. You are managing a ship and crew. You are a star-captain. Act like it.\n\nIn the game's current state its missing some story content, but you've got a big galaxy to roam around in, working faction interactions, and a rediculous amount of things to do. Want to Spy for a faction? ok. Pirate traders? Sure thing. Hunt down bounties? No problem. Explore new planets and get into combat? Absolutely.\n\nCombat in this game is turn based. So your ship moves toward the enemy ship, and you choose what weapons to fire or talents to use. Ground/Boarding Party combat is .... well it reminds me of a Darkest Dungeon-lite. You assign 4 positions and it plays out a bit like an rpg. Talents and weapons play a key role here.\n\nThe game is polished and playable right now. However, Trese Brothers is OUTSTANDING when it comes to content addition, and polishing of their game. If their past titles are any indication they will still be tweaking and perfecting this sandbox gem years from now.\n\nEver watched Firefly? Smugglers V, Endless Sky, and Space Rangers 2 not doing it for you? Give this a try. Its fast becoming my favorite 2d Sid Meier's Pirates clone. So much going on here, and as they add more story and sandbox features I can't imagine it not becoming one of the best of its kind.\n\nIt also runs on potatoes. Like an actual potatoe. Out of the ground. With no electricity, and it has an AMAZING price. The fact that you don't own it already hurts me like when you bought Pixel Privateers and Star Nomad 2. Or when you pre-ordered Star Sector. This game rocks. If you like space, crew/ship management and making your own way among a vibrant and living universe with Warhammer 40k esque lore, than you owe it to yourself to own this game.\n\nSounds like a paid review huh? Well there are some downsides. The UI needs a bit of work, but I prefer it to say Star Nomad 2. The game can feel a little barebones if you are new to this type of game, and have no idea how to make it up from nothing in a crap ship. Its a bit grindy, (granted this genre is much like JRPG's.) and frankly it could use more weapon and ship types. However, again, I have had nothing but great experiences with Trese Brothers.\n\nAs someone who freaking adores open ended ship trading/fighting games, from New Horizons mod, to Elite Dangerous, to  Escape Velocity Nova(Endless Sky.), I have been playing this type of game for the last decade or so. Constantly looking for the one that was perfect for me. Space Rangers 2 was close, but it lacked crew. EV: Nova was close, but it again lacked people aboard my ship. (and the combat was tedious.) I only have a few hours after work and family, and I'm playing this game. In a golden age of video games, media, and my other hobbies, I still find myself thinking about my next captain and the strategies it will take to thrive in Hard mode. It already is very good, and with the quality I expect out of Trese Brothers, I expect it to become great.\n\nChrist. You read all that? You must really not be sure. Take it from me. This game is worth your time. Not buggy. Fun, and will have lots of content upon full release. Plus its one of the most polished EA's Ive ever played, and the community actively gets responses from the developer.

Moreover this being a Trese Brothers game I have no doubt that the devs will keep updating and improving the game for years (just look at their record with the Templar Battleforce).\n\nThis is an early access release, but I have encountered no bugs so far and there is plenty of content to explore already. It is a rather complex game though, so expect to spend some time figuring out how various aspects of the game work - I guess some people might feel a bit overwhelmed and it certainly isnt for everyone, but I would say it is well worth the time to figure things out.

At first glance, its scope seems similar to - or even larger than - that of Paradox's grand strategy offerings. Whether this proves to be the case in the long run is something I shall no doubt discover and share here.\n\nThe second impression: \"oldschool\". Oldschool in a good way. In a comforting, \"I'm at home\" type of way. Even though I have little-to-no idea of what I'm actually doing yet. The interface, though bewildering at first (not unlike a Paradox title) is very welcoming (very unlike a Paradox title) and not so daunting that you're inclined to simply give up. Over time, the UI starts to make sense. A lot more sense than it does at the beginning, anyway. Hotkeys are a welcome addition here and, once you've become familiar with them, you can achieve most things with them. Tooltips is another welcome feature which compliments the available hotkeys well.\n\nThe third impression: \"Just one more turn.\"\n\nFurther bulletins as events warrant.

I recived my key from backing the Kickstarter. \n\nStar Traders: Frontiers is primarily a game about a single Captain, their ship, their loyal Officers and their crew. The gameplay is primarily sandbox oriented, with the player being able to freely move from world to world, trading in the Exchanges, exploring the vast untamed Wild Zones, Spying for precious intel, fighting in the silence of the void or chasing down criminals in a gravity well. However, every choice made comes with consequences, be they good or ill. Crew, Officers, and even the Captain can and will die in battle or in unforgiving wilderness. The Factions do not treat lawbreakers kindly, and beware the terror of the Xeno. \n\nThe story is still only in its opening stages, but it already has a lot to do. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I shall only say that many things happen, and you can choose your level of involvement. Do you stay aloof and neutral, fully back your allies, or maybe just go on your way, seeking out another distant star for different opportunities? \n\nThe galaxy is full of secrets, potential, allies and enemies. Make no mistake, your first Captain will die. And likely your second and third as well. The difficulty scale in this game is not a joke. Even as an experienced player, I still lose Captains to careless mistakes, falling behind the difficulty curve, or simple bad luck. However, if you prefer a less harrowing experience, the lower difficulty options will make for a more forgiving world, perfect to learn in until you feel that you can move up to the next rung on the ladder. \n\nFinally, the devs, the Trese Brothers, are always looking to improve their games, and have an excellent track record of doing so. In the closed Alpha alone there have been over 60 updates, and if the original Star Traders RPG is anything to go by, there will likely be hundreds more in the pipeline. The devs are almost always on their forum or in their Discord server, and they are always happy to take suggestions, requests for new features, and answer questions. \n\nNow Captain, the Crew are at their stations, the Engines are warming up, and the galaxy awaits you.

The Wiki pages are automatically updated.The Wiki pages just scratch the surface, you really need to experience the depth for yourself in realtime play. \n\nI can write four or five pages.  But that wouldn't be a review, and who would have the patience to read it.  When looking for a new game, my eyes glaze over after about a page.  That length belongs in a Steam guide I\u2019ll be putting together later.  \n\nThere is an Advanced mode button.  This lets you create your Captain, Officers, and crew\nto your exact finely detailed specifications. Quick start is like looking at your watch to see what time it is.  Advanced is like building your own watch.  Advanced will offer you all 9 current Captain types to start with instead of 4.  Each Captain and officer will develop up to 3 jobs as you play.\n\nThis game is not frozen in carbonite.  Trese Brothers will continue to add content and fix bugs long after purchase. As normal, Steam will update with the new versions as they are released.\n\nQuick Start:\nAfter installing if you want to jump right in without allot of setup, there are 4 pre-made Captain templates for you to choose from. You can start playing in two or three minutes.\n   \nSelect a Template and Click the Launch button.\nChoose game difficulty.\nChoose a Map: You can use the default map or create your own.\nChoose a Faction:  Which house or Syndicate do you want to join at the beginning.\nCustomize, Choose from male or  female Captains.  How do you want your Captain to dress\nWhat does the face look like and more.\nClick the Launch button\n\nSimple right?  You just started a very long fun journey.  How, when, and the people you interact with in this game determines your fate.  Each of them has enemies and friends, if you perform a service for one contact are you helping or hurting someone else in a distant quadrant?  When you meet them they won\u2019t forget what you did.  If you return from a mission is your contact still alive?\n\nCrew & Officers:  Each of them have their own distinct personalities, and traits.  You can decide to promote them, fire them, or just take a calculated risk.  They can quit or even mutiny.  What makes a crew member tick affects the rest of the crew, and ship performance.  Like everybody else none of them are completely good or bad.  You will not automatically understand who they are, hidden traits will be revealed during game play. \n\nHot Keys, are increasingly rare in laptop/desktop games.  Saves allot of clicks.  Hover over an icon to reveal the keyboard shortcut.  The Escape key is your best friend to exit cutscenes you have seen a dozen times before, and backing out of other screens quickly.\n\nI\u2019ve done my best to keep the review brief.  If you want to know more, Steam guides are being prepared.  Google \u201cTrese Brothers\u201d to see hundreds of helpful Forum  threads, and as mentioned above take a look at the Wiki pages.

Then dos-box and play it. Really!) AND crew postion based turn-combat lifted straight out of that brilliant gothic Go-Mad-And-Die 'Em up Darkest Dungeon. \nWrap it all an open world world map of dynamic factions who ally, war, and screw each other over in a sci-fi setting that looks heavily inspired by Frank Herbert's Dune, Warhammer 40k and the lightspeed Age of Sail stylings of long-dead 90's tabletop RPG Fading Suns and you have Star Traders: Frontiers.\n\nOk, so far, so cliched sci-fi meanderings, right? Well the lore genuinely feels more like fond tribute than generic rip-off for one but still why is this game good?\n\nIt's about the things Star Traders strides forwards with where it's peers and predecesors stumbled.\n\nThe game world not only feels genuinely dynamic in a Total War Campaign Map kinda way, but Star Traders really maske you feel like you can influence things: the tasks you choose really feed into your faction's performance or undercut that of an opposing one. Random events that happen in a system really affect the kinds of encounter you will have: a sector might experience a trade boom with more merchant ships flooding the space lanes with laden cargo holds. A rise in local tensions will have aggressive military ships running stop searches on you cargo holds. There's a feeling of ebb and flow.\n\nIt gives you ley-way rather than forcing you into certain playstyle, be it letting you build your character,crew and ship for smuggling (which has quite and in depth mechanic), boarding and bounty capturing, long-haul trading, resource gathering or straight up carnage. Piracy is viable (and very profitable) and combat isn't punishing.\n\nYour crew matters! They're full customisable, learn and level up skills that will form that will be crucial to your success.  In many ways how you manage them will tailor your play style: you can recruit them to specialise your ships role or train them to fill in the gaps in your captain's resume, eg giving a combat spec'd character the ability to engage in smuggling, espionage and exploration.\nThese motley men and women will fight for you, die for you, desert you, even betray you if your not careful and develop their own traits and quirks as time goes on. \n\nDid I mention this all just Early Access? There are already a few NPC's with branching quest lines and at least one big event that spawned a new faction. And the dev's (a two-man team I believe) are dropping content regulary. In the past 3 days alone there have been daily updates adding content.\n\nA word of warning though, and this is important - Star Traders: Frontiers is A ROGUELIKE- there is one save file that updates automatically. NO MANUAL SAVES - a deliberate choice by the dev's so that your choices have consequences. I'm not sure how I feel about this -I see their intent but it doesn't really help trial-and-error or experimental play. Crew and player permadeth is present. Having said that I'm playing on Basic difficulty and the game is very generous with cash, saving throws, and not-to-taxing combat. So just be aware of that.\n\nAnyhow, TLDR - Surprisingly deep 2d spaceship Rogulike with rpg and turn-based tactical combat elements in a dynamic galaxy. Total bargain.

It's the best port you could have ever imagined. It's pirates in a dynamic world that meets Crusader Kings, or Europa Universalis, or Victoria. It's deep and engaging, your choices matter. In addition the game has lots of mini-games that will keep you engaged like the ground combat that plays like Darkest Dungeon or space combat that reminds me FTL.\n\nThat's a big blow for EA, SEGA and all other monsters out there, who make games best on flashy graphics and first impressions.

It's amazing to be able to play a game that grows as my experience with it does. It's like constant free DLC!\n\nEarly Access besides, the game is really good. Every decision you make has an important impact on the various factions within the games universe. There are many facets of gameplay to explore and experience, such as ship customization and crew load outs. \n\nThe story changes and grows, branching in many directions depending on how to approach the problems you encounter as you progress. \n\nThere's about 6-10 difficulties from 'easy enjoy the story mode' to 'jesus christ what in the *bleep* was I thinking!'. This gives room for plenty of experientation and offer plenty of replay value.\n\nMuch is expected to be updated in the many updates, yet today the game remains a solid investment. It doesn't ever \"end\" as far as I can tell right now so there's a LOT of replay value. Potentially limitless as it stands today.\n\nFinally there are numerous play styles. You can play a Bounty Hunter, attacking pirates and rogues within the various star systems, a Merchant, trading with lands far and wide instead of focusing on combat, you can be a Smuggler, and many others. \n\nI highly recommend you buy this game!

Throw in some card mechanics, darkest dungeon-style ground combat and you get an idea of what Star Traders:Frontiers is about. \n\nFor a game in Early Access this is a pretty solid game as it is, with the devs (amazing dedicated guys, always active on the forum) adding in more content almost constantly. I'd say this is a good purchase even if you are normally a bit skeptic/careful with EA games. \n\nYou basically play as a captain of a desired profession. Merchant, Smuggler, Spy, Pirate etc.. These choices do affect your playstyle in the game so a bit of pre-planning is worthwhile. There is a storyline (not finished yet) you can follow or you can break from the main story and do your thing. But what's great is that the story progresses no matter if you interact with it or not. This gives the universe life IMO. Not many games do this so it's refreshing to see. \n\nThe game has 6 factions. Contacts (people that offer you jobs) all have their personal agendas. People they support or dislike. So all your actions have political consequences. Gain reputation some place, lose it elsewhere. A great system that keeps the player following his/hers own agenda according to what faction they wanna help. This is pretty complex IMO and makes for some great \"roleplaying\" opportunities. \n\nI'm not good at reviews. So for more detailed info check some more indepth ones or come by the forum and ask if you are curious. I give this game a solid recommendation. The devs are fantastic with several games to their name, it's very clear it's a passion project of theirs.  They communicate a lot with the players and are listening to each and every suggestion. So if you wanna help shape the game, maybe come up with some brilliant idea that could make it into the game, now is your chance to do exactly that. \n\nRegarding stability; So far I haven't had any problems with stability. The game just runs smooth and perfectly.\n\nJust buy this damn game already.

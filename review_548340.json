I expected more from a game with 94% positive reviews, maybe people in 2016 just had really low expectations but now I need more to enjoy something in VR than just some nice interacting with things.\nThere is nothing here to inspire you or to impress you, or that really makes you feel smart, just a \"ok, I found it, is this all?\" experience.\n\nThe game is well done, but it's not fun or satisfying enough to be worth the 4.50\u20ac I paid for it.", "timestamp_created": 1515976819, "timestamp_updated": 1515989952, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39306359": {"recommendationid": "39306359", "author": {"steamid": "76561198800720829", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 73, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514969390}, "language": "english", "review": "WHAT'S IN THE BOX?\nAbode is an 'escape the room' game, that is you are locked in a room and need to escape by solving puzzles. Abode has a main room and a side room and you have to find keys and codes for various machinery to progress through the game. You teleport around, investigate items, put object A into object B and so on. \n\nVISUALS\nAbode has a sort of comic style visual design, everything is quite stylized. The room you are in is a weird mix of sci-fic tech (floating screen) and old-style stuff (like a record player) which I found a bit strange, but overall the objects are well-designed and colored.\n\nSOUND\nThere isn't much in the terms of sound; there is background noise like cars driving by and then some sounds when interacting with objects. The sound fits the game nice though so no complaints here.\n\nCONTROLS\nYou don't have hands but some stylized controller-type things which have only one small point with which to take things which I found a bit annoying. Grabbing and using objects was a bit awkward sometimes since larger objects get stuck on walls or other objects and fall out of hand. Also there are three keys for different locks which look identical but can only be used on one of the locks which leads to lots of trying out how to make a key fit. There is an inventory system which I found to be more distracting than useful. \n\nGAMEPLAY\nThere is no story as such, as is often the case in escape games (other than \"you need to escape!\"). The puzzles are well designed overall if sometimes a bit obscure (The plant! OMG!). The puzzles don't make \"sense\" in the real world and are not logically connected, but simply a string of challenges; I personally would have liked are more logical way to escape but there are some really nice puzzle ideas in there. \n\nBOTTOM LINE\nIf you like escape games, then this is a good one and provides a nice challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1515844007, "timestamp_updated": 1515844117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39273599": {"recommendationid": "39273599", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074046884", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "last_played": 1515728377}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Basic Puzzles, Holds Your Hand Too Much[/h1]\nI bought [i]Abode[/i] because I thought it looked like a fun escape-room style game. To make sure I played with no spoilers I actively avoided watching any videos associated with the game until I had finished my playthrough. I wish I hadn't bothered waiting.\n\nWhile [i]Abode[/i] is part of the escape-room genre, it's far too much of a tutorial into what escape-rooms are rather than an actual challenge. To understand why, I'll have to explain out some spoilers to the game, so I'll break the spoilers into 2 categories:\n[list]\n[*](Puzzle Elements) - Objects necessarry to complete the escape-room challenge are discussed. Solutions to the appropriate use of these objects are not. These spoilers will probably give you some hints as to what objects you should focus on.\n[*](Puzzle Solutions) - Solution uses of objects are discussed. Clues unlocked along the way and hidden puzzle elements are discussed here. These spoilers will most definitely ruin your ability to play the game with a clean slate.\n[/list]\n\n[b][u]The Format Of [i]Abode[/i]'s Escape-Room[/u][/b]\nThe gameplay used to escape the room is divided into two parts: (Puzzle Solutions)[spoiler]destruction of everything followed by following the 'clues'.\nIn engaging in absolute chaos you just need to make sure that no stone is left unturned. Empty every container, open every drawer, and move every object that can be moved. You should find the bathroom key and the entire first set of rings. And you don't even need the bathroom key you found to get in.[/spoiler] The game has no safeguards against walking through the door, other than a dimmed display during the brief second you're clipping through it.\n(Puzzle Solutions)[spoiler]The first set of rings will set you up for the second phase. Simply insert as instructed and each one awards you a clue that will lead you to a second set of rings. With the second set of rings and the world code, you have everything needed to open the final safe and get the exit key.[/spoiler]\n\n[b][u]The Individual Puzzles[/u][/b]\nThe puzzles in [i]Abode[/i] almost all lack any sort of challenge. And it's because of the 'clues'. In playing this escape-room, I feel like only a couple of the clues this game includes actually have any merit to be a part of the experience. Almost all of them are holding your hand and removing all of the challenge in the game. You could argue that clues like (Puzzle Elements)[spoiler]the cracked brick[/spoiler] are necessary when players get stuck. I agree with that, but ones like that should be delayed and identified as a [b]hints[/b] to help you keep moving, separate from the [b]clues[/b] which are necessary to finish the challenge. And with puzzles like (Puzzle Solutions)[spoiler]the bathroom physical, where the password is obtained from an obviously and easily coded phone message, and one of the 'clues' is literally just telling you to do the physical,[/spoiler] there's no feeling of success when you advance because the steps taken just seemed obvious or were given in exact directions.\n\nBecause the game is so straightforward (Puzzle Solutions)[spoiler]once you just start destroying everythings[/spoiler] I find little reason to recommend it to anyone in its current state.", "timestamp_created": 1515735671, "timestamp_updated": 1515735769, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39192216": {"recommendationid": "39192216", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067883432", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 87, "last_played": 1515444478}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome, relaxing game.

I played for around 2 hours but It did take me a while to set things up and get used to everything so actual playtime is shorter than that.\n\nAlthough this is the first VR  game I have played and therefore I don't have anything to compare it to, I think this is a well made little indie game. I generally enjoy puzzle games and I thought it would be fun to try out an escape room type game. It's a pretty straight forward one and it's not difficult at all but the fun in this for me mainly came from the ability you have to really explore and search every nook and cranny. It's a lot more personal and immersive being able to literally crouch down and look under the sofa, or peer into a fish tank to look for fishies.\n\nIn terms of play space I don't really have any room to move around, yet I still found it enjoyable to play. I just had to be a bit more careful. As my computer isn't quite up to scratch I use my dads computer whenever I can to get in some VR gaming. It being in the family house it's pretty hard to get used to knowing you look like a right tit looking under imaginary sofas or banging imaginary drums (which were in the other game I tried during this sesh) and hearing a voice in the distance laugh and go \"You having fun there?\". \nWhy, yes. Yes I am.\n\nI was quite satisfied with this game and the amount of things in it that you could interact with. I imagine there is nothing more disappointing in VR than going to pick something up or interact with something and finding out you can't. Anything that I wanted to look at in this game gave me the choice to, so I was quite pleased with that.\n\nOverall I think this was a fun little game for anyone looking for a quick little puzzle or even just a basic VR game to start off with. I found the graphics were good, which is important in VR, and the sound quite immersive, so I would definitely recommend this one. It's short but sweet.\n\n\nTL;DR : It's a simple, short and immersive little puzzle game, great for beginners to VR or people who enjoy puzzle games. The graphics are good on the eyes, the sound is immersive and the puzzles aren't that hard but the environment is fun to rummage around in.", "timestamp_created": 1500062406, "timestamp_updated": 1500062406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33543072": {"recommendationid": "33543072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025507808", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502304409}, "language": "french", "review": "Si vous aimez les escape game et que vous avez un casque VR, n'h\u00e9sitez pas, vraiment une super exp\u00e9rience.\nLes \u00e9nigmes sont vraiment sympas. \nTellement bon qu'on en veut plus, si il y a une suite ou tout simplement une autre salle en DLC, je prendrai direct !", "timestamp_created": 1500060761, "timestamp_updated": 1500060761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33539081": {"recommendationid": "33539081", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993671994", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 170, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500047694}, "language": "french", "review": "Bon petit escape room (1-2h) !

There was no expectation of a positive review.\n\nSummary: Surprisingly fun escape room game. Not hard for experienced players, but a few puzzles do make you think. Estimates of a 60 minute play time are about right - considering \"actual reality\" escape rooms are $35 to $60 per person for an hour, the $10 price tag seems fair for fans of the genre.\n\nAdditional Comments: I played Abode after I Expect You To Die (IEYTD) and Please Don't Touch Anything (PDTA), other games that could be considered escape rooms. It compares favorably to both, as a true room scale escape room experience - the first I've done in VR.\n\nIn comparison to IEYTD, Abode falls a bit short on pure polish: there is less humor, no voice over/narration/story, and perhaps most importantly, Abode's puzzles appear to have only one solution where IEYTD rewards creativity. On the plus side, Abode's one overarching situation (vs. the episodic approach of IEYTD) and more mobility makes for a great feeling of immerson. IEYTD is also $25 on Oculus Home for about 2 hours of content (vs. about 1 hour for $10 for Abode), so Abode is a much easier financial entry point.\n\nPlease Don't Touch Anything is less an escape room vs. a series of independent puzzles, so it's harder to compare. That said, PDTA has more puzzles and is significantly harder, so it lasts much longer. On the flip side, Abode has more variety, all objects are interactible, it was built for room scale, and it has better Touch integration (PDTA is kind of janky and works better as a controller game). Though I love PDTA, I think Abode edges it out for fun; PDTA gets the win if you're looking for real brain bending puzzles.\n\nTouch integration is quite good, though see my suggestions below. Rift players should know the following:\n1. Many things must be picked up from the floor, so be sure your setup supports this (no problem for me, 3 camera 8 foot x 8 foot setup). If you have trouble, download Steam VR Advanced Settings and use the \"Floor Fix\" option to set the floor a bit higher in-game than in reality.\n2. Front-facing setups should be fine, note that the joystick does snap turns (I didn't see this documented anywhere).\n3. One puzzle requires physical poses; if the pose moves your controllers out of the view of the sensor, the puzzle won't \"progress\". Reposition yourself (maybe step back, or bend your knees a bit) until something happens. Hope this makes sense when you get there. (I'm tall, so my hands graze the ceiling when over my head - apparently I have a small dead zone 1\" from the ceiling - though I didn't notice this in VR Sports Basketball).\n\nA few suggestions to the developers:\n1. The Touch controls are good, but the interaction model feels a little \"off\". Most Touch games use the grip button to grab/hold, and trigger to use. Abode uses trigger to grab, and A to use (sometimes, others it's a physical action). Similarly, I'm used to Arizona Sunshine's implementation of teleport: just push the stick to pick your location, and release it to teleport. Abode's \"A\" button laser took a while to get used to, and it's hard to teleport with some things in your hand.\n2. A controller layout diagram or more controller help would be useful, I struggled a bit to figure out how to do some things.\n3. The alternate ending is hilarious and took me by complete surprise. However, it could confuse some people (no spoilers), and could be considered \"off color\" by some. Considering I want my 11-year old daughter to play, it would be nice to have an option to turn it off. However, I totally appreciate the auto-save immediately before, allowing me to easily see the normal ending.\n4. I'd love an option for a timer. Having a countdown clock (say, a 60-minute default that you could adjust based on difficulty level) would add a level of tension that's currently missing. Running out of time could just prompt a message like, \"You're out of time. Continue from here, or restart in Hard mode?\" (which could be a 30-minute timer).\n5. Personal preference, but I wish the \"hint\" disks were colored differently from \"needed\" disks. Some hints were too good, making a tricky puzzle easy. It would be nice to be able to skip those and only \"use\" them when I got stuck.\n\nOverall, the suggestions above are minor and didn't detract from the game. Nice job to the devs, and I look forward to having my daughter play through.", "timestamp_created": 1487015085, "timestamp_updated": 1487015085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29890711": {"recommendationid": "29890711", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980408930", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486959221}, "language": "english", "review": "Very much like a real life \"Escape Room\" game we did near us.

When you can pick up a lit cigar that has nothing to do with any of the puzzles and pull an unlit cigar from a case and touch the ends together to light the unlit one, it's an insignificant action, but it does a lot to give you a sense of presence in the game, and Abode does that sort of thing really well. It's on the longer end of the spectrum as far as length goes, so you can get at least a little under an hour out of it. It's hard to say much without talking too much about the game, but if you like escape room games you'll love Abode.

They're not too hard, yet not easy and straight forward. Each one leades to another in a way which you are never stuck and you know where you should focus on next. At the time I was bought it other players and I ran into a small glitch where the mail shoot wasn't magnetic and wouldn't grab the pipes, but after a quick restart of the game it fixed itself and I was able to solve it. Other people are complaining the ending was odd and didn't match the style, but I quite liked it and was a \"satisfying\" end. My only complant is the price, I think 10$ is too much for the 45 minutes (how long it took me) of gameplay, and I can not justify keeping it and never playing it again.

Overall, this is a well designed game.  It has some good puzzles and some easy ones.  The overall play time is roughly an hour [or a lot more], which is the appropriately length for an escape room game.  For escape rooms, I feel that the game-play/puzzle element is the most important aspect of the game.  This game does it well (for the most part) in that regard.  Some may not get over the cartoon art style.  But when you're busy solving puzzles, you don't even think about it.  It just so happens that I do like the art style and presentation of the game.  So, that's a bonus.\n\nLong:  [SPOILER ALERT:  FEEDBACKS - STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO RUIN YOUR EXPERIENCE]  :-)\n\nWhile I enjoyed playing this game overall, I felt that some of the gameplay could be improved.  I feel that a lot of the clues were unnecessary.  They practically tell you where to go and get items or figure things out.  For example:\n\n1- The main computer code\n2- The drawer hidden compartment\n3- The broken brick\n4- The trash can\n5- The email pipe map\n\nIt would be a lot more rewarding to discover these on your own.  They are not hard to begin with (maybe except the brick).\n\nInstead of giving away clues, maybe incorporate a hint system into the game where users can request these clues as needed.\n\nOr have difficulty levels.  Add clues for easy level and no clues for difficult level.\n\nOther than those, I had fun playing this game.  Even in its current state, I would not hesitate to recommend this game.  It's just that it could be more rewarding in the end knowing you got all those items on your own.\n\nThanks and looking forward to more escape rooms!\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480983748, "timestamp_updated": 1480983748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28206867": {"recommendationid": "28206867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001217962", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498355146}, "language": "english", "review": "Abode is a marvelous Sci-fi experience within VR.\n\nEvery aspect in the game feels polished and friendly to any skill level gamer.\nBudget about an hour to an hour and a half for the full game. \nIf you are into \"escape the room\" games, then this is the one for you.

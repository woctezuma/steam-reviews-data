Pretty easy and straight forward. Cute characters, dialogue, art style/graphics. Really strong voice acting.\n\nIf I were to complain about something, it would be the lack of suspicion the games builds up for each character as a suspect. It's pretty much non-existent. It's a murder mystery, you should be suspecting everyone at some point. You should be confused and trying to figure it out. I never really felt like that with this game. I ruled out most of the characters pretty quickly. And there's a lack of suspense as well, which made the \"reveal\" lackluster. The end, where you're basically recaping everything you've discovered and end up finding out who did it... It just feels like... \"Yeah. That person did it. Whatever.\"... It was pretty unsatisfying, even though it was obvious who it was, so I knew it would probably be unsatisfying. It's kinda hard to describe the feeling. \n\nIt's definitely not an amazing game. I wouldn't even call it great. But for me to not recommend something, it would have to be bad, or stupid to me. This wasn't that. For what it is, it's a nice little game. I would say the voice acting is the only thing that stood out as something that was really good to me, but besides that, the game didn't have anything that I was overly impressed by. But at the same time, it didn't have any flaws that were extremely noticable either.

The artwork reminds me of a picture book, the voice acting is excellent (although the sound quality seemed to be a little inconsistent - some characters' lines were occasionally a little soft or muffled), and the story was interesting. However, the \"puzzles\" were ridiculously easy. There were only a couple that required even a little thought on my part: one of the character \"challenge\" puzzles, which wasn't a big deal since the game lets you try again as often as necessary until you get it right, and the combination to Echo's tent. The chemical analysis puzzles could have been a little more interesting but turned out to be a joke, and most of the rest of the puzzles just involed either moving things out of the way or putting together a simple jigsaw puzzle.\n\nAs far as the investigation aspects went, I was a little disappointed there as well. There were times when I thought characters would respond to certain pieces of evidence but didn't, and times when I wanted Detective Grimoire to further question a suspect but the game decided that we were done with that topic. I did really like the last part of the game, though, when players were asked to explain what happened and who the murderer was using the various clues they collected. \n\nIt wasn't a bad game, but it was much, much easier than I expected it to be.\n\nPros:\n+ Excellent artwork.\n+ Good voice acting.\n+ Relatively interesting little murder mystery.\n+The final \"whodunnit\" mechanics were pretty good.\n\nCons:\n- Most of the puzzles are so simple that they don't even really qualify as puzzles.\n- No real replay value. Also, as far as I could tell it isn't possible to skip more than one line of dialogue at a time, so having to go through all that dialogue again could be pretty annoying.\n- Since it wasn't always clear which pieces of evidence would generate a useful response from the suspects and which wouldn't, I ended up trying everything.

It's just...not to sound girly, but it's friggin' cute.  And a pretty good murder mystery, to boot.\n\nThe good points: relatively good cartoon animation, as you already see, as well as professional voice acting that at times made me forget it was a game, though that's not to say the 'cutscenes' are drawn out, as you play those parts as heavily as anything else.  It's simplicity means no glitches, and it's good for a wide range of ages (I'm 27, and played it with my 8-year-old nephew, and neither of us lost interest until the end).  All of the characters were interesting and fun to watch. \n Some puzzles threw me for a loop (well, one did) to the point where I just cheated and googled the answer while my nephew was in the bathroom, so adults shouldn't get cocky.  It's fun.  I'd rank it higher than Murdered: Soul Suspect, anyway.  It was more fun than L.A.Noire, though I won't claim that it's as authentic.  You'll have a good time.\n\nThe bad points: it's only one murder mystery, which lasts around 3 hours if you're not cheating.  As far as the murderer goes, my nephew and I both called it as soon as we started talking to that person, so you might find it too obvious.  Figuring the murderer out isn't the hard part, though, you have to prove it by having the evidence and using it at the right time.  It's not exactly Ace Attorney, but it's interesting.

With an unique visual style and a whimsical cast of characters this game hooked me right from the start.\n\nPlaying the eponymous Detective Grimoire, you are charged with solving a mysterious crime, that happened at a tourist attraction, located in the depths of a swamp. During your investigation, you will examine and pick up pieces of evidence, solve basic puzzles, as well as interview the inhabitants and workers at the tourist attraction. While these gameplay mechanics are nothing new, SFB Games make the best of it: Every once in a while you are faced with the task of forming a sentence out of pieces of evidence, characters and phrases (it is a rather simple system, but has lots of possible combinations, making a random success unlikely). This way, the developers make sure that you really understand what you are doing. If you form the right sentence you are rewarded with a \"challenge\", meaning that you can confront one of your suspects with your conclusions, often revealing important information. These systems are a perfect fit for the game and i found them to be very engaging.\nDetective Grimoire's Story is nothing exceptional, but rather well-crafted; the characters are distinct and intriguing with nice animations and well-written dialog. The visual design (most notably character design) is the most apparent selling point of this game and really gives it a special flair. Together with the athmospheric soundtrack it creates the impression of a lovingly created game.\n\n[i]But enough praise, let's nitpick a little![/i]\nBeing a casual/children's game, Detective Grimoire will be pretty [b]easy[/b] for most adult players (, but I think a perfect fit for younger audiences). Also, the game is available on mobile devices, too; which is basically a good thing, but is reflected in the rather [b]low resolution[/b] the game is displayed in on the PC. This dampens the quality of the artworks a little and makes the menus appear a little overbearing.\nLast but not least: This game is [b]very short[/b]. I finished it in two and a half hours, and you might do so even faster. While this does not particularly bother me, many people on Steam seem to be very attentive, when it comes to game length.\n\n[b]All in all, I would still recommend Detective Grimoire, because its flaws are extensively outweighed by its qualities. It is a very athmospheric, engaging Adventure, with some unique gameplay ideas and likeable cast of characters. If you have no problem with its brevity, I recommend it at its full price (6,99\u20ac here in Germany).[/b]\n\n[i]Have fun![/i]", "timestamp_created": 1505316492, "timestamp_updated": 1505318429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34906753": {"recommendationid": "34906753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096421544", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505242904}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want a short point and click this is your game.

The characters have some fun interactions with Detective Grimoire. As the player I found the repsonses you can say are surprisingly funny compared to some other games, I have some trouble deciding which I like more. The investigation itself is intuitive and the background story is very scooby-doo. There are small puzzles every so often, mini-investigations and I gotta say we don't get enough games where you get to play detective(in a non-linear way).\n\nThe voices are very fitting to the characters, every bit of dialogue has got a voice over it. Grimoire is pleasant to listen to, which is good because he's the one you'll hear the most, but something must have gone wrong in the audio mixing stage of production. Sometimes the dialogue sounds completely off and two characters sound like their voice was recorded with a cereal box. I suppose this could be from casting VO talent from different locations on the planet with different recording setups, but overall the game sounds great and I wouldn't call this a \"con\" to buying the game; just a gripe. As I said before the visual aesthetic is wonderful and although the cast don't have many animations I still love watching each idle movement when they talk.\n\nIt's a fun game I would recommend, a good story, decent gameplay, fun to unravel the mystery and put together clues, as well as refreshing to walk around and chat up suspects at your own pace and not be forced down a single route.", "timestamp_created": 1503435307, "timestamp_updated": 1503435307, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.510022", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34405476": {"recommendationid": "34405476", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977303947", "num_games_owned": 406, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503238853}, "language": "english", "review": "A short and sweet point and click adventure.

You play a detective who's sent to a tourist attraction in a swamp to investigate a murder that took place there. You need to talk to the suspects, gather clues and then piece together the clues and the statements from the suspects to find out what happened and who's the murderer.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nIn most point & click adventure games you collect items and use those items on objects in the game world, sometimes after combining them with other items in your inventory first. In [i]Detective Grimoire[/i], you just gather clues. Clues can be items or they can be statements made by the seven suspects. You don't use your items on objects in the game world to advance, you only collect them to puzzle together the whole story behind the murder.\n\nTo gather clues, you investigate objects in the swamp and talk to suspects by simply clicking on them. Sometimes, investigating an object leads to a puzzle you need to solve in order to advance. The puzzles are very easy though.\n\nWhen you're talking to a suspect, you have a plethora of topics to bring up: there are a few basic conversational options, you can bring up an overview of all the items you collected and ask the NPC about any of them, you can ask their opinion on each of the other suspects and finally, you can unlock one conversational 'challenge' with each suspect, which is a conversation during which you deduce an essential clue.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nRichard Remington was the owner of a small tourist attraction that revolves around a mysterious creature known affectionately as Boggy. When Remington is found dead and it appears none other than Boggy is the culprit, detective Grimoire is sent to the swamp to investigate.  \n\nThe story plays out as a typical whodunit. Everyone is a suspect and clues are everywhere, waiting to be found and pieced together. \n\n[i]Detective Grimoire[/i] is a short game, about three hours playtime, so the story and its people don't get described in great detail but you do get a very decent narrative for your money. The swamp has a whole history that revolves around Boggy, the mythical creature that supposedly lives in the swamp. Each of the suspects has a distinct personality and has a personal view on the story of Boggy and on recent events. \n\nSomehow, despite showing some flaws, this game managed to get me invested in the story and its people. Important note, though: don't skip the credits that roll after you pieced together the mystery, as a final scene is shown that wraps up the story. And still the developer found it necessary to tease the player by ending the game with a [i]'To be continued'[/i] message. I looked into it a bit. In december 2015, the developer was awarded some funding for making Detective Grimoire 2 and promised more news 'soon'. But there has been nothing but silence since then. So it's not clear if the sequel will ever be made. Again, it doesn't really matter as the story of [i]Detective Grimoire[/i] is perfectly wrapped up at the end, provided you keep watching while the end credits are rolling.\n\n[h1]Graphics and sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are crude and artsy, so whether or not you like that style of graphics is an entirely subjective matter.\n\nThe voice acting ranges from okay to good. It's never bad but unfortunately it's never great either. Most of the times, what you hear is a voice actor delivering lines skillfully, but you don't hear the character come to life because of the voice acting, which is of course what's desired. In my opinion, there was only one voice actor who managed to rise above that level. \n\nThe music is atmospheric and sounds very nice. Combined with the ambient sounds of the swamp, at times it even sounded genuinely soothing and relaxing. \n\n[h1]On Steam's extra features[/h1]\n\n[i]Detective Grimoire[/i] has 10 Steam Trading Cards.

Most of which is quite fun and enjoyable, each puzzle feels very awarding to solve although they aren't all that difficult, finding a new clue and interrogating suspects feels very exciting, however exploring the tourist attraction is a bit tedious since there are many locations and most of them are very bland and boring.\n\nI would say that there isn't really to much of a mystery in this game, it's a fairly simple concept and not all that serious and exciting, which is OK, there's nothing wrong with having something just be simple, but don't expect anything amazing with this. In fact I would say that most of the elements of the game are fairly lacking and nothing really stands out, it's all good but nothing worth praising for.\n\nTo summarize Detective Grimoire is a fun game that will keep you entertained for a couple hours which I would recommend, but really isn't what you call a \"must play.\"", "timestamp_created": 1500882575, "timestamp_updated": 1500882575, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33758011": {"recommendationid": "33758011", "author": {"steamid": "76561198374397287", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500615014}, "language": "english", "review": "Super cute game with great voice acting and a visually appealing art style.

You are a detective, and you have to find clues, interrogate suspects, solve puzzles and piece it all together to solve a mystery.\n\nThe game is like your average point and click game with walking around and looking for things to click on and then solving puzzles, but it adds more to it - there's quite a lot of interaction with suspects, browsing through your case files, noting what seems to be important in solving the mystery and what doesn't. While solving the mystery isn't too hard and the puzzles are very easy (also, the liquid mixing one was completely pointless), there's a whole lot of fun to be had. \n\nThe story is my favourite part of the game - you're given some very simple information to start off with, but the mystery keeps building onto itself and giving you more and more questions, then tying them all together and providing satisfying answers near the end. The characters were interesting, but human-like, and, with each one having some evidence pointing towards them, you'll be guessing the murderer until the last moments. The dialogue was witty and the great writing was enhanced by the well done voice acting. There's also plenty of cool, small details that are easy to overlook - for example, during the question puzzles, where you have to make a question for the detective consisting of multiple parts, you can notice that there are some things that the detective keeps thinking about even though they're unrelated to the investigation. You can see the options \"my beard\" and \"my hair\" appear (Grimoire is worried about how he looks), or \"Sally's hair\" and \"Sally's legs\" (Implying that he has the hots for Sally). Little details like that don't add much to the game, but they make the characters seem more human and relatable, as well as giving you a small chuckle when you notice them.\n\nThe artwork was done pretty well (noticeably the same people who did Haunt the House), the game was beautifully drawn while retaining a cartoony charm. The music wasn't anything out of this world, but it was good enough for me to notice it and enjoy listening to it while playing the game.\n\nFor fellow completionists: All achievements in this game are very easy to get, and 100% completion comes in 2-4 hours. It's a bit short for my taste, but if you only care about the percentage, this one's for you.\n\nOverall, this game was very short but very fun and clever.

The only real downside to me would be the lack of \"complexity\" involved with the puzzles, and of course the length of the game may be a turn-off to some as well- however for me personally, I felt that the game was the right length for the price.

It all happened the day I discovered the original free flash version of \"Detective Grimoire\" - a wonderful, beautiful, dark, moody and entertaining murder mystery solving game. It was good then, and it still is one of my all times favorite flash games. If you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend to - the newer game even references to the older game a couple of times.\n\nAfter playing the original Detective Grimoire, I - as did many others, I'm sure - sought to find more great games by SFB Games. I was not disappointed to find other great games such as the \"Blue Rabbit\" games series (Climate Chaos was absolutely stunning, at the time anyway), and \"Haunt the House\" (which got a sequel on Steam as well, but that's for another review).\n\nWith that said, you can guess I was pretty hyped to try the brand new, shiny Detective Grimoire. When I saw it was 80% off for the Steam summer sale (2017, for future reference), I immediately bought and played it.\n\n[b]Review[/b]\n\nSo, what is Detective Grimoire? It's a \"lightweight\" and beautifully created detective game where you attempt to solve a murder under strange circumstances - a theme park in the middle of a swamp, themed around the sighting of a strange creature 60 years ago - which happens to be your primary suspect.\n\nAs you can tell by this short paragraph, the game is not extremely serious, and surely less so than the original Grimoire. The setting is much less dreary than the original, which is not exactly a bad thing. The characters are very memorable and likable, the voice acting and music is absolutely amazing. The game features many innovative ideas, such as combining clues with pieces of sentences to create a thought and progress through the game.\n\nNow, while I did enjoy the game, two things annoyed me. First, the game is extremely short, which isn't the main problem - some games are better short. The second and biggest issue was, without a doubt, the confusing choice of audience the developers were going for. Allow me to explain my thoughts...\n\nThis is a murder mystery game, featuring a creepy swamp and a scary monster as the prime suspect. While this may depend on the parent (or the child, who knows), one could debate that this would hardly be considered a kids game. But then again, the puzzles were hardly puzzles - more like ideas that mostly focused on the game engine's abilities (lots of 2D physics involved there) but not much thoughts put into making it any challenging. Some of the puzzles didn't even make much sense at all (the chemistry set one, for those who played the game - you'll know what I'm talking about) and could have been skipped entirely, at this point. Most puzzles were great ideas, but so poorly implemented that it was more like an attempt at slowing down the player's progress by a moment than anything else. No puzzle took me more than seconds to crack, and I'll be very honest - I generally suck at solving simple puzzles. So the question is, were the puzzle (and the game in general) designed to be easy on purpose?\n\nAnother thing that was a bit irritating was the slightly annoying \"move\" implementation. When playing games like these, you need to move from one screen to another while looking for hints. The fact that you must select the move option to get anywhere, and at every new screen you need to select the option to move again, made me just use the map move feature more than anything else. And this caused problems, because I only found one of the characters wayyy too late into the game. Sure, I'm partially to blame, but honestly, I just really didn't like the way moving from one location to the other is designed - I think it's just personal preferences, though.\n\nThat aside, I have to admit I did enjoy the game. As I mentioned before, the characters design, voicing and animations make the game a very pleasant experience.\n\nWhat could have been done better? Well, obviously the puzzles should be more challenging, the game should be longer, and the mystery a bit more \"mysterious\" rather than pretty obvious. The idea to combine hints was neat, but I would have loved to see it used a bit more often, with more \"freedom\" for lack of better words. The ability to take pretty much anything anyone said and combine it with any evidence or hints would have been extremely interesting, although I admit it would have its downside as well.\n\nOverall, I feel that the \"new\" Grimoire series is off to a good start, although I'd like to see a bit more of the old game in the new one. As for the pricing, I think it is slightly steep for such a short game. I finished it within roughly 2-3 hours, and would have been pretty disappointed if I hadn't bought it during a sale. But honestly, this is one of these opinions that change from person to person, or, more likely, wallet to wallet. Heh.\n\nWell, that was longer than expected.\nThanks for reading, if you managed to get all the way down here.", "timestamp_created": 1498748423, "timestamp_updated": 1498748548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751106", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32983168": {"recommendationid": "32983168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089375727", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498660398}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19 \u0e07\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22 \u0e40\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e34\u0e19 \u0e23\u0e32\u0e04\u0e32\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e41\u0e1e\u0e07", "timestamp_created": 1498731239, "timestamp_updated": 1498731239, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32969720": {"recommendationid": "32969720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198352904065", "num_games_owned": 1237, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 383, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498876327}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e94\u5757\u94b1\u4f60\u4e70\u4e0d\u4e86\u5403\u4e8f\uff0c\u4e70\u4e0d\u4e86\u4e0a\u5f53\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u6765\u5b66\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u518d\u9002\u5408\u4e0d\u8fc7\u3002\n\u5168\u7a0b\u5730\u9053\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u8986\u76d6\u52a0\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5355\u8bcd\u91cf\u4e5f\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u505c\u4e0b\u6765\u67e5\u8bcd\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u5267\u60c5\u3002\n\u53e6\u5916\u6709\u70b9\u540e\u6094\u6ca1\u591a\u82b1\u4e00\u5757\u94b1\u4e70\u97f3\u8f68\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u97f3\u4e50\u771f\u7684\u8fd8\u86ee\u597d\u542c\u7684\u554a~~~~\n", "timestamp_created": 1498704201, "timestamp_updated": 1498704201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32951369": {"recommendationid": "32951369", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258304209", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498452082}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite it being a fairly short game (it took me around 2 hrs to complete), I really did like this game. it is a fun little mystery game, and i love the graphics style. it is an interesting mystery game, if not full of unexpected twists like some mystery games. there were some puzzles, but they were pretty easy, so my suggestion for improvement of this game is to add more puzzles and make the puzzles more challenging. but still a fun game overall.", "timestamp_created": 1498675197, "timestamp_updated": 1498675197, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32913093": {"recommendationid": "32913093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050098454", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498614340}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cute, easy-to-play game for a few hours.

First off, this game is a low budget indie title so there is nothing realistic about the graphics. The graphics or better defined as art in this game. Each character encountered has a unique look. Locations are detailed and interesting with easy to identify interaction points. Solid lip-syncing and animation make the game shine. It really shows how much love was put into this game. \n\n[u]Story:[/u] Detective Grimoire's murder mystery/who done it story is quirky and interesting. The titular hero is skeptical of the supernatural suspect, but with help from the folks in the Amusement Park, all is revealed by the end. The story does fall into some classic tropes of the genre, but is funny and strange enough to see through to the end. Simple design and art really make this mystery better than most mystery games on the market!\n\n[u]Gameplay:[/u] Detective Grimoire is a point and click game. Meaning that all movement and interactions are done simply by clicking. Puzzles and a suspicion meter system have to be completed to move on in the story. Some of the puzzles are harder than others, with some being as easy as dragging objects. The puzzles and Grimoire's comments solidify the story and bring it all together.  \n\n[b]Value:[/b] For point and click gamers, short game lovers, and mystery fanatics, Detective Grimoire is a fun addition to any those categories in your library. While a little overpriced at $6.99, the price regularly drops down to $1.39 on sale, which is a pretty good value. \n\nAny questions, concerns, queries, thoughts etc, feel free to comment!", "timestamp_created": 1498483400, "timestamp_updated": 1499455442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32812625": {"recommendationid": "32812625", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045926205", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493044501}, "language": "english", "review": "Basic?

Very easy game to get into and play through in one hit. \n\nIt's clearly geared towards kids with the skill level of the puzzles being extremely low. At times they felt like they were just testing the functionality of a tablet (where a game like this is better suited). For example at one point you're looking for a clue in a garbage can and just need to move the pieces of the trash out of the way to get to the bottom. It's hard to count that as a puzzle but you get the idea of the skill level involved for puzzles. However finding all the clues, eliminating suspects and confronting the killer was chilled out fun. \n\nWorth the price on a heavy discount and if you keep your expectations to a minimum before jumping in. The strangest thing about the game worth noting is the story/murder plot. I mean, it's clearly aimed toward the younger market but the plot revolves around solving a murder. What's up with that?

IME, the games can feel tedious, boring, and repetitive. While Detective Grimoire is fun by its own merits, I especially enjoyed how it overcame these common weaknesses. The art/animation/music/color palette is lively, the voice acting is excellent, and the story has a streak of bizarre that breaks up the monotony. Yes, it is a somewhat cliched concept (murder mystery with a monster suspect). However, the game is self aware of its camp, and does a good job of humorizing it. The story/idea is well executed.\n\nThe game play is well designed; it uses a blend of interactive (and interrelated) clue/person/conversational methods, and it encourages the player the 'think through' what evidence means. While some of these methods could be a bit more challenging, I like the concept and would like to see more of it. Most characters/suspects do not say over-the-top giveaways, and it requires actual legwork to reveal what happened. E.g., you need to learn information before asking any specific questions, but you can still ask questions on your own. These are logical progressions too--no ridiculous specificity requirements. Overall, it felt like they did a good job of layering in the mechanics of game-play with a somewhat realistic story execution. \n\nThe main weak point that I contend, is that the game lacks enough 'irrelevant' clues and conversations. Although not *everything* interweaves together, and there are some decoy trails, it is also a bit too easy for every 'pocketable' object be a valid clue. It hampers the game quality. It would be more challenging/realistic (and fun) to find/receive more useless information and evidence. The game was also a bit too short (likely related to the streamlining of the mystery). And, while figuring out the mystery is a fun challenge overall, some of the individual tasks were painfully easy. The game is still enjoyable and I would recommend it; I hope that they address these sort of weaknesses in the potential sequel.\n\nPros:\n-Great art/story/style\n-Above average voice acting\n-Nice integration of different modes/methods of evidence \n-Interesting mystery (nice mix of mystery, humor, and camp)\n-Soundtrack fits well\n\nCons:\n-Not enough 'unrelated' clues/topics\n-Short (mystery is streamlined)\n-Lack of challenge for individual tasks\n-Somewhat impractical controls (switching between walking/looking)\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1493913012, "timestamp_updated": 1493913012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31403811": {"recommendationid": "31403811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353368932", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492408303}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel like this game failed as a mystery game.

However, I would still reccomend it, because despite the fact it's short and easy (and overpriced), it's stilll good. The sluthing you'll have to do to figure out the case isn't hard, it only took till I was half-way through the game to figure it out, and that was only because I didn't realize I forgot to talk to one of the suspects. Even if you couldn't piece it together based of the first few clues, the game makes sure you have more than enough evidence to convict the killer by the end of the game. Each character you meet also has a challenge topic for you to beat. Most of them aren't hard, once again I only got stuck when  I actually had forgotten clues that I didn't think were important. The actual puzzles they put in the mix up the game play aren't challenging either, but they were kind of entertaining, I just wish they were harder. Then personally I wished the characters had more connections to each other, everyone felt like they were on their own little narrative island, with no relation to the other characters except for the murderer, the victim, and occasionaly, their single \"friend\" character. \n\nBut all that aside, the game was still fun. The visuals are smoothe, the voice acting is good, the soundtrack is great, the characters have simple, but not boring personalities, the mechanics are fun, although the walking mechanics (don't forget you can fast travel) and navigating your notes can be a pain. So overall, I liked this game. If I had to describe it in one word, I think I would say the game is \"charming.\" I can't honestly say the game is worth seven dollars, I typically don't mind short games that cost a bit, but this game doesn't seem like its worth that much (five dollars would have been more reasonable). But I picked this up on a steam sale for a dollar, and I feel like I got my dollar's worth.

Die Synchronstimmen waren gut gew\u00e4hlt und die Musik nicht aufdringlich.\n\n[h1]Fazit zu der Geschichte:[/h1]\nIch muss sagen, anfangs war ich nicht allzu begeistert. Aber mit zunehmendem Fortschritt der Geschichte fand ich das Spiel spannender und fieberte mit, wer denn nun der M\u00f6rder sei. Letztendlich hat mich die Geschichte in Verbindung mit dem Aufbau des Spiels \u00fcberzeugt. \n\n[h1]Kaufempfehlung ja/nein:[/h1]\nVon mir gibt es eine Kaufempfehlung. Bei Detective Grimoire handelt es sich um ein Spiel, dass man gut zwischendurch spielen kann, da man nichts wirklich verpassen kann. Dadurch lassen sich Pausen leicht verschmerzen. Weiterhin ist es auch kein langwieriges Spiel, welches dennoch mit ein klein wenig Detektiv-Feeling an das Geschehen rangeht. \u00dcberm\u00e4\u00dfig witzig war die Geschichte zwar nicht (Da waren Deponia und Harvey doch ein wenig besser), aber auch nicht \u00f6de. Vielleicht sollte man es sich in einer Daedalic-Rabatt-Aktion kaufen, wenn man sich unsicher ist, denn 6,99\u20ac  ist noch immer viel Geld f\u00fcr 3-4 Stunden Computerspa\u00df.\n\n\n______\nDir hat mein Review gefallen?

It doesn't specify this on the main page which seems eerily tricksy of the developer as it is very obvious after the first 'puzzle' what kind of game this is. Therefore, I'll be reviewing this game as a game for adults.\n\n\n [h1] PROS [/h1]\n- The artstyle is goofy and quirky enough to at least not be an eyesore to look at. Its unique character design was refreshing  enough that it made some parts of the game bareable.\n\n- The voice acting is alright with a plentiful amount of cheeseiness, so if you like people hamming up their voices this game is for you.\n\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n-The music is not memoriable in the slightest, look up \"stock mysterious music\" and I'm sure that you could find something much better.\n\n- The puzzles are abismal. I did not even get SLIGHTLY stuck on a single puzzle and I'm not even that clever. So if random mazes and dot to dots are your thing then enjoy.\n\n- For a 'detective game' Detective Grimoire is not smart with ANY of its gameplay mechanics. Most of the deductive reasoning comes from basic slot puzzles that can be finished with simple trial and error giving absolutely no feeling of accomplishment when completed.\n\n- All characters in the game can be indivisually summarised with one word each. What you see is what you get for their personalities and if you like tropes then it is chocablock with them from pompous rich guy to hippie stoner dude. Don't expect to remember their names after playing.\n\n\n[h1] TL;DR [/h1]\nIf you're missing a couple of chromosomes or are an unborn fetus this game might be just the right challenge for you, but anyone else will see this game as a boring slog to the finish line wasting your time along the way.\n\nI got this for \u00a32 and it still wasn't worth my time.", "timestamp_created": 1485190755, "timestamp_updated": 1485191076, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29445686": {"recommendationid": "29445686", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979308059", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485189102}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0443\u0440\u044f\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0441 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438-\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0438. \u041d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e. \u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0441\u0446\u0435\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0443\u0441\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043a\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0424\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u043e\u043b\u0438\u043a \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 - \u0432\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u0430\u043d \u043d\u0435\u0442!", "timestamp_created": 1485189695, "timestamp_updated": 1485189695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.439701", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29440238": {"recommendationid": "29440238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073535425", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485167120}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny game, great for an easy play after work and finished fast :)", "timestamp_created": 1485167416, "timestamp_updated": 1485167416, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29427775": {"recommendationid": "29427775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111713732", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485108727}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0439, \u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0439, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u044f\u0441\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c. 10/10 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432", "timestamp_created": 1485108918, "timestamp_updated": 1485108918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29401955": {"recommendationid": "29401955", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042228090", "num_games_owned": 831, "num_reviews": 191, "playtime_forever": 162, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412884668}, "language": "english", "review": "Detective Grimoire has a charming aesthetic and intuitive controls.

The visuals are very charming, as well as the music and overall atmosphere. The story was very simple, but it was still enjoyable to run around and talk to all of the suspects and their distinct personalities. It's short and sweet, and worth the time if you need a change of pace and 2 hours to kill.\n\nHowever, the biggest gripe I have with this game is the very mystery/detective aspect of it. Despite this game being classed as a \"detective\" game--the amount of sleuthing you do is almost absent. You have a couple of puzzles to solve (around 5 I believe) which even a two year old child could figure out. If you're used to Proffessor Layton-esque puzzles or even Sherlock Holmes ones, these come off as incredibly flat and just plain disappointing. Of course, I wasn't expecting anything too complex puzzle wise but it felt incredibly lazy and just \"thrown in\". Even when questioning the suspects further and unlocking \"challenges\" to further the investigation; everything was incredibly clean cut and straightforward. No mystery, zilch, nada. Once you've pretty much questioned most of the suspects (first 45 minutes through the game or so), it's incredibly clear who is the murderer. You spend the rest of your time racking up evidence and showing this evidence to the suspects (most of which don't even have an opinion of it) to progress the story. The \"detective\" aspect of this game isn't fun at all, and I found myself being more intrigued in the characters than solving the murder mystery. \n\nThough my commentary is quite harsh regarding the \"detective\" aspect of it, I wasn't expecting any of the mystery to be truly spectacular or mind boggling. I went in with the understanding that this was going to be a casual detective game, and didn't expect much from it. However, even that low expectation wasn't reached and you'd be off better playing a free mobile detective game honestly. The game itself is very charming, but again, if you are going to create a *mystery detective* game--I would develop and refine those aspects of the game instead of releasing something which feels half-assed.", "timestamp_created": 1483931628, "timestamp_updated": 1483931628, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29013301": {"recommendationid": "29013301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076659464", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483555015}, "language": "russian", "review": "+1", "timestamp_created": 1483554557, "timestamp_updated": 1483554557, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28999215": {"recommendationid": "28999215", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009301811", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483361676}, "language": "english", "review": "Detective Grimoire takes a bit from the Ace Attorney series and adds in its own gameplay mechanism, which are sadly not well explained and could be left unused, to make a pretty good detective game with a muddling ending. \nVisually I really liked the fluidity of the animations, they may have been repetitive, but they felt natural to the characters. That said the game has all the earmarks of a flash game.  It definitely feels like it could have been released online instead of on Steam. \n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it is very similar to Ace Attorney\u2019s investigation gameplay (not the court room).  Go around talking to people, pick up evidence and find ways to open up new conversations with suspects.  The issue is there is even more to it than that, and it doesn\u2019t illustrate how to use it.  I was expecting a standard point and click, but there\u2019s actually a note system, a suspicion system, and map that details completion of each section.  You get a screen with about a dozen icons on it and no alternative hover text to tell you what they are.  This game really needed a tutorial case because I got to nearly the end of the game before even knowing some of those things existed.\n\nSpeaking of that, the game gives the impression that they may have wanted to do more cases, but only one case is included. There is a place to go and \u201clab testing\u201d but it becomes pointless by the end, you only test for 1 substance and the test itself is laughable.\n\nOkay but aside from all that. It\u2019s actually a really good game. It includes some lock puzzles, it requires some searching and maintain cognizance of what\u2019s going on in the game. The ending is a little lack luster but overall a detailed and fairly well developed story. Biggest issue with the ending is that it\u2019s kind of obvious who the bad guy is long before you get to the end.\n\nOveral, Detective Grimoire is a pretty decent game that could have used either pairing down of unnecessary extras that were included or a detail tutorial chapter and gameplay change to make them useful.", "timestamp_created": 1483514812, "timestamp_updated": 1483514812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28976981": {"recommendationid": "28976981", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079878697", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483452787}, "language": "english", "review": "A simple point-and-click adventure game. \nI like the simple layout that is friendly to casual gamers.

To be honest, I think it definitely is worth full price but I am happy that I got this game basically at a steal.\n\nTo start off, I love the game's art style. It's got an almost storybook charm to its setting and world that I can't help but fawn over. The cuteness translates over to certain mechanics like making the titular detective draw out what he thinks is happening in his notebook complete with snarky little word bubbles like \u201cI have a stupid nickname\u201d to add character. The voice actors are great and if you're familiar with internet voice actors you might recognize Detective Grimoire's voice actor from the old Trapped series of flash games and the voice actor for Agent Folder from literally anything Arin Hanson has done. The actual mystery is pretty interesting but if you're anything like me, you'll call who did the murder right away. Regardless, I still really liked how suspenseful the story was and even though the actual murder didn't get me the side story does. I'm being intentionally vague here so as to not spoil anybody.\n\nMy only real issue is a mechanical one. In the beginning of the game there's a feature where you can switch to \u201cwalk mode\u201d and go to different areas. I like the idea because I can examine everything I want without having to worry about clicking on a way out accidentally. However, a little under half way through the game, I had unlocked all the areas and was using the map feature to fast travel from place to place. I think the only times I even clicked on the walk mode button again were misclicks. While I understand why it was there in the beginning of the game, I think the walk mode mechanic was ultimately useless and I think unlocking areas could have been done slightly better. \n\nAside from a very VERY minor complaint I really enjoyed this game. The characters were fun and interesting, the voice acting was great, the story was engaging, and the art style is lovely. I heartily recommend this game full price or no!

Would I recommend this to someone who enjoys a deep meaningful multi-layered, mind melting journey? Probably not. However, if they have a kid under the age of 14, just to give a grounded figure; I'd say this is one of the child friendly adventure games a kid can play.\n\nI consider this a bit like the Professor Layton games, except very lite on the puzzle aspect. The game even makes a quip about the guy with the tall hat. Story wise you're looking at maybe 2 hours of murder mystery. Your main goal is to uncover as much information as possible by talking to people and finding clues. And while I didn't feel that much invested in the story it wasn't super easy to figure out who did it until nearing the very end. Finding the murderer took actual reading and thinking, which was good.

It was of that one mystery game I enjoyed playing a really long while back, back when Grimoire was less white and there wasn't any real voice acting. I really wasn't sure what to expect from this game, but I'm really glad I bought it. Heck, I probably would've bought it even outside of the sale. I have to remind myself to buy the soundtrack later on.\n\nThe graphics are really nice. Smooth animations and stuff. The voices are nice too. I mean, I love Grimoire's voice. So suave. And I thought the same person voiced several people and it was really funny finding out that I freaking called it. Wow. I forget the name of the guy, but he's amazing. I especially love what he did with Harper's voice.\n\nThe mystery itself isn't very hard to solve. You can piece out the clues easily by following the \"notebook\", trying to figure out the clues you're missing. Being the completionist that I am, I spent a bit of time actually getting everything at 100% even though it isn't necessary to end the game. I swear some of those notes are really trivial. But the game was nice in itself. There isn't any real need for a guide because the game sort of guides you in its own vague way. Like that little girl. Although she's a bit more... transparent in this one than in the last game. (I'm referring to the game about the Fairground, of course.)\n\nI think the game with the Fairground was tougher because you *can* try to go find the suspect without all the clues you need. It's also harder to find the clues you need because you can't just talk to everybody and present everything (as far as I can remember, at least). But it's still a challenge. And wow, would I love a sequel to this one.\n\nOnce again, Grimoire has taken me in with his wit and charm. He's still my favorite game detective, I suppose.

Anyone that enjoyed the original Detective Grimoire game on Newgrounds will likely have a good time with this one as well. It has a logical mystery, interesting characters, and great humor. Also, the animation is very well done and the voice actors are pretty good.\n\nThis game is a bit on the easy side, but seeing as how I'm a full-grown adult with plenty of prior experience in the mystery-game genre, that should be viewed as more of a personal bias of the difficulty. However, there is one legitimate issue I had with the mystery, and that was determining the murderer. I remember meeting one of the suspects for the first time, and after speaking with them, I knew right from the get-go that they did it. On top of that, almost all of the clues you get will only point to the same, single person. If you are well-versed at all in solving mysteries, I have a strong feeling you will undergo some of the same issues.\n\nBut besides that, I highly recommend this game for younger gamers or just people who like to solve a good mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1477783406, "timestamp_updated": 1477783406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26296275": {"recommendationid": "26296275", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996746298", "num_games_owned": 245, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477705627}, "language": "english", "review": "As long time fan of the Point&Click genre, I purchased this game with little to no expectations given it was dirt cheap (less than 2\u20ac).

It's a cartoon-animated, detective style point & click adventure with a focus on humorous yet dated jokes, puzzles that are way too easy to be worthy of the name and surprisingly good voice acting. There's not combining item+item or item+environment in order to MacGyver your way out of trouble. There's a bit of exploration and dialogue. If you click on all the right places, you'll get a puzzle that will move the story forward. Like I said... Simple.\nHowever, despite the aformentioned features, the creator does a good job in creating a narrative that makes you want to see the game through.

Es geht darum, in die Rolle von Detective Grimoire zu schl\u00fcpfen und in einem Sumpf einen Mordfall aufzukl\u00e4ren. Sowohl die Getaltung der Charaktere als auch der Schaupl\u00e4tze ist relativ einfach gehalten, wirkt aber im Kontext des Spiels stimmig. Auff\u00e4llig war f\u00fcr mich vor allem der innovative Mix aus verschiedenen Spielgenres. Da man keine R\u00e4tsel im klassischen Sinn l\u00f6sen muss, hat es viel von einer interaktiven Geschichte, beinhaltet aber durch die Befragung der Zeugen, Sammlung von Beweisgegenst\u00e4nden und nicht zuletzt des schr\u00e4gen Humors definitiv einige Elemente eines klassischen Adventures. Die Fortbewegung des Protagonisten durch das Gebiet und die (ziemlich leichten) Minigames und Puzzles widerum erinnern stark an ein Hidden Objects Game. Zuletzt geht es noch darum, alle Indizien und Beweise zusammenzutragen und selbst im Notizbuch zu verkn\u00fcpfen und als verd\u00e4chtig odernicht zu sortieren, was uns der Aufkl\u00e4rung des Falls in etwa 3-5 Stunden Spielzeit n\u00e4her bringt (ich habe wirklich jeden Dialog ausgereizt und jeden auf alles angesprochen und etwa 5 Stunden gebraucht). Die R\u00e4tsel sind f\u00fcr einen erfahrenen Spieler wirklich nicht der Rede wert, so dass auch Genreanf\u00e4nger wohl sicher keine H\u00e4nger haben d\u00fcrften. Die Synchronisation sei hier noch lobend erw\u00e4hnt - die Sprecher leisten sehr gute Arbeit (leider gibt es anscheinend keine deutsche Vertonung) und die Dialoge sind lustig und bissig am\u00fcsant.

Artstyle, voiceacting, and background music were all well done\n\n-Style of the adventure reminded me of the old freddi fish and pajama sam games which I loved as a kid\n\n-The narrative was well done and very creative. I loved unraveling the mystery of the murder and the swamp\n\n-I thought mechanically and interface wise, the detective work and clue gathering was well done. Oftentimes it's clunky in these sorts of games but was not the case here.\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n-Puzzles were far too easy. They were definitely catered to a younger age group(but the content of solving a murder seems gauged to an older group) Would have been great to have difficulty settings for the puzzles to balance this.\n\n-Game felt very short. i got in the steam sale so much cheaper than the actual price, but I finished the whole game in 2.5 hours. I was expecting more depth. Worth it to me for what I paid, but may not be the most bang for buck at full price.\n\n-Repeat dialogue when mistakes on challenges, and no way to skip or fast forward through repeat conversations\n\n-Weird narrative hole with who the little girl following you around is. It really bugged me because they imply you know her but give you no context.\n\n[b] Overall I would reccomend this game. Look elsewhere for challenging puzzles but if you love a good murder mystery this is worth sinking a couple hours into. It also appears to be SFBgames first real foray into this genre, so i imagine they will be able to really expand on this formula in the future(with ideally a longer sequel to this game) [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1467007136, "timestamp_updated": 1467007136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23837393": {"recommendationid": "23837393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088535177", "num_games_owned": 178, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466966202}, "language": "english", "review": "What fun!!!

(Oh, I already miss the fun and adventure.)\n\nThe smart gameplay with tons of humor, leading-edge puzzles, gut-busting kind of narration with nifty voicing quality makes this game super-awesome (two thumbs up here!!!). All the characters are so adorable and the soundtracks are perfect especially for those lovers of mystification (whooaah!).\n\nWhat I love the most about this game is that you\u2019re playing as a detective (Detective Grimoire) who\u2019s very keen in solving a murder case by a weird green creature (Boggy). The characters are like those in cartoon network due to its flamboyant style, environment, art, and graphics. Excellent interface! The puzzles are not that staggering and can be unlocked through common sense and comprehension as the game is progressing. \n\nI would say that you should try this flashy game! As you meet various characters through playing the conundrum, clues and evidences will also be unveiled which will bring you up together the pieces and linking it with all that you\u2019ve discovered to formulate judgment or conclusion. Sounds interesting, right? (Hehe!)\n\nThe only thing that I felt disappointed about is that the game was too short. I was expecting of a more story rich game especially with its great quality (waaaahh).\n\nOverall, beautifully presented! I would surely RECOMMEND this game. It\u2019s worth the play! Still waiting and hoping for its sequel and I might as well find and marry this indie developer (guy?! haha!).

The game has nice graphics and is well-made on the whole, but I just found it way too simple, the story so-so, and the interface and gameplay aimed too much at children. [u][b]I would only recommend this to kids/teens aged 7-15.[/b][/u]\n\n[h1]Here's what I liked:[/h1]\n+ Mystery to be solved\n+ Pretty, vibrant visuals\n+ Fully voiced\n+ Voice autoplays during conversations, so you can just sit back and let things flow\n+ Good music\n+ High production values\n+ Quite a few trading cards\n\n[h1]Here's what I didn't:[/h1]\n- Puzzles are way too simple\n- Some puzzles are poorly conceived and have nothing to do with the context\n- Mainly just talking to other characters\n- No object use (i.e. you never have an inventory and never need to use any item)\n- Not a \"real\" adventure game per se (due to the points mentioned above)\n- Almost all the clues are pieced together by combining words to form a sentence\n- Very kiddish interface\n- Story is dull, uninspired, unoriginal and bland\n- Conclusion is really boring and anti-climactic\n- No satisfaction in solving the mystery\n- Game holds your hand throughout and treats you like you're 5 years old\n\n[h1]Some examples of the \"puzzles\" you will encounter:[/h1]\n\n1) Moving objects aside to find what was beneath them. And you are [i]specifically instructed[/i] to do so. DUH.\n2) Selecting the correct phrases to form a sentence. E.g. \"___ was told to ___ yesterday.\" And the choices you are given are dead obvious.\n3) Putting the correct pairs together.\n4) Entering the correct code to open a lock, and the code has [i]nothing[/i] to do with the lock.\n5) Choosing the correct image to form a clue. E.g. On a diagram of a person hiding in a tent, you must choose a picture (out of 4 choices) that depicts what made him stay in the tent. All the choices other than the correct answer are completely nonsensical.\n6) Putting gears in the correct place to open something.\n7) Choosing the correct string in a tangle.\n8) Matching the correct shape to the keyhole.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's not a bad game, but it's definitely not for the discerning old-school adventure gamer looking for at least some creative & challenging adventure game puzzles to solve. Add to that a really [i]blah[/i] story with no drama or excitement whatsoever, and I say give this a miss.", "timestamp_created": 1464711705, "timestamp_updated": 1464712184, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.687026", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23305347": {"recommendationid": "23305347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273617662", "num_games_owned": 836, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464649744}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442, \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438-\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043a\u0438, \u0436\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438. \u041d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435. 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1464684955, "timestamp_updated": 1466539610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23302179": {"recommendationid": "23302179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119097520", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464626144}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, not too short but not overly long either. \n\nPros\nDecent length\nGood soundtrack\nVoice acting is well done\nWriting is well done\n\nCons\nStill kind of short\n\nEither Pro or Con\nRelatively easy puzzles\n\nIn short, if this game is on sale, it is probably worth it. if it isnt, it might still be worth it depending on how fast you finish it", "timestamp_created": 1464664971, "timestamp_updated": 1464664971, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23292407": {"recommendationid": "23292407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185617795", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464617938}, "language": "english", "review": "Maybe I'm too dumb to understand how It supposed to be played .", "timestamp_created": 1464621991, "timestamp_updated": 1464621991, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23291990": {"recommendationid": "23291990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155487731", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464631424}, "language": "german", "review": "nice game! didnt even noticed that i played 3 hours straight", "timestamp_created": 1464620489, "timestamp_updated": 1464620489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23287134": {"recommendationid": "23287134", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203407209", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 110, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464042206}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game aimed(I would guess) at a younger audience.

Most lie under the hidden object category and try to convince people they're actually about mystery. Others, however, remind people of the fantastic and absurd Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney games, and Detective Grimoire is no different. In fact it's resemblence at a glance is what made me even consider buying this game. However there are a few features that seperate this game and make it a wonderful experience. Very much worth it's price tag.\n\n[b][u]- Point-and-Click Adventure[/u][/b]\nIf it's not going to be a hidden object game, it has to point-and-click. Not that it's bad. I'm a fan of point-and-click. And Grimoire doesn't try too much different. Standard, as far as most of its mechanics go. If you've played Sam and Max, Grim Fandango, or any game in that area, you really won't be caught off guard.\n\nIt does at least try new mechanics to invigorate the formula. For starters, every suspect has a profile attached to them with clues relavent to them and you can mark weither or not the information is suspicious. While I never noticed this mechanic to be relavent, it does help with organization quite a bit. Not to mention it makes you feel more like a detective than some random guy with way too much room in his pockets. There are other (and I hesitate to use this) mini-games that really add to the detective experience.\n\nThere is one major thing I couldn't get around, though. For movement, it is required that you click the 'move' button every time you want to move to the next area. At first it seems alright, but as I got deeper into the game, it just became an annoyance.\n\n[b][u]- Delightful Personality[/u][/b]\nThe characters absolutely make this game. Each of them were distinct from eachother and felt very real to me. They all act like they're going about daily life and would greatly prefer to not be interogated by some dork in a trenchcoat. (Also, Arin Hanson voices one of the characters in this. Didn't expect that!) The story itself is filled with intregue the whole way through (as is to be expected. Not much of a mystery game without a mystery). Each character has a shread of both innocence and guilt to them, and sorting out who's clean and who's the culprit is tough and rewarding.\n\n. . . is what I would say if the culprit wasn't painfully obvious. Throughout the entire game you go back and forth between people, getting more information and grilling anyone with holes in their stories. Then near the end of the game, once you talk to everyone, a new character appears. I literally even said to myself \"this guy did it, didn't he.\" It feels like the developers knew the other characters were too morally gray for the player to decide who it was, and added this last character to make sure no one made a wrong choice.\n\nDoes this ruin the game? Absolutely not. The story is wonderfully interesting and rewarding. The visuals are delightfully cartoony. The characters are an absolute joy.

My only complaint is that it was only about 3 hours, and I really took my time with it. The best part of the game, hands down, was the voice acting; real top notch quality!\n\nAs Detective Grimoire; you will explore more than 20 locations, find clues and question a plethora of well voiced suspects. The puzzles are pretty easy but extremal enjoyable! In some cases you even have to test clues to determine the chemical makeup of the residue left behind. This and other unique features make this game stand out within the point and click genre.\n\nOverall, I would pay $5-7 for this solid 3 hour game; It's got lots of polish and was executed in a seamless way.\n\n[code][h1] Accidently Reviewed[/h1]\nWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

The game has a few minor gameplay issues, but nothing that took away the entertainment and feeling of immersion in play. It offers a rather detailed interface that can be intimidating at first, but each tool is important to your ability to solve the crime. I go into detail about the interface features more in my video review. \n\n\nThis is a traditional point and click detective adventure that I am pleased to report focuses more on the investigative and detective aspects of the game rather than flooding you with puzzles that can take away from your immersion into your case. The items you acquire are clues that tie together to help you figure out who the murderer is. You aren't running around the map on a wild scavenger quest.  This game is one of the few that actually does the 'detective' aspect right. It isn't too complicated, and fairly straightforward, but it synergizes with itself well.\n\nIt does have some comedic elements, but nothing that will have you rolling in the aisles. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does so just enough to relay the gravity of solving a murder.  At the end of the day, this was a very enjoyable game. It has a solid story and solid gameplay, with a well put together detective interface and mechanics. There are a few minor performance issues, but nothing that would ruin your experience. The music is fitting, the voice acting is well done, and it is a well put together detective story.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho", "timestamp_created": 1453095747, "timestamp_updated": 1453095747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500866", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20577391": {"recommendationid": "20577391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273522467", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 94, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453151097}, "language": "english", "review": "The graphics are pretty cool!

I have to say i've just found it. Detective Grimoire is one of the games i will definitely recommend to anyone who wants nice detective game :)\n\nFirst of all, menu is simple and functional, nothing special, you can just adjust sound there and maybe switch to windowed mode i think. Main character, detective Grimoire is funny guy, with great dialogues. At the beginning, some officer will introduce you into the case. After that, whole \"island\" in marshes is yours. You can go anywhere, click on anything, talk to anybody, collect items, just everything to solve the murder. There are also some simple puzzles to solve and also challenges for every person you meet. I think that the game itself is not that hard, you can finish it in 3 hours with all achievements, you can also receive trading cards. Soundtrack is also nice, and there is an option to purchase it, if you want. Different voice actors, who did their job really well, dialogues are awesome thanks to them. The only negative thing is maybe controls. It's a Point&Click game, so you can do everything with only mouse, but. If you want to go from one scene to another, you have to \"switch\" the controls between \"exploration mode\" and \"movement mode\". In one mode you can click on everything and Grimoire will interact with it, in other mode you can just move from scene to scene. Not really negative thing, it just needs time to get used to it. I can't remember any other point&click adventure with same controls.\n\nSo, is it worth 7\u20ac? I would say yes, even when playtime is really around 3 hours.

As Detective Grimoire, you must gather evidence to discover how and why the murder was committed, and then interrogate people to learn facts about them, which will help you to work out which one is the murderer.\n\nThe game is simple to pick up, and fun to play. In particular I enjoyed the \"challenge\" mechanic, which allows you to quiz each suspect on a key topic and use evidence to get the truth out of them. This mechanic was reminiscent of the Phoenix Wright games for Nintendo DS. The puzzles were very simple, but in a way it was nice to play the game and enjoy the story without getting stuck on complicated puzzles.\n\nThe story was fun, and the characters were entertaining and well-acted. My only criticism is that it is a very short game (about 2 hours long), which would be fine as the first episode in a multi-part series, but as a standalone game it does leave you feeling unsatisfied. The game could easily be extended to include more than one case, and hopefully the developers will do so in the future.\n\nThe graphics in my opinion were fine, a very simple 2D cartoony style, but I imagine that some people would find the style very ugly and it would put them off the game. I would encourage them to look past the graphics and try to enjoy the game for the story and gameplay. One thing I did notice about the graphics is everything was very large, as if it was a mobile phone game stretched to fill a full-sized screen.  But this didn't interfere with enjoyment of the game in any way.\n\nOverall, I would heartily recommend this game if it is on sale.

I should remember never to buy them again.\" I buy a lot of french fries.\n\nI also enjoy the anticipation of adventure games. The videos tease an interesting plot, cool artwork, funny dialogue, or a tantalizing mystery and I can't resist. However, after playing one for a few minutes, I remember why I hate them. Most of the gameplay consists of searching for something to click on, watching unskippable cutscenes, or waiting for characters to walk... and I remind myself never to buy one again. I buy a lot of adventure games.\n\n...and this is the first one I've enjoyed playing. The high points for me are what's not there:\n- You will never need to watch a character walk.\n- All the cutscenes are skippable and most are repeatable if you miss something.\n- Movement is instant. Click on the map location you want and your character is instantly there.\n\nAll the puzzles are trivially easy, and the gameplay itself mainly consists of dialog trees.

But it's just too simplistic, too linear (their jokingly \"non-linear\" circular map notwithstanding), and too forgiving. The environment often provides too few cues as to where you need to click in order to find the requisite clues, and likewise the topics that will or won't prove helpful when talking to a given suspect are not necessarily intuitive. Basically, just click on every square inch of each scene until, go through every possible conversation topic with every possible person, and you'll complete the game in two hours with zero consequences.

Unfortunately it is also very streamlined and easy, at least for anyone who has played the first game in the series and expects a bit of a sleuthing challenge. \n\n[h1]Some history...[/h1]\nDetective Grimoire's first appearance was several years back in a free browser game that you should go and play [url=http://armorgames.com/play/200/detective-grimoire]right now[/url] if you haven't already. As a browser game it was unique, interesting, well made (for a free game) and its best selling point was that you were actually required to do some detective work: The game expected you to collect clues, solve puzzles, interrogate people with a fun little lie detecting mechanic, and actually stop, think and make some deductions on your own before you could accuse someone of the crime. It was perfectly possible to make mistakes if you didn't think things through and that was exactly what made the game really interesting.\n\n[h1]...and some crushed expectations.[/h1]\nThis is sadly not the case with its crowdfunded follow-up. You are asked to sit back and enjoy an easy ride, in which yes, you are interacting with the world and the story in interesting ways, but, no, you are not asked to do any real thinking of your own. And then when you have collected all the strands and are hyped about thinking through the mystery, the game will step in and hold your hand while it reveals its secrets. To me (with my previous high expectations) it felt dumbed down, and that was a disappointment.\n\n[h1]The Good: Writing, Art, Animation, Soundtrack[/h1]\nThat said, this is a really really good, if short, point & click. It is less the answer to the mystery at its core that makes it interesting and more the charming, intriguing characters whose motivations and backstories you're watching untangle. I have a special soft spot for well written dialogue and Detective Grimoire delivers that in spades, accompanied by fantastic voice acting that makes the characters come alive. Bonus points for a dialogue system that expects you to pay attention when interviewing suspects, allowing you to become even more immersed in the game world. In fact not only the characters but the whole \"Boggy's Bog\" you are walking around in feels alive, thanks to some adorable art and an atmospheric soundtrack. I thoroughly enjoyed the lovingly hand-painted backdrops and all the neat animation details.\n\n[h1]The Mediocre: Gameplay, Puzzles[/h1]\nMy own expectations aside, the gameplay is not bad per se. The fact that it is so streamlined may make the game feel too easy (for me), but one could claim that it also helps in allowing you to become engrossed in the game's story. Still, the puzzles are simplistic and many gameplay elements feel like a missed opportunity. For example, having a suspect screen where you can look through various facts that you have uncovered and tag them as suspicious or not suspicious but then never being allowed to use this mechanic in any meaningful way felt like a real let down. On the other hand, combining your clues into logical claims in order to open up new interrogation opportunities is a much better utilised mechanic, and thus becomes one of the most entertaining gameplay elements. All in all, there are many original ideas here, most of which were sadly not allowed to shine. So come to it expecting to interact with an interesting little mystery, but not to be a real agent of change in this world.\n\n[h1]The endorsement[/h1]\nSo there you have it. I was disappointed by this game, and yet I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is no denying its charm. It is a polished and very entertaining experience but it is also less than 3 hours long with no replayability, so gauge your preferred price tag accordingly.

Well, here's something: It's okay.\n\nI first stumbled upon the game on Kongregate, some time before the sequel (this game) was announced. I remember thinking \"this was really fun!\". It wasn't something huge or ground-breaking, but it was a pretty cool little gem. And, to be fair, it's not trying to be grand, and I can respect that. It's not the issue I have with this game. This game is much of the same. The story is fine, the gameplay is pretty standard, but the art is definitely eyecandy.\n\nSo here's the story: You are detective Grimoire, and you've been called out to a swamp, to investigate a murder in a tourist attraction. The supposed killer is the mascot on which the attraction was built: a swamp monster. You meet a cast of colorful characters, note in your pad who is suspicious and who isn't, go over the evidence and play a silly flash game from the early 2000's until the murderer is finally caught.\n\nSo what are the good things? Well, characters and voice-acting. Both are really good, and I can't really point out many places that broke immersion (there is ONE, but we'll get to that). Their dialogue is fun and interesting, and breaking their safeguards on certain points is pretty satisfying because they keep denying or outright fighting you on the subject. The art, of course, is beautiful and colorful (much more interesting to the eye might I add, which begs the question: why are none of the triple-A companies taking advantage of more colors in their games?).\n\nUnfortunately, there were quite a few things I disliked about this game. The little girl character is more or less there because she was in the first game (like, really, she gives you a map and pleads for you not to arrest the swamp monster). The aforementioned flash game from the early 2000's really stands out from the rest of the game style-wise (and in early 2000's flash game fashion, the sounds are really loud). The setting is almost the same as the first game. The ending is pretty weak (first gave us a psychotic freak-out, this one has mythical monsters), and the section leading up to it is so straight forward, it almost crumbles the rest of the cookie. See, whether or not you note one of your suspects as the only suspect, you will be pointed to the actual murderer so long as you take the right dialogue choices in the first part of fetching the murderer. So if you thought that wormy guy was the murderer, whoops! Looks like it was this other guy all along! The only difficult part of the game is finding all the clues and details, which really chips down in hindsight. \n\nThen, who finally catches the murderer? What ending is this totally okay game bestowing upon us? The swamp monster. Honestly, I wasn't even angry. I was disappointed. This is a game that seems like it could be centered around our world, one that never hinted to a supernatural element (apart from the witch who turned out to be a herbalist, which I guess is witchcraft to the uninitiated), and yet here they spring an actual monster on us. I was really disappointed, because this could have been my scooby doo (there's no such thing as monsters and the whole kahoozie), and I really really REALLY wanted to like this game.\n\nIn a way, though, I want you to give it a try. It's an unrefined gem, dusty and unclear, in need to find its own place in a chunk of ore. There is potential, definitely, but I don't know if the series will continue from here on (though there are characters to grab and hold on to, and the visual style is a five-star lobster dinner to the eye), but as is, it's pretty harmless.", "timestamp_created": 1445358152, "timestamp_updated": 1445358152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18547640": {"recommendationid": "18547640", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171275434", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445170378}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich hasse es, wenn sonstSch\u00f6nes Spiel :) Tolle R\u00e4tsel, nicht zu schwer, nicht zu leicht (ich hasse es, wenn bereits in den ersten 2 Szenen R\u00e4tsel versteckt sind, die man nur durch wildes rumklicken findet) und eine wirklich gut gemachte Story :) Ich freue mich schon den n\u00e4chsten Teil zu spielen", "timestamp_created": 1445170735, "timestamp_updated": 1445170735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18515799": {"recommendationid": "18515799", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043768739", "num_games_owned": 737, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1441914881}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a fun little game and great for fans of the Ace Attorney and other mystery games.

Nothing other than how the game is controlled has been altered in the Steam port, so any side-puzzles you get involve very simple drag-and-drop solutions. However in my opinion, the game itself is so strong that this lack of puzzle difficulty is [b]more[/b] than made up for.\n\nThe standout aspect of Detective Grimoire for me is the story, which is fantastically good fun to the end. Grimoire himself is a briliant character; his humour is part cheese and part charm, with a dash of classic British dryness and a stellar voice actor to boot. But it's not just him - all the other characters have great personalities and voice actors too, and if you do end up buying the game then I strongly suggest not skipping a single bit of dialogue! Every conversation and monologue is hilariously entertaining, and a couple had me in tears from laughing so hard. Other positves I need to mention are the game's stunning, hand-drawn art style and its accompanying soundtrack, both of which are gorgeous and you can tell had great care put into them.\n\nAs for the negatives, from a personal point of view I can't list many. Detective Grimoire doesn't come with the usual roster of bugs, trial-and-error item combinations, pixel hunting and bad voice acting that I'm used to from the adventure genre - the technical aspects of the game are flawless. However if you prefer skill and difficulty in an adventure game over a good story, then Detective Grimoire will probably let you down. Little hint icons make clue-hunting fairly straightforward (although these can be turned off to make the game harder), and if you don't do well questioning a suspect you can try again as many times as you like. However, I personally had no problem with any of this as I picked up the game well aware that it was originally intended for mobile.\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b]  Detective Grimoire is a gorgeous little gem of a game which I simply cannot recommend enough, and its polished finesse and fluid storytelliing make this a must-play for any fan of the adventure game genre. The adorable art style and lack of difficulty also make it a perfect introduction to the world of point-and-click gaming for younger players.

Den Humor hat das Spiel jedoch von typischen P&Cs.\nDas Spiel ist in einem sehr kindlich/niedlichen/ Comicstil gehalten, die Dialoge sind recht flapsig und die Story sowie die Charaktere ein wenig schr\u00e4g.\n\nMit einer Dauer von etwa 2,5h ist das Spiel recht kurz und die R\u00e4tsel sind nicht sonderlich schwer. Neben den vielen Dialogen gibt es auch einige kleine Minispiele die f\u00fcr etwas Abwechslung sorgen.\nLeider kommt das Spiel ohne deutsche Sprachausgabe oder Untertitel daher, die Sprache ist allerdings sehr(!) einfach, Aussprache und Untertitel helfen hier alles zu verstehen und man kann jeden Dialog immer wieder durchgehen (was nicht n\u00f6tig ist).\n\nGenerell kann ich das Spiel f\u00fcr einen kleinen Zeitvertreib Point&Click-Freunden empfehlen, die Charaktere und die Story sind wirlich witzig und die Sprachausgabe (in Englisch) ist super.

In my opinion, such a story does not fall short of a Sherlock Holmes story.\n\nSweet refers to the game design in terms of mechanics, graphics and music. Looking for clues, interrogating suspects and deduction are necessary in solving a case mystery, and absolutely well put in this game. The most interesting mechanic for me is the part where you have to drag in suitable subjects from a list of subjects and cycle through a list of predicates to complete your thoughts and proceed from there.

The soundtrack is terrific and the character designs are excellent. Gameplay involves individual scenes that you click on in a somewhat \"hidden object\" sort of way in order to collect evidence and reveal clues. Occasionally you will need to complete a very short and VERY easy mini-game to accomplish certain tasks (e.g. unlocking doors, uncovering something buried, etc). The mystery is well-written and the interfaces provided for helping you keep track of your evidence and suspicions are superb.\n\nThere are a few minor demerits:\n\n--Voice acting, while very well performed, does not always match the sound of the voice with the character very well. For example, situations like the voice of an obviously young man who is clearly  affecting the voice of a gruff older man---and similar odd affectations on other characters, despite the excellent performances. In other words, the voice PERFORMANCES are stellar, but the voice CASTING is sorta questionable on several characters.\n\n--Seems to be an iOS port. This is a bit of a pet peeve of mine, but it does always annoy me to play a game on the PC and get repeatedly told to \"tap\" on things.\n\n--While the mystery is well-written, the characters well-designed, the dialogue superb.... the mystery is very easy to figure out. The are zero false evidence trails. There is pretty much just one evidence trail---the right one---and it makes pinpointing the culprit a piece of cake. You won't be second guessing yourself a whole lot. More astute players will figure out very quickly who the criminal is, and so the rest of the game is just checking off boxes so that you can get to the accusation phase.\n\n--Ending sort of predictable and anti-climactic.\n\nOn average, despite being very short and a few minor demerits, it is a fun little game and will keep you well-entertained for an evening.

Man selbst spielt als Detective Grimoire und versucht dieses Geheimnis zu l\u00fcften. Dabei muss man auf jede kleinste Detail in diesem Point&Click-Adventure game achten. Die Figuren sind Comicm\u00e4\u00dfig konfiguiert und es macht Spa\u00df. \n\nWie bei jedem anderen Poin&Click sind keine gro\u00dfe Action zu erwarten, sondern immer eine gute und gelungene Story. Diese hier ist gelungen. Nach einem kurzen Einstieg in das Verbrechen m\u00f6chte man um jeden Preis versuchen den M\u00f6rder herauszufinden. Durch logisches Nachdenken und auch einbisschen rum Clickerei macht dieses Spiel unglaublich viele Laune. \n\nWas den Achievments betrifft kann auch nur ein dickes Plus gesetzt werden. Sie sind alle verst\u00e4ndlich und auch gut zu erreichen, man muss nur das Spiel zu Ende spielen und dabei auf jede kleinste Detail achten.\n\nLetzendlich ist zu sagen, dass dieses Spiel auf jeden Fall ca. 5-6h spielspa\u00df hergibt, indem man zwischendurch nicht aufh\u00f6ren m\u00f6chte. Ein zweiter ist im Abspann zu sehen bereits angek\u00fcndigt. \n\nF\u00fcr den Originalpreis von 7\u20ac ist es meiner Meinung nach trotzdem einbisschen viel.

The simple cartoon style really adds to the atmosphere\n\nBGM : to be honest I was so into the gameplay that I have no recollection how the BGM was like...\n\nVoice actors : LOVE THEM.\n\nPlot : Nicely done, it has the 'Scooby Doo'-esque approach on whodunnit but less cheesy\n\nPuzzle level : super easy. I turned off the flicking hints options, thought to challenge myself, and it turns out that hints aren't needed in the first place. Though instead of puzzles, I think of the ones on Grimoire into more of object-interaction. No challenge, but they serve as great interludes between scenes \n\nPrice : Very reasonable. You will not feel cheated\n\nPersonal opinion : I love point-and-click games. The only thing I found annoying was the repeated instructions for the same \"puzzle\" (yes, there is a certain \"puzzle\" you will have to do several times), like, 'dude I got it the first time'.. it's kind of a waste of time. Luckily we can just click click click to end it a bit faster.\nAlso, how we have to go back to the dialogue menu each time after we present a clue, and not just straight back to the clue inventory itself.\nOther than those, it's great.\nThe storyline is great, the ending was a bit sad-sweet-ish (got no idea how to describe this feeling), the murderer got what the murderer (pronouns are spoilers :p) deserved (at least), and a somewhat promise to a sequel or a series even.\n\nRecommend : A definite yes.

I love the voice acting with people such as Edward Tiong, Arin Hanson, joshua tomar and all the characters they've played were awesome. The plot was also believable and a lot of evidence made sense along with the suspects. 10/10\n\nGraphics: The graphic cartoony design instilled into this was pretty good, and the characters all feel well instilled into this world. Plus I LOVE THE ANIMATION CUTSCENES, this was perfect 10/10\n\nGameplay: The controls and inventory system are very simplistic, heck you just need your trusty mouse to play the whole game! You have two ways of going at it in this game, looking at things and walking around, also you have fun little mini-games and can of course talk to suspects and show them evidence and interrogate them. I would warn people though that this game is very easy to beat so don't expect it to be long. 9.5/10\n\nOverall: This was one of the best adventure games I've ever played, it's got great voice acting, good cartoony graphic's and a good length (seriously I thought I could beat this in an hour but it took me 4) so if you can please buy this game, it's totally worth it. 10/10\n\nRecommended price to

Still, it\u2019s priced similarly as a movie ticket, and it sure is a lot more entertaining than most movies you may watch.", "timestamp_created": 1427783973, "timestamp_updated": 1427783973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547325", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15120228": {"recommendationid": "15120228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006849221", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 195, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427689279}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun and interesting story for point and click gamers!", "timestamp_created": 1427689369, "timestamp_updated": 1427689369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15106953": {"recommendationid": "15106953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075180419", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426166111}, "language": "english", "review": "Short and sweet.

I played this game with my boyfriend last night and we both often found ourselves smiling at the game: It has a lovely style of art, and very, very charming characters. The voice acting is great, the dialogues are great, and the protagonist is a charming, slightly sarcastic, definitly cool character.\n\nThe gameplay had some refreshing mechanics to it in my opinion, letting you form thoughts that you probably already figured in your head. That really allowed you to stay on top of things and for once incooperate what you thought into the game - something most detective games don't do. You sit there thinking you figured it all out, but you can never tell anyone, well, this game tries to change that up a little.\n\nThe puzzles were all quite easy, and the story itself is not hard to understand for any adult. So if you are looking for a challenging game, this will probably not be for you. It is also relatively short, with a playtime of maybe two hours, and whilst it is entertaining for that duration it will probably not have any replay value for some time.\n\nI would gladly hand this game to a child, because the puzzles and the story will be absolutely appropriate for them. The art style and characters would simply charm them, and I remember playing games like this in my past and loving them with all my heart, because to me they were still mysterious and unpredictable when I was still a child.\n\nFor adults? Not challenging, nothing too iconic - if you are someone who enjoys games aiming at a younger audience, this game is great.

The characters are interesting and charismatic, not your run-of-the-mill lifeless cookie-cutter supporting characters. The conversation options might not be all that hilarious but they should at least make you smile. The mystery itself is not obvious at all from the beginning, there's some complexity to it, the writing is pretty decent. All good up to this point.\n\nThe main reason I advise you not to purchase this game is simple: the difficulty is next to none, it is almost an insult to our collective intelligence. 'Almost' because at least at the ending you have to consider a few pieces of evidence at the same time to find the culprit, aside from that the game poses no challenge whatsoever. The puzzles are so easy they seem aimed to very young children - except they couldn't possibly be able to consider so many pieces of info as you are supposed to at the end - plus there are some violent themes and graphic grizzly sounds (nothing visual though) so it is definitely not a game that should be aimed at little kids either. I am unsure what the target audience of this game is, to be honest, and that's my biggest bone to pick with it. There are hardly any puzzles anyway, and you'll spend most of the time talking to the same characters over and over and presenting the same clues and profiles - hint: they won't have anything to say about them 80% of the time - so on top of the non-existant difficulty, it can get extremely repetitive despite its short duration.\n\nI really, really wanted to love this game because I've been an SFB fan for way longer than I care to admit, and when I could finally pick up Detective Grimoire I expected something much more well-rounded. I am disappointed as you have gathered already from my review. There's too much hype about this game, and I'm sure there are many more SFB fans like me around here, back from early Newgrounds days, who mean well and are trying to support who they know are very talented guys. But getting the hype about this game up is doing no good to anyone, this game is seriously flawed and I hope they will do some serious work in these weak points if they plan to release a sequel. You can do WAY BETTER and we KNOW IT.\n\nIn conscience, I cannot recommend this game to anyone who isn't very young (but not a kid!), very inexperienced with adventure games and looking for a beginner's experience that poses near no challenge, or someone who is looking for a VERY casual game experience.", "timestamp_created": 1424463674, "timestamp_updated": 1424464203, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651758", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14560314": {"recommendationid": "14560314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031283774", "num_games_owned": 773, "num_reviews": 193, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424442881}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "Simple, easy and funny.\n\nThe only problem is gameplay time too short.", "timestamp_created": 1424444422, "timestamp_updated": 1424444422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14548524": {"recommendationid": "14548524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043970644", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1424374854}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is wonderful. From its animated characters, background art and its music; this game is worth playing.\n\nI've tried the first Detective Grimoire game on Newgrounds before, and it was the very reason why I got this game. The first game was modeled after Phoenix Wright (in-game, Grimoire hinted something to this) and this one could be hinted to Professor Layton. Still, you can find the influence of the Wright games in the interrogation sequences(questioning, presenting evidence/profiles, cross-examination) but its the inclusion of the puzzles(though I must admit, the puzzles are very easy to solve, I just love more challenge to my puzzles and this game has none of it. But its not a bad thing mind you, its pacing is designed for easy puzzles to get the story moving.) that make it a mystery/detective game. \n\nThe narrative is very impressive; This seriously gave me some Call of Cthulu vibes. Although, it is kind of lacking in the character development. Can't say anymore since I don't want to spoil a cool story (you'll just have to buy the game and play it for yourself)\n\nThis game stands on its own and in no way a clone of anything else aside from its influences. I am slightly disappointed since I expected the puzzles to be more challenging, most of the time you could just show every single piece of evidence, really its just a diligent point-and-click.

Most of the time it's at 30, but sometimes during conversations it'll drop to 15 and it's kind of jarring.\n\n- Having to click the walk icon every time you want to switch screens gets annoying\n\n- I thought before or at the end I'd know who the killer was, but I honestly had no idea.

It's a game that can and likely will be played in a single session, as the simplistic gameplay never becomes overwhelming and the player always find new interesting story details that will encurage them to press on just a little further.\n\nThe story starts as improbable as it gets: Detective Grimoire is send on a murder case that may have been commited by an elusive creature that is the main attaction of a tourist attaction somewhere in the middle of a remote swamp. Strangely enough, Grimoire appears to be the only one confused how such a place can turn any kind of profit and thus begins our strange hunt for clues to unravel this mystery one piece at a time...\n\nYou might be best advised to see this game more along the lines of a visual novel, with a few simple puzzles mixed in to keep your brain running. The only flaw the story has in my opinion is that depending on the order you find the clues and how your brain works, you can make a very sure-fire guess who the culpirt is about half the way into the game.

This game is a sequel to an identically titled flash game. It expands and improves on the tested formula by adding additional layers of detail to the evidence, voice acting, high quality animations and heaps of polish. The user interface in particular is very well designed, making it easy to do anything you want to do.\n\nThe story is simple, perhaps a tad too simple in that many developments are only loosly related to the actual crime.\n\nThe game has a few minigames, but they are all very easy. They do break things up a little, but they are nothing worth bragging about. The game also has short quizes at times to ensure that the player is following along with the logic. This helps to reinforce the ideas and ensures that players don't miss critical points.\n\nThe character design is strong and clear, there is no risk of mixing up the characters. The characters aren't obvious stereotypes, but they don't have a lot of depth. There may be a layer or two to find, but nothing tought provoking here.\n\nThe voice acting is well done, both from an audio quality aspect and from a casting aspect. The audio is well timed to the character animations and you genuinly belive that the characters are speaking.\n\nThose looking for inventory puzzles have to look elsewhere, this game is not about rubbing everything on everything else, this is about pure investigating.\n\nThe game isn't very long, only a couple of hours. While there are many other games in the same price range that offers a lot more of play time, this game offers new content for its entirerty. It's worth the money. It's neither over- nor under-priced, it is just right.\n\nFans of the original should obviously play this. There is no requirement to play the first game, even if it is free, the story is self contained and barely makes any references to the previous game. Newcomers will like this game if they like mystery stories with a detective who investigates a situation and makes a conclusion in the end. It is not a difficult mystery to solve once all the facts are gathered, you play this for the experience getting there, not for clever puzzles or a challenging mystery.

Oh my gosh, I'm SO glad I did. This game is incredible. As a fan of Ace Attorney style point and click games, this was a real treat. The soundtrack was downright beautiful, the animation was flawless and flowed gorgeously, the art style was very overly cartoony (which made looking at the character animations super fun) and the characters themselves all had very unique personalities that the art style conveyed very well. The voice acting work in this game was superb, it really was. The plot, though it ended on a 'To Be Continued', was still marvelously well done. It was just vague enough to put suspicion on everyone, but detailed enough so that finding out who did commit the crime was really interesting. I also found that playing it was not nearly as difficult as I had anticipated it was. Sure, finding out everything did prove to be a bit of a challenge for me, but it wasn't difficult to the point where I needed to look for a walkthrough online somewhere, which is something I'm guilty of doing a lot for videogames. \n\nAs for negative points, I only have a couple. The first is that I managed to somehow complete the game without breaking into the tent (I couldn't find the code, but was told to visit the policeman to tell him my findings anyway), which is something I don't think I should have been able to do, and was a bit of a let down. My second criticism, is that the little girl that keeps randomly coming out of no-where needs some explanation, I think. I mean, did Grimoire imagine her? And if not, how does she know the Detective? What is up with her? Why does she keep vanishing? I really hoped the game would answer those questions, but they never did.\n\nDespite that though, I really enjoyed this game and I'd reccommend it to anyone. It was WAY worth my money.

Your job is to take on the mysterious death of Remington, the owner of a swamp amusement park in the far reaches of a swamp. The odd thing is that the apparent killer is the infamous Boggy, a creature so unique that it hasn't been seen in 60 years, and yet came out of hiding to kill the man that created a park about the creature itself. \n\nGraphically I loved the look of the game, the characters all had a very different look to them, and the different sections of the \"park\" definitely went with the vibe of what was going on in the scene. All the screens are static back drops, and some of them have characters that will appear somewhere in the foreground. There was just something about the character design that just draws a person in, I can't tell if it was the way that they were drawn, or if it is the use of colors, but whatever it is, it works for the game. I also really liked the HUD layout of the game, you definitely new where you were in the game, in terms of progress, as well as where you stood with the different characters that you would be interviewing as you try to track down the killer.\n\nOne of the biggest things that I have found makes or breaks the game is the voices and sounds of the game. This particular game nailed it. Along with the look of the characters I could feel the voices breath life into them. Each was very unique and each made me believe that those voices belonged to those characters. I also really appreciated the humorous dialogue that was thrown in from time to time to keep things a little lighter in the game.\n\nThe controls are really simple, this is another point and click game. So as long as you feel confident left clicking with a mouse, you'll do just fine.\n\nAlright so lets get down to it, as I stated before you will be playing the role of Detective Grimoire. You have been asked to consult in this truly bizarre death which everyone is claiming was done by an almost mythical creature that has not been seen in 60 years. It is your job to interview everyone on the island and try to uncover all the truths, lies, and obstacles that get in your way. My only problem with the game was that the overall length wasn't all that long, but there was something about this game that I didn't really care. I enjoyed it for what it was, and that was a great story, with a great cast of characters, and surprises spread throughout. I also enjoy the interrogation mechanic that was in the game. There was always a chance that some new bit of information or perhaps an actual clue could get more information out of the different individuals spread out across this very unique theme park.\n\nNow I'd like to go more into some of the twists and turns, but that would be a terrible thing to give away for anyone out there wanting to play the game, and I think most will want to play this game. So if you like point and click mysteries with colorful casts, and a very mysterious murder, this is the game for you. You can beat the game in under 2 hours, that's the only thing that I want to warn you about, but outside of that I think most will greatly enjoy the time they spend playing this game.

Arguably worth the low price of \u20ac6.99.\n\nI think the first thing that I really took notice of was the cute artstyle, which really brought back memories of obscure cartoons in my early, early childhood. It was mostly impressive within cutscenes, while in-game it looked a bit stale and clunky at times (incl. during dialogue sequences). But all in all a fairly good artstyle.\n\nThe gameplay is very simplistic point-and-click. Very much just running around the map, clicking on things until you find the solution, as it switched chapters for me twice just going around the map a singular time. It does not make any effort to hide the fact that it was ported over from mobile platforms, as it continuously reminds you to \"tap\" things instead of \"clicking\" them. Not that I find it at all hampering to the overall process of playing it.\n\nThe story itself is quite kid-friendly, actually, which I find to be a rather curious matter-of-fact seeing as the case entirely revolves around a murder... which is not all that kid-friendly. Nonetheless, the story did actually grab me in enough to play through the entire two or so hours as I frantically clicked away at things. In the end, a cute little story.\n\nSomething that I should mention is that I, personally, had some weird framerate issues. They mainly occurred after playing for more than half-an-hour or so, and would only affect interactions with objects within the world - but it did not affect the menus, the dialogue or the cutscenes. It might only be me experiencing this, as no one on the forum seems to be complaining about such issues at the time.\n\nSincerely\nCrayt", "timestamp_created": 1412352716, "timestamp_updated": 1412352716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12296939": {"recommendationid": "12296939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025267880", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 116, "playtime_forever": 134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408982685}, "language": "english", "review": "Too short of a game, but what there is is really well done.

Though it shares a few similarities, and even references the top hat wearing puzzle solver at one point, where Layton focuses heavily on brain teasers and riddles Grimoire is a pure detective game; something akin to an elaborate game of Clue crossed with an adventure game. While I could see developer SFB Games losing some people at this point, Detective Grimoire is actually all the better off for straying away from Nintendo's franchise and carving its own original, highly enjoyable path for itself.\n\nSet in a swamp located in the middle of nowhere, populated by suspicious individuals, and potentially home to a mysterious and brutal creature, a murder takes place. With little to go on, the police turn to Detective Grimoire (whose first name I never did find out), who arrives at the scene of the crime and begins to get to work putting the pieces together of just what occurred the night before.\n\nAnd this is where you come in. When I said this was a pure detective game, I meant it quite fully, as the entire game is broken down to finding clues, questioning suspects, and gathering evidence to eventually track down the culprit. As a result, the actual gameplay is rather simple, and usually involves little more than asking suspect A about clue B to get clue C, and repeat this until you've exhausted what you can get out of who you're questioning.\n\nIt's a bit dull on paper, yes, but what kept me engaged throughout the 3 or so hour story was the brilliant writing, lively character, and dry humor and wit of Grimoire. There is a huge amount of personality in every character, every line of dialog delivered with some truly fantastic voice work leading you one step closer to the final reveal, and the vibrant and wonderfully animated art is just the character on top. The plot itself likely couldn't hold its own among most other whodunits, but the way everything is presented more than makes up for the occasionally straightforward narrative and kept me entertained and guessing right up to the very end.\n\nPerhaps some will miss the puzzles or elaborate plot of other detective games, but I for one found Detective Grimoire's offbeat style, basic but enjoyable sleuthing, and buckets of personality one of the more uniquely enjoyable games I've played all year. It doesn't try to do a whole lot, but focuses its energy where it counts and makes my only real disappointment being there is not more of it. Thankfully, if what is hinted at after the credits becomes a reality we'll be seeing more of this detective soon, and that's definitely something to look forward to.\n\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2014/08/24/detective-grimoire-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1408915884, "timestamp_updated": 1427421828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685119", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11851907": {"recommendationid": "11851907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020994333", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410714812}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice, and funny enough, child friendly murder mystery game with unique style and great soundtrack. \n\nThe biggest flaw to this game is that its too short.

Grimoire is the second in the series, the original being available on the Newgrounds website, although the game doesn't hold many throwbacks to that game, aside from one remark, so it isn't ultimately necessary to play in order to enjoy this game, although  still whole heartedly recommended. \n\nDetective Grimoire details the story of the titular character's attempts to solve the mystery of the death of an attraction within an unusual place, and his main suspect is the tourist attraction's prominent star - Boggy, a creature that nobody has seen in decades. The Detective has been called to this murky bog in order to solve this mystery. While finding his misplaced hat, preferably. \n\nFirst thing first - there is no doubt that Detective Grimoire is an excellent game, and with the price I spent on it, I was pretty satisfied. However, the issue I mainly had for this  game was the puzzles, and the overall difficulty is a bit lacking. The puzzles that arised were very simplistic, and the game never really presented much of a challenge. Aside from that, I really did enjoy everything else. Unraveling the mystery of the swamp was very irritating, and the presentation of the bog was excellent, both in terms of art and sound. The humour in the game was also very amusing, and I must admit, I did find myself having a bit of a childish giggle at Grimoire's thought puzzle sections. \n\nDetective Grimoire is definitely something people should check out, and, as a huge fan of SFB Games, I look forward to what they produce next!", "timestamp_created": 1408816252, "timestamp_updated": 1408816252, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11835379": {"recommendationid": "11835379", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035552524", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408813381}, "language": "english", "review": "A great little detective game.

Doch was passiert, wenn sich ein Mord in diesem Freizeitpark ereignet und das mystisches Froschwesen \" Boggy \" zu den \u00fcblichen Verd\u00e4chtigen geh\u00f6rt? Nun liegt es an Grimoire, die Existenz von Boggy zu beweisen und den mysteri\u00f6sen Fall aufzukl\u00e4ren.\nDie Geschichte entwickelt sich in einem angenehmen Tempo und hat hier und da kleine \"Aha-Momente\". Der Gro\u00dfteil der Story entwickelt sich durch Gespr\u00e4che mit den Verd\u00e4chtigen.\n\nGameplay:\nMan zeigt und klickt in alter Manier auf einen Gegenstand oder eine Person und Grimoire h\u00e4lt einen kleinen Monolog \u00fcber den angetippten Gegenstand. Sollte ein wichtiger Hinweis dabei rausspringen, wird dieser mit gelber Schrift hinterlegt, was das ganze etwas einfacher macht. Zudem m\u00fcssen einige kleine Schiebepuzzle gel\u00f6st werden, die zwar nicht besonders anspruchsvoll sind, daf\u00fcr aber doch sehr gut ins Ambiente passen.\nF\u00fcr mich neu sind die \"Gedankenketten\", die man zusammen mit Grimoire erstellen muss, um zB. auf weitere Gespr\u00e4chsthemen zu kommen.\nDer erfolgreiche Detektiv hamstert sich schnell einen gro\u00dfen Berg an Beweisen zusammen, die er den Verd\u00e4chtigen zeigen muss, um neue Informationen zu erhalten. Meist ist es logisch wem man was vorzeigen muss, um einen Hinweis f\u00fcr die L\u00f6sung des Falls zu erhalten, doch wenn man das Spiel zu 100% durchspielen m\u00f6chte, kommt man nicht darum herum, jedem alles vorzulegen (was ein bisschen m\u00fchselig ist).\n\nPr\u00e4sentation:\nDas Ambiente wurde einfach gro\u00dfartig gezeichnet und macht sogar einen ollen Sumpf sympathisch, die Charaktere besitzen alle ihr gewisses etwas und \u00fcberzeugen vor allem mit einer wahnsinnig guten Synchronisation ( auf englisch ). Zudem wird das ganze mit einem herausragend gut passendem Soundtrack hinterlegt, der an entsprechenden Stellen wechselt und viel zum Spielerlebnis beitr\u00e4gt. Zu dieser Atmosph\u00e4re kommen noch die super synchronisierten Dialoge, die hier und da mit etwas Humor verfeinert wurden.\n\nFazit:\nWer der englischen Sprache m\u00e4chtig ist und sich auch f\u00fcr andere Point and Click Adventures begeistern kann, wird mit Detective Grimoire seine wahre Freude haben.

I liked the cartoonish style. It was simple and nice. It conveyed very basic body language (well, facial actually) in a humorous way. The atmosphere is very well achieved.\n* [u]Dialogs[/u]. The scripts were rather humorous, dynamic and very well acted. I liked the different choices in dialog, even though they don't always affect the outcome of the interrogation (but sometimes they do). Little objection:[spoiler] it can become incredibly annoying to click \"not suspicious\" on all the clues of one character, because the guy keeps saying it over and over, but I guess it doesn't matter if you don't do them all at the same time.[/spoiler]\n* [u]Sounds[/u]. The environmental sounds were great, not too overwhelming that they became annoying. The music was one of the best I heard in this kind of games.

You can question subjects about one of four topics, ask them about another character, or about an object in an inventory. Get enough clues and you get a special interrogation section with a character that plays out like a memory game, if you can remember the details, you will recieve an extra clue. Get even more clues after that and you will play a matching game that allows you to also recieve an additional clue. All to discover the solution to the mystery. Forgot details? Don't worry every single clue is written down for your convenience. There are even a few puzzles like trying to open a door available as well, but these are trivial.\n\nOn the possitive aspects Detective Grimoire is a creative game with bright vibrant characters with voice acting and animation that instantly brings them to life in a way few games ever achieve. The world is quite fleshed out and mildly interesting as well as a tourist attraction in a swamp feels like a place that really could exist. The game is very intuitive and discovering who the criminal is stems naturally from the clues given to the extent where you could solve the case in your head without the need for sudden reveals.\n\nThe negative aspect of the game can be summed up as busy work. There is an old saying that in adventure games when you get stuck you need to use everything on everything else. Detective Grimoire is a game based around using everything on everything else and unfortunately in some cases it is what you genuinely need to do. You will sometimes find yourself bringing up every item and suspect to every single character... Now you might think to yourself \"But divulging that I am onto the criminal might scare them away or put me in danger.\" Not so in Detective Grimoire, you can bring up all the evidence you need to catch the criminal to the criminal and they won't even bat an eye. Essentially making this feel like a large game of \"busy work\" instead of a full blown detective game. It is also a bit on the short side.\n\nDifficulty wise the game is easy. Hints are on by default, essentially it will give you solutions, and even with them off occasionally the hints they give in the game should entirely give the puzzle away. There is no game overs and the game even has a system to tell you when you missed something. If you think Telltale point and clicks are too hard, this game is for you.\n\nThis game confuses me because on paper I should dislike the game because it is incredibly easy and ultimately requires no real problem solving... Yet I actually like the game because of its atmosphere, voice acting, and world building as well as the characters that inhabit it. It helps that it is priced quite fairly.\n\nI give this a 8/10\n\nBy the by, those 3 hours on record?

If anything, the game lacks depth and it's rather too short, and the final part of the game is very disappointing since it does everything for you.\nWorth a check, considering the low price point.\n\nLong Review:\n\nDetective Grimoire is technically the second game of the series, with the first being released as a free flash game on their site (which is still pretty good in my opinion! Give it a check!). However, with this game they did a HUGE leap of quality, adding a ton of stuff that the original game didn't have, such as voice acting (A LOT of voice acting) better animation, different art style and more complex puzzles (but not as complex as they should be really).\n\nInitially released for portables such as iPads and what not, I was anticipating this game for a long time, as I loved the original DG for being quite interesting, and the character is actually very likeable and very funny; what we have here is basically a port that didn't suffer from it and still maintains its core mechanics, such as the \"theory-maker\" thingie. \nIf anything, the resolution cannot be changed, and the volume is at max by default: little nitpicks, so nothing to worry about.\n\nThe game itself is splendidly made: dialogues are fun to follow and don't drag too much, as they flow very fast and I rarely skipped the dialogues, since they were very interesting and very funny (especially Grimoire: he really tells a lot of stupid things. Oh, and they made the hat joke again!). The puzzles are ok, but just too easy to follow: the real challenge at times is the Theory-making part, since at times you'll put the wrong statement...but at the same time, it's a lot of fun to mess up those, making him say the dumbest thing ever. The game is fluid and has also animated cutscenes as well, and the characters are...okay, for the most part.\n\nHowever, there are some issues in my opinion: for one, the story is good, but the last part is a joke: you do nothing at all when you catch the culprit, and that's a huge disappointment considering that the first game, a flash game, had a far more complicated part where you EVEN have to guess who did it. In here, he picks it up for you.\nThe game is also too easy: you really can't fail anything at all, and as soon as you get your clues you can just spam them to the suspects and see their reaction...and Grimoire even tells you \"when it's time to go\". They also gave you the possibility to see if something is suspect or not on a culprit, but it's completely useless and serves no purpose: it's just there for letting you  check your progress to catch the culprit. And let's face it, you'll guess who it is pretty soon.\n\nI honestly hoped the game to be more intriguing: the art is amazing and the game is very fun, but the story behind is disappointing and lacks to be intriguing, which is a huge problem for me. \nStill, I do recommend this game, because it's always good to have nice adventure games and the game is still VERY well done. \nAvoid it if you don't care about investigation, reading, or point and click adventures in general.", "timestamp_created": 1408421928, "timestamp_updated": 1408421928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11774797": {"recommendationid": "11774797", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027353562", "num_games_owned": 1824, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1408416186}, "language": "english", "review": "Utterly gorgeous in every way.

There are puzzles in some areas that will give more clues when solved.\nThere is a mechanic where if you have collected enough clues, you will have to analyze things by completing sentences.\nAnd lastly, a mechanic where you interrogate someone and has to choose the right words to say and questions to ask.\n\nThe art style is simple yet stylish;\nThe drawing of the world is pretty frame-worthy, and the character animations are made with good care and detail.\n\nThe mechanics are fair, in a good way!\nI'd say the challenges are a bit easy, but I believe the design is intended to be casual. Most of them it took me only one attempt to complete. They are still interesting, however.\n\nTook me 3hrs to complete (as well as get all achievements) in one sitting.", "timestamp_created": 1516416292, "timestamp_updated": 1516416292, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40944298": {"recommendationid": "40944298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074691072", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 303, "last_played": 1521565332}, "language": "russian", "review": "Detective Grimoire - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0438\u0437 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0432, \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0448\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0440\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0448\u0435. \u0412 \u0447\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d \u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440, \u0432\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442\u044b - \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f!

I played it through all in one setting, with a few distractions thrown in, in the form of my children... LOL But this really was a super cute and fun game to breeze through. The art style was wonderful. The characters each had their own real personality. You really got a feel for who they were and even the brief time you spent with them, you liked them, or just didn't. \n\nThe music in the game was pleasant as well. The audio aspect of this game was neat because you used it in one of the ways to solve the mystery. I liked that additional bonus of the game. There was humor in the game. Cute for adults, but probably hysterical for younger players. And that is something else that is cool about this game. Literally anyone able to read can play it and there isn't anything in here that is questionable. \n\nI think I only ran into a couple of small glitches in the game. One where I had to restart. An item popped up that was being added to my clues and I had no way to exit the screen, so I had to back out of that, and one other where a puzzle piece wouldn't fit not matter how many times I tried to click it in place. But after I exited that mini-game and re-entered it, it worked just fine. \n\nOver all, I give this game a thumbs up, but I really wish I could get the \"To be continued\" part of this game!

You play as the character with the same namesake as you explore around different areas to look for clues and talk to witnesses/suspects (depends on how suspicious you think they are).\n\nTo solve the case, you mostly string together evidences to form a \"Challenge\", a critical cross-examining question you form to interrogate your suspects. From there, it didn't take too long for me to figure out the solution. On the other hand, the great soundtrack and artistic direction was a wonderful icing of the cake. I'm thoroughly impressed by their character design and the voiceover of every single dialogue!\n\nDue to its short length and simplicity, Detective Grimoire is a perfect game for younger gamers who seek the thrill of sleuthing.

The voiceacting is phenomenal and the art is gorgeous! The characters are peculiarly well-written and the storyline is just riveting (I'm looking forward to more from this team!).\n\nThe game works on a point and click idea, so it's easy to get the hang of clicking every darn thing (not just for clues, but for our main character's witty witicisms too). The game follows our Detective Grimoire (yes, that's actually his name. It's pretty cool) as he searches for Boggy, the swamp monster. Is the creature really our murderer or is there something even more sinister going on here?\n\n\nI don't normally play point and click games or even murder mysteries, but this game just looks adorable. The storyline is also challenging but easy enough that it only takes just a few tries to find the right answer (which was pretty surprising honestly). The game allows you to move wherever you like (and it's always a good idea to backtrack), so everything goes along at your pace! It's easy to pick up but not so easy to put down (I've personally completed this three times. First as a newbie, second to get the achievements, and the third when Steam decided not to save my achievements).\n\nI highly recommend getting this game and playing it! it's surprisingly easy to play through it again and again (provided you leave some time inbetween so you forget THAT one detail that always trips you up).

For example, when you speak to a character, the detective has a thought bubble which changes to something like \"I think I'm done here\" when you've spoken about all the relevant topics, so you don't have to keep showing evidence until you've done the lot. It's very easy - I didn't need to use any hints, but as someone who has very little time for games these days, it was kinda spot on perfect. I never ran out of stuff to do or felt like I was aimlessly poking around at hotspots.\n\nI actually started playing this game on mobile but it crashed too many times for me so got the PC version instead (hence only 1.5 hours of playtime on record here on Steam). The PC version runs better than the mobile version, especially with the minigames, at least for me.\n\nI really enjoyed the humour. It wasn't laugh-out-loud funny but each character was unique and amusing. It played on stereotypes without feeling cookie-cutter. I loved the voice acting!\n\nThe best part of the game, for me at least, was the gameplay. The murder mystery was laid out really well and the clues kept building up a picture in your mind until eventually you're pretty confident in who the murderer is. The final sequence requires you to put a bunch of clues together in a similar style to Phoenix Wright, answering questions by presenting evidence from your inventory, map, and clues. As a result, it really feels like you've solved the mystery yourself, rather than the game just recapping what you've discovered.\n\nFor an indie title, it by far exceeded my expectations and I'd happily buy sequels at the same price point.

It felt like the very first chapter of an epic detective story, unfortunately all you get is a single case to work with. With that out of the way...;\n\n\n If you enjoy point and click adventure style games with charming characters to talk to and detective style investigations, this is a great experience! Here is a little hint: Just because the main characters tells you that they feel like they are done talking to someone, it doesn't actually mean you are. There is also a very neat deduction system which really makes this game shine as a detective game. This game rewards you for being incuisitive which is actually kinda rare in point and click adventures which often times require you to click every pixel and try to figure out the crazy logic of the game-developer instead of the in-universe logic.\n\n\nThis is a very neat, cute, somewhat fresh experience for those of you who are into old adventure games, just keep in mind how extremely short it is. I really hope they make a sequel...

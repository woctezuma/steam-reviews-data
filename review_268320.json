The point of the game is iteration, doing the levels over and over until you understand what to do and until you get better at doing it. The camera is close to the actual \"ball\" that you're playing, which makes it difficult sometimes to see where you're supposed to go, and the game's visuals plays into this with its aesthetic and actual, invisible platforms in many levels. Don't expect to be able to do all levels in the first try; again, the game is about iteration and learning-through-doing. If you like games that will frustrate you a lot at times, then Grapple is a pretty damn good experience. If you don't, you will hate it and probably not finish it, because there is nothing else but the gameplay to get you through the game (meaning, there is no story).\n\nAs for my recommendation, I personally liked it, but I can see it being kind of a nieche experience. I would suggest getting this game if you like the core principle of grappling/swinging, because it does work very well in this game. I would suggest getting it if you like difficult games and overcoming them. I would suggest getting it if you like 3D platforming, and can oversee your perspective being limited while playing. If there is one of these three things that you find very unappealing, I would not recommend this game for you.

And of course, replay value isn't really a thing with this game, atleast I don't think so, It's a breeze to swing through all the levels a second or third time, but, I guess that would be too much to ask from a puzzle game, once you figure out everything it's going to be easy no matter what, I can't blame anyone for that. That being said, it's still a fine game replaying it knowing what to do, but of course it doesn't have the same thrill the second time round. I'd wait a while before you replayed it, maybe like a year. Then come back and see if you can remember how to finish it. You might even have to put in as much effort as the first time.

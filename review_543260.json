Had I looked into it more I would have bought it on the Nintendo Switch instead, since it's actually a pretty quick and easy game if you're familiar with the system and where to go. As one could tell from my currently short play time, it doesn't take too long to beat, but it takes longer when you experience the game for the first time, and don't conveniently remember all the secrets.\n\nFor fans of the original, the game was remastered quite well, charm stones were revised and now have hidden challenge dungeons, including one for Hu-man, they can be solved without much difficulty if you think about what weapons you have access to, and how to get around certain obstacles.\n\nFor anyone new to the game, if it feels like a 90's game, it's because it's actually an 80's game. It's a classic from the time, and if you like platformers it's a good way to spend an a few afternoons.\n\nThe controls are exactly like the original, which may not feel precise by todays standards, but they are as the game was originally designed, and once you get used to them they are not an issue.\n\nThe music and sound effects are quite nice in their modern versions, yet as a player of the original I preferred the older sounds with the new graphics. Luckily, the developers allow us to change between classic and modern sound or graphics any time, including mashing the switching graphics button to get it stuck with old graphics on one side of the screen, and new on the other.", "timestamp_created": 1512241351, "timestamp_updated": 1512241351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38005283": {"recommendationid": "38005283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099206025", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511087788}, "language": "french", "review": "Super Remake de Lizardcube un vrai plaisir de red\u00e9couvrir ce jeu!!!\n\nPour ma part j'ai pleinement profit\u00e9 de la bande son r\u00e9instrumentalis\u00e9e et des graphismes qui sont juste sublimes.\n\nPour ceux qui veulent y jouer en mode classique c'est possible soit juste graphiquement ou pour la bande son d'origine ou les deux, et ce \u00e0 n'importe quel moment.\n\nUn grand merci au studio pour ce travail incroyable et respectueux des joueurs.\n\nA acheter les yeux ferm\u00e9 tant le studio a accompli un chef d'oeuvre.", "timestamp_created": 1512225267, "timestamp_updated": 1512225267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37955725": {"recommendationid": "37955725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054978155", "num_games_owned": 2145, "num_reviews": 148, "playtime_forever": 301, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512140411}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u7378\u63a7play\n", "timestamp_created": 1512057980, "timestamp_updated": 1512057980, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37938793": {"recommendationid": "37938793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119076764", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 96, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504725522}, "language": "english", "review": "I love it \nthe graphics,, ooo\nthe music,,, wooo\nthe gameplay,,, nice\ni am wondered", "timestamp_created": 1511991936, "timestamp_updated": 1511991936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37938238": {"recommendationid": "37938238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013609212", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 605, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511989282}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Si eres uno de los privilegiados que lo disfrutaron hace a\u00f1os ya en Master System, te va a encantar.

This game tries to sell itself as a Metroidvania but it simply is not. Itis more of a platformer with Metroidvania elements. However again this is not my biggest issue.\n\nMy biggest issue is that the game is completely broken once you get to a certain point where you have to switch from one creature to another. The problem lies in the fact that only the mouse can enter the room where the switching portal thingy is. I paid 20$ which is extremely pricey for an indie title like this, and as a result I expect a game which has no game breaking issues like that.\n\nShame,  I was actually enjoying this game up until then...

The room with the well has a block you can break to access it.\n\n(Later in the game the Tasmanian Sword also enable some extra flexibility but it's a secret rather than a main line thing)\n\nIn term of overall difficulty, the game is balanced as such that with extra money you can buy better equipments. But we agree it isn't an easy game in particular at it is a game that leaves the player with little instruction. For example (one example among other issues) we found that some players mashed the attack button multiple time when in Lizard-Man form, which keeps cancelling their attack, and make it much harder to progress for them than if you attack a single time. They are indeed design flaws that we could have improved with better help screens or by conveying the effect better. Or another recurrent issue is that people don't understand they can attach clouds with the arrow or in some instance there are low enough that you can just jump and attack them with flame/sword.\n\nCheers,\nOmar"}, "37824886": {"recommendationid": "37824886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254326902", "num_games_owned": 505, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1514599886}, "language": "english", "review": "Remastered versions of classic videogames are some of the trickiest things to get right nowadays. If a developer changes things too much, it may end up driving away the fans of the original game. On the other hand , if the developer plays it \"too safe\" and offer changes that are minimal to the overall experience, it will most likely be ignored by new audiences as well as most of the fans of the original game who may have wanted to see something new. Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is a remastered version of the third title in the Wonder Boy series that appeared on the Sega Master System 8-bit console almost 30 years ago. And it is impressive to see a remastered game that looks so different yet so close to the original classic title.\n\nThe story is unchanged from the original title. After being cursed by Meka Dragon and turned into a \"Lizard Man\", Wonder Boy must travel through Monster Land in order to find the Salamander Cross and lift the curse. However most of the areas are guarded by a Dragon Boss who will curse you into a different creature after their defeat (a mouse, a piranha, a lion and a hawk. Each with their own strenghts and weaknesses!). This gives the game a certain \"metroidvania\" feel since some areas are only available if you have the correct transformation.\n\nThe most obvious changes are the game's looks and sounds. The game now features gorgeous cartoon-like graphics and backgrounds (not quite on the same level as titles such as the impressive looking \"Cuphead\", but still a joy to behold!) that still manage to stick closely to the cute looks of the original game. (every character on the game would make a great plush toy, even the bosses!) \n\nThe music and sound effects are worthy of praise as well. The music tracks are now performed with real instruments and some of the music tracks have been expanded or modified to fit better with the current background stage, yet they manage to stick closely to the original musical score. (in the original game, there was a single specific track that plays everytime you enter an enemy stronghold, in this version every stronghold plays a different remix of this very track that is close to the stronghold current motif such as the sunken ship or the japanese castle!)\n\nFor better or worse, the controls are mostly identical to those of the original game. Playing on a xbox 360 controller gives you more buttons for a more precise control than the original title had back in the day (the SMS control pads were a two-button only affair so this is apreciated!) Some of the newer gamers may find the characters somewhat heavy to control (small jumps and you can't stop on a dime) but this is close to the original design were timing and positions were key to beating the game! \n\nOther gameplay related changes to take notice would be the inclusion of difficulty levels, an overhaul of the charm system (which is quite appreciated since this was nothing more than annoying padding back in the original game!). But the highlight would be the fact that it is possible to change between the original version and the remastered version of the game's graphics and sounds with the touch of a button at any moment! This feature alone goes to great lenghts in showing just how nicely the game's fundamentals hold up in gaming nowadays. Even, as a nice bonus, the old passwords from the original game still work!\n\nIt is important to notice that this game was never a long quest in the first place, and with the charm system modifications, it is even faster to complete. Also there are times where newcomers may have troubles to figure out were to go next, but this was a small issue in the original and is a small issue here as well.\n\nOverall, I can't show enough praises for what the developers at Lizardcube have done for Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap to adapt the game to more recent times while keeping what made the game a SMS classic. Here's hoping that more remasters of such quality can make their arrival someday!

Right now he can't fall asleep because he just unlocked a new shape and wants to explore some more.\n\nOh, and I also enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1511724357, "timestamp_updated": 1511724461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37693883": {"recommendationid": "37693883", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062565894", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 523, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511922423}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0430\u044f.\n\n\u042f \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0439 Wonder Boy. \u041d\u043e \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c. \u042d\u0442\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438, \u0441\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430, \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e. \u042d\u0445\u2026 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0432 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0438 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0439 Master System.\n\n\u0410 \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430. \u041e\u043d \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d. \u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430, \u044f \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 OST \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b. \u0410\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f. \n\n\u041c\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0430 Lizard-man-\u0430. \u041d\u043e \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c. \u041d\u043e \u0434\u0430, \u0437\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u043d \u043d\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u0434\u043e Mummy Dragon, \u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e. \u041d\u043e \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0430, \u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u043a \u0447\u0442\u043e\u2026\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1511715978, "timestamp_updated": 1511715978, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37680508": {"recommendationid": "37680508", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000134361", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497727644}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Volte aos tempos mais simples de passar as tardes jogando mega drive!

You seemingly get punished for standing still for more than a second by BACKGROUND interference. So many times, take damage just for standing there, assessing the best way to navigate the next section of jumping, crouching and left right dodging AIR ATTACKS as well as ground attacks, while being mindful of arbitrary background danger. I was so excited to pick this up, but the game is hard because it controls bad. \n\nIt's a shame, the art style is great for a remake of what was a nice game for it's time but nothing to shout about now looks wise. The soundtrack, I probably prefer the old one to be honest, but the new one is not terrible. Also cool is how you can make it completely retro if you want, graphics and sound change at the touch of either trigger. \n\nFor me, I won't play any more. I won't refund because I appreciate what the dev tried to do here, but the controls are absolutely abysmal and after playing Hollow Knight in the days prior to this, I can say I won't be bashing my head against the wall trying to progress any further here.\n\n*Edit* Have decided to refund.

Love the graphics overhaul though!\n\nPerks: \n* Auto save any time on exit\n* Ability to switch between old and new game at the click of a button\n* Cartoon-style graphics are well done and comical\n* Ability to change up game switching on/off retro/new sound and graphics\n* Old save system in tact and old school passwords work too (for those of us that still have saves written down somewhere... ^_^)\n\nOverall my experience was enjoyable and although the game is 100% now complete, i will still revisit it for my own personal enjoyment.

The progression feels rewarding, with 'secrets' and paths all around the place. The music is excellent and has had an imense amount of effort put behind it, really helping in capturing the player. The graphics are absolutley amazing. It would be so great to see more oldschool titles brought back in this fashion - Alex the Kidd, NES/Gameboy Zeldas', Ghosts 'n Ghouls. In any case, it's great to have a return of 2D sidescrollers with modern grahpics. There is good reason those games all did so well in their time. The artwork/bonus content included is also very nice and helps illustrate the thought that went into it. The difficulty setting options is also a nice touch.

It doesn\u2019t take long to know that the bones of this game are the same as the platform action-adventure games it was based on, specifically Wonder Boy III: The Dragon\u2019s Trap from 1989. This new Wonder Boy (or Wonder Girl if you prefer \u2013 one way the game has updated to the 21st century) makes no attempt to hide its roots. The foundation is built on the simplistic left-right-up-down-attack-duck model of platform games from the 80s and 90s, but it manages to give this old gaming style a boost of new blood and energy.\n\nA lot of that new blood comes from the hand drawn graphics. Traveling from the central village hub, you unlock new areas of gameplay, from dry, volcanic wastelands to underwater lagoons. These graphics, combined with a dynamic and interesting score, gives Monster Land a new, beautiful, yet somehow still raw, look and feel. But Wonderboy is all about paying tribute to the old. If the new graphics feel a little too polished for you, the click of a single button with transform your world into 8-bit in the blink of an eye, and with it, the score becomes a nostalgic arcade ditty to accompany your pixelated hero. You can be in the middle of a boss fight, suddenly long for the days of old, and transform your battle into the 90s platform game that you know and love.\n\nUnderneath the pretty new graphics, the game is still fundamentally the same. As you journey through Monster Land, you battle new dragons and transform into different creatures (because of course you\u2019ve been cursed by the Meka-Dragon). You begin as a lizard that spits fire, but as you unlock new creatures, you unlock new abilities. The mouse-human can climb walls, the hawk-human can fly, and so on.\n\nFighting consists of a few basic attacks, which vary slightly depending on which cursed animal-human you happen to be. Starting off with low health and low armor, these fights require a certain level of patience and caution at first. It\u2019s a matter of figuring out the rhythm, getting used to different tools at your disposal, and a bit of luck. It\u2019s that last part that can get frustrating. Especially during the boss fights (when the stakes are at their highest), leaping in for an attack has to be so perfectly timed that it starts to feel a bit like a guessing game. Be prepared for a test of patience, especially since dying sends you, yet again, back to your main village hub.\n\nDuring your travels, you\u2019ll also come across some helpful tools like arrows, which allow you to shoot up at the sky, or potions, which give you a second life for when you get trampled by a giant red frog. The only way to get these items is stumbling upon them either in treasure chests or after killing an enemy. Die, and these items will disappear again. Though you have the option of buying armor and visiting a flirtatious nurse to restore your health, the endless amount of coins you procure from killing fish and snakes starts to feel pointless if you can\u2019t spend it on useful weapons. It would have been a nice touch to be able to purchase some of these items in stores, rather than relying on luck dropping them into your lap.\n\nFor anyone nostalgic for these platform games, while eager to see some of the physics and kinks worked out in a modern setting, Wonder Boy won\u2019t disappoint. It\u2019s boldly simple and boldly new.

Nice handdrawn sprites with lots of new backgrounds in multiple parallax layers, adding more atmosphere due to the feeling of depth. My only complaint is that the remixed soundtrack sometimes diverges too much from the original compositions, I would have preferred a more subtle interpretation. Most tracks are beautiful though and I really appreciate the option to mix and match original content with remake content such that the new graphics can be combined with the original music or vice versa.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the original, it is a platforming action RPG where you travel to different areas, always on the path to the next dungeon in which to beat the next boss. After defeating a boss, you get transformed into some new form, each one having their own unique abilities enabling you to reach previously unreachable areas where you can find new stores in which to by better equipment and reach the next dungeon. The different forms into which you are transformed enable you to run up certain walls (as Mouse-Man), swim under water (Pirahna-Man), hit blocks above you and below you with your sword (Lion-Man) and fly (Hawk-Man). Later in the game you can access certain rooms where you can change back and forth between all forms unlocked so far. It all creates a Zelda-like feeling where you often backtrack to previously visited areas because you realize you can now access parts which were unreachable earlier.\n\nThe remake changes almost nothing gameplaywise, the few tweaks feeling like improvements. There are a few additions like difficulty levels, the hardest one making you take damage as time progresses and unlocking an achievement upon completion, and newly created short dungeons to complete for each character granting you access to one final piece of equipment upon completing all of them.\n\nThis is who a remake is supposed to be done: cosmetic upgrades to visuals and audio, minor tweaks and some small additional areas and/or features. The end result is the same magical feeling created by the original and whether you feel like enjoying the experience with new high-quality graphics and audio or prefer the originals, the experience is superior to taking out your old Master System and playing the original yet again (not that I don't recommend adding the original game to you collection).", "timestamp_created": 1505077812, "timestamp_updated": 1505077812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34859521": {"recommendationid": "34859521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198397201369", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505303338}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u753b\u98ce\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u8ff7\u5bab\u5f0f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u6b66\u5668\u88c5\u5907\u591a\u6837", "timestamp_created": 1505042789, "timestamp_updated": 1505042789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34819132": {"recommendationid": "34819132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110427104", "num_games_owned": 314, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508561245}, "language": "french", "review": "+1", "timestamp_created": 1504891321, "timestamp_updated": 1504891321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34815585": {"recommendationid": "34815585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379293890", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505277211}, "language": "french", "review": "WAAAAW la claque !

How random is it that some hero developer decides to remaster this diamond 25 years later?!\n\nWell, they did, and it's awesome! The graphics is completely remade to match todays standard in 2D platforming, beautiful hand drawned pictures that really captures the feel that made this game great, i actually like to think that this is exactly how i imagined everything to look beyond the pixels when i was younger.\n\nThey didn't stop there however, what i haven't mentioned yet about the original was the music, which is also some of the best soundtracks that was ever made to a Sega game (again, in my opinion)\nThey didnt just settle with hiring a guy to rewamp the music digitally but instead got several musicians with actual instruments (As you can see in the in-game gallery) to transform those awesome tunes into something even better!\n\nAnother really cool thing is that you can swap between retro and modern gfx/sound on the fly.\n\nIf you are on the fence of buying this and are reading this review you probably played the original at some point so let me tell you, this wont dissapoint you in any way, shape or form.

The game's aesthetics were redrawn in a style halfway between Japanese and Franco-Belgian comic books, they look amazing and 100% fit with the original game's style.\n\n - New music: to be honest, I would have preferred a more energetic soundtrack, because some of the remastered compositions are rather on the mellow side. But never mind my take on the chosen direction, the execution is a thing of beauty. The OST is worth buying, and I'm saying than even without having heard the extra tracks!\n \n - Quality-of-life improvements : If you still struggle to determine which piece of equipment is best for one form or another, or which ones have special capabilities, now you can, even before you buy them. Also, items are now used using a separate button, and not Down+Jump. It does make a difference, believe me. Limitations due to the Master System technology are also gone: you can now actually save the game (passwords in the original only save an approximate state of the game) and you can access the items/equipment menu during boss fights (what, you didn't know you couldn't in the original? try pausing while fighting a dragon and see what happens) .\n\n - Humor : yes, it has it now. Between some of the items' descriptions, and the eternally snarky pigs and nurses, these little things bring more flavor to the adventure.\n\n - Extra content: The Unknown, six hard mini-dungeons for you to find and complete. \n\n - Retro mode: switch between retro and modern graphics and sound. It really helps appreciate the difference between the original and the remake, and to realize how faithful to the original the engine is.\n\n - Difficulty modes: While I didn't need the Easy mode, the Hard mode was rather challenging, and the idea behind it is both a very good fit for the game and a great reference to a previous installment in the series!\n\n - Moddability: Thanks to the format of several files, the dev tools still in the game, and good-willed developers who participate in discussions about modding the game, this game has awesome potential for becoming something more in the future.\n\nLook, I don't pretend I can list all the good parts in this review. However, what is for sure is that, in addition to the original game being really good, this remake should set the standard for retro remakes.

It's very faithful to the original game, the animation is of exquisitely high quality, the music is spot-on, revisiting Meka Dragon's area for example feels really great, there's only a few tracks slightly unsuited for the sort of action we see in the game, but the option to quickly switch from retro to modern makes up for it. The content added to the remake, the puzzle platforming areas that contain a charm stone for every transformation are tastefully done, challenging but not impossibly so, require mastering the controls but also feel like solving a puzzle in how you look for the right spots to jump from, with how much momentum and so on, which block to destroy. Those areas give me confidence in the developer's ability to design a solid platforming experience of their own in the future, should they decide to make a brand new game. \n\nAs for reviewing the parts that belong to the original game : it's a fantastic platformer/metroidvania-ish game with touches of inspiration from the arcades. The game length is thus on the short side if all you care about is completing it once, but there is more fun to be had if you are the sort of player who have an interest in getting better at the game, such as playing hard mode and setting new challenges for yourself such as how fast you complete it, or with how many resources. The base mechanics of the game are solid enough to support that sort of playstyle, it is not unlike the enjoyment found in replaying shmups whose absolute game length are 30 minutes, but whose goals of endless higher scores or perfect no-death 1 credit continues leave players with the desire to play more. The game can get easier if you use all the resources at your disposition, but you can also have fun doing runs with no magic or powerful items. The only negative bit, where the game hasn't aged well, is the boss fights, which can feel tricky in your first attempt, but become rather trivial once you've noticed the way the single pattern works. With that said, it does not overly detract from the game, which at the core is a platforming experience about dealing with various enemy spawns on multiple sides of the screen. \n\nA last thing to note, on the technical side : it runs perfectly well on Linux, with not a single bug spotted during my runs.

I'm really impressed by the overall graphical appearance which is way above of what I usually would expect from a platformer. In this sense I put it next to gems like 'Ori and the Blind Forest' or 'Rayman: Origins'.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] Some of the 8bit classics are pure masterworks gameplay-wise, but they were graphically limited. The developers of the remake decided not to change the original controls, level-design, enemies and puzzles, but rather left everything as intended and just gave it a modern look. This concept works incredibly well! Thanks to the graphical overhaul the original gameplay can really shine and can be enjoyed by a modern audience. IMHO this is how remakes should be done and I would love to see other classics like Super Mario Bros. 3, Metroid, Contra or Mega Man 2 remade this way.\n\nRegarding the gameplay: Wonder Boy is a solid Platformer with minor Adventure-elements. It's a light-hearted game, not too easy but never frustrating at any point. It's not very long and you could probably beat it on a sunday afternoon. I'd say it has high replayability since those games where made the be played again and again. And like most of the classics: No grinding, no unnecessary elements that stretch the game. Pure fun!\n\n[b]Other:[/b] A nice gimmick is the option to switch between the modern appearance and the classic 8bit graphics (and music).", "timestamp_created": 1502199286, "timestamp_updated": 1502199792, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34070243": {"recommendationid": "34070243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126252334", "num_games_owned": 3635, "num_reviews": 106, "playtime_forever": 679, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502554564}, "language": "english", "review": "This Review is writed for [url=https://crassbee.com/wonderboy-the-dragons-trap/] Crassbee.com [/url]\n\nOverview\n\nWonderboy: The Dragon\u2019s Trap is a remake made by Dotemu and Lizardcube for the 1989 Sega Master System Game: Wonderboy III: The Dragon\u2019s Trap. This remake has the same feel as you are playing the original one: It\u2019s mixes the difficulty + exploration across the places very well. You will need to be prepared to pass across some really difficulty levels if you don\u2019t have the necessary character or weapon/shield/armor equipped. And this version has the addition of the Wonder girl for you to play.\n\nStory\n\nIt remains the same as the original. The game starts on the last battle versus the Meka Dragon from the previous game: Wonderboy in the Monster Land. After you defeat the Dragon,you\u2019ll be cursed and transformed in different monsters with unique abilities after defeating the Dragon Bosses. You will return to your original form only when you defeat the last boss. Your goals are to defeat the dragons and remove the curse.\n\nGameplay\n\nOne of the many charms of this game. The game has easy controls and smooth gameplay. You have a inventory that shows you every item that you got,and it\u2019s divided into four categories:Special Powers,Swords,Shields and Armors. You also can quickly swap the magic items with the mapped keys. In the start you will find that the enemies can kill you very quick and the game is hard,but after find the hearts and the right weapons across the levels the things gets better and you will enjoy each and every moment that this game can offer without getting killed almost all time.You\u2019ll have a chance of getting a potion on the game over screen,if you don\u2019t get it and die across the level,you will have to restart the whole level again.\n\nTo defeat the bosses you need to find the pattern of attack of each one,after getting on it,it\u2019s pretty easy to find what you have to do to not lose hearts and defeat them.\n\nYou\u2019ll find a lot of secrets hiding new weapons,powers,shops and money.Some are easy to find but most of all are well hide and will require a exploration across the whole level to find it.\n\nAnd the game also reserves secrets for who bravely searches it: Each character of the game has a charm stone hidden somewhere. To find it,you will need to search even more,after you find the correct door,it leads you to a level that you can only use the right character without changing it\u2019s form. These levels requires more attention since they are harder compared to the normal levels,After getting the 6 stones you\u2019ll have the ability to buy the last sword of the game: The Gallic Sword.\n\nGraphics\n\nWell,the graphics of this game can attend to two kinds of people: The Nostalgic ones who want to play the classic game without enhancements and the ones that want to relive their memories with new and updated graphics. The art and design of this game was really done with love,making the game beautiful and delicious to play. And in the other side you can activate the retro mode that will lead you back to the 1989 original game without losing the feeling that this remake brought.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe same attends to the soundtrack: You can listen the original one or the new one. The new soundtrack maintains the nostalgic feeling but with renewed songs and instruments. The music can go from the calm village song to the intense boss fight song music. The sounds are very good and can help you find hidden enemies sometimes.\n\nSummary\n\nWonderboy: The Dragon\u2019s Trap is the definitive remake that everyone asked for. It\u2019s blends the nostalgic feeling of playing the original game plus the feeling that the game evolved with the remake too. The game difficulty is fine,but if you do not have patience for dying constantly it can be a trouble. It\u2019s a game that suits for anyone,even the ones that have knowed the game only on this remake.", "timestamp_created": 1502058724, "timestamp_updated": 1502059340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34064882": {"recommendationid": "34064882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200619975", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 316, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508516095}, "language": "italian", "review": "\u00e8 brtuuto ha la grfica bruta", "timestamp_created": 1502041038, "timestamp_updated": 1502041038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34045365": {"recommendationid": "34045365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054517113", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 993, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502329383}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O melhor remake que j\u00e1 joguei, ainda mais pelo mod da Turma da M\u00f4nica em: O Resgate do Master System, tenho o jogo em cartucho at\u00e9 hoje e as senhas!

With the new look combined to the original gameplay, it's safe to say that the game still holds up to this day.\nSome parts can be a bit cryptic for modern gamers, and the lack of checkpoints may discourage some players who are not used to over 20-year old games.\nIt is most recommended for people who are interested in old classics or if you're a fan of the original game.\nCan't praise the art style enough, but it's amazing how fluid the new animations make the game feel. I'm looking forward if any other classics will get same kind of treatment in the future as this one.

Gameplay mechanics are identical to the original (down to the fact that you can literally switch back to emulator view), but the controls are a little more convenient... the inventory is certainly easier to deal with since you don't have to pop in to switch spells.\n\nOverall a fantastic remake.", "timestamp_created": 1501364624, "timestamp_updated": 1501364624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33886972": {"recommendationid": "33886972", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983542567", "num_games_owned": 882, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 886, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503932538}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0443\u044e, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u0433\u0438. \u0414\u043b\u044f \u043e\u043b\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 Wonderboy - \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430. \u041b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0443 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u043e\u043d \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430 8-\u0431\u0438\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 MasterSystem. \u0427\u0442\u043e \u043c\u044b \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c \u0432 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438?

The look got me really interested though, so much that I had to buy the game.\n\nFor me, the style totally carries the game. It just looks awesome. I love the look of the characters and the animations. Being able to change the graphics and music to the original style at will is also pretty neat, not much more though.\n\nSadly, the controls are not as crisp as you would like in a game like this. I heard some people say that it plays exactly like the original, which is probably the reason why. Since I do not have any nostalgic feelings for the game / series that does not really do anything for me. It just makes the game a bit worse.\n\nAlso the \"stun locks\" are not really fun (when they happen to you). When you get hit you get knocked backwards a bit and are invincible for a short time. The same happens with enemies, just without the invincibility. Pretty typical platformer stuff. While you are invincible, you can still get hit and knocked back though, and sometimes you get hit 2-4 times back-to-back and are basically just getting \"tossed\" around. This was extremely bad during the last boss fight, where I got carried from one side of the room to the other regularly, because I missed a hit on the boss. Luckily you do not take extra damage during this, the invincibility is apparently renewed every time you get hit. Still, you basically do not get to play for a few seconds and it just feels bad.\n\nThe character switching is nice and adds a bit of variety to the game. I probably could have done without the bird or fish though. They are pretty same-y, just that one can fly through the air the other through the water.\n\nI'm not a fan of the weird secret doors. A few doors are in spots where it makes sense, others are just completely random.\n\nI can not decide if it's good or bad that it is possible to (accidentally) skip bosses / transformations. I happend to completely miss the Shipwreck level, and subsequently did not fight the Captain Dragon and got transformed into the lion but I still managed to get to the Daimyo Temple (ninja / samurai level) as the mouse. This made things way harder for me than they were supposed to and only after getting the Tasmainian Sword (to change characters at will), was I able to beat the level. Luckily I unlocked the lion at the same time as the bird, otherwise I would have been screwed.\n\nAll in all, the wonky controls and my \"inability\" to find the correct level entrances are not enough for me to not recommend the game, because it just looks soooo good.", "timestamp_created": 1500292326, "timestamp_updated": 1500292653, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33596979": {"recommendationid": "33596979", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037996606", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 660, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499828309}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely remade, exquisite animation and a beautifully arranged soundtrack with live recorded instruments.", "timestamp_created": 1500249527, "timestamp_updated": 1500249527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33595171": {"recommendationid": "33595171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046239614", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500241771}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Your Childhood, REMASTERED[/h1]\n\nI can say without fear of being wrong that this is, by far and large, not only the best remaster of a classic game. It's also perhaps the best of the whole nostalgia gaming wave to date.\n\nIf your age range is around the 40s and you grew up with a Sega Master System then all I have to say is: YES, it IS as good as you remember, it is just as sweet, and the remaster will bring a tear to your eye. The downside, if you have been a gamer this long, however, is this: The game is going to be too short and too easy. While gaming today has gotten a lot more forgiving in several areas, it has grown also more complex and provides richer experiences, so unless you pace yourself and play in hard mode, then you'll probably finish the game in two days tops (even if now you're a busy person).\n\nStill, short as it may be, and easy as it may be, BUY IT. It's worth every penny, and you won't have a sweeter trip down the nostalgia lane.\n\n[b]10/10, want more Sega remakes from Dot Emu and Lizardcube.

Controles sencillos (direcci\u00f3n, salto, disparo, opciones y uso de opciones).\n\nLa \u00fanica pega, que para m\u00ed es bastante molesta, es que no hayan arreglado que cuando te hieren, el mu\u00f1eco queda deshabilitado mientras  que los dem\u00e1s pueden seguir disparandote y moviendose (cierto es que aunque te disparen en este momento, no se reducen la vida, pero es bastante frustrante que no puedas hacer nada hasta que dejen de hacerlo).

I did not know of this game in the past nor played the original version but I did do some research. There are many ways to look at this game and list out the reasons on why it's great solid game, why it's an example to be followed by any developer trying to remaster a game, and why It has some minor issues.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing Soundtrack.\n-Short but well designed areas.\n-Diverse gameplay mechanics throughout all of the character's transformations.\n-Areas are challenging but mostly up to how the player wants to approach it (equipment).\n-Marvelous 2D art and animations.\n-Fair and balanced difficulty curve.\n-The option to swap graphics and sound from remastered to retro on the click of a button.\n-For those looking for a faithful Remaster of the old game. It delivers exactly that.\n-You can be a Wonder Girl too.\n\nWonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap was an enjoyable experience from start to end. It's hard to say what is most captivating, the amazing music or the gorgerous art that sorround the game as a whole. Having the power to see how the game used to look like back in the day makes everything even more impressive. The gameplay it's classic from the original's gaming era, a solid 2D action plataformer. Now while some old games would resort to sometimes exceeded difficulty in order to make the game feel longer, Wonder Boy takes a different step allowing players to take on the challenge head on or slowing down and getting some gold to buy equipment to overcome difficult obstacles. Skillful gameplay is rewarded but the game will not pose as a hassle for those who just want to play through a more relaxing experience.\n\nIt's important not to forget though that this is a pretty faithful Remaster of its predecessor and the game does present the player with challenges that cannot be 'worked around', some of these challenges can get quite frustrating due to some old game quirks that the game has.\n\nCons:\n-Player character got some heavy physics applied to movement, which does not go well with some areas that require precision plataforming.\n-Some secrets require a guide or a lot of trial and error to be found.\n-Hard mode can sometimes be a bit too RNG dependant.\n-Simplistic story.\n\nNote that most of the criticism made here related to the gameplay apply mostly to optional areas and content, some of those might be frustrating for the reasons that were listed but they can be seen by nothing more than another challenge to be overcome with practice and dedication. As I mentioned previously, this is a very faithful Remaster of it's predecessor, In terms of Story it is just a reflection of the original game, back in Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap from 1989 you were the Wonder Boy (or Girl) who journeys across the land defeating dragons in order to remove his or her curse, in this game it's no different.\nWhen it comes to Hard Mode the very beggining can feel sometimes unfair, but just like the normal difficulty, skillful gameplay is rewarded even though RNG can be against you sometimes in terms of health drops. It's important to say that the RNG can be somewhat countered by just knowing the areas well and by planning your actions carefully.\n\nOverall Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is a marvelous game that brought a classic back to life with beautiful graphics and animations, a great soundtrack and solid gameplay. For fans of the original game this is definitely a must without a doubt. For those who never played the original one before it's an amazing experience especially if you like the retro gameplay vibe or just plataformers in general. Definitely one of the best retro remakes I've ever seen and lucky are those who find this gem and become the Wonder Boy or Girl to defeat the dragons and free themselves from their (not so horrible) curse!", "timestamp_created": 1499139909, "timestamp_updated": 1499140970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579243", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33200888": {"recommendationid": "33200888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026783150", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 987, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504151564}, "language": "english", "review": "When this game popped up in my discovery queue, i squealed with delight. I thought it was too good to be true that a remake of a forgotten gem like this had been made, and the nostalgia started hitting me harder than a steam train.

However, unlike the numerous other remakes out there, the fresh coat of paint doesn't feel forced in the slightest, and feels true to the original.\n\nSpeaking of that fresh coat of paint, the hand-drawn animations and the remixed soundtrack are just breathtaking, and the amount of heart, love and care put into each detail is clear to see. For fans of this old series such as myself, it can leave you hungry for more, and this is a game i will likely keep replaying to experience it all over again.\n\nFor those of you who haven't heard of the Wonder Boy series before, this is possibly the best starting point.

Both the graphics and the music are incredibly well done. You can switch at will between the retro and modern version of the game, anytime while you\u2019re playing (sound and graphics independently), so while I never played the original game before, it seems the original gameplay was left intact.\n\nSpeaking of the gameplay, special mention for the 2D artist ! He managed to give life to the original animations, without touching the gameplay : in retro mode, when the player is walking it\u2019s ok, but when he stops, while the animation stand still the player is still advancing a bit due to inertia, making him looks slipping. In the modern mode tough, the animations, while still using the same inertia, makes it looks natural. I especially like when the player walks in a direction and suddenly changes to the opposite direction because in that case the player is doing a new special animation. Whoa, I\u2019m impressed. It must have been a little nightmare to make all these player\u2019s animations looks natural while syncing them with the original gameplay.\n\nPlenty of details, subtle or not, are making the game better. For instance, if you\u2019re paying close attention to the graphics in the modern mode, you could have a hint of the existence of a hidden door somewhere, while in retro mode there\u2019s no hint.\n\nIt was a pleasure to play this game. My 2 sons (13 and 9) are loving it too (in easy difficulty), which show that this game, despite old, has still its place in this days and age now, thanks to this remake.\n\nGood job !", "timestamp_created": 1498851046, "timestamp_updated": 1498851130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.661335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33049976": {"recommendationid": "33049976", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995369485", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498846560}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little adventure.

Per questo i responsabili di questo remake hanno fatto la cosa giusta: lasciarlo quasi esattamente com'era, rimuovendo gli unici piccoli aspetti irritanti (le pietre del carisma) e aggiungendo dei brevi dungeon opzionali, che comunque si inseriscono perfettamente in una struttura di quasi 30 anni prima.\n\nIl nuovo comparto audiovisivo \u00e8 in una parola eccellente, e il nuovo stile dell'illustratore Ben Fiquet si addice molto al buffo mondo di Monsterland; stesso discorso per le BGM rifatte con una moltitudine di strumenti per un effetto molto accattivante e in linea con lo stile \"comico/epico\" che gli 8bit e le chiptune non avrebbero potuto rendere a pieno. Per i nostalgici, comunque, c'\u00e8 la bellissima idea di \"switchare\" al volo la grafica e sonoro con quelli originari e anche di mischiarli tra loro (es. chiptune con grafica disegnata a mano), un'idea che spero venga adottata da tutti i futuri remake di giochi del passato. \n\nHo letto di gente lamentarsi perch\u00e9 il gioco \u00e8 \"troppo uguale\" al suo antenato, ma oltre ad essere

Every element of the original game is recreated, but feels entirely accurate.\n\nWonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap was easily one of the top games on the Master System and Game Gear, but it's age shows at parts, particularly with the hit detection, level layouts and bosses. Newcomers may be very offput by these, but failure is not punished too hard and the game itself is rather short (should take 5 to 7 hours for a first playthrough). The game has no leveling system but does have increasingly better gear that can be purchased or found. Enemy designs and their colors clue how strong they are and are used as a hint of sorts to the player to travel elsewhere; Harder monsters naturally give better money and loot too, so although prices for swords and armor increases it never feels as if there is a need to 'grind', but players could choose to do so anyways. \n\nA crazy amount of effort was applied to make this remake look like a cartoon in motion, and they absolutely succeeded. It is one of the best looking hand drawn games out there and in no way feels cheap like most other modern 2D games do. Personally, I was initially extremely negative of the new aesthetics in terms of art and musical direction upon it's reveal, but it has all grown on me. The new animations add a lot of personality to the world but also help the player better understand the character momentum and where to go to next, It is more than well designed, it is clever!\n\nThe original visuals, sound and music are still included in this game though and can be swapped between without even having to pause.

Foi s\u00f3 com o passar do tempo que eu descobri sobre a s\u00e9rie Wonder Boy e as suas ra\u00edzes - mas desde aquela velha experi\u00eancia com aquele velho cartucho eu me tornei um f\u00e3 da forma livre e n\u00e3o-linear que ele apresentava seu mundo, o que era algo completamente diferente de tudo que eu tinha jogado at\u00e9 ent\u00e3o. Foi minha primeira experi\u00eancia com algo parecido a um action-RPG, e at\u00e9 hoje eu considero um padr\u00e3o de como fazer jogos com uma estrutura viciante.\n\nWonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap \u00e9 um excelente jogo pra quem quer relembrar mem\u00f3rias da inf\u00e2ncia - e se divertir tanto como naquela \u00e9poca. Com um design t\u00e3o s\u00f3lido que faz um jogo que \u00e9 essencialmente de 28 anos atr\u00e1s ser divertido ainda hoje, n\u00e3o tem como negar que \u00e9 um cl\u00e1ssico.", "timestamp_created": 1497893947, "timestamp_updated": 1497893947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613607", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32569342": {"recommendationid": "32569342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091545265", "num_games_owned": 608, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498380000}, "language": "swedish", "review": "A wonderful game which still has the feeling of the original.

In all honesty I'd almost forgotten about the game ever existing until it popped up on Steam. This modern remake brings back so many memories and feelings. Wonderboy is up there with the likes of Sonic, Mario, Tetris, Bomberman, Zelda and other classics. This game is a must play for boys n girls who grew up playing games in the late 80s and 90s. The Wonderboy Series is a series of games that all gamers should experience from that era. I hope they remake the other games from the series in the same style. This isn't a diverse RPG in the Final Fantasy sense nor is it a complete platformer like Mario it takes bits and pieces from both types of game genres... be warned it only has very minor roleplay elements this is not like Phantasy Star or Zelda.\n\nThis is essentially a platforming adventure where by you the hero who is cursed by a Dragon, you must quest through platform style levels and beat various bosses using your skills and occasionally visiting the village to buy upgrades to find a way to turn you back into a human. Sure you have a shield, a sword and some abilities but the mechanics are all about timing, jumping and dodging rather than stats and spells.\n \nI played Wonder Boy The Dragons Trap in the 90s on my Sega Gamegear as a kid. I remember it being a very hard game and I remember it being unique as not many games are both an rpg and a platformer. That said the rpg elements are the story and shops there's no character building or skill trees the mechanics are jump, dodge and attack as I mentioned before. Just think Legend of Zelda from the SNES but in a 2D platform style rather than overhead birds eye view and you have Wonderboy.\n\nI'm not sure if I ever completed it back in the day but I remembered the Lionman and the Birdman forms when I watched the Steam trailer and was sold on the brand new graphics and art style.\n\nThe developer has made this game look and run fantastically whilst keeping the retro feel, it feels like a 90s game not a game from 2017. Many remakes or retro remakes suffer from trying to incorporate modern gaming too much but bar a few fixes and tweaks this is the original Dragons Trap with new age sprites and great graphical design. The original game had very hard difficulty and relied on password generated saves meaning you often had to complete certain areas of the game over and over upon loading up a save. Luckily this modern version has had the difficulty balanced out and the password system is replaced with modern save data. For some reason which is cool I guess you can use your 90s passcode if you want to load up an old character.\n\nThere aren't many retro remakes that stay true to the original game but this one does very well. It runs on my work PC just as well as my gaming PC so onboard graphics users will be able to run it. \n\nYou still jump around platforms, explore rooms, slash enemies and feel like your playing a 90s games even with the new artist style and design. The boss mechanics are the same as they were back in the day so most of the difficulty comes from the levels themselves once you determine the boss movement patterns. Finding the secret rooms, heart pieces and collecting gold for weapon and armour upgrades and finishing hidden areas are the main challenges... do you want to just complete the game or are you the type of gamer that has to get every item and unlock as Dragons Trap offers that.\n\nIf you wish you can even flip between modern day/old skool sounds and graphics with the press of a key which is a cool feature but to be honest you'll bore of that pretty quickly it's just a quirk. \n\nTo sum this game up it is a tweak/reskin of the old game 100% with nothing new in terms of gameplay features and content just subtle improvements.\n\nThe Dragon's Trap plays like the original, feels like the original and the difficulty and annoying bugs of the time have been fixed or updated to improve the experience. This is a retro kids wet dream! \n\nOverall I would say there is about 4 or 5 hours max game time involved to complete from start to finish if you really go at it in one session. If like me you do it in 20 minute sessions you might get a lot more satisfaction out of it and for some players they may wish to find every secret room.\n\nThe price is a little a bit expensive... once you've completed the game I can imagine you may not play through it again for a long time and I don't expect the developer to add DLC or new levels... but who knows!\n\nGamepad is supported but keyboard play is fine.", "timestamp_created": 1497878326, "timestamp_updated": 1499068103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32556032": {"recommendationid": "32556032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059588669", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 793, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507955207}, "language": "english", "review": "Didn't have the chance to play the original back in the day but this remake is truly remarkable.

The amount of love that went into this, just the fact that it exists make me happy to pay for it.\n\nThat makes it kind of impossible to review this from the point of view of someone who never played it before. For me its a big hit of nostalgia wrapped up in beautiful new graphics and music, but I can't really say how the gameplay holds up to modern standards. But something about it kept me coming back every now and then over the years, its just simple fun I guess. An action rpg stripped down to its basic elements. \n\nIf you are a fan of the old 8 bit version and were hoping to get something more than the original adventure, well, there is a hard-mode and some extra little challenges to find. I would have liked more than that if i'm honest. As a kid I used to imagine all the places that might be hidden out of reach, up in the sky or behind secret doors and suspicious walls. Thats just me being greedy I guess. Games like this train you to always expect more from them.\n\nSo anyway, I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original, or is interested in the history of metroidvania style games. And I'd also like to thank the artists and developers for doing such an amazing job updating the sights and sounds.", "timestamp_created": 1497721270, "timestamp_updated": 1497721270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32503353": {"recommendationid": "32503353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088579864", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499019491}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderboy: The Dragon's Trap is literally the template to which all other remaster/remakes should aspire to.  You have the option to play it in its original 8-bit Sega Master System 1989 audio & visual glory, or opt for hand drawn, cartoon style graphics and full orchestral audio. Alternatively, you can mix and match.  On the fly.  ON THE FLY!!\n\nAnyway, for those of you who have never played the Wonderboy series (this was the third installment), the game puts you at the end of Wonderboy 2 (Wonderboy in Monster Land) where you are about to enter the dragon's castle.  BE WARNED, there are spoilers regarding the end of Wonderboy in Monster Land ahead! lol\n\nCharging into the castle to take on the dragon, you must navigate a certain way to be able to reach the dragon's lair.  The maze from Wonderboy in Monster Land has been simplified to essentially the first and last section, meaning you don't have to scale the annoying chimney section with moving platforms - hurrah! Additionally, you don't have to fight the dragon to uncover the truth - you're straight into a fight with the Mecha Dragon! Defeating the dragon obviously doesn't end the game or teleport you back to Monster Land, either. It unleaches the dragon's spirit, which on contact turns you into Lizard-Man.  You have to escape the now crumbling castle!\n\nLizardcube have totally aced this remaster/remake. The new graphics are simply gorgeous, the animation is smooth, and the fully orchestrated soundtrack brings the original 8-bit version into the 21st century in spectacular fashion, while staying true to the original tunes.  The re-vamped audio and visuals add layers of additional atmosphere to the game, while keeping it instantly recognisable to the original.\n\nThere are several wonderful touches to this game, from the simply sublime ability to change the audio and visuals from 8-bit to modern with the press of a button - you don't even need to pause the game to do it! - to the fact that if you still have a notepad of the original master system game save codes, you can use these to continue where you left of 22 years ago!\n\nThis game first released on Xbox One, and I bought it on day one, as I'm a MASSIVE fan of the Wonderboy series.  When I learned it was coming to Steam, I wishlisted it, and bought it for PC on the day it was released too.  If they released it for Nintendo DS and Wii, I'd buy it for those too.  That's how good it is.\n\nThe addition of hard mode, and additional things once you complete the game (no spoilers here!), are welcome additions for new players and old alike, and the price point is, I think, spot on for this title.  Sure you can complete it on easy in an hour, but then you can play on normal, then hard and so on.  My general rule is that if I can pay around \u00a35/hour of game play, I'm happy that I've got value for money.  I know I'm going to get WAY more that that amount of value in this game, without a doubt.\n\nNow I'm hoping on a remake of Wonderboy, Wonderboy In Monster Land, Wonderboy III: Monster Lair, Wonderboy in Monster World and and Monster World IV.  *Sigh* I can only hope.", "timestamp_created": 1497703189, "timestamp_updated": 1497703189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0,

The original was a classic that stood out in my childhood.\nI have played this game twice, in full retro and full remix mode. 100% achievements etc etc.\n\n\nClassic/Retro graphic/audio Mode Specific Notes:\nI've played through this game in the \"Classic\" Retro graphics/Audio, and am astounded how it was virtually identical to my experience on the Master System so many years ago. With exception to changes to how some of the deeper unlocks of \"Charms Stones\" work, and some added secrets to the game. The only issue i had, was that the item screens and menus were not retro (like the inventory/pause screens. All stores in the game looked original). It was pretty well streamlined. Though, the ending was probably the most altered. The classic WB had one of my favorite credit sequences ever, and this one was not as good in my opinion. Missed lots of the retro fancy effects. But was still the same music and decent overall. switching both music and graphics to retro independantly at the push of a button was pretty seamless and had great effect. very impressed. There were various options for adding scanlines and altering audio for the different 8 bit experiences the old school players would have experienced.\n\nRemix/Original \"New\" mode specific Notes:\nThe art style was a lot of fun. Very animated and a great homage to the original series. Lot's of artistic license with the look and sound of everything. Entirely respectful to the core material in my opinion though. Lot's of added dialogue with store keepers, excellent animations etc. The only issues I had were:\n- Occasionallly, things got too dark. Not enough to heavily impact gameplay, but noticeable. There are parts of the game where all rooms are entirely dark, and the interactable objects also became dark and hard to see at times. This includes projectiles (Shurikens and fireballs mostly), this actually affected gameplay and made it a bit more difficult, though overall it was a nice asthetic that didn't really impact negatively too much at all.\n- The audio overall was not quite as iconic. It was great to hear direct remixes, and a lot of it was great. However, at many times rather than feeling the beat and impact, things sounded heavy on reverb or an overall sense of echo or muted. Again, not terrible and worth a listen, but not as iconic. It loses some of the action momentum as a result. When tension rises in gameplay, the music does not always follow in kind like the original score did. Though i heavily appreciate how deep and wonderful the music was. Fully composed with real instruments, it is an experience to be hold even with those caveats.\n\nThe game itself, regardless of Retro/Remix visuals/audio:\n- Just wow. The gameplay is identical in both modes, yet feels different given the insane amount of animation in the remix. Actually had to adjust how i played, purely on asthetic, as i had to learn the new animations and recognize the new timing based on animations.\n- You can switch between Wonderboy and Wondergirl modes. including changes to the openings/endings and character specific mentions in the story. Very impressive, and totally welcome.\n- There has been an added \"Hard\" mode, that adds a timer to gameplay. Take too long, and you take damage. I normally hate timers in games, as i love to explore, but this was entirely manageable, and i didn't feel too rushed. You could still farm out hearts, and if you were too worried, you could go hunt down potions to ensure you wouldn't die too quickly. In particular, some boss battles can be extra long with the extra survivability of bosses, and a lack of being able to pick up hearts, so those ended up being more difficult, but in a good way i think. required more prep and being \"ready\", but not at all terribly difficult.\n- Fantastic action/RPG gameplay. most RPG aspects come in the form of aquiring weapons/armor and equiping them specific for the level or type of character you can have. You basically have access to various \"Animal\" forms, that function differently in the world, and react differently to all the items. That and the open world almost Metroidvania aspect to the world, gives it the RPG feel. There is no leveling system or growth, beyond the aquisition of permanent heart upgrades and equipment aquisition/equipping.\n- Overall, there are a lot of actual changes. The gameplay itself, is nearly perfect carbon copy to the original. But additions to the remix, and actual items of the game are welcome. All items/equipment have updated descriptions, many indicating a lot of the \"Hidden\" effects, or outright adding hidden effects that the original game never had. There are added challenge rooms to aquire Charmstones which are added challenges, that can affect some new item aquisitions and achievement unlocks.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI love what Lizardcube has done with this game. They clearly have love for the original, and have treated the content with respect. Yet they have entirely embraced the remix and been willing to take artistic license and give their own feel to the visual/audio. I admit to having Nostalgia tinted glasses in my review and playing of the game. But I really do think this game captures the original feel, while making this also feel like a modern game that stands the test of time against many modern games of similar type. If you like Platformers and Metroid/Vania type games, there is a lot of meat in this game to devour. If your not into the retro platforming type games, then this is not probably for you. Though even then, this game was always ahead of its time. I reccomend highly. I very much look forward to more games from Lizardcube.", "timestamp_created": 1497661102, "timestamp_updated": 1497661102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32487478": {"recommendationid": "32487478", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968084221", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17, "last_played": 1514121372}, "language": "english", "review": "Where shall I begin?

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nWonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is a classic-style 2D platformer based on the classic Wonderboy games from decades past, released by new Steam developers, Lizardcube.\n\nThe game is most like Wonder Boy in Monsterland, and seems to be attempting to update that title for 2017. You play Wonder Boy (or Wonder Girl -- we have gender equality in gaming now, you know!?), sans skateboard, but equipped with sword and shield, intent on beating the dragon in his castle. I didn't even know dragon's had castles!\n\nI played Wonder Boy and Wonder Boy in Monsterland longer ago than I care to remember. They were good fun, but I remember the parts I liked best were from the first game, with Wonder Boy on his skateboard. I was thus a bit disappointed to see that he's no longer interested in that particular mode of transport. Still, I was interested to see what Lizardcube had done to try to resurrect and modernise this particular classic.\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nGraphics - The graphics are big and colourful, with a setting reminiscent of Wonder Boy in Monsterland. Levels take the classic approach of scrolling painted backgrounds with a layer of floating platforms in front, and the backgrounds look quite lovely in some cases, with a weird colour texture to them similar to a bande dessin\u00e9e. Many of the backgrounds include animated components, such as moving clouds, birds, and the like. These are well done and make a nice addition.\n\nThe protagonist character looks rather personable after the first level and is very well drawn, but it's a shame that the graphics don't change to reflect equipped items. Animations are good: typical of modern 2D platformers, but somewhat limited in number.\n\nThe game has cut scenes to move the story along, with small sections animated on mostly stationary comic-style screens. The art in these is very good, too. There's also a 'retro' graphics mode available from the options menu, which puts the game into a mode reminiscent of the first Wonder Boy on a 16-colour system (I think). It's very well done and really does look 'right'.\n\nGraphics options are limited to windowed/full screen, and various options to do with frame rate, vsync, and resolution. There are no detail or similar settings.\n\nSound - The music is instrumental with a renaissance-style feel to it, and fits the game perfectly. Some of the tracks may be from the original games; I can't remember. In any case, the style is a great choice.\n\nSound effects are appropriate for a 2D platformer. They're well balanced, but not especially good or bad.\n\nAs with the graphics, there are 'retro' sound effect and music options, which are good for a laugh, or for real fans of chiptunes I suppose. I turned them on for a couple of minutes, but then I'd had enough and disabled the options again.\n\nThere are no voices.\n\nGameplay - No one should be surprised to learn that Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap plays like a traditional 2D platformer. It supports keyboard or controller. I didn't bother with the keyboard as the default controller support is fine.\n\nThe game includes controls and actions typical of the genre. You can jump, duck, move left and right, enter doors, fire or attack, and, if your character has a shield, block an incoming attack. You can also pick up a number of single-use weapons, such as boomerangs and fireballs, and throw these at your foes. You can equip one sword, one shield, and one suit of armour, all of which you can buy at shops that you discover on your adventure with coins that you pick up from defeated enemies, or find in chests. And you have a certain number of hearts, which are reduced with hits from enemies (at a rate I haven't quite worked out yet), and can be restored by picking up little hearts that occasionally drop from defeated enemies as well. If you're lucky, too, you'll find a potion, which restores you to full health (minus one hit) when you die.\n\nThe first level is essentially an introduction to the story, and I shouldn't be ruining too much of the plot by saying that after this level, your chosen character -- Wonder Boy or Wonder Girl -- is largely irrelevant. The game is divided into areas, with a dragon of a certain type guarding the end of each. Kill the dragon and you are transformed into a different character, sometimes with a special ability that allows you to reach previously unreachable areas. This gradual progression through a number of different bodies is an interesting twist on the old formula.\n\nAnother diversion from the classic formula is the use of a sort of 'home' area -- the village -- to which you keep returning, time, after time, after time. This leads to a game that becomes hugely repetitive very quickly, as taking the wrong exit from a screen can end up with you back at the village again, spending ages backtracking to continue from where you were. And you have no idea until you take an exit just where you'll end up, leading to considerable frustration on occasion.\n\nLevel design is mostly unremarkable and sometimes even lazy. Most screens include enemies that respawn if you leave and re-enter, which is not a design feature I enjoy. This is made worse still by the need to cover so much ground multiple times, due to being unceremoniously deposited back at the village over and over again. This seems like an attempt to increase play time artificially by forcing the player to redo sections multiple times.\n\nOther disappointments include the one-use inventory items, which are a bit rubbish, and some poor grammar, which seems to be the norm in most games these days. Probably the biggest issue is that the game just isn't as much fun to play as I expected it to be. Controls are quite slow and unresponsive, with some characters more than others. However, with all characters I found inertia too strong and friction too low, making negotiating jumps or attacking groups of creatures harder than it should be.\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nPros:\n+ It's Wonder Boy, risen from the grave!\n+ Graphics are nice, with a convincing retro mode (if you like that sort of thing)\n+ Multiple character 'forms' to play with (but you can't choose)\n+ Steam Achievements and Trading Cards\n\nCons:\n- Controls feel slippery and a bit unresponsive\n- Often poor and very repetitive level design\n\n[h1]==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================[/h1]\nWonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is a reasonable two-dimensional platformer in the traditional style that does some justice to one of the genre's classic retro series. It has some problems, but if you don't mind retracing your steps more than you should need to, and aren't prone to fits of controller abuse, it should suffice to scratch a platforming itch.\n\n[h1]7/10[/h1]\n\n[code]For more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/10405952/]here[/url]![/code]", "timestamp_created": 1497605942, "timestamp_updated": 1497606114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32464983": {"recommendationid": "32464983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077157970", "num_games_owned": 1321, "num_reviews": 97, "playtime_forever": 794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497137738}, "language": "spanish", "review": "[h1] Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap - Review[/h1] \n\nWonder Boy: The Dragon\u2019s Trap nos recuerda que no todos los Remake son necesariamente malos, tambi\u00e9n existen algunos que para nuestra sorpresa, pueden hacer las cosas bien, sin arruinar toda una vida de legado. A fin de cuentas, The Dragon\u2019s Trap se mantiene fiel a sus or\u00edgenes, pero con unos ligeros retoques que lo adaptan a los tiempos que corren. En lo jugable no ha cambiado en lo m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo, lo mismo se aplica al contenido en general. La mayor virtud viene de su acabado visual, con una est\u00e9tica simplemente asombrosa, hasta tal punto que luce como una pintura en movimiento. \nEso no es todo, para los m\u00e1s nost\u00e1lgicos siempre se podr\u00e1 presionar una tecla y jugar en su estado original, con esa exquisita humildad visual que predominaba en los 80-90. \n\nSin mucho m\u00e1s por agregar, The Dragon\u2019s Trap es una asignatura pendiente para todo seguidor de Wonder Boy y una obra de arte que acaba de ser inmortalizada.

The fact you can seemlesly switch between the old style graphics and the new ones make this game a polished bit of nostalgia, and there ain't nothing that can beat that. \n\n\nThe Music is well written and fits the theme perfectly. I'll be snap buying the OST. It has that wonderful feeling that has you bouncing along with some of the happier music and has you on edge with some of the dungeon music. I'm look at you wrcked ship.... Oh and the most important thing, the RETRO sound track? IT SOUNDS GOOD! Anyone played the ghastly abomination on the 360 that was called SplatterHouse 3 , the retro games in the CD sounded FUGGIN HORRIBLE! It ruined everthing, THis game? This game does it right.\n\n\nThe Gameplay is a bit of a double edge sword, i couldn't put this in the con's because to me, it makes the game that much more nolstagic. Swinging your weapon and the timing can be a little irratating and you will find yourself taking \"stupid\" damage . The platforming is a little, well.. Airy? It can be hard to land on some platforms, in some areas but that just takes a little time to get used to the controles.  It holds that retro feel though, and I like!\n\n\nThe story? Your a guy getting cursed by a dragon , the story given here isn't no Works by Stephen King or some epic tail like a Square-Enix game, you just got a cut and dry simple story. You are a dragon slayer, go do your job. You have a little coloful interactions with the shop keepers and nurses, so long as you play with the new graphics rather then the retro.  \n\n\nAll and all, the game is great for what it is, a old gem taken out, given a fresh polish and cleaned up nice.

Todo o cen\u00e1rio reimaginado, a fluidez das anima\u00e7\u00f5es, os personagens carismaticos. Apenas indescrit\u00edvel, basta ver as imagens para se ter uma id\u00e9ia de como \u00e9 o jogo todo.

Ainda sim, mesmo nos dias de hoje, s\u00e3o controles bem simples de se aprender.\n\nHist\u00f3ria: 8/10.

As a result, I have a TON of nostalgia for this game, and I loved it back then. As a remake, it's expected to meet the standards of the original game, while also offering a bit more to give you more bank for your buck, as most solid remakes give. So does The Dragon's Trap live up to the original?\n\nStory\n====\nThis game is a direct Sequel to Wonderboy in Monster Land. After the journey, Shion confronts the dreaded Meka Dragon and defeats him; however upon striking down the Meka Dragon, he is inflicted with a curse, transforming him into a dragon. Shion must now travel and journey through Monster Land, striking down more dragons to eventually cure himself of this curse to return himself to being human.\n\nGraphics\n======\nThis is a case where the devs went above and beyond. The game features HD, beautiful designed graphics that are amazing to look at and view. They designed so many awesome animations and truly fleshed out how they thought things looked (details like Hawk Man leaping like a bird for his movement is an amazing touch). But, if you feel homesick for the original Sega Master System graphics, don't fear; hitting Right Back Trigger allows you to switch between Retro Graphics and Modern Graphics.\n\nGameplay\n=======\nGameplay is truly perfectly matched with the original. You get 6 different forms (Dragon, Mouse, Piranha, Lion, Hawk, Human), each with their own different gameplay abilities and functions. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, as well as gain benefits from Swords, Armors and Shields found differently, encouraging you to mix and match to find the best combinations. The gameplay is kept simply, with A jumping, X swinging your sword, Y bringing up your weapon inventory, and B casting magic. Left and Right Shoulder buttons cycle through your magic, and the back shoulder buttons shuffle between Retro Sound and Graphics. It's a nice balance of gameplay. There's also 3 difficulty levels, with Normal being the original game, and easy being a toned back version. However, Hard mode offers in a timer, similar to Wonderboy in Monster Land, adding a new layer of challenge to the original adventure, forcing one to have to rush.\n\nSound\n=====\nMusic is remixed and wonderfully done, all the areas have a distinct remix of the tracks, but once again if you get homesick for the retro sound, you can switch it on. Sound effects are in a similar boat, they all sounds awesome. Downloadable DLC soundtrack is apparently on it's way.\n\nBonus Content\n===========\nSo of course, being a remake, bonus content is a must have, however to keep the guide spoiler free, I will not be telling you what, where or how this stuff is used. There are 6 bonus dungeons to complete; hidden decently well, and an all powerful super sword for clearing at least 5 of them. There is also a gallery containing a ton of concept art, recording of the music and developers, and additional unlocks. It's truly a wealth of content.\n\nOverall, I can Strongly recommend this game. If you're a fan of 2D Platformers, Wonderboy III: The Dragon's Trap is a must play.

The game starts off much as the trailer suggests, a dragon curses you to be.. well.. a dragon. \n\nI am not much of a platformer gamer, I find jumping rather tedious, but I was blown away at the simplistic, while still challenging gameplay. Most of the areas are acessable from the start, with a few exceptions, and the secrets are reasonably well hidden. \n\nThe character models are adorable! I almost melted at the design of the dragon and the lion. The charater in the church is rather quirky as well, and will make quips about your current character, as well as offering hints. The choice to have HD or 8-Bit audio/graphics was a really nice touch as well.\n\nOverall I highly recommend this game to anyone, whether they enjoy platformers or not.

The feeling, the gameplay, the handling, everything else is 100% the same as the original.\n\nFrequently, us older gamers remember classics from when were younger with what can be termed, rose-tinted glasses.

I remember them being better...\" Of course, they were always like that, and, at the time of release, they were top notch. However, these days, we expect a lot more, and old classics like WBIII just don't hold up, graphics wise. Which is a shame, because the gameplay is what made these games great, but the dated graphics are what prevent new players from even trying them. No more.\n\nThis remake literally makes the rose-tinted glasses real. The graphics are amazing, the updated sound, amazing, but the gameplay, the classic gameplay that made this game great. Did. Not.

In fact, I think they even improved on the game a lot.\n\nThe graphics are wonderful with the hand-drawn animations by Ben Fiquet really adding so much value and enjoyment as you play. Your animal forms, the dragon bosses, and all the enemy creatures are all a joy to behold. The backgrounds and even foregrounds provide you with a sense of a world that is populated and rich with lore. It's probably one of the biggest improvements on the original game that I can point to.\n\nThe musical score of the old melodies composed by Shinichi Sakamoto and newly arranged by Michael Geyre are SO good. I loved the old tunes, they're some of my favorite 8-bit pieces, but the new music is, again, so rich, so lovingly made, that it just adds to the experience and tenfolds your enjoyment.\n\nAs an aside, it's always fun to be able to see the old graphics and hear the old music with the press of a button. It really makes for a wonderful trip down memory lane.\n\nMechanically they didn't much touch the game. Combat still requires skill, patience, zeal, and practice. The different animal forms all have their abilities, special skills, and optimal weapon, shield, and armor load-outs. The enemies all have patterns that you need to remember and anticipate. The world is littered with secret doors and events for you to explore. Frankly, the game was already pretty tight so there wasn't much to improve there (though they did, here and there, with new challenges, smoother mechanics, and a slightly more easy going attitude).\n\nAll in all, it's both a blast from the past and a really great new game.

So, when it was announced that it was getting a full-on remake, I was both excited and INCREDIBLY nervous. It's so hard to capture the spirit of the classic while making it accessable to a brand new generation decades later. But the crew behind this really knew exactly what they were doing and made this port live up to and even exceed the original in many ways.\n\nFor those of you that don't know anything about this title, I'll do my best to offer a quick primer. In the story of the game, you are Wonder Boy (or Wonder Girl if you prefer in this version), who is confronting a powerful dragon in its lair. Little do you know that the dragon has the ability to curse people, and upon defeating him, you find yourself transformed into a fire-breathing lizard person and fleeing for your life as the castle crumbles around you. What takes place after is a series of misadventures involving battling new dragons and using their \"curses\" to your advantage as you take new forms to solve puzzles in what could only be described as one of the early \"proto\" Metroidvania titles. \n\nWhile the visual appearance of the original was absolutely astonishing and genuinely could be mistaken for 16-bit instead of 8, the hand-drawn and delicately crafted animation cells of the original bring the visual presentation not only to the modern age, but in some ways, further. Not since Dust: An Elysian Tale have I seen to much love and effort put into the highly crisp and fluid frame-by-frame animations. The backgrounds are gorgeous and incredibly deep, the style of the characters and enemies is incredibly anarchic and has a sort of light-hearted humor about it, while still feeling powerfully dynamic and all those other words from the thesaurus. In a nutshell, it really, REALLY is good.\n\nBut what if you haven't played the original and want to see what it looked like (for the most part)? Not a problem! With literally the push of a single button you can alternate between the updated animation and the original 8-bit graphics on the fly! No menuing or any of that nonsense; one click, you're there. The appearance is not EXACTLY the same (as there were slight GUI changes), but the tileset is pretty much identical.\n\nI feel as though the graphical upgrade of the new version does more than simply give the game an aesthetic facelift; it improves the gameplay itself by giving monsters better \"tells\" for all of their attacks. Even though I'm a fan of old-school difficulty, there are aspects of the original did not age well; and monster attacks having no warning is one of them. With the newer graphics you're given a more reasonable chance to react to new challenges than in the original. Definitely a huge improvement. And even if you'd prefer not to, you still have the OPTION of playing old style if you prefer. And more options are almost ALWAYS a good thing.\n\nThe same applies to the soundtrack. With the push of the button, you can switch between the energetic chiptunes of the SMS original and the updated, remastered versions of the songs and sound effects; independently of the graphical settings. I find that I appreciated the two options being independent of one another because while the new graphics are a slam dunk in my opinion, I feel that the original soundtrack had a little more energy to it and was more enjoyable for me overall. This isn't to say that the new soundtrack is poor by ANY means! Rather, it just felt a little more plodding and lax than an exciting adventure really should have. \n\nThat being said, the fact that you have the option between the two for graphics AND sound, mean that this game does that much more to cater to more people's individual tastes. And the ease in which you can switch means you can fine-tune things just how much you want!\n\nI have one very minor complaint about the graphics, though. Or rather, simply just the addition in general. If you choose to play as Wonder Girl rather than Wonder Boy, only the human forms look different. Since you're almost never going to BE human in the game apart from the beginning, I feel this aspect was kind of a pointless addition. I think it would have been neat to have just a few slight visual differences between the animal genders, like a different color or eyelashes or something. Nothing major; just something to make the different character feel more unique. \n\nThe graphical presentation and GUI weren't the only gameplay improvements this game saw. As I said, not every aspect of the original title was perfect. And to me the absolute WORST thing in the old game was the arbitrary and stupid charisma system; where you could only buy certain items if you had enough charisma. And worse, different forms had different base charisma. You would think that would have been the case to keep you from buying the items too early, but no! The second animal form you receive also has the second-highest charisma. And you can grind for charisma anyway, so there was ultimately no point to it other than to give the middle finger to the lizard-man form. \n\nWell, I'm pleased to say that ALL of that nonsense has been done away with (for the most part). Now, shopkeepers will sell indescriminately and you don't have to grind for what is essentially two different forms of currency at once. Charisma IS still technically in the game, but it's only for a single thing, as far as I can tell. I can easily accept that.\n\nOther improvements include quick-switch between subweapons, slightly better clues for proceeding, and a save feature over the old password system. (Don't fret! If you still want to USE your old passwords; they thought of that, too!) \n\nBut ultimately it comes down to this: LOVE was put into this remake. It was a masterpiece then and it's even more of one now. They did exactly what it took to dust off the (admittedly few) cobwebs and poorly-aged aspects of the original while keeping 100% true to that title's vision. While the game isn't particularly long, it also doesn't overstay its welcome and it's got enough material packed in to give a memorable adventure to old and new gamers alike!", "timestamp_created": 1497195490, "timestamp_updated": 1497196147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614035", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32345519": {"recommendationid": "32345519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057218732", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 56, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497284882}, "language": "italian", "review": "[h1] Un restyling completo dello storico Wonder Boy III, a quasi trent'anni dalla sua pubblicazione..\t[/h1]\n\nIn una parola: [b] S U B L I M E \t[/b].\n\nCredetemi sulla parola, il lavoro svolto dai ragazzi di Lizard Cube \u00e8 veramente encomiabile, ed era da tempo che non rimanevo cos\u00ec affascinato davanti ad un rinnovamento cos\u00ec fresco e vivace di un videogioco ormai datato. Eh si, ormai il caro e vecchio Wonder Boy III  fa parte della storia, un classe 89' che ho avuto modo di giocare per la prima volta tramite un emulatore sul mio primo PC, quindi parliamo di ere geologiche fa. Un platform divertente, abbastanza difficile e stracolmo di segreti, che ti dava la possibilit\u00e0 di poter utilizzare delle trasformazioni sul nostro protagonista, ognuna con delle caratteristiche peculiari che ci permettevano di raggiungere zone altrimenti inaccessibili...Cosa volere di pi\u00f9? Ovviamente un platform del genere sente eccome il peso degli anni, e di sicuro non \u00e8 un gioco particolarmente accessibile, per lo meno al giocatore moderno che predilige videogiochi molto pi\u00f9 dinamici e con molte pi\u00f9 caratteristiche: bisogna quindi entrare nell'ottica giusta e capire che [i] Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap\t[/i] non \u00e8 un gioco per tutti. \nMa sicuramente la nicchia di appassionati al titolo o i nostalgici dei vecchi e tosti platform l'avranno sicuramente acquistato al Day 1, proprio come ho fatto io (in realt\u00e0 era il Day 2, ma sono dettagli), ben consapevoli verso cosa andavano incontro. C'\u00e8 una cosa importante da sottolineare: [b] \u00e8 lo STESSO IDENTICO gioco uscito 28 anni fa sul SEGA Master System, non aspettatevi stravolgimenti di gameplay o quant'altro, perch\u00e8 ne rimarrete delusi (o estasiati, chiaramente). \t[/b] Invece c'\u00e8 stato un completo rinnovamento dal punto di vista estetico, sia nel comparto grafico che in quello sonoro, introducendo all'interno del gioco una bellissima feature che far\u00e0 scendere sicuramente una lacrimuccia ai retrogamer dalla scorza pi\u00f9 dura: con la pressione del trigger destro del pad (l'ho ovviamente giocato con il controller dell'Xbox One) cambierete in tempo reale la grafica, potendo cos\u00ec switchare dal nuovo al vecchio rigiocandolo senza alcun filtro, proprio com'era una volta. E solo questa feature vale il costo del biglietto. Oltretutto i pezzi classici sono stati ri-arrangiati da un'orchestra con un risultato finale letteralmente incredibile: tutti i motivi musicali, da quello del villaggio passando al deserto o alla spiaggia sono orchestrati in modo eccezionale, ma per farla breve, aprite questo link per farvi un'idea del tutto: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1JE-TkYZB0\n\nBella vero? Tornando brevemente al lavoro svolto sul comparto grafico, il gioco \u00e8 interamente disegnato a mano, animazioni incluse (tra i giochi disegnati a mano che aspetto di pi\u00f9 c'\u00e8 anche Cuphead, sperando che non esca tra un secolo...), ed \u00e8 uno spettacolo. Mi rendo conto di aver utilizzato parecchi elogi verso questo titolo, ma quando vale la pena render merito ad un lavoro fatto bene, bisogna farlo senza troppi filtri, lasciando parlare il cuore.

Easily the best video game remake since Bionic Commando Rearmed\n\nDon't you roll your eyes. This ain't your garden variety retro nostalgia. WB:TDT is basically everything we love about retro design. The average Mega Man game doesn't come close to how good WB:TDT is. This is Super Mario World tier, LttP tier, almost Mega Man X tier quality. The only reason we all didn't grow up in Wonder Boy's world is because this came out on the losing system. WB:TDT is so good Shantae pretty much ripped it off wholesale and did not come close to doing it justice.\n\nIt gets this good by starting with a simple formula. It's a basic metroidvania. Find out which way you can go with the power you've got. Find a dungeon, get to the end, beat the boss, come out with a whole new power. The levels are great, each with varying styles and enemy makeups. Without a lot of secrets or collectibles, you aren't stopping to hump every wall in hopes of finding another ammo capsule (Or a wall which you can't bust down until later.). To supplement your arsenal, enemies drop ammo for various sub-weapons randomly, each fulfilling a Castlevania-ish niche, but without the Castlevania-ish \"can only carry one at a time\" limitation. The sort of retro \"find the one pixel invisible block\" nonsense is also kept to the barest minimum, too. The enemy variety is strong (Though the placement does not get as clever as a modern game might) and the bosses are all high points. And if the game gets you down, you can still engage in the old retro tricks of finding the right secret room and farming it for enough resources to make any room a breeze. \n\nAll this means that the pacing is great. The levels are fun and fly by. In fact, everything might go a little TOO fast. You will probably see the end credits in about four hours and you probably won't have too many more hours digging up all the secrets and optional challenges. Sadly, this remake is still accurate to the original in that regard. \n\nNeedless to say, the new art is amazing and the new soundtrack is just as good. And you can swap between each freely at any point while playing just to see how much they improved.\n\nI never played the original WB:TDT, but going into this blind, it charmed me in ways I never predicted.

The biggest emotion I've been seeing from people is \"This is how a remake should be made!\"\n\nLet me tell you my friend, this is how a remake should be made.\n\nThe game itself is not fundamentally different to the original 1989 classic (with a tiny amount of extra content!), and everything you remember from the original will be right here waiting for you. The gameplay has not been tampered with, it is a very faithful adaptation, almost to the point of wondering whether they should have fixed a few pain points with how faithful it is. They've done an incredibly smart thing in allowing you to switch, at will between the original game's visuals, and the new art style built for this remake, and they have even kept the original passcode system (and old passcodes will still work! A save game from 28 years ago will work and let you continue your game on this remake!). Nothing has been removed from this game, and the additions are slight and do not detract from the original experience (for example, you can start as Wonder Girl, instead of Wonder Boy, if you wish. Slightest change, no impact on the gameplay).\n\nBut that is not the reason you should buy this game. The reason you should buy this game is because of how god damn pretty it is.\n\nThe new art style is sumptuous and beautiful, with incredible new vistas to see in the backgrounds. The character designs are all incredibly good elaborations on the original sprites. The level of detail that has gone into these backgrounds is amazing (check the tower in the village - in the top section, you'll find smoked meats hanging!). A lot of these visuals are just inspiring - I suddenly want to know more about the giant grave monument you see in at the start of Mouse Man's area, for example. Every visual in this game is expertly polished and more beautiful for it.\n\nAnd then there's the soundtrack. Being a Sega Master System game, the original had a... minimal soundtrack. This game takes that soundtrack, holds true, and then elaborates on it to give a brand new feel and vibe to every area. What was once the same track for each castle and each boss, is now the same theme, but with different arrangements (The shipwreck castle theme in particular is astonishing in how it completely changes the atmosphere of that level in the best possible way).\n\nAbout the only issue I have with the game is how short it is - If you played the old game and remember where to go, you will probably finish this game in a day or so, and what little extra gameplay has been added to the game isn't enough to give you more than a few hours more play. This is, of course, mainly an issue with the original game itself, not the remake, but if you're looking for something to keep you occupied for a week or so, this is probably not your game.\n\nA hearty recommend for both first-timers and those (like me) who were obsessed with the original. Both will find plenty to like in this remake, that I certainly hope has redefined how to remake these classic games from the original console eras.", "timestamp_created": 1497153163, "timestamp_updated": 1497153163, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792481", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32333423": {"recommendationid": "32333423", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974893913", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 409, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512964044}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like home.", "timestamp_created": 1497152889, "timestamp_updated": 1497152890, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.416121", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32331360": {"recommendationid": "32331360", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967016421", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504324122}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing so far, just a beautiful and joyful game.

It clearly shows how much the devs loved the source material, and it's outstanding how much it still holds up today. \n\nOriginally on the Sega Master System, Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is an action platformer borrowing some of the exploration of Metroid to a simpler extent. The game is the follow-up to Wonder Boy in Monster Land, and it begins with a redux version of the last level of Monster Land. After you beat the first boss, your character is cursed and turned into a monster. You will travel across the land unlocking new abilities and transformations and upgrading your gear to face new challenges.\n\n The new art is beautiful and completely expands on the original. You can toggle between the modern and retro art and sound at will, but the 1989's graphics haven't aged all that well and some color palettes are somewhat jarring.\n\nThe modern art also gives you an advantage on the gameplay, as there are new frames for your walking cycle, as well as attacking, jumping and turning. Once you get used to it, it makes a lot easier to know if your attack will land or if you are about to walk out of the ledge of a platform. Also, as the enemies have new animations as well, it's easier to know when they are about to attack.\n\nThe new soundtrack is great, and there are some amazing remixes to match the level's feel, but some of the original songs are still amazing and can't be that easily replaced, so I've been toggling the music through modern to retro on a lot of more occasions than the graphics.\n\nThe new text on the shops is also really well done, matching the quirky feel of the overall game. It's a love letter to the 1989 original, a great action-RPG with Metroidvania aspects, and a must buy for everyone looking for a fun and rewarding game.", "timestamp_created": 1497116852, "timestamp_updated": 1497116852, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.553481", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32323187": {"recommendationid": "32323187", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987128284", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 90, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497114813}, "language": "english", "review": "I was soooo looking forward to this version of what is my all time favorite game\n\nYou can always play the game in the old version (Which is just plain great)\n\nThis game also has refreshed graphics, which are made in the spirit of the old game\nThe honored people behind this game really salutes the old game, and I love you to death for it\n\nThis is sooooo fun\n\nGranted 20 Euros is a bit steep for a fairly easy game, but for the spirit and the love of the old game, I would pay that gladly.

I am absolutely stunned with admiration!  This game is beyond amazing, in fact, I think there is nothing else like it anywhere right now.  It captures the feel of a well tuned, classic action/rpg platformer, before metroidvania changed the formula (not that either style is bad).  Because you can turn the redrawn graphics, and remixed orchestral live-instrument sound off or on at any point mid-gameplay, it is possible to see exactly what has changed.\n\nMY EXPERIENCE PLAYING TODAY\nToday, I played about half way through the game on the same day I bought it.  This is no surprise since I must have beat the old game nearly a dozen times when I was in my teens, oh so many years ago.  Almost everything is right with this game, and if I wanted someone to understand how side-scroller game design used to have incredibly precise control in a way that is not really seen anymore without burning their eyes out with low resolution graphics, this game stands alone as the one example of how to play a classic without it looking or sounding dated.\n\nTHE FEW FLAWS ARE AS FOLLOWS\nThere is very little that could be improved but I will mention a few, very minor things:\n\nGRAPHICS FLAWS\nThe game appears to be written for 720P (game consoles).  It goes full screen just fine but the graphics are a little bit soft.  I hope the developers consider adding an \"HD\" or \"4K\" graphics pack, so I can see their awesome artwork in all the fine detail possible.  It runs great so there is no reason not to include it.  I am sure they have all the assets to add this and it would be quite the way to immortalize this game.  PC gamers are almost all going to have screens that are 1080P or higher (4k here).\n\nCONTROL FLAWS\nPlease tune the Tiger Man.  Right now, his animation makes it difficult to do precise jumps and I have to switch to the old graphics for challenging jumps and once I land I switch back to the new graphics.  All the other characters are perfect (haven't gotten to Hawk Man, can't comment on that yet).\n\nTHE ORIGINAL MUSIC\nThe new recording is outstanding, but your emulated music sounds practically broken/ruined.  It is missing the bassline, it just sounds like half of the music is missing.  Your new music is fresh and very, very pretty, but the old music is just as good.  Neither are better, just different, and I like what you did with the new music very much.  Unfortunately, someone who plays as it is now wouldn't know that the old music is good too.  Refer to the recordings on YouTube for reference and compare to the way the game plays it now.\n\nEDIT\nMy experience is with the TG16/PC-Engine version, which may have had more sound channels and a richer overall tune.  Perhaps consider adding sound/graphics option to cycle between SMS/TG16/Modern?  That would be amazing!  Anyhow, the link below shows what the original tune is like on the TG16, which is far more rich than what is here otherwise as far as the chip tune goes.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-vD6rIjXrcI2cHZ5RDy-TqW8h3iI4lXp", "timestamp_created": 1497067935, "timestamp_updated": 1497068369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.465337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32307797": {"recommendationid": "32307797", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985236121", "num_games_owned": 1149, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 361, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507266686}, "language": "english", "review": "tl;dr review : Weak recommendation, beautiful graphics and sound, transitionning from updated music/graphics to it's 8bit version and back is one button away /  very short game (same as original SMS/TG16), removed the charm system, high asking price.\n\nPlayed and finished the original on the SMS almost 30 years ago and I enjoyed it. So when I heard the remake was finally being released on steam, I was eager to return to Monsterland.\n\n20$?!? For 2-4 hours of gameplay without replayability? Ouch!\n\nYes the music is awesome and the updated graphics are incredible. No it doesn't get old switching from the new to the old versions of the game on the fly. Yes it a game of the late 80s where you need to figure out where to go )unless you need a walkthough then how dare you! ;-)  ). And then, for us old gamers that still have those old passwords, we can dust them off and play again with that same old playthough. An interesting touch to say the least.\n\nThe flaws of this game? They removed the charms system for one. They are still there as extras (and in one case needed to get one armor) but unlike the originals where, unless you had enough, stores wouldn't sell you items. Another flaw was MouseMan's jumping off blocks is erratic. It was in the original but they could've fixed that. And well, since it is an older game, it's short. I clocked in 4 hours but I could've finished it in 2. I played around collecting all the weapons / shields/ armors/ charms (except mouseman's... gawd that flaw).\n\nMy recommendation : unless you enjoy the nostalgia throwback, wait for a sale. This game is fun to play and is a gem of a remake but the overall length and no real replayability, short of replaying with increased difficulty, makes the current asking price an issue. But then again, if you are a nostalgia freak like me, you already own it.\n\nQuick fact : the old graphics was from the Sega Master System version yet there was one on the Turbo Graphics 16.", "timestamp_created": 1497065983, "timestamp_updated": 1497065983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32307380": {"recommendationid": "32307380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000878346", "num_games_owned": 677, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 390, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498054018}, "language": "english", "review": "Pow!

For starters, just the ability to switch back and forth between the 8 bit version and the updated version at any time during the game is fantastic. The new graphics, all hand drawn, are amazing. One big difference in the game is that you no longer have to switch from gameplay to a menu to use your alternate weapons like arrows, tornados and fireballs and they have also mapped a third button, as opposed to ducking, when firing your alternate weapons. The music is fantastic although what made the original great (especially the TurboGrafx 16 version) was a sense of urgency and this feels a little more relaxed. Another huge difference is that you no longer farm for Charm Stones because there are only six total in the game. Steam achievements have been added and you can also unlock the art library which is great. Not only is the concept art fantastic but they also threw in videos of the musicians recording the sound track. The animation makes this game feel so much smoother than the original 8 or 16 bit versions. The background graphics as well as the ambience really add a sense of depth to this game.

Very fluid transitional and incidental animations, and they really give the characters, well, character.\n\nThe remastered soundtrack is beautiful so far as well. It was recorded with actual instruments, a rare touch in indie games these days that makes the gaming experience that much richer. Either way, it's cheerful and atmospheric.\n\nThe game itself is fun. It feels right for a platformer from 1989. Controls with just the right amount of play in them to force you to plan your play, not just twitch your way through, yet tight enough that you can twitch in a pinch. Difficulty (on normal mode) is challenging, but not unfair. It feels so far like a bit of a Metroidvania style game, with each area I've visited so far teasing towards alternate approaches and secret shortcuts once I've unlocked the right power. You get bumped back to the hub world when you die, which is a little frustrating, but not out of line with how games were made back in the day. No save points for you to crawl your way between \u2014 develop the skill and memory to make it through the long haul!\n\nI look forward to my next session with this game. I highly recommend it to platformer fans and fans of good art and music in games, whether or not you're familiar with the game's pixellated origins.", "timestamp_created": 1497036722, "timestamp_updated": 1497038340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32296958": {"recommendationid": "32296958", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972618912", "num_games_owned": 303, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497291537}, "language": "french", "review": "(better than on Sega master system !!)\n\nBEST PLATFORMER EVER :D\n\n<3<3<3<3\n\n20/20 !!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1497028845, "timestamp_updated": 1497028845, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32296798": {"recommendationid": "32296798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306812990", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509716723}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u753b\u9762\u7cbe\u7f8e\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u53ef\u7231\uff0c\u5267\u60c5\u8001\u5957\uff0c\u5173\u5361\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73a9\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u4e70", "timestamp_created": 1497028456, "timestamp_updated": 1497028456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32296249": {"recommendationid": "32296249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051552750", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512747894}, "language": "french", "review": "Je n'ai aucun mot pour retranscrire le plaisir que j\u2019ai eu \u00e0 rejouer \u00e0 ce jeu !

GOOD. \n\nI grew up with Wonder Boy 3. I was the Sega kid on the block that had the Master System while everyone else had the NES. Wonder Boy 3, along with part 2, Phantasy Star, and several other Master System games formed my ideas about what good game design is. \n\nWonder Boy 3 is still marvelously designed. It's essentially a proto-Metroidvania, where after the introduction you are dropped into a village in the middle of a semi open world. Once you unlock abilities, more areas become available and previous areas will have different routes that lead to secrets. This game rewards experimentation and exploration, especially with the armor and weaponry, which some rarer items have special abilities. \n\nThis is a great game to play in between massive AAA games. The play time will be less than 10 hours and would be a great, refreshing break in between other larger games. \n\nThe art direction is MASTERFUL. The music is great, even though when I was a kid the music always sounded much more \"metal\". The devs decided to give it a more folky vibe with a lot of acoustic instruments and whatnot. Very nice but I still think I prefer the 8 bit tunes. This is all a personal preference though. \n\nThe physics of the game may seem a bit slippy slidy, but you will get used to it. It's nice for a character to actually feel like there is some weight behind them. Also, the option to be Wonder Girl is super cool too. \n\nI really applaud these devs for undertaking this remake.

I knew that guy loved WB3, and wondered if he knew about the project. Imagine my surprise seeing that he was in fact the guy behind the remake.\n\nI've bought a lot of retro remakes (not to be confused with emulated ports) and they're varying degrees faithful to the originals, I don't always like the art style and so on. But this plays true (I believe the original game code is executing in the background, although at 60 FPS rather than 30) and the art is absolutely charming and perfectly fitting. A real labor of love. The ability to switch seamlessly between remake and original graphics and audio is a really nice touch.\n\nShould you buy the game if you have never played the original? Yes - it's a timeless classic. Think of it more as a leisurely platformer than a true RPG though. It's more or less linear, but with a bunch of secrets (including a few new ones) to find. The Hard mode should keep people looking for more of a challenge entertained as the primary game is not that difficult, especially once you gear up.\n\nJust so delighted this game exists.

KLASSE! :)\n\nDie Vielfalt dank der einzelnen Verwandlungen und der R\u00fcstungen, Schwerter und Items macht das Jump'n'Run-Erlebnis gleichzeitig zu einem RolePlayGame in dem man nicht nur geschickt laufen und springen muss sondern auch kleine R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6st und die Welt erkunden muss um weiter vorran zu schreiten.\n\nDer Preis von knapp 20\u20ac scheint im ersten Moment tats\u00e4chlich etwas happig zu sein doch dann als ich das Ergebnis gesehen habe und mich erkundigt hab was alles f\u00fcr Arbeit dahinter steckt, empfinde ich 20\u20ac als genau den richtigen Preis f\u00fcr das was man hier geleistet hat.\nMan hat nicht \"nur\" das Spiel portiert man hat es grafisch und soundtechnisch verbessert aber trotzdem die M\u00f6glichkeit gelassen den alten Look zu behalten...man hat also quasi 2 Spiele in einem. Einmal den \"Port\" bzw. \"Das Orginal\" und einmal \"die sch\u00f6ne Version\" bzw. \"Das Remake\". :)\n\nIn der Gallerie im Hauptmenu schaltet ihr beim Spiel div. Bilder, Zeichnungen, Gifs und Filmchen frei welche unteranderem den Prozess, also das Making-Of, n\u00e4her bringen.\nGrade das hat mir die Augen ge\u00f6ffnet wie viel Arbeit und Liebe darin steckt! \n\nKann es jedem Jump'n'Run-Fan w\u00e4rmstens empfehlen und auch jedem Nostalgie-Fan!\nNeue Gamer wie auch alte Hasen werden hier gleicherma\u00dfen bedient und haben die M\u00f6glichkeit Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap so zu spielen UND zu h\u00f6ren wie sie es m\u00f6chten! :) \n\nWem 20\u20ac doch zu teuer sind sollte sp\u00e4testens im Sale nicht lange fackeln! Doch 20\u20ac f\u00fcr das was die Devs hier fabriziert haben ist nicht nur der Preis f\u00fcr das Spiel sondern auch die Verbeugung vor einem tollen Spielehersteller der mehr h\u00e4lt als er verspricht...sowas muss unterst\u00fctzt werden f\u00fcr weiterhin tolle Games! :)", "timestamp_created": 1497019850, "timestamp_updated": 1497020059, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471010", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32293455": {"recommendationid": "32293455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090588839", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500076252}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Voy a ser sincero, nunca juge su version antigua o retro antes y lo compre el dia que salio como si lo hubiera hecho.\nMe lo vicie durante toda la noche.\nLindo apartado artistico, musica y lo mejor de todo: es que puedes jugar tanto la remasterizazda como la retro al alcance de un solo boton!\nHan pensado en todo para no perderse de nada.\nLo recomiendo muchisimo.", "timestamp_created": 1497019661, "timestamp_updated": 1497019661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32293291": {"recommendationid": "32293291", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065661758", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513342377}, "language": "english", "review": "Overwelming demonstration of what a remake should be.

This one has charm by being able to be picked up and played and still having great depth to it kind of like a Zelda 2.  You explore around Monster Land and discover treasures like any other game.

Somptuous graphics, amazing soundtrack, keeping the simple but powerful gameplay of the original game. Extremely faithful to the original game.\n\nFor those who don't know the original, this mostly a platformer, with some rpg elements (gold/equipment), and an unusual character progression, where each boss fight will transform you in a different character, with totally different skills and characteristics (one is smaller, one can fly, one can break some blocks, etc). Those skills almost always allow you to access new zones in places you already visited, making the world feel really big. It's also full of hidden secrets with really clever level design.\n\nOnly disappointment might be the new hard difficulty, that doesn't really add much to the game. All it does is make you lose a bit of health regularly, which doesn't impact much the game as much as it sounds (as long as you max potions before leaving for a long trip, or know where to farm them on the way).\n\nGame is also very accessible, I'd recommend it at any age. Do not expect a lot of guidance though, even if there's a bit more information than on the original game, you still have to pretty much figure out everything by yourself.\n\nEdit after a bit longer in game: some new zones have been added, and modify one mechanic of the original game (the charm stone one, that was quite obscure originally).

That's why he's called WONDER Boy (or Girl.)\n\nUnlike a number of people reviewing this game, this is my first sojourn into the Dragon's Trap.  I never had a Sega Master System so this review will be done with the viewpoint of someone coming into the game for the first time.\n\nWonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap is one the of first Metroidvanias, even preceding that of the famous Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.  It is the second of the Monster World series (and the third Wonder Boy game) and a direct sequel of the first game, Wonder Boy in Monster Land.  It shares a lot of elements with Symphony and like it, begins right off at the end of another game, in this case: Wonder Boy in Monster Land.  You will also be locked out of certain areas until you cleared a previous one first and gaining an item or ability that enable access.  \n\nWhile Monster Boy in Monster Land was originally an arcade game (and ported to various systems), The Dragon's Trap was a console-only exclusive of the Sega Master System, the Nintendo Entertainment System's direct rival.\n\nFast forward, decades later.  Now we have this, Wonderboy: the Dragon's Trap developed and remade by Lizardcube.  \n\nThe first thing to remember is at it's essence, it still is the same game as the original, meaning it has the typical length of a title of this kind for an 8-bit system.  Thus for anyone unfettered by nostalgic memories of playing the original, even with all its bells and whistles, any expectations of enjoying the length of a typical Metroidvania made in 1997 and beyond will be sorely disappointed.  It took me a few hours to win and only because of the few instances of getting stuck and wandering around before I could figure out what to do next.\n\nI knew all this beforehand, that I was buying an 8-bit SMS title essentially and it was going to be pretty short.  So why did I buy this in the first place?  The wonderful art and the music, that's why!  The aestethics was just that good.  From the minute I saw the trailer, I knew I had to get it.\n\nIf you've been weaned on French style comic books like Asterix, Iznogoud and Ompa-Pa, you'll notice a resemblance in it's rugged detailed style.  The art is wonderful and the game animates like a dream (even on my old outdated laptop), like one of those aformentioned comics coming to life.\n\nThe music still uses the same score created by Shinichi Sakamoto in the SMS version but Lizardcube re-presents these same old tunes to be performed by professional musicians.  No midi tunes or techno, you will hear saxophones, pianos, flutes and more as you traipse all over Monster Land and it sounds glorious.  Like Akumajyou Densetsu (Castlevania 3 Japanese version) which I played for so many hours, it's a joy to re-play this game again and again just to listen to the wonderful music.\n\nI played the first game, Wonder Boy in Monster Land in an Amiga 500 and always wanted to play the sequel.  Now I do and I've never been happier that I waited for so long and end up playing this marvelous remake.", "timestamp_created": 1496926287, "timestamp_updated": 1497446817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.594187", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32266368": {"recommendationid": "32266368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011635427", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 536, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497355171}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome", "timestamp_created": 1496926011, "timestamp_updated": 1496926011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460358", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32266295": {"recommendationid": "32266295", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965077926", "num_games_owned": 456, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497920454}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un clasico de la Master System.

For someone like me, this remake is like a dream come true, that one thing you never actually think was gonna happen but actually does.\n\nGraphics:\n\nIf you've been following the trailers/hype up to release, you'll have noticed that the guys over at LizardCube tried to re-create the game to the best of their ability and I have to say that even though I have a soft-spot for the original graphics (which don't look as bad as I expected at 1080p), the updated visuals look amazingly gorgeous and I find myself swapping between retro and updated on the go because I can't make up my mind about which to keep. The UI in retro mode also got a few tweaks and looks much cooler now.\n\nMusic: \n\nStarting with nostalgia again, they have kept everything from the original game, both sound effects and music and when I started playing, which I did with new GFX + retro sounds, it just felt like I was a kid again playing on my Game Gear. Then I went for old GFX +new sounds and music and was amazed at how well it fits. It's almost like playing an orchestral score of the original, considering all the variety of instruments used. I'd love to see an OST released for this, would buy it asap.\n\nGameplay:\n\nWhether you play with the old or new GFX, the gameplay is identical as the original game you know and love (with the momentum slide when you stop moving too). If you're not acquainted with the gameplay of the original, think NES Zelda 2, but with good control and better graphics. It's a 2D platformer with light RPG mechanics (equipment, spellcasting - that you gather as drops as you explore the world and kill monsters), but the true meat of the game is its overworld. It's almost like a Metroidvania but not quite. There is a central hub-town you start at that you can explore more and more depending on which monster form you happen to be at the moment. The new parts you get access to will lead you to new areas where you will eventually enter a dungeon and face a new dragon. The controls are responsive and the character does what you ask it to when you ask it to. Just like in the original :P\n\nPlot:\n\nA dragon screwed and cursed you. Now you will get your revenge... and murder his entire family in the process. Ok, maybe it's not quite like that but close enough!\n\nOther notes:\n\nI love the added humor in new GFX mode. Fits the light tone of the game like a glove. I also love that touch of being able to change the title screen from Wonder Boy to Wonder Girl by pressing A on it.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'll give this game a very strong thumbs up.

The backgrounds are really comfy. Being able to switch between the retro audio and visuals with a single button press anywhere in the game is a cool feature, and the FM Synth is also a nice add.\n\nAll in all it's a fun game and I recommend it.

Which is great, because you can jump straight back to retro style immediately, and reuse your old save codes.  It also has secrets. Actual secrets. The kind you wouldn't be able to find without a walkthrough, trying everything, or by complete accident.  It can be slightly infuriating at times with the same stupid enemy knocking you off that one platform, but that's just the old-school charm.\n\nMy only real complaint is because its an old game, some sections and powers feel like you hardly get to use them at all before they are never needed again.  This is more a criticism of the base material, but it feels like powers were mostly about letting you access certain zones, and their individual special mechanics weren't needed much beyond that.  I don't see how the sunken ship is enhanced by being a piranha-man other than needing it to board.\n\nBut again, those complaints are mostly to do with the base game, and not with the remake.  Its a rather excellent remake, keeping the visuals and music close to their source material while still rendering them in HD if you want them, and even makes a point of deliberately leaving in typographical errors.

I originally played all of these games on my MacBook, purchased via the Apple app store, and I loved them.  I think they are showing their age now, but when they came out, they were very impressive, and I still enjoy them a great deal.  I am someone who likes to replay games over and over, as I find it relaxing, and these three never fail to provide an hour or two of entertaining relaxation.  However, my MacBook is very near death and has not yet been replaced, so I decided to purchase these items through Steam for my desktop PC.  I have only played through Broken Tune so far, so I do not know if the other two games have the same issue, but Broken Tune was missing the voice acting for the scene where you find the journalist and the final scene where you confront the clown.  The characters look like they are talking and the captions show what they are saying, but you cannot hear them speaking.  It's not like having the voice acting is absolutely necessary to play the game, but I am annoyed that the game is not complete, particularly since there are only three scenes with voice acting in the entire game (the voiceover in the very beginning explaining the mission played without issue).  \n\nLong story short: these are great games, I wish the bundle had the bonus chapters that come with the collector's editions, and I had a minor issue with voiceovers in the first game.

I can recall some old school games looking similar. reminded me of claymation. \n\nI also like that some items within the game don't just function the first time you click on them and use it for a puzzle or item you need to move forward.  \n\nI don't want to spoil it for others with specfics but if you play them you will see what I mean. \nThere may be no purpose for this other then the sheer amusement that I can use said items again to see something turn on or move.\n\nThe HOGs are pretty simple but I even like how the clicking on an item feels and the sound that it makes when I click on it.  I don't always mind simple HOGs as I play these games to relax and even with this semi twisted ( in a good way) feel of over all look of the game I find myself feeling very calm and happy to play, lol.\n\nThe puzzles aren't mind blowing difficult. however you may spend a bit more time at to get the proper sequence to solve it.  I think this game works best for those who aren't looking for mind splitting hogs and puzzles or super in depth storyline but can enjoy what this game has to offer because the atomsphere and finding out where you end up next is fun in itself.\n\nAs a lot of current games like this contain maps so we can travel more easily from place to place this does not but I find myself not minding that at all here. \nAdmittedly in some casual games I really don't like when they don't include this feature as an option but in some games it's not so bad.\n\nIf you really can't remember what to do or where to go next you can use the hint function enough to where you can find out where you want to go without giving away what you need to do so it's not so bad.\n\nI like the atmospheric sounds in this game as well and I even keep the music on as it's not to intruding on my senses and adds to the overall atmosphere of the game where as in many causal games I usually end up playing with the music off because the music is less then desirable. \n\n( side note: the exception is blue tea's Dark Parables series 1-8, the music and the games themselves are really beautiful, one of my favorites - while I already have those games from purchase at a non steam place had to mention it somewhere, lol.  take note that the series continued on with 4 more games however another company did  9-12 and they just can't compare with the first 8 in the series.  I mention this series because while they are different from Weird Park Trilogy it has the same dark twisted but fairytale feel to it, though they really are different style of games.)\n\nThis is what you would call a Standard Edition so don't expect extras like in game achievements\n ( also as far as I can tell no steam achievements for these either if that's your thing) however for an SE the first game was pretty long and I can't tell you yet how long the other two are since I haven't finished them yet but I think they all will be at least the standard amount of game time for this type of game.\n\nBe sure to play them in order if you get the Triology, trust me they all go together.\n\nso how many of you looked up coulrophobia? ;p\nCheers~\n\nupdated:  Finished all three.  I think the first two were my favorite out of all three.  not that I didnt' l ike the 3rd however I did run into a weird message at times, as if they hadn't completed some text in the game - if you play you will see what I mean.  small thing though, doesn't interfer with game or the enjoyment to play.\nthe 3rd game is like a CE version, it comes with achievments, map, extras. you can collect/find candy canes to buy 'upgrades'.  \n\nall three seem to be a very nice length for this kind of game. honestly everytime I thought I may be close to the end more things came up for me to do. all have really nice animation and graphics, fun puzzles and more.", "timestamp_created": 1483339377, "timestamp_updated": 1483834817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26757369": {"recommendationid": "26757369", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960986989", "num_games_owned": 130, "num_reviews": 138, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442872608}, "language": "english", "review": "Expected good storytelling and good puzzles.

And no annoying misclick penalty on Casual mode! (Don't know about Expert.)\n\nThere are tons of fun minigames, and some rather interesting HO scenes where you have to assemble stuff.\n\nIt's a very neat setting full of weird stuff. I like weird. And this is fun even without the shiny colours that usually draw me. It's certainly not bleak either!\n\nI can also mostly easily understand what to do and why, unlike in most HO games where I'm left puzzling at the reasoning behind actions.\n\nYou can collect candy canes, and while they're not indicated on the map (I really would prefer more games to show where collectibles are still hidden), there's a reason to find them: You can buy cosmetic upgrades for your HUD with them!\n\nConcerning the story...\n[spoiler]I'd felt sorry for the Clown from the start of the first part. Now he got a happy end. :) [/spoiler]\n\nThe game crashed twice during a cut scene (different ones), but restarting, I could repeat the last action and watch the cutscene again without trouble both times.\n\nThere was one minigame that I skipped, because I couldn't see how it could be solved.

That bugs me a bit.\n\nOverall some nice minigames.\n\nIn the first part was 1 'remember the sequence', where you had to press different stick figure type drawings on piano keys, that was simply too long. First time ever that I skipped a minigame (that I know/remember/wasn't an accident).\n\n2nd part had a minigame that I skipped too, as there wasn't really anything to go by to fill the image with bits from pressing buttons, except pressing randomly.

Weird Park Triology does a lot right, while only minor problems rise their ugly head during gameplay.\n\n[b]Graphics: +[/b] The three games have good graphics, only the third supports widescreen fully. \n\n[b]Sound: ++[/b] Original and fitting soundtrack to the game, some of the tunes catch the mixture of mystery, crime and actual horror or circus setting.\n\n[b]Playability: +[/b] Not a lot of surprises here, some of the riddles are challenging enough not to let a gamer run through this game like a madman, and you should take your time to try out the riddles. If one particular riddle is too tough it can be skipped, or you can quit playing and continue later. The graphics of the hidden objects are quite well, especially the third part with the assembly HOS section is a real nice and relaxing part.\n\nNow for the Genre-typical Scores:\n\n[b]Story: ++[/b] I hope you don't suffer coulrophobia, since this story is about... Clowns, one Clown and a mischievously evil little entity that is. The story suffers some insignificant lapses during the three parts, those might be reasoned away with developing the villain and his victims (when you play the last part you'll finally notice why).\n\n[b]Technical Realisation: ++[/b] If all three parts would have had the technical standard of the last part here would be three plusses, my personal max score. Sadly the first two episodes are neither CE's nor are they fully compatible to widescreen (yeah, turning them into WS actually is changing them into uglyness). The game is on par with some of the other good HOG's.\n\n[b]Extras: +[/b] There isn't too much to explain, only the last game has a lot of extras and a bonus chapter, which actually deepens the story behind the Series. Sadly, the first two aren't so well off with extras. Nonetheless, the Extras in the third part do some compensation.\n\n[b][i]Overall Rating: 9 +[/i][/b] Keep in mind, HOG's are casual games, they don't have much of a replayability, aside some sentimental value. But this triology includes three quite nice and well told stories, one which you actually wish to get deeper and deeper into. It has no fear factor - if you don't suffer coulrophobia - and is quite entertaining.\n\nLast but not least: [b]Value for Money: Moderate[/b] 19,90 \u20ac doesn't seem much for three games, but they don't have a really long playtime. And replayability tends to zero. Nonetheless, all three games are actually good HOG's with a lot of story to cover. So the price [i]is[/i] acceptable.

The atmosphere of the first and the game design if the third episode makes it especially noteworthy for any HOG fan.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nAlawar made the right choice when they released Weird Park in the package format on Steam. While it certainly lacks extras like trading cards, the quality of the trilogy justifies the price. Let\u2019s see in details:\n\n[b]Weird Park: Broken Tune: 79%[/b]\nBroken Tune is tries to sell itself with the visuals and atmosphere, not the story. The derelict amusement park, haunted by the ghost of a clown, works great as a setting, and it can make anyone forget that the game has almost no plot.\nThe game mechanics are barebones, but refined. There is a fair amount of backtracking and some challenging puzzles, but the main attractions are the hidden object scenes. They are well-constructed and a joy to play, even if some of them are reused several times.\n\n[b]Weird Park: Scary Tales: 71%[/b]\nThe second part feels less intuitive. The playable area has expanded, but the game has little identity on its own. The number of the hidden object scenes increased, but their quality dropped.\nThe story brings back the ghost clown, who, along with his puppet, is now kidnapping children in order to place them in known fairy tale settings because\u2026 boredom, I guess. While the plot makes its presence known a lot more, it is paper thin and serves only as an excuse to change the scenery frequently.\n\n[b]Weird Park: The Final Show: 83%[/b]\nThe third part is, finally, plot-driven: a new protagonist ends up in the nightmare world seen in Scary Tales in order to free a kidnapped boy and the soul of the clown (who is suddenly a good guy now). There is even a bonus episode, where we finally learn the truth behind the jester puppet.\nGameplay is strange, as initially it focuses on sequential hidden object and fragmented object scenes before it settles on the traditional HOG mechanics. It also features cross-inventory item manipulation, a rare sight in this genre.

How about THREE games with creepy clowns! The minds behind these games clearly wanted to induce nightmares so play at your own risk!\n\n[b]Weird Park: Broken Tune[/b]\nThe first game of the Weird Park Trilogy. You play a detective on a mission to uncover the mystery behind disappearances at an old carnival as well as find another detective who went missing there. The park is haunted by a dead clown\u2019s ghost and the trickster Loki and both will eerily appear around the park to spook you, again, evil freaking clown.\n\nThe game play is basic hidden item fair. A fair share of hidden item scenes along with mini games and puzzles to solve. Nothing out of the ordinary. It has spooky music and voice acting, though it\u2019s not the best. Everything you could want in a hidden item game is here, despite it being an older and more basic title.\n\n[b]Weird Park: Scary Tales[/b]\nThe second installment unfortunately has little to do with the first. You play an entirely different character and, despite defeating him in the first game, you\u2019re pitted against the evil clown Louise and Loki once again. The story is off the walls weird. It could be its own separate title and not even be linked to this trilogy and you wouldn\u2019t notice. I found the story to be the weakest, and most annoying, of the three. Your a random guy who went off the road into Spooksville and you have to save kids you don\u2019t even know.\n\nThe game play, graphics and music thankful make the game bearable. It\u2019s fun to play and the puzzles are engaging. The voice acting isn\u2019t stellar but it\u2019s appreciated. Even if you feel the same way as I about the story you\u2019ll be too busy finding hidden objects to really notice, too much anyway.\n\n[b]Weird Park: The Final Show Collector's Edition[/b]\nThe final act in the war against Loki and Louise, you once again play someone different but you\u2019re brought back to Fairy Gate Park as a journalist. Everything about this game is an improvement from the other two except, in my opinion, the story. The first game was incredibly spooky and unnerving, even causing me to be mad at it for the clowns in it. As the series progresses it becomes less and less scary and more mundane. To make matters worse, this story is a redemption tale for Louise the clown which I didn\u2019t like.However, it\u2019s still an interesting story and better than the second one.\n\nGame play has been given a huge upgrade from the previous titles. Amazing hidden item scenes and challenging puzzles, item combining and more. The graphics have also improved from the first two but the voice acting really hasn\u2019t. You also get a bonus chapter which shows how Loki became trapped in the record to begin with.\n\nOverall this is a solid buy, even if one game isn\u2019t strong on its own you\u2019re getting three and that\u2019s a great bargain.\n\n[url=http://lunarproductions.tumblr.com/]Lunar Productions[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1449731015, "timestamp_updated": 1458300433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525409", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18878303": {"recommendationid": "18878303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254666621", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1446660719}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is awesome :) the graphics are good and they actually work on windows 10!! the sound is skippy but thats alright, you arent missing much, the sound track if fairly traditional for spooky games. puzzles are simple enough to figure out without feeling like u are running out of time or you need to use a hint to solve it. it isnt too much back and forth from one location to the next to be able to move onward. i like it!! 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1446660862, "timestamp_updated": 1446660862, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18720608": {"recommendationid": "18720608", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969267147", "num_games_owned": 5854, "num_reviews": 203, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445985612}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent value for fans of hidden-object games and casual point-and-click adventures.

But there is also another recurring character, the real antagonist, which is Loki/Mr. Dudley. \n\nWeird Park: Broken Tune was the first one to be released but I've played it in the Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1. I enjoyed the dark settings and the soundtrack. But I had an hard time to find my way sometimes, relaying on the hint buttons. Besides, the ending was promising a real good sequel. In this opus, you're searching for a journalist that vanished and that was investigating an abandoned park that closed following accidents and the death of their clown.\n\nBut this is where Weird Park: Scary Tales happens. And it's not even a sequel to the story. You're on the road and you're suddenly distracted, sending your car somewhere you didn't know it exists: an old house and a little girl needing help... in another world. You have to save her and her friends, by re-acting some tales.\n\nAnd to conclude Louis Gauche's story (which isn't really coherent at this point) with The Final Show, you're investigating the disappearance of another child and is sent to another world, where Louis Gauche, the clown, is finally understanding that he was manipulated and that he wants to save the boy that showed him that he could be a good man.\n\nI hate when a trilogy is not making sense. I mean, Loki/Mr. Dudley is either a servant of Louis Gauche or his boss, we don't really have Louis Gauche's background coherent and I don't understand how he could have survived as you defeated him in the first opus. Also, the hero isn't the same each time, so, while you, the player, know more or less who to trust and the story, the character is completely unaware of everything.\n\nIf the graphics are very good and very representative of the ambiance of the story, the soundtrack is also good. As for the gameplay, it doesn't change: hidden object games and puzzles.\n\nI would buy the bundle during a sale, mainly because I think that the price is not justified when you already own one of the game as part of the Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1 - they did the same with another good game, Mountain Crime. Notice that I will buy the upcoming 4 in 1 though I already have the House of 1000 Doors. I don't want to miss the other games in it. But, yeah, for me, Weird Park Trilogy is worthy to be bought and played.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1444164078, "timestamp_updated": 1444164078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.707817", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18354186": {"recommendationid": "18354186", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116675491", "num_games_owned": 610, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444047909}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0438. \u0421\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0438\u0437 3-\u0445 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0439, + \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0414\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043d\u044f \u0442\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0441\u044e\u0434\u0430. \u041d\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434, \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434, \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b, \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043b \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434.. \u041d\u043e \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435. \u0415\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043a\u0430, \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f", "timestamp_created": 1444139267, "timestamp_updated": 1444139267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18303596": {"recommendationid": "18303596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101603112", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 893, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443643498}, "language": "german", "review": "[b]7/10[/b]\n\nIm Ganzen gesehen ist Weird Park Trilogy ein gutes Wimmelbildspiel,\nwelches Fans des Genres lange unterhalten kann und \u00f6fters auch \u00fcberrascht.\n\nEs hat nat\u00fcrlich auch ein paar Bugs, R\u00e4tsel die schlecht erkl\u00e4rt sind oder einfach unlogisch sind.\n\nTeil 1 hat sehr viel Spa\u00df gemacht zuspielen.\n\nTeil 2 war nicht so fl\u00fcssig, mit vielen Stellen ohne weiterkommen\n\nTeil 3 war dann total anders und hat wieder viel Spa\u00df gemacht\n\n\u00dcberraschenderweise gabs nach Teil 3 dann noch ein sch\u00f6nes Bonuskapitel.", "timestamp_created": 1443861227, "timestamp_updated": 1443861227, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563087", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18130365": {"recommendationid": "18130365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032800685", "num_games_owned": 432, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442833513}, "language": "english", "review": "Trilogy of Hidden Object Games telling the story of the dead clown Louis Gauche and the creepy little demon Mr Dudley.

Each installment casts you as some kind of investigator looking into a part of the park's past, and having to assemble crests, collect socks, and shoot crossbows to solve the mystery. They're all hidden object games in that grand European style where the English and the logic are just a little bit off, but you can see the polish get layered thicker and thicker as the series progresses. Honestly, there's a lot of difference between the three games, so I'll talk a little about each one.\n\nBroken Tune is the first in the series, and is about as straight-forward a hidden object game as you can get. You pick up inventory items, you use them on things, you find 12 doodads in hidden object scenes to get another inventory item. There are a few puzzles, but no gimmicks, no item combinations, and no map. However, the game itself is very well laid-out, with items arranged so that they will send you back to areas that have new points of interest. The uses of items are crystal clear, and the hidden object scenes are clean and detailed. One interesting feature of the game is that it is split evenly into two acts, with no backtracking or items shared between halves. The graphics are good, the voice acting is goofy, and it'll last you a good two hours.\n\nScary Tales is the middle installment and a huge step up from Broken Tune. This one adds more puzzles, cutscenes, and areas to explore. The game is also WAY longer, clocking in at nearly 4 hours. In terms of design, there's more variety to the different areas. The first third of the game is extremely open, allowing you to travel to many different rooms right from the start. This does make the opening act a bit harder, however, because you get a crapload of items at once and no real clear direction for using some of them. After that the game goes into some really creative places and plays with fairy tale concepts. It's a great game to follow the first with, especially since it's more difficult overall.\n\nThe Final Show is, unsurprisingly, the last in the series. Again it improves over the previous game, this time adding new variations of hidden object scenes, interactive items you can manipulate, an upgrade system (!), achievements (in-game, not Steam), and a map for ease of travel. Final Show is just as long as Scary Tales if not longer, and is split into convenient chapters with no backtracking between. It also goes full-on crazy with the setting, having only the tutorial set in the real world. Oh yeah, it has a tutorial, too, for some reason. The graphics are fantasic, and there are quite a few voiced NPCs in this one as well, as opposed to the mostly barren games before it. The upgrade system might just be cosmetic, but having something else to find in addition to the necessary items was a treat. There's even a bonus chapter you unlock after beating it that fills in some of the backstory, and is honestly one of the best-designed chapters in the series. My only gripe is that Final Show is harder still than Scary Tales, which pushes it into slightly unfun territory sometimes. In particular, some of the item logic is really questionable. Beyond that, though, it's easily the most polished and deep game of the three.\n\nTaken as a whole, Weird Park Trilogy feels like a great way to get into hidden object games because each part of the series is so different. They form a spectrum from bare-bones to feature-rich, which lets you discover precisely what your taste is. There's even a complete story told across them, though it's perfectly goofy and predictable. It's also hard to beat the value, since you're getting 10+ hours of game in a genre where most will only get you 2. My one piece of advice if you do get into it, though, is to play on the lower difficulties. Whereas the \"Expert Modes\" in other hidden object games make the puzzles and searches more challenging, all it does in the Weird Park games is eliminate the highlights around hidden object scenes. It's an annoyance made worse by the amount of backtracking you have to do sometimes, because each scene has to be done multiple times at different points in the game. Remember that if you ever get stuck, too... go back and look for a scene that's reactivated. With the hints and the improvements of the later games, though, it shouldn't distract too much from the overall experience. No matter if you're new to hidden object games or an old hand at them, you won't be disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1442724314, "timestamp_updated": 1442724314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18032132": {"recommendationid": "18032132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077671243", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 904, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442248670}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely great, nice mixture of point and click adventure, hidden object game and puzzle game.

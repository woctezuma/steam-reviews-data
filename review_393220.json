This is my favorite steam game. Its so fun. And ill tell you why.\n\nPros\n\n-Tons of awesome monsters to pick from and destroy stuff with!\n\n-Man is super epic to play as, seeing giant monsters charge at you is so epic and scary!\n\n-Pretty long, 2 campaigns with multiple takes on the game, and are both equally fun to play.\n\n-Graphics. I dont like pixelated games usually but this is by far my favorite pixelated game. I love the art style, it fits the game really well!\n\n-Awesome music! The chiptunes sound just right in the game, and theyre super catchy and epic.\n\n-Splitscreen! Its super fun to play with friends! Tons of fun times!\n\nNow onto cons. A few but they arent to big, doesnt ruin the game at all.\nCons\n\n-No monster vs monster. When you think of giant monsters you think of them fighting, but no fighting here. \n\n-Lacking in game modes. Only 2 campaigns, and while fun you just do the same thing over and over.\n\n-Splitscreen. Yes it is a pro but it is a little weird. As man you only get 1 type of infantry you can spawn, and you have to find crates to get more. So to even make it fair, I have to act really stupid as the monster in split screen and not destroy to much. And most monsters are way to op, its almost never fair for man since you only get 1 choice of infantry, and get random pickups. Only really fairyou pick weaker monsters.\n\n-No online!? I want to play with my friends on steam, and since theirs no online i have to invite my actual friends over, and thats only sometimes if they even can, reducing my enjoyment of the game. Also meaning i cant play with my steam friends. I know you would have to rebuild the entire game but its something that would have been nice.\n\nGame is definetly worth the cash.

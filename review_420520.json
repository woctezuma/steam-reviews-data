Thats when i got home and fired up a recently purchased Rome Total War 2. Spartans are pretty cool, and now it was time to smash the Roman Empire to pieces, problem was, I was burnt out. Even the greatest leader needs a little break from time to time. Check through the store a bit and find some game id never heard of but it was only a few bucks and looked easy enough. Figured it would be nice to dumb it down for a bit before I reimmersed myself in multi level Empire management.\n\nSo here I am now, its wednesday and I've just gotton home from work. I kick on steam, wander to Lost Technology in my library and notice i have almost 20 hours into this game I am about to fire up.

Pick a race/nation, build them up off the corpses of your enemies, and conquer the world.  This can feel pretty overwhelming at first, especially at the beginning of a campaign, but gold is the only resource you need to worry about so it's not actually as bad as it seems.  There's like a hundred officers you can recruit and while some are more useful than others (Dragon Riders lol) they're still noticeably more useful than stacks of mooks so that's cool.  You can also just stack heroes together and that can be hilarious.\nFactions have unique troops and, again, they're not all particularly balanced but that's fine.  It's like a secondary difficulty selection.  Lizardmen and Dwarves in particular don't have much for troop selection but their frontline infantry are monsters compared to other factions.\nA lot of the mechanics, as always, are mysterious.  Figure it out.\n\nMost of the factions don't have a story because they're not translated but I guess they're working on it?  The setting itself is pretty standard fantasy fare except for the thing that's in the title.\n\nThe game is graphically simple but I think it works out in its favor.  The aesthetic is solid.\n\nThe music is fun but repetitive and I ended up turning it off after a while.  All the officers have unique voice clips and that seems crazy to me.\n\nUI is functional.  \n\nI liked this game, it's 3 bucks.

"Recommended\n\nThe game is simplistic, but has an interesting backstory which I enjoy. The downside is with the English translation. Only three factions, so far have been translated for story mode, however, these three factions have multiple endings which make the game replayable.

pretty solid and I'd absolutely reccomend this game with a few caveats.  So its like a turn-based tactical RPG made real time with a lot more troops and an overmap where you engage in diplomacy and move/recruit troops; its fantastic! And the story very well done from what little I've seen of it. Although that brings me to the localization.\n\nOne thing I do have to say is unless you speak japanese your not going to get the full game, at least for now. \nYou see the thing is the game is being localized in pieces and based upon people buying the game. Of the time of the review only 3 (supposedly another batch is coming) of the 12(?) main stories have been translated and a handful modes have not been brought over (although 3 of which are freeplay modes so I'm not really sure what thats all about since they have the same map and factions but another seems to be senarios or something to that effect). Also the way the developers decided to handle having non translated stories is to simply say \"the story hasn't been translated your in freeplay mode\" rather than just warn you that this story hasn't been translated here it is in japanese which maybe I'm in the minority on but moving on.\n\nThe localization itself is not amazing as there have been times where I suddenly get a string of kanji thrown at me when I hover over abilities or even item names in dungeon master mode. Although that is an exception rather than the norm. Overall I'd say what is localized was done very compitently the characters' personallity don't feel lost in translation as can happen.\n\nAnyways enough whinging on the localization I honestly adore this game.

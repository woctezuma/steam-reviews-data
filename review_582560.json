Without VR, the closest way to emulate this experience would be hiring a troupe of actors to play out an elaborate murder mystery in an abandoned mansion.  If that sounds awesome... I honestly think you're actually getting a better experience with The Invsisible Hours.  WIth the ability to rewind or speed up time, you don't need to miss a single detail.  You are free to view as little or as much of each of the various storylines as they wind in and out of each others paths.  It is only over when you feel that you have sufficiently understood all of its mysteries.\n\nMy only criticism is that this story's particular structure does not provide room for a traditional denoument.  I would love a greater sense of resolution for the remaining characters.  That being said, I would gladly sign up for more should the developer create similar immersive theatre in the future.  Different settings/genres are ripe for exploring in this exceptionally engrossing new 4D storytelling medium.\n\nI would recommend this experience to anyone with access to a capable VR rig.

Intrigue? Following people around? Welcome to the Invisible Hours. The Invisible Hours is a game best described as a VR movie with multiple scenes happening simultaneously. To handle all the things going on and watch them, you will find yourself pausing and rewinding time. Time is a big part of what this game is about.\n\nThe game reminded me a bit of your typical Clue setup \u2013 A bunch of guests are at a mansion and the host has been murdered. Who did it?! That\u2019s the premise for the Invisible Hours. For $29.99, you will get quite a bit of game time \u2013 myself I clocked in about 3-4 hours. I would normally not say this is enough play time but to be fair, this is 3-4 hours of constant dialogue. In a strange way, I would consider the Invisible Hours more of a \u201cplay\u201d than a \u201cmovie\u201d. It\u2019s lacking special effects and focuses more upon the stories of each character and their own interactions \u2013 not flashy effects.\n\nPlaying the game \u2013 it looks good and sounds good. My only problem, initially, was the movement but that was because I didn\u2019t understand I could rotate myself when teleporting by holding down the button. I didn\u2019t figure this out until Chapter 4. Another problem of the game is the \u201cobject\u201d mechanic. It works fine when you\u2019re used to it but at the start of a game \u2013 there is a lever you must pull to start the game. In any other VR game in existence, you would instinctively grab the lever and pull it down. In this game, you need to think of your hand as a laser pointer and instead point at objects and pull the trigger from a relative distance. Needless to say, starting the game should never be an issue. It\u2019s not as miserably cryptic as Euclidean but still never a good start to the game.\n\nCompared to other games, the \u201cweight\u201d of the VR is felt more in this game. Since much of the game is played passively(ie standing and watching), I\u2019d almost suggest playing it seated. I try to play all my games standing but you really feel a bit of VR fatigue while waiting in this game. For $29.99, it may be a tricky purchase. It\u2019s not a game \u2013 you don\u2019t win or lose. In fact, you\u2019re pretty much invisible(ironically). The best way to think of it as a super-special 3d MOVIE \u2013 is it worth buying? That\u2019s what it comes down to. I personally enjoyed the game but I also purchased it on sale. $29.99 feels fair for an asking price from the developer due to the presentation and amount of dialogue but as a buyer \u2013 it comes down to personal preference. Do you want to play a game you win? Skip this. If you want to have a VR play \u2013 here you go.\n\nThe Invisible Hours - The Good\nLooks great\nSounds great\nTons of plot\nInteresting game that keeps you guessing\nThe Invisible Hours - The Bad\nNot a game you win(or lose) - bad to some\nStarting the game(lever mechanic)\nA fairly high priced game depending upon your genre preference\nTeleportation is a little wonky to me(rotation)", "timestamp_created": 1515192711, "timestamp_updated": 1515192711, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500780", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39097591": {"recommendationid": "39097591", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019855603", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514397459}, "language": "english", "review": "If only I were able to delete just one line from the game code this game would probably be great. It's the line that updates the player-Z-rotation-value every time you teleport.\n\nThere is litteraly just one small little feature that ruins the entire game. It's that the game forces me to do an artificial rotation everytime I teleport. When you press the teleport button you will get an arrow to specify what direction you want to face at the new teleport destination. It's impossible to end up in the exact same direction as before the teleport.\n\nI feel like the following reddit post does a great job of summing up my thoughts about this mechanic:\nFor me it moves the game towards \"traditional video game\" and away from \"immersive experience\". It's another artificial motor skill to learn and one that doesn't correlate with my intuitive spacial awareness.\n\nFor me good VR is about reducing the number of artificial factors. The ideal VR experience would be the one where I just moved naturally like I do in the real world. As much as that's currently unobtainable it doesn't excuse adding in kludges that were only really invented because of the limitations of front-facing setups. (random guy on reddit) \n\nEverytime I teleport I have to actively think about how to reorient the entire world and this constantly reminds me that the world is not real. The worst thing is that if you happen to look to the side before teleporting the world orientation will become even more offset. This greatly discourages me from ever looking anywhere else than straight ahead. In the real world we want to look around while we locomote. We never just look straight ahead.\n\nLuckily probably over 99 % of all teleport games does teleportation the right way, by only changing location and not rotation. It would be extremely easy for the TIH-devs to make an update that atleast made this OPTIONAL.

One of the best and unique VR \"games\" I've ever played.  It's hard to clasify what this is.  It's not quite a game but it's not really a movie either.  The best way to describe it is that it's like a non-interactive Holodeck Novel (from Star Trek).  The \"movie\" plays out around you between the different characters regardless of what room you're in.  If you follow one character around the house, you'll miss what other characters are doing at the same time.  \n\nAs for the \"gameplay\", you can pause, rewind, and fast-forward through the story.  You can teleport around the house.  And there's also a useful map and timeline to keep track of where people are when\n\nThe story is really good!  I had no idea who did it until the end - I won't spoil anything here though.  I started out mostly following Gustav, the detective, around the house; which gave a good backdrop to the main story (i.e. figuring out who murdered Tesla).  But you'll definately want to see what other characters are up to in other areas of the house in order to get the full experience.  There were many times where a character's actions either didn't make sense, or took on an entirely different meaning, once I had gone back and seen a previous scene that I had missed before.  \n\nThere's also a number of achievements and collectibles to find, if you like that sort of thing.  I'd recommend trying to look for most of the collectibles because they do add important background information; these would be various letters, newspaper articles, and Tesla's diaries scattered around.  They're mostly not too hard to find.\n\nMy only negative is about the graphics.  Some movement seems a little stiff and it can look a little awkward when characters interact with objects.

There are no real objectives, there is no real gameplay. You can't \"beat\" it, or even affect the world in any way. \n\nWhat you can do is fast forward, rewind, and pause time. You can also go back to the \"theater\" you're watching the whole thing from to see a timeline, map, and the locations of each character at each point in time on the map (provided you've actually seen them at that point in time before). Using this you can quickly travel between points in time.\n\nThe entire game takes place over roughly two hours, with about an hour of that being seen by the player. This stretches out a lot more than you'd think however, as characters are moving about the manor interacting with things and each other. If you're thorough you'll end up following each character around for each \"chapter\" to ensure that you see every scene. The story plays out as a very \"Clue\" like murder mystery, with the player either passively watching or (if you're like me) actively trying to catch characters in lies and figure out who the killer is before the end.\n\nAs you play, you'll find yourself marvelling at things you managed to miss. Characters will take actions, leave evidence behind, and you'll probably miss changes made by characters you haven't followed yet.\n\nThis is definitely a unique experience with excellent voice acting. You can really feel the emotions of the characters.\n\nThere are two drawbacks to this game however - The ending, while certainly satisfactory did leave me with questions. I can't really say more than that without spoilers, and spoilers would ruin the entire experience - so I'll leave it at that. I hope that there will be a sequel in the future. The second drawback is the graphics. Up close (such as a foot or two away), things look fairly crisp but with a very low texture resolution. More than a foot or two away though, and things get blurry. Faces become indistinct when someone is merely across a table from you, even on Ultra settings. Perhaps this will get some work done on it, perhaps not - either way, it certainly didn't hamper the experience much.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1508050904, "timestamp_updated": 1508050904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621595", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35723607": {"recommendationid": "35723607", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974737904", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511467787}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a game, per se.

Many different plots happen and a scene can read in so many different ways depending on how much information you've gathered from witnessing other character's actions.

I'd say it is The prestige (movie) meets And there were none (crime novel) meets The Sexy brutale (game) meets The Last Express (game). So, pretty much my dreamgame on paper.\n\nThe game is around 5 hours long, without trying to find the collectibles. It's biggest strength is not holding the player's hand : you can play the game in whatever way you see fit, rushing through the several chapters following only 1 character, or going through each chapter on a quiet pace while following all the characters. You can also not use the time control powers like rewind or fast-forward at all, or take full advantage of it, it's up to you.\n\nStory, characters, graphics, sound design, voice-acting, controls : everything is pretty good.\n\nThe game has a few problems tho :\n\n- poorly integrated subtitles : the translations are good and use different colors for each character. However, the subtitles vanish if they are in the way of a character, making it really hard to find a good angle to listen closely to any conversation between the characters while reading the subtitles. An easy fix would be to make the subtitles always appear on top of anything it comes across.\n- game is a bit blurry.\n- poorly integrated oculus touch controllers on the steam version : which is especially and incredibly annoying regarding the thumbstick warp as you will accidentally move with it, pretty much all the time.\n- a bit short : the story is about 1h long for a single run, and 5+ hours if you try to discover all the scenes. But the concept is so good that it leaves you wanting more.\n- achievements don't seem to work yet but i don't care (i know some people care about achievements)\n\n\nWhat I thought was especially neat is how you have to find the location of the characters by yourself at any given moment (which you do by exploring the house, looking for them) to be able to follow them. For instance, at a certain chapter of the game, I had lost 2 characters and had no idea of where they were / what they were doing. At first I was angry I couldn't teleport instantly on them in the game's menu with the map and characters icons, but it's actually much better to find them yourself.\n\nI just wish the game was longer as a AAA-game with high budget would have been probably a GOTY solid contender.

Had I not seen the earlier event myself, this later happening would have meant something *totally* different to me than they ended up meaning.", "timestamp_created": 1507688091, "timestamp_updated": 1507688350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35626268": {"recommendationid": "35626268", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966247510", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514310153}, "language": "german", "review": "[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th] [/th]\n        [th]Oh no[/th]\n        [th]Maybe[/th]\n        [th]Great[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b] RATING [/b][/td]\n        [td] [/td]\n        [td] [/td]\n        [td][h1] -X- [/h1][/td]\n    [/tr]\n   \n[/table]\n\n[b] Gameplay- und Test- Video: [/b]\nhttps://youtu.be/h-rUzSV86oc\n\n[b] Spielerlebnis: [/b]\nIhr seit Teil eines Theater St\u00fccks welches ihr als Interaktives VR Adventure erlebt. \nIn wie weit Ihr ein Aktiver Teil dieses Spiels seit kann ich momentan noch nicht sagen.\nIhr seit ein unsichtbarer Beobachter einer Krimi Geschichte.

Its a brand new concept and its so incredibly fucking cool. Ive barely scratched the surface and im already so damn into this. ITS DONE SO WELL WOW!!! I heard about this a few weeks ago and wasnt sure if it would catch my interest but it most certainly has. The acting and motion capture is so brilliant and the story line has me so damn curious and interested. \n\nmake sure to set the graphics to ultra as they are kinda blurry, its a bummer knowing some people will not appreciate what this seeming materpeice of an idea for VR this is beacuse the game is so blurry. Dont let that stop you from trying this, its certainly so so so much more than some blur. this is a masterpiece you NEED to buy this now to see what i mean, especially if you like movies.

Godot provides a module system which allows us to plug in and compile our own modules written in C++, and 3.0 will introduce C# and other features providing us with everything we need to work around GDScript's performance concerns.\n\nThe user interface is easy to navigate and easy on the eyes.\n\nThe software itself is lightweight and portable.\n\nMIT license, no strings attached, no royalties.\n\nI designed my Unity3d game's code to not be reliant on UnityEngine.  When Godot 3.0 comes out there's very little reason for me to stick with Unity3d, and I will heavily consider porting over to Godot.", "timestamp_created": 1506548444, "timestamp_updated": 1506548444, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35170932": {"recommendationid": "35170932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258461530", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7332, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513512759}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u70b9\u90fd\u4e0d\u597d\u7528 \u7528\u4e24\u4e0b\u5c31\u5220\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1506228590, "timestamp_updated": 1506228590, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35160867": {"recommendationid": "35160867", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048613379", "num_games_owned": 1418, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 21490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 190, "last_played": 1516417022}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1506191580, "timestamp_updated": 1506191580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495016", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35140828": {"recommendationid": "35140828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120569509", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507475217}, "language": "english", "review": "Otima engine", "timestamp_created": 1506127374, "timestamp_updated": 1506127374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34910138": {"recommendationid": "34910138", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994366441", "num_games_owned": 1743, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504445832}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412 \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u043b\u044f\u043f\u0430\u043b, \u0432 \u0441\u043a\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0431\u044b\u0434\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b...\n\u0418 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0448\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u044d\u0442\u043e - \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u043a\u0430.\n\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0445, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u0441 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c, \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \"\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u044b, \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0435 \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0435\".\n", "timestamp_created": 1505258706, "timestamp_updated": 1505258706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612347", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34873450": {"recommendationid": "34873450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314408697", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510778653}, "language": "english", "review": "Great engine for 2d development. \n\nI have experience in C# and Python, so the custom scripting language was easy for me to pick up, especially since it is very similar to Python in syntax.

Although I feel that I'll be able to catch up when better learning resources become available.\n\nOverall I really like this engine.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1501790867, "timestamp_updated": 1501790867, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33949437": {"recommendationid": "33949437", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981889253", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507278809}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud2c8\ud2c8\ud788 \uacf5\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud234\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4. 2\ub514 \uac8c\uc784\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc744 \ubc30\uc6b0\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc694.\n3.0 \ubc84\uc804\uc774 2017\ub144 \ud558\ubc18\uae30\uc5d0 \ub098\uc624\uba74 3\ub514 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub798\ubc0d\uc774 \uac15\ud654\ub41c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\ub124\uc694.\n\uc601\uc5b4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc544\ub798 \uc720\ud22c\ube0c\uc758 \uac15\uc758\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uac83 \uac19\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. >>> GDquest \uac15\uc758 \uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KEr_YlibZ3SBuzfw9xwGduK", "timestamp_created": 1501595036, "timestamp_updated": 1501595036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33781386": {"recommendationid": "33781386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048642417", "num_games_owned": 657, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506086595}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u4e2a2D 3D\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u514d\u8d39\u3002\ndemo\u91cc\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u804a\u5929\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c7b\u8d85\u7ea7\u739b\u4e3d\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u65b9\u5757\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u98de\u884c\u5c04\u51fb\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1500968287, "timestamp_updated": 1500968287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467836", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33760205": {"recommendationid": "33760205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025459086", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 20673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511700171}, "language": "french", "review": "Great, works flawlessly on low specs computers.\nPro tip : ALWAYS close your project by clicking file -> close, otherwise you could screw up godot's install directory.", "timestamp_created": 1500879612, "timestamp_updated": 1500879612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33639019": {"recommendationid": "33639019", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355962274", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500465827}, "language": "turkish", "review": "godot engine yi ilk g\u00f6rd\u00fc\u011f\u00fcmde bi i\u015fe yaramz demi\u015ftim ama kullan\u0131nca yan\u0131ld\u0131\u011f\u0131m\u0131n fark\u0131na vard\u0131m suan bana gore bu oyun motoru unity ile kap\u0131\u015f\u0131r. kendine has dilide bir ba\u015fka g\u00fczel pythona benzer bir dil kullan\u0131yor bence her oyun yaz\u0131l\u0131mc\u0131s\u0131n\u0131n bu oyun motorunu bilgisayar\u0131nda bulundurmas\u0131 gerek ve buna bir \u015fans verilmeli emin olun y\u00fckledi\u011finize de\u011fecektir", "timestamp_created": 1500414654, "timestamp_updated": 1500414654, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33424024": {"recommendationid": "33424024", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179523627", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 25411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1438, "last_played": 1516521000}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay I have put a semi-decent amount of hours into this thing. and Post quiet a bit on Github and itch.io, All my projects are free and open source. So take, and examine whatever you desire.\nhttps://github.com/lavaduderDev\nhttps://lavaduder.itch.io/\n\nLightweight, Free and OpenSource, Easy Node system, Great UI. \nGodot is made for people who: \n\nlike building their games from stratch.\nEnjoy a diverse script languages\nCustumizing their game engines\nPrefer linux over every other platform\nPublish to html\nlow spec computers\nDive into other people's opensource projects and change them for the better.\n\nGodot however is not for everyone, especially those that:\n\nPrefer toying with assets (Unity is for you)\nwant to easily make games (Gamemaker, Construct2)\nUse a lot of tools to make things shiny (Unreal)\nHave a specific game genre in mind (various, like RPG maker) (However Godot does have Escoria Project, Which is for Point and Click Adventure games)\nAnd have a huge library of tutorials to teach you (ANY OF THE ABOVE)\n\nI've seen a lot of people suggest you wait for Godot 3.0. But I'd say learn it now. Once everything opens up to you, You'll never find a better engine. \n\nGodot's power is what you'd call a double-edged sword.\nIt's for those that at least have a half idea of what they are doing (Don't worry I am exception. Just look up the Q&A, Which is farely active.), beginners are welcomed to try, but it is not the easiest to learn. Gdscript is undoubtably easier than C++.\n\nMy favorite part of Godot is the Node system. Organized, and simple. I can call a node function, get a node variable, load a script in, instance a scene, or signal it on command. With very little hassle. The list of node types and their node family inheritants are quickly understood. \n\nBecause Godot is FOSS it is customizable for everyone, If you prefer C# over the default gdscript, gdscript can be replaced, prefer to work on linux over windows? No problem. (infact it seems like that was the targeted audience.) And if you don't like where the engine is going, you can fork it. (Also if you do that, PLEASE CALL IT GODOT MATE!) It fits in with my other FOSS software, like musescore2, Lmms, Gimp, and Blender(Godot actually has plugins for Blender!)\n\nThe Escoria Project. To me this changes Godot completely. I'm still using that familar UI, but with very powerful point and click adventure tools, I especially love the dialog system. esc script can make really complexe dialog trees, and I love it! I've been wanting to make a point and click adventure ever since I started using game engines, and now I got the best one for the job. It's a dream come true!\n\nBut not all is good. My biggest complaint with Godot is the lack of tutorials, and those that exist need improving, But that's a community issue. Of a community driven engine.\n\nIt's also Still early in development. A lot of stuff is missing. Infact very recently enumerators were added to gdscript. STINKING ENUMS! Plus The lighting is awful, like other game engines, it does not spread out, annoying hot spots are frequent. It's a disaster when making dark areas.\n\noverall I do recommend Godot, if it appeals to you. I came because of the node system, but stayed because I felt I can help shape a community, Thanks to Escoria and Dolphin Island 2.", "timestamp_created": 1499669639, "timestamp_updated": 1516520793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710352", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33252806": {"recommendationid": "33252806", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062661717", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499443507}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "boa engine", "timestamp_created": 1499210644, "timestamp_updated": 1499210644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32790870": {"recommendationid": "32790870", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044075907", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506021483}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been playing around with Godot for nearly a year and it's a fantastic piece of kit:\n\n[list]\n[*] Free and Open Source\n[*] No royalties required\n[*] Runs on Windows, Mac and Linux\n[*] Cross platform and mobile export available from the get-go\n[*] Built in tools for animation, shaders, particles, etc\n[*] Easy to learn Python-like language\n[*] Version 3.0 on the horizon\n[/list]\n\nIt's not as well known as Unity and perhaps not quite as robust as Gamemaker, but both of those tools are either premium or require royalties.

If I would pick anything else than Unity, I would pick CryEngine because of its beautiful 3D rendering, or Lumberyard for both CryEngine beauty and Amazon Web Services. \n\nGodot looks great if you didn't look at Unity or any other options. But after looking into the different engines that are available at this time (2017), Godot is just left far behind on so many things. The only thing that Godot has going for it is the MIT license which makes it completely free, compared to for example Unity where you need to pay some licensing if you start making more than 100'000 USD per year, at which point you really should reward the game engine developers anyway, unless you are a total douchebag. \n\nSpeaking of douchebags, it is my impression that the Godot community is rather hostile and not really nice people. Maybe I was just unlucky in my interactions. Without naming any names, just look at this Steam review, which previously pointed out a bug that made Godot entirely unusable. One of the comments said that \"this negative review doesn't count because bugs are not part of a programs functionality\" [slightly edited]. So apparently, having a bug that renders a software impossible to use is not part of that softwares functionality?!? Anyway, I mentioned this bug in my first review, which made one of the developers respond and work to fix it, so great job on his part. However, while I reported a bug that made the software impossible to use and while that report resulted in a developer responding and fixing said bug, 83% of the Godot users came in to say that my review was \"not helpful\". \n\nSo according to the Godot user community, bugs that render a software useless should not be part of a review because it has nothing to do with functionality, and reporting those bugs so that they can be fixed is \"not helpful\". This is just one example of my interactions with Godot users, but I really don't have any kind of positive impression of the community. Meanwhile, other engines have users that produce tutorials and act generally friendly with advice and help. Again, this may be some unfortunate and unlucky things that only applied to me, but it is my own experiences and impressions. You might be more lucky, if you want to risk it. \n\nTo sum up, I don't think Godot is bad software. It's just not even close to other software, and the user community appears to be less friendly and helpful than what I have found elsewhere. Therefore, I would recommend anyone to try out Unity, Lumberyard/CryEngine, Unreal Engine, and the other options out there that are most likely better than Godot in every possible aspect.", "timestamp_created": 1489426630, "timestamp_updated": 1490537734, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.344189", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30023095": {"recommendationid": "30023095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049022043", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2040, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515119516}, "language": "english", "review": "Working with this engine has been an absolute pleasure.

This is excellent news in my opinion that's worth mentioning - because it shows that the guys behind godot are pushing the engine where the community wants it to go.\n\nOverall, an excellent engine I'd easily recommend.\n", "timestamp_created": 1487468569, "timestamp_updated": 1487468569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29996200": {"recommendationid": "29996200", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970279067", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496969905}, "language": "english", "review": "This review was *almost* a positive recommendation.  You can read a lot of the other positive reviews to learn why it's a really good development framework.\n\nI was about to choose Godot as the engine for my next game, but then my partner noticed that there were posts dating from over a year ago reporting screen tearing and frame stuttering, and these reports continued up to the present.  (Search for \"godot screen tearing\" to see some of the posts.)\n\nI had not noticed the problem because the scenes we had made for our evaluation project did not have scrolling.  As soon as I added some scrolling to the project, I saw the problems.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no workaround.  Even Godot's own Space Shooter demo has the problems.  Neither turning VSync on (or off) nor enabling pixel snapping helped.  It would sometimes look so bad that one could clearly see the seam flicker between two triangles of a texture.\n\nOnce Godot fixes the screen tearing and frame stuttering, I will gladly change my recommendation to \"Yes\", but for now, it's not good for commercial use.  It's still good for personal projects, prototyping, and game jams.\n\nUPDATE (25 Feb): As another test, I created a project with no scrolling.  It was simply a 4-color Sprite node that one could drag around the screen, and the background was a solid color.  If I dragged the sprite rapidly around the top 1/3 of the screen, I would see weird ripples inside the sprite. Slower movement minimized the rippling, but it was still noticeable.  I don't think it's simply a hardware issue because similar behavior does not happen if I recreate the demo in GameMaker, Corona, or Unity.  It seems like a renderer issue to me.  I hope Godot 3's new renderer fixes the problem!", "timestamp_created": 1487375841, "timestamp_updated": 1488052105, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 55, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766415", "comment_count": "12", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29946933": {"recommendationid": "29946933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003523726", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487303748}, "language": "english", "review": "Open Sourced game development goodness.", "timestamp_created": 1487183450, "timestamp_updated": 1487183450, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29910902": {"recommendationid": "29910902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101688515", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 7352, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463401556}, "language": "english", "review": "Free to use and doesn't require you to get anything else.

Especially for a newcomer, this will help them to learn and grasp the basic in programming, mechanic and developing their own game. Plus with GGE own interface, it won't make the newcomer feel overwhelmed like UE4 own interface.\n\nPersonal opinion, if you're aspiring dev who have a \"big idea\" to be realized then you better go for UE4 (or Unity5). Especially where UE4 itself is designated for epic 3D AAA game or simple 2D Flappy Bird-esque game, everythings is possible. With vast arsenal of useful tools like visual programming-esque language, profiler, real-time debug and WYSIWYG, it definitely will speed up and make your game development much easier. \n\nAlthough the learning curve for UE4 is quite steep, in a long term investment it defenitely worth your time. Plus it's free (excluding 5% royalty on that amount after the first $3000 per game per calendar quarter).\n\n[h1] Comparison with Unity5\t[/h1]\n\nAnother game engine that sell like hotcakes among indie game dev or hobbyist. \n\nHave been using UE4 for almost 1 year and GGE for 1 week before my friend ask me to help him create 360\u00b0 video VR inside Unity5. Can't say much about the pros and cons but one thing for sure, Unity5 is easier than GGE and probably almost equivalently feature-wise like UE4. \n\nThe huge con for someone who reconsidering to get Unity5 instead GGE is the Unity5 license for Plus and Pro are quite expensive (with 12 month of continuous subscription commitment).\n\n[h1] Conclusion\t[/h1]\n\nIf you are the one who need a free, not license restricted (like Unity5) and looking for easy, not so hard game engine (like UE4), you should try GGE.

After some initial testing, I gotta say there's just something about its presentation and streamlined simplicity that make me keep coming back. The UI looks almost sparse at first but I find that actually keeps me more focused because the layout is tidy.  \n\nThat doesn't mean it's lacking in functionality at all though. The visual node-based/blueprint shader engine is a godsend for those who want to try GLSL shaders but aren't so great with the code side. This same system is also being developed for the engine scripting as well and that can be a HUGE feature for many. Check out the videos on YouTube regarding this feature.\n\nThere's just too many nice features to mention really but it all just seems to *work* well from the flow of the development to the samples and demos included.\n\nUsers are also contributing plugins such as an amazing bone-based 2D IK system similar to Spline/Spriter for Blender that exports to Godot. Asset dropper/management plugins and other goodies are also available.\n\nThere are no license fees involved with Godot itself when exporting your work so that's a bonus as many engines have royalty clauses for commercial games.\n\nI'm really impressed with this engine and hope the development and community continue to grow and contribute to an even more robust product.\n\n10/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1477160918, "timestamp_updated": 1477160918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.551155", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25889553": {"recommendationid": "25889553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271000435", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500923931}, "language": "english", "review": "A great game development tool.", "timestamp_created": 1475778736, "timestamp_updated": 1475778736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.466185", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25866913": {"recommendationid": "25866913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118788628", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512930429}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend this game engine.

One thing to note is even though this engine in fairly fresh to the public, it had been used exclusively in-house by OKAM studios for about a decade while simultaneously adding new features to the engine to fit their needs in it's closed source past.\n\nThat the engine has such beginnings is very reassuring. It had to meet the needs of developers in-person and get games out the door. That it is now being refined as an open-source engine makes it even better. Developers around the world alongside the responsive lead developers are intelligently managing this project with lots of fantastic updates and it has turned into my absolute favorite engine ever because of their efforts.\n\nLet's break it down with a classic pros & cons list.\n\n---\n\nPros:\n\nAbsolutely free & open source. Unlike other big name engines, you won't be charged no matter how much you profit from the result. You can mess with the base code all you want and compile the result for your own team.\n\nBinaries for Linux are provided regularly, including here on Steam!\n\nA familiar UI to other modern engines with no shortage of good inspiration & careful design.\n\nIncludes a pythonic scripting language named GDscript that is suited for the engine.\n\nThe node system is packed with lots of great base objects.\n\nA powerful animator that can change any variable exposed to the engine over time!\n\nOutside of games it has plenty of tools to make traditional applications too.\n\nContains plugin API so you can expand on the engine even from GDscript itself. \n\nHas an asset store so you can share those plugins, perhaps some assets or even game templates.\n\nDark theme by default!\n\nGreat for low-res/retro style & needs few tweaks unlike other big name engines.\n\nGreat controller support, I've been able to get both X Input & Direct Input to work with zero issues.\n\nCan be ported to pretty much everything since it has a C++ base. Windows, Linux, Android, OSX, iOS & HTML5 are all available. OKAM have released their games for various console platforms, so that is very possible to do as well.\n\nThe visual scripting system is soon coming in 2.2 and looks promising.\n\nC# support is in the works.\n\n\nCons:\n\nIt still uses GLES2 for the rendering API, which means more advanced graphical effects will not be available & in the worse case you may suffer from a stuttering effect that may be tied to this being the only option. There are plans to add GLES3 support soon as well as Vulkan down the road to correct this.\n\nThe documentation is a bit weak, but it's gotten much better over the past half year.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, just get it! You've got nothing to lose, it's absolutely free and I think many of you will find it easy to love. Video tutorials are a bit lacking out there so I'm considering sharing what I know with some videos myself. Check me out on Youtube with the same name if you're interested as I'll have some stuff up in the near future. If you are licensed for a console platform and are porting your game to one, I would love to hear your results.\n\nI'll try to update this now & again as the engine is actively evolving.", "timestamp_created": 1471885216, "timestamp_updated": 1472027518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25037193": {"recommendationid": "25037193", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190240737", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473503451}, "language": "english", "review": "Very recommended game engine, very active development, supports Gdscript and c++ and soon it will support c# and visual scripting.

The main drawback for someone just getting into dvelopment (and this is by no way a reflection on the engine) is currently there's a lack of diverse beginner tutorials available online. Especially if compared to the wealth of information for the likes of Unity3D or Unreal.

Denn nur weil ich andere W\u00fcnsche habe, oder besser gesagt weil sich der Markt halt anders entwickelt (ich mag auch keine Werbung in Apps!!, aber die Mehrheit will das, da sie leider kaum Geld f\u00fcr Apps liegen lassen. 1000$ f\u00fcr ein Smartphone, aber keine 99Cents f\u00fcr eine App) Nunja eben. Das der Markt nun mal halt so funktioniert ist NICHT die Schuld von GODOT. Darum war mein Review im Nachhinein betrachtet v\u00f6llig unfair ! So bin ich aber eigentlich nicht. Darum hier warum ich es nun doch empfehle!\n\nGODOT wird einmal das im Game Development Bereich sein, was KRITA im Paintbereich und Blender im 3D Bereich ist. Der Fortschritt ist rasant und jetzt mit der Version 3.x (die bald kommen wird) hat es viele super Hilfen dabei. Ich denke da zB an das Visual Scripting oder die Verbesserung des 3D Bereichs. GODOT entwickelt sich super schnell weiter und wird wirklich zu einer ernst zu nehmenden Konkurenz f\u00fcr Unity. \n\nWas im Momemt leider sehr Mau ist, ist die Dokumentation. Besonders im Hinblick auf Version 3.0 wird sich da ja einiges \u00e4ndern. (Visual Scripting) Das ist jedoch logisch und das tolle daran ist, das jeder (ja auch ich) sich die Zeit nehmen k\u00f6nnte diese Dkumentation zu erstellen ! Also auch hier. Kein Fehler von GODOT an sich. SOndern liegt halt in der Natur der Sache :-) \n\nWer neu in den GameDeveloper Bereich einsteigt dem kann ich GODOT sehr ans Herz legen und wer weiss, vielleicht gibt es bald eine einfachere M\u00f6glichkeit AdMob , Facebook usw zu integrieren.

Also I usually dont do particle effects but this engine makes it very straightforward and easy to grasp. Just recently I made a 3D particle effect for a simple 3D missile model. \n\nI feel that 3D part of the engine is still lacking, especially in tutorials. But there are some demos out there that will point you in the right direction. Ofcourse theres a good but small community that will answer any questions you have as well. \n\nAs far as scripting goes, I have little knowledge in programming but i played around with the built in script called GD script. I feel its easy to understand like python. Anyways I cant comment much on the scripting part since its not my forte. \n\nBut overall good engine and looking forward to future updates and updates for the 3D side of the engine as well. And perhaps sooner than later, it needs better documentation and more tutorials for 3D and GD script. Oh by the way, it goes hand in hand with blender quite well.

It's one of the least known game engines out there, which I myself discovered just mere month ago. Boy was I surprised to see something like this on the \"market\". It's an opensource 2D and 3D game engine, with a main focus on 2D (as of now, in version 2.0.2; 3D improvements and quite a lot more stuff! is coming in version 3) but which can also do 3D, though not as intuitive. But the best part of it all is the great community, responsive devs. (just try it out in their IRC chat: freenode - #godotengine & #godotengine-devel, like right now!) and best of all it's MIT license which basically means you can do whatever the hell you want with it. It is also poewrful enought to get you started in games ranging from simple to advanced. The editor itself is built in Godot! yah, you heard right, the editor is actually a game, how cool is that? Anyway, on to the more serious part (I'll focus more on 2D cause that's what I've been experimenting with):\n\nPros:\n[list]\n  [*]it has all the tools you need to fast prototype your game, though crude, they're super useful. Don't have artistic abilities? Just try  out the polygon tool for building graphics quickly, run the game without compiling it, for debugging purposes. It has real time updates, that is if you run your game and change it while it's running, the changes will reflect in the game play! Super useful\n  [*]the way they put it together really follows the simplicity philosophy: the tools are all nodes in a tree which means you can easily prototype and implement complex scenes (which are themselves nodes, which is why I actually don't like referring to them as scenes, they're basically just nodes, everything is a node in Godot, it's really important to get this mindset when starting out, it will definitely help in the long run, trust me!) in a very straightforward way. Games usually have a hierarchy structure to them which can be thought from the beginning: the player is a character, the character has weapons, armor, stats, the wold comprises of the map and the characters, the map contains props etc. All this shows how easy it is to build a graph or a tree of the game which can literally be replicated in Godot. There's no need for Prefabs or other workarounds that you might find in Unity or other game engines. Here in Godot everything fits in quite naturally\n  [*]the GDScript Godot uses for the logic of interactive nodes is very simple and fast to learn. It's based on Python (I'd say 80% or more is overlap) which goes back to the fast prototyping paradigm. It's essential to have a simple scripting language to bring life to your characters and artwork. It's also enough powerful and straightforward to use for simple to complex objects.\n  [*]build custom nodes through GDSCript which you can then use in the editor! Missing a node? Just build one yourself, it's really easy once you get the hang of GDScript\n  [*]if there's functionality missing in the engine (which requires specific access to hardware or needs to run buttery smooth) just write a C/C++ module or Java if you are developing for Android, etc. which means you're not limited to work only with what's been given.\n  [*]it's MIT licensed, this is huge! Use it, modify it, distribute it, do whatever you want with it and it's all free! no hidden costs or fees, no nothing, just take it, use it, build something marvelous!\n  [*]animation is built wright inside of it! with armature and what not, just try it\n  [*]build for any platform, ranging from Windows, Linux to hand-held devices, consoles etc. you name it\n  [*]more and more people are taking interest in it. For example take a look at this brand new tool for blender: https://github.com/ndee85/coa_tools\n  [*]of course, last but not least, it's opensource which mean anyone can contribute!\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n  [*]documentation is scarce, but it will eventually improve, there's a lot of refactoring going on as we speak and it's constantly updated\n  [*]]if there's functionality missing in the engine (which requires specific access to hardware or needs to run buttery smooth) just write a C/C++ module or Java if you are developing for Android, etc. which means you're not limited to work only with what's been given. You might remember this from the \"Pros\" list. I've also included it in the \"Cons\" because it's not easy to get things rolling if you don't have experience with lower level languages or with specific platform languages. I sure am no expert in Java for example which means I won't be able to take full advantage of the hand-held hardware, unless I dig in and learn some Java to build my own modules, or rely on someone else to come up with the functionality, it's both a Pro and a Con\n  [*]relying on it's own GDScript means yet another language to master and you may find it just isn't powerful enough for your needs. Now the engine itself was built with multiple scripting languages in mind so at some point we might find that it will support Javascript or Python or what not, but for now we're stuck with GDScript\n  [*]it's still early in development which means some features are missing or there's bugs, but hey... show me a commercial product out there which doesn't include bugs!\n[/list]\n\nCan't wait for Godot 3 which will a complete revamp of the particle system, it will be focused on 3D functionality and it will move on to the new Vulkan graphics API which is quite ambitious. So far the devs are on top of it and they have delivered every time! I guess it help that they are actually payed to work on this project, even though it's open source :). All considered I think this is one of the best game engines out there and on top of it it's open source!

PERIOD. (If you're a serious dev and not a wannabe.) IT PUTS EVERY OTHER 2D GAME ENGINE TO ABSOLUTE SHAME.\n\nIgnore my number of hours on this engine. I've spent way more hours with the builds I compiled myself before it even got on to Steam. Even now, I always compile my own Godot for the latest and greatest, and I still can't keep up. They develop so often and so rapidly that they push out commits with new features and bugfixes so frequent, I gave up trying to pull and compile the sources just to have the latest. Nowadays I only do it when I feel like it. \n\nFor 2D development, Godot is a FULL-FLEDGE game engine which surpasses everything by a far stretch. It is tons better than Unity, Unreal Engine, GameMaker: Studio, Clickteam Fusion 2.5 etc, and Construct 2 when the Visual Scripting is ready (except for maybe, everything about asset stores, and bigger communities, etc). \n\nIt doesn't fake its rendering of 2D by using a 3D camera minus the axis of depth (like Unity does). Looking at its source code, even if you may not agree with it, you probably can't help but wonder what an engineering wonder this is! Imagine how perfect this engine could be (or already is for many gamedevs), as Godot is only limited by one thing: the people in the community using it to make games and contributing to develop it further, available plugins for 3rd-party IDEs.\n\nMakes anyone wonder why Godot isn't THE mainstream game engine for 2D yet. I prototype 2D games a lot so I've used plenty of game engines (absurd to list them here) and Godot is by far the greatest 2D all-in-one integrated game engine in the world surpassing everything out there except custom in-house engines that are not available for public use. It's hard to believe, but I'm not exaggerating at all. \n\nKeep in mind that this is AN ACTUAL GAME ENGINE / FRAMEWORK, not some no-coding drag-and-drop visual programming wannabe bullshit, even though it has visual scripting in the works.\n\nSo you're gonna need to code a lot, and a lot I mean A FUCKING LOT. And I said FRAMEWORK too since you can actually completely ignore the whole visual side of Godot and use it like MonoGame, libGDX, etc, coding purely in C++ (git clone https://github.com/godotengine/godot.git) if you're like an oh-so-hardcore-esque low-level wiz from the 70s.\n\nTake note that I am a VERY BIG FAN of Unity and everything Unity. I've also used GameMaker: Studio and Clickteam's various products in the past.\n\nYet, I still use this as my main engine over any other option available out there because:\n\n- Full source code access. MIT license. Freedom.\n\n- Extremely active developers. Just look at their GitHub repos. Just look.\n\n- Very easy compilation for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, HTML5 etc.\n\n- C++ source/framework. Devs seem to use QtCreator as their IDE. Easy low-level gamedev. C98 datatypes.\n\n- You can write your own modules, easily, provided you are familiar with programming in C++/Java.\n\n- C++ modules. Very modular. Even GDScript is a module. Have to recompile to enable modules.\n\n- GDScript plugin system. No need to recompile.\n\n- Tool mode (Godot's editor scripting if you come from Unity).\n\n- True cross-platform with mutliplatform editor: Windows, Mac, Linux, etc!\n\n- I prefer instancing scenes of nodes within other scenes of nodes over components on GameObjects in big scenes.\n\n- Tiny, efficient executable.\n\n- Visual shader editor. No need to buy something like ShaderForge (Unity). Shader language too.\n\n- Animate anything animation system a la Unity's Mechanim.\n\n- Bones for 2D skeletal animation with IK. No need to buy Spriter Pro or Spine! I just wish we can export the animation to image files.\n\n- IAP system (enable its singleton to enable the module).\n\n- Want to let an object be tappable on a mobile screen or clickable on the desktop? Easy, just check one option: \"Pickable\". Done.\n\n- True 2D.\n\n- Very very very easy pause system. \n\n- Has something like AssetBundle (if you come from Unity).\n\n- Crazy signals system and GUI nodes and CanvasLayer make GUI building easy even for kindergarten kids.\n\n- Theming GUI with your own skins? As if this world has anything easier in any other software out there.\n\n- Can be used to make DESKTOP software. (Don't try to make mobile apps yet though since it doesn't do low-power mode on mobile yet)\n\n- Your own splashscreen.\n\n- THEMABLE DARK THEME!\n\n- https://www.facebook.com/groups/godotengine/ THE COMMUNITY IS HYPERACTIVE ON FACEBOOK!!!\n\n- MANY MORE!\n\n\n\nCons are:\n\n- WORST IF YOU CAN'T CODE.\n\n- If you don't like GDScript because it's like Python. Or because it's \"not a real language\" \n\nJUSTIFICATION: But it's so easy to pick up, I didn't even read the docs before I guessed my way around the API and got the hang of it in just a couple of hours.\n\n- HTML5 export is flawed. \n\nJUSTIFICATION: But they're working on it. They just got a lump sum of $$$ from Mozilla. I'm Waiting for Godot 3.0+.\n\n- Relatively tinier community.\n\nJUSTIFICATION: But very very active, especially their Facebook group. ESPECIALLY THEIR FACEBOOK GROUP. It's even more active than your emo friends' tantrum-throwing posts every few minutes.\n\n- Has an \"Asset Store\". Little content. NO VR export.\n\nJUSTIFICATION: Give it time. It's still new so it's GROWING. \n\n- Godot structuring a game as one big tree with many branching nodes may not sit well with some people coming from other engines and frameworks at first sight.\n\nJUSTIFICATION:  But if you actually stop being prejudicial and spend some time to learn and change your thinking a bit, it is the BEST out there and if you're a developer who has experience shipping games, your productivity will increase by 99999999%.\n\n- Maybe you think you can't export to consoles? \n\nJUSTIFICATION: YOU CAN! It's not stated anywhere on the website and due to legal reasons you have to contact and prove to a Godot core developer/maintainer you're a licensed developer for a particular console first before they send you the export templates.\n\n- Plenty of info in the docs but still not enough for many people?\n\nJUSTIFICATION: It's GROWING. Give it time to grow.\n\n- Not enough tutorials because not enough people using it. \n\nJUSTIFICATION: But this (http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/Godot-Game-Engine-tutorial-series.aspx) will probably get you started VERY QUICKLY.\n\n- There might be bugs here and there, just like every other engine.\n\nJUSTIFICATION: But if you report it, it gets fixed in a few hours to at most a few days, if it's not a major bug. If it's a major bug, they're already working on the fix. Or it's already fixed.\n\n- Certain links to certain Godot resources (like 3rd-party modules etc) from Google search results may be outdated and current ones may become obsolete very quickly because of the rate at which Godot is being developed.\n\nJUSTIFICATION: The current number of game developers using Godot just isn't enough to keep up with the extremely rapid updates. If there are more people using Godot and contributing to it, this would be less of an issue (and I get to be lazy).\n\n\n\nAlso, take note that I don't really do 3D that much since doing 3D is too hard for my little brain.\n\nI don't believe in things being absolute, but Godot is an exception. It is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST.\n\nProvided you're not doing 3D. Haven't heard of any shipped games made with Godot? Only reason why it's not THE 2D GAME ENGINE? Because you haven't used it yet. Why don't you be the first to make a hit with it? Why don't you help push this engine to be THE ABSOLUTE GAME ENGINE?\n\nEmbrace Godot. Sniff it like weed. Or even better, make it a part of your physical body. Trust me, you will be a lot healthier than you are. You will be among the healthiest and fittest in the world. Truly the best.

I've been developing and re-developing my own game for a year or so. I started out using Unity, switched to jMonkey, but settled on Godot. It doesn't get any easier than this to make games, almost feels like cheating!\nUnity is nice, but they 'shoe-horned' 3rd party \"Mono-develop\" in for the coding environment, I had several issues where they didn't stay in sync with each other.\njMonkey is a similar approach, they've taken open-source Netbeans and shoe-horned a game engine into it. It works fairly well, but being beta, still a few glitches, some quite bad ones. Eg. the sound system no longer works in 2.0. I reported this on the forum and got told off for not reporting it earlier!\nThen comes Godot, still Beta, but very much more refined, very active development too, I monitor commits to the source code. I submitted a bug report/suggestion two weeks ago, it just got fixed and pushed out in the nightly build.

I have briefly played with other free engines, but this is the first one I've really commited to.  Been using it since the beginning of 2015. Here's what I like so far.\n\n[list]\n [*] Scenes - You (can) break up your project into pieces, but still graphically manage everything from the interface.\n [*] Phone Apps - You can also create GUIs in godot.  Why not write a graphical phone app with a game engine?!\n [*] GDScript - At first I was bothered by it not supporting my language of choice, but since GDScript essentially a custom python based language.. I can easily port all kinds of python code to godot.  It's easy to pickup and hasn't held me back at all.\n [*] Documentation - With a project as complex as a game, I'm constantly solving problems I've never had to solve before.  The built in documentation in combination with the wiki usually have exactly what I'm looking for.  It's not perfect, and for more obscure things I'm sometimes digging a bit, but the docs keep improving and will only get better.\n [*]  Open Source - If it doesn't do some crazy feature I need for a project, I can add it.  I have had no need to do this, but I felt this was a big plus.  Kind of like having an in house engine you've developed.  If you really don't like how a feature works or one is missing.. You can fix that (and give back to the community)!\n [*] Rapid Development - I feel like one of the keys to figuring out what works and what doesn't is being able to try things quickly.  I can usually have something working within a few hours to test out whatever new concept i'm working on.\n [*] Built in Debugging - Output, performance metrics as well as deploying to a device.  Really handy stuff.\n[/list]\n\n I'd say the downside would be it's still new, so it doesn't do EVERYTHING for you.  The new version supports community plugins and community assets are coming soon, so this should improve.  An example of this would be something like a dialog system.  You are left to create it however you like, but by no means is it drop in place and go.  I like that flexibility, as it allows me to have full control over everything.. not fighting an imposed system... but there's more learning curve there.\n\nOverall, it has helped me quickly build some really cool stuff.  I often find myself enjoying the accomplishment of solving a problem for a silly little project I'm working much more than playing through a big budget game.

I jumped from one engine to another. With Godot I finally can develop a game on Linux from the start to the end. It's still a young game engine but it has an incredible development pace. I follow its development since last year through GitHub, Facebook and I have to say what others say as a marketing term this game engine really does democratizing game development.\nIt's open source (MIT License) without strings attached, the main developer(s) listen to the community and welcoms everyone who wants to help in the development, documentation and growth process. \n\nSome technical notes:\nWhen we have to talk about the technical stuff right now the 3d stuff is really just at the start (although If I take a look around what people often produce with other game engines they could easily do the same with Godot) . One Problem as of now are the shadows and performance in large scenes. That said the 2d part, the custom scripting language, the editor (written in Godot and its GUI itself which proofes the power of it) everything fits so well together. If you come like me from a background with other game engines then you might need some days to fully grasp the concept and its underlying power. But then it makes just click and you see a really powerful game engine that has a lot of potential to become a serious competitor even for commercial grade games. The actual renderer is based on OpenGL (ES) 2.0, which as of right now is perfect for targeting Mobile,Webbrowsers (seems that most WebGL implementation are on par with OpenGL ES 2.0) and of course the desktop. There is an upgrade (and rewrite) planned for the 3d related stuff to OpenGL ES 3.0 which will come with Godot 3.0. In my opinion a lot of people underrate the possibilities with the actual renderer. I'm sure we will soon see some people prooving to be a good alternative to other game engines out there. (And let's not forget it's free to use without big restrictions like a lot of other game engines)\n\nScene nodes concept:\nWhat I love about Godot is the scene node concept it follows. A lot of engines have some kind of scene node or scene graph based concept. But Godot makes it in a really simple and yet smart way. A scene consists of multiple scene nodes (of all sort of types of nodes for 2d,3d,gui, own defined with modules etc.) . A scene can also contain other scenes within its hierarchy. The keyword here is \"instanced scenes\", which allows to add scenes in other scenes and people can work on different parts of a big scene without having to fear to break the scene hierarchy, it's really great.  Together with Godots use of source version control friendly file formats this makes for me a great choiche for a collaboration. (Be it a collaboration for a  commercial game or a game for a game jam).  I love the scene node concept as it's main goal is that with one look at the hierarchy you already know where everything is and how it is organized (try that with componend based design where you have to first select objects (and find them first) before seeing which components they contain. \n\nGUI:\nIn some simple words: smart, powerful, easy\nThe editor has everything you need to layout things. GUIs can be 2d on top of 3d content (like we see in every game) or it can be 2d within the 3d content. You need a menu on a display which is made as a 3d model? No problem. With Godot it is easy to set it up. I saw recently a demo where a guy made a 3d game where there was a tv and  game console in a room and you could start playing a 2d game  on that 3d modeled tv. So a game within a game. I know it's also possible with other game engines, but with Godot it's really easy to set these things up, the editor is just easy to use.\n\nEverything can be animated:\nWith everything I really mean everything! Every kind of property can be animated (so it will be interpolated if the values are float based, set and unset if they are boolean like etc.),  But also function calls can be part of an animation track. Animating is so easy just some clicks and you have a animation ready to play. I made a simplistic day/night animation for instance in just 2-3 minutes lol\n\nExtendibility:\nYou can write plugins in GDScript (Godots own scripting language which has some similarity with Python but is not Python as it is a scripting language made for game development). \nAnd you can develop modules in C++. If you had problems integrating C++ libraries in other engines, you might be surprised how easy it is to do it with Godot, thanks to the nice binding functions offered by it. \n\nMy opinion so far:\nMy opinion is that we are seeing the start of what can become the Blender of the game engines out there. \nIf you need a high performance hardcore graphic solution for a game with large scenes then Godot might be the wrong choice rigth now. But it doesn't hurt to try it. It's easy to learn and you don't need to register any account with it. \nI'm happy with it. Btw I used Unity, Unreal and Cryengine among other game engines and while I think that they are far superior in some areas especially in 3d rendering, I also think that they could learn a lot from Godot's simplicity of use and how it organizes some stuff.\n\nAs of now you can use it without any doubts for every kind of 2d game, 3d game (if not ultra realistic hardcore graphic is aimed- which will be possible only later on), mobile games  for iOS,Android and even Blackberry. Browsergames (so you can develop 2d and 3d games without needing a plugin).  And it runs on the typical 3 operatin systems for the desktop: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X plus people even made ports for FreeBSD, Haiku (which a lot don't even know it exists) and someone tested it on Raspberry Pi too. This is possible thanks to the permissive license.\n\nI made my choice and I guess I will continue to use it for a long time. I feel that this game engine has potential to become really important. But again as said try it and valuate it if you need more or if it has everything you need right now.\n\nWhat lacks is still the documentation but it's getting better and better, we'll see", "timestamp_created": 1456347669, "timestamp_updated": 1456347916, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503343", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21431720": {"recommendationid": "21431720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056550249", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 22222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514739060}, "language": "english", "review": "This is in my opinion the best game engine ever made, and it has potential to become even better!\n\nFirst of all, it is open source, and written in c++, meaning it's easy to extend the engine with your own code and libraries.

Its strength lies in the 2D engine. Once you are familiar with it, prototyping a 2D games is quick and easy.\nThe 3D editor has not received much love recently, and the renderer is stuck with GLES2, but it's planned to implement GLES3 for 3.0 (hopefully late 2016 or earlier 2017). Of course, this doesn't prevent anyone from creating great looking 3D games already.\nThe engine comes with a built-in script editor and debugger. The animation system is another of its strengths, allowing to animate almost everything.\nIn Godot you can instance scenes into scenes (this is the main difference over engines that use prefabs). This is a powerful tool for organizing your porjects.\nThe main fear you can find is the custom scripting language. GDScript is similar to Python, and new users tend to dislike learning a new language. But once you get used to it, you will understand the decision over other existing languages. GDScript and its debugger are really well integrated with the engine, making our life easier. If some parts of your code need better performance, you can write them as modules in C++.\nThe community is huge and very helpful. You can ask questions on the Q&A site, reddit, the facebook group, or the IRC channel.

The engine works with \"scenes\", which are collections of \"nodes\". Such nodes are basic game entities like sprites, GUI controls or physics bodies, or more complex ones like audio output, cameras and such.\nEvery node can be given its own scripting in the engine's native language, known as gdscript. Gdscript itself is very easy to learn, and even easier if you are familiar with the python language. While it's a bit of a bummer to not be able to use, for example, Lua, the language barely takes an evening to learn if you can already code, and shouldn't take much longer if you don't. The editor contains a very competent code editor with all the bells and whistles, from bracket highlighting to autocompletion, which helps a lot.\n\nOnce your scene is set up, you can import it into other scenes, creating more complex scenes that you can alter dynamically with relative ease. For example, you can create a scene containing the HUD for your game, then import it into your main game scene, or custom widgets that you can include in said HUD. All very hassle-free.\nThe node system is also very good to write quick interfaces for debugging/development tools, saving huge amounts of time and allowing to provide suchs tools as modding tools once the game is shipped.\n\nOnce your game is complete, it's easy to export it to various systems, including the usual 3 (Win/Mac/Lin), Android and  HTML5 for in-browser games. It even allows exporting to...blackberry, for some reason.\nThe process is quick and simple, only requiring a few clicks, and includes various options allowing from open-sourced games to single-binary distributions, or even encrypted data.\n\nNow, I have been using the engine for a while, and it's really solid for 2D games. And while it might not be as powerful as others for 3D games, it's competent enough if you use the features creatively. The engine is being developed at a rapid pace, and it gains features and improvements at a good rate, so if you find it lacking in some aspects, it might have just what you need for the next version.\n\nOther interesting features include a very powerful animation system that allows keying almost every single element in your scene, allowing for easy cutscenes, skeleton-based animations and other cool visual effects. It also allows importing most common data formats used in development, international fonts, built-in localization features and other goodies, allowing for very easy prototyping or fully featured games. It also has a live editing feature allowing to change elements of your game in real time from the editor while the game is running, which can accelerate debugging and testing stuff like enemy logic in the project. A huge time saver.\nThe entire engine's source and issue tracker are hosted over at GitHub, allowing to easily keep track with progress, report bugs or collaborate with the project, which helps refining it further. The editor is also surprisingly stable, and I haven't encountered a single crash or data loss in months of use, even using bleeding-edge daily builds. It's also very easy to build in all systems, if you prefer to keep up with every single commit to the codebase or modify it to implement advanced features or alter core behaviors directly.\n\nAs the main flaw, while it has a number of step-by-step tutorials, some elements aren't completely covered by the available documentation, but the tutorials should be able to cover most basics, and the in-editor help covers almost all the classes and nodes without having to keep switching to a browser window for reference. There are a number of included demos which also can help giving you hints on how to proceed.

Within a day, I was up and experimenting with an already-impressive, free, soon-to-be-open, game creation tool.\n\nPrevious to using Godot, I would make my game projects from scratch in C/C++ with SDL libraries. Godot was much different. It was kinda love at first tinker.\n\nI admit that I was initially hesitant to invest much time into Godot because of the custom script language, GDScript. It's very similar to Python (which I had never used). However, after diving in, I found it to be very clear, clean, and fast. It's even easier since the syntax hinting and autocompletion were introduced. I see a lot of complaints around the web about how it should use C# or Lua or whatever, but I don't see the need. That being said, the engine is completely free and open-source (MIT license), so feel free to whip one up and contribute it so everyone else can use it, too. Or just keep complaining. Your call.\n\nSpeaking of contributing, the codebase is quite nice, even for people with modest C++ skills like myself. I was able to make a few meaningful contributions over the years, and hope to do more if/when I can. But this new release is a huge leap forward compared to a year ago. I think any of my minor complaints have been alleviated!\n\nFor 2D games, this engine is fantastic. 3D is limited to GLES2 right now, but a GLES3/3.1 rendering backend is planned for the 3.0 release, so that will bring over many capabilities that even the most demanding 3D developer will require. That being said, the GLES2 backend that already exists is capable of putting out some nice-looking pixels.\n\nYou can export your games to a variety of platforms with just a few clicks, and I've had no issues with that process so far (though i've no Apple devices to actually do any testing of those versions).\n\nThere are a lot of great things about Godot, and it's hard to list them all here (pointless, too, since it's going to continue evolving closer and closer towards perfection). It's free though, so you can jump in and try it out yourself.", "timestamp_created": 1456286474, "timestamp_updated": 1456286474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 172, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869356", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39585179": {"recommendationid": "39585179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030095913", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1516551707}, "language": "ukrainian", "review": "\u0420\u0443\u0448\u0456\u0439 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0456\u0433\u043e\u0440, \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434.", "timestamp_created": 1516812874, "timestamp_updated": 1516812874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39526118": {"recommendationid": "39526118", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153527344", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1516848724}, "language": "english", "review": "Occasionally there is a clitch but overall it's an excellent software.

It should be easy to hop into making a simple 2D game.\n\nMy only gripe so far is that it could be friendlier with version control.

The fact that it's available as free and open-source software for anyone to use is, quite simply, astonishing. \n\nFor 2D games, it's capabilities and ease of use is nearly unmatched. Neither Unity or Unreal have a dedicated 2D renderer, and they suffer dearly for it, often introducing unecessary complication and esoteric problems.\n\nFor 3D, both Unity and Unreal are still a bit ahead as far as pure graphical fidelity is concerned, but for 99.9% of indie devs out there this will never realistically be an issue. The new OpenGL renderer in 3.0 is quite capable, and with the news of MoltenVK becoming open-source, it's likely Godot will switch to focusing almost entirely on Vulkan for rendering, which should easily bring it up to par with the other major engines.\n\nOverall, Godot is a fantastic, professional grade tool that any aspiring game dev should seriously consider.

But everthing has it's own way to be simple:\n\nyou make elements of a game from nodes, by parenting them together, in a logical way: a mesh, an animation player, a collision shape, are the children of a Kinematic body, could be a character. And there is plenty of things that simply help out, want to switch around elements, there is a node perfect to be a position placeholder.\n\nThose elements are defined by their own scripts, you can give every single one of your node a script, if you are into that!\n\nThen it include a complete, and functional GUI, said GUI is the GUI of the editor too.\n\nThe design of scenes, that you then instance in another one, to make a bigger scene, let you fix small stuffs that'll be carried over the other scenes, you can do per instance changes for values you set for, which make it quite the handy way to proceed.\n\nLanguage-wise, Godot seems quite the challenger. It has his own scripting language, akin of Python, made for prototyping and light stuff, while not insane performance-wise, it remain good enough to try. It has C++ too. C# too (considered WIP, but working)\n\nBut here come the game-changer aspect: imagine that you can have ANY language, as long as the community is behind. You want D, Godot has the binding, you want Nim, Godot has the binding, Rust? Guess what. Godot use an API to allow a plugin (community made) to be the language binding. You have a benchmark of it [url=https://github.com/cart/godot3-bunnymark]here[/url], so you can see, it's not just a random thing put into the engine, it's really something the devs want to see working very well. It also mean you can get the steamwork API, or Google Play API working without a special build.\n\nAnd you can export to basically anything (Windows, Mac, Linux, Mobiles, Desktop) with a few clicks.

Take this real world example that happened to me:\n\nIn Unity 2017.3.0f3, my project would not run on my Android device. It was a known bug that still isn't fixed in the stable version, I had to go all the way back to 2017.1.whatever to fix it. This also broke my project, so I had to reimport everything. No updates on when it's going to be fixed except \"Fixed in Future Build\". The only problem is, it's not fixed yet.\n\nIn Godot 3.0, my project would not run on my Android device. It was a known bug that was listed in the bug tracker for the Adreno 3xx GPU. SINCE WE ALL HAVE ACCESS TO THE ENGINE SOURCE CODE, someone posted a patch. Apply the patch, compile from source (using the Godot documentation as a guide), and VOILA problem solved.  \n\nEven if you don't find it useful in it's current incarnation, consider contributing to make it better.

While the C# exporters are currently a WIP, I've tested my project, unchanged (literally moving the folder) in MacOS High Sierra and Ubuntu 17.10 and, in both cases, loaded and ran without any extra steps.

Godot hat mit der neuesten Major Version allerdings ordentlich nachgelegt und hat einen Physical Based Renderer mit einigen netten Features, die es so nicht in der Unreal Engine gibt (auch nicht in Unity btw). Ich w\u00fcrde jetzt nicht soweit gehen und sagen, dass mit Godot solche AAA Titel wie Hellblade so effektiv umgesetzt werden k\u00f6nnen, wie mit Unreal, aber die Renderqualit\u00e4t ist von Godot inzwischen auf einem sehr guten Level und bietet enorm viele M\u00f6glichkeiten, damit das eigene Spiel toll aussieht.\n\nUnity - Godot\nUnity kommt vom Aufbau des Editors Godot recht nahe, verwendet allerdings unter der Haube eine grundlegend andere Datenstruktur. Inzwischen wird auch daran gearbeitet, C# in Godot nutzbar zu machen. Das ist f\u00fcr Unity-User sehr praktisch, ich pers\u00f6nlich finde jedoch das hauseigene GD Script sehr einfach zu benutzen und w\u00fcrde auch nicht tauschen wollen.\nUnity bietet genau wie Unreal allerdings auch den deutlich st\u00e4rkeren Fokus auf moderne 3D Grafiken. Doch auch hier gilt wieder, dass der Renderer von Unity genau wie der von Unreal von Grund auf nicht auf Physical Based Rendering ausgelegt ist.\n\nUnity/Unreal - Godot\nGodot hat meiner Meinung nach viele interessante Eigenschaften, die sich lohnen, sie auszuprobieren. Mit der neuen Major Version hat die Engine einen enormen Sprung nach vorn gemacht und mit dem neuen Renderer gibt es tats\u00e4chlich eine sinnvolle Alternative im 3D Bereich im Vergleich zu Unreal und Unity. Au\u00dferdem hat Godot weiterhin den Vorteil einen dedizierten Renderer f\u00fcr 2D Anwendungen zu besitzen und ist somit in diesem Bereich in der Regel performanter als Unreal und Unity.\nIch pers\u00f6nlich mag die baumartige Datenstruktur von Godot sehr, weil sie intuitiv anzeigt, in welcher Reihenfolge meine Programme abgearbeitet werden und damit auch implizit die Renderreihenfolge vorgibt. Das schafft meiner Erfahrung nach viel Klarheit in der Strukturierung von Projekten.\n\nUnd schlie\u00dflich die gr\u00f6\u00dfte Besonderheit: Godot ist komplett quelloffen und individuell erweiterbar, und zwar bedingungslos. Ich habe selbst bereits ein C++ Plugin f\u00fcr die Engine zur eigenen Nutzung geschrieben und finde die M\u00f6glichkeiten die Engine nach eigenen W\u00fcnschen (und Programmierskills) selbst zu gestalten und mit Features zu erweitern extrem n\u00fctzlich.\n\nFazit:\nDer Engine-Markt ist mit Unreal, Unity und auch stellenweise mit der CryEngine schon recht gut und g\u00fcnstig bedient, jedoch empfinde ich Godot als extrem erfrischend, weil es viele moderne Ans\u00e4tze mit einem klugen technologischen Design verbindet. Die Zukunft sieht pr\u00e4chtig f\u00fcr die Engine aus, da sie inzwischen viele Unterst\u00fctzer hat und die Entwicklung neben der Community auch durch einige Vollzeitentwickler, die per Patreon finanziert werden, vorangetrieben wird. Die Roadmap f\u00fcr kommende Features erscheint auch sehr sinnvoll und die k\u00fcrzlich eingef\u00fchrten Neuerungen im 3D Bereich machen sie tats\u00e4chlich so langsam im Bereich der grafischen Qualit\u00e4t zu einer guten Alternative zu den gro\u00dfen Engines.", "timestamp_created": 1519646373, "timestamp_updated": 1519646373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40412919": {"recommendationid": "40412919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035458969", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 661, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518679350}, "language": "german", "review": "Briliant experience as a developer.

I've followed this project for a long time now and I've been continuously impressed by it. Without charging a single penny, this is easily comparable to mainstream engines like Unity3D in many respects. The graphics it can produce are stunning, and with the release of Godot 3.0, I really don't have any big complaints with this engine at all. I'm trying to learn it right now, and it's very intuitive compared to other engines I've tried. \n\nMy only issue might be a lack of tutorials at the moment, but the official documentation is already very well-made and comprehensive so it's not urgent. There are some bugs as well, but most are relatively minor and on the path to be fixed for Godot 3.1. Once Godot 3 has been out for more time, I expect more tutorials to start flooding in too.

Like Puzzle Games That Actually Challenge You. THEN YOU NEED TO GET THIS GAME!\n\nI'm an avid puzzle game player and stream puzzle games most days. I was recommended this game by one of my viewers and I'll be honest, looking at the images on the store page, the game didn't stand out to me because of the \"2D Game Design\", but I decided to go with my gut and give it a go. boy am I glad I did.\n\nI've just finished streaming all the main game levels. the game mechanic seems very simplistic at first, but don't be fooled. I've played so many puzzle games which have a great concept, but it feels like developers have 'given up' mid way through and what you end up with is a game which is very broken, very easy, or ends up complete trial and error. Not the case with Recursed.\n\nEach area introduces a new mechanic, and gives you a few simple (tutorial) levels before throwing you in at the deep end and combining with previous mechanics, which is where the real mental agility test comes in.  it has taken me 11 episodes, and 13 hours to complete the main game, and some episodes i only solved 2/3 in an hour sitting, so be prepared to not work things out straight away. just have a break, clear your mind, and come back to it.\n\nAll in all, i think recursed has been my game of the year, which last year went to The Witness. At time of writing, I'm having a small break, but still have the bonus content to play (which by the way is all included in the price, although i would happily pay a couple of quid for extra content) and I'm really hoping that Portponky has continued to bring new items and mechanics to the game.\n\nThank You So Much For This Game", "timestamp_created": 1513384049, "timestamp_updated": 1513384049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38249026": {"recommendationid": "38249026", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027688591", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1590, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513053502}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd never have thought to run into a better puzzle game than Stephen's Sausage Rolls.

Lemme try again.\n\nRecursed is a puzzle-platformer. The goal of the game is to get to the goal (a giant floating purple crystal) by solving puzzles. As in a standard platformer, you can move around and jump (three blocks high, in fact). But if you're holding an item, you can only jump two blocks high (you can however throw items horizontally). Already this is a pretty novel mechanic I've not seen in any other game; there *might* be a game I've played where you merely can't jump when you're holding an item, but that's just not the same. Point is, Recursed does some neat stuff with this mechanic, as it's the focus of a fair few puzzles in the game.\n\nBut of course, that's not actually what Recursed is about. No, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.\n\nAhem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.\n\nThere are three types of item you can pick up: keys, which open doors; blocks, which you can stand on; and chests, which are rooms which you can bring items into and pick them out of. The first two are standard puzzle fare, but it is the third that's where the game is.\n\n\"But,\" I hear you cry, \"Isn't that just the same as rooms being linked to one another? I can't [i]possibly[/i] see how that would give deep gameplay!\"\n\nAnd here lie two subtleties. The first one is that since chests are items, you can also pick up chests and bring them into other chests. This changes which rooms are connected.\n\nBut that still doesn't get at what Recursed is about. No, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about.\n\nAhem, sorry, I'm thinking of INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry). Lemme try again.\n\nThe second subtlety is this: Entering a chest does not actually move you to another room; it instead creates an *instance* of a room, which is destroyed when you leave the room. So what's the difference? When you re-enter the room, it re-creates the *original* instance of the room. So, for example, you can take an item out of the room, then enter it again and find that the item's respawned. And it is *this* subtlety that creates the puzzles in the game.\n\nUsing this, you can, for instance, pull chest A out of chest B, then put chest B in chest A. Then pull another copy of chest A out of chest B, and put it back into chest B, into a third copy of chest A. Be careful, of course, because if you leave the first copy of chest A now, chest B will vanish into the aether, and cannot be gotten back (which probably means you've borked the puzzle).\n\nThis unique sort of action in a game could only ever be dreamt up by a madman. Truly, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about. And yes, this time I [i]am[/i] thinking of Recursed, not INF (Ludum Dare 37 entry).\n\nUnfortunately, at some points, you have to think like a madman to solve the puzzles. That's not to say the puzzles are *unfair*; rather that they require such a weird modus of thinking that I've yet to wrap my head around the game. Contrast this with Stephen's Sausage Roll, the Best Puzzle Game Ever\u2122, where the levels themselves usually tend to guide you towards what to do; the levels here are either doing so in a really arcane manner, or not at all. That's not always a bad thing, though, but it does mean that you'll have to experiment a lot more than most (and often don't really get as much feedback when you've done something right or wrong).\n\nComplementing the game quite nicely is a rather catchy soundtrack (unfortunately not a fractal one, but either way it's been stuck in my head the past few days), and some nice humour (\"This green stuff smells terrible! I hope it's not poisonous. *deep sniff*\").\n\nDespite its lack of level signposting, Recursed is a game about what Recursed is a game about. It is unique in terms of mechanics and brings a lot to the table in terms of that. [strike]While it's not as good as Stephen's Sausage Roll (because it's still the best puzzle game ever by a long shot)[/strike] (SEE EDIT), I still recommend it highly, with the caveat that you'll need some patience to get through it.\n\nAlso, screw Rolling Shapes and Soko Match (formerly known as Flow Match). Those two games can chuck themselves into a chest which I'll happily remove from existence for them, because they're that bad and I've mentioned in my previous reviews that I would slag them off from time to time.\n\nEDIT 17/09/2017: Having finished the game now, I can definitively say that it's somehow [b]BETTER[/b] than Stephen's Sausage Roll! If you are a fan of puzzle games, you DEFINITELY do not want to miss this. The main mechanic is just so rich and the secondary introduced mechanics complement it so damn nicely.

From the trailer I thought it would be simply messing with the chest rooms like a straightforward puzzle game, but the mechanics are far more complex.\n\nThe chest rooms are all temporary.  You can take items out and then when you go back in the state of the room will reset.  When you're going into a chest that's in another chest (layering instances) the rooms previous to the one you're in will keep their items.  You can move chests around, take them out of the rooms they're in, put them into new rooms to create different paths through the room layouts... duplicate chests... put chests inside of the rooms they lead to...

make an entire set of puzzles based on recursion makes the game very unique, and the solving process is not at all repetitive, forcing the player to always come up with new ideas to try. \nAlmost all puzzles leave you at first with a perplexing feeling, but in an enjoyable curious way. Then as you explore, you start gathering the key ideas to use, but interestingly implementing them in order to pass the level is by no means trivial, meaning the game doesn't suddenly become dull as soon as you realise what has to be done, which is very important. \n\nAfter a couple of levels, the game becomes very absorbing.

I think this comes down to a few things: 1) It\u2019s very difficult to solve, 2) It\u2019s very difficult to describe, 3) It\u2019s a very pure puzzle game without much fluff.\n\nSome more complaints: The sound track only has a couple tracks and they\u2019re like bland Christmas tunes. The VO is very quiet and I always have to turn up the volume, stop moving, and strain to listen.\n\nMost everything else is great! The visual style is interesting. It looks like a pixel art indie game, but when you pay attention most objects are rendered in 3D. The puzzles are excellent. Everything feels impossible until you\u2019ve figured out a genius new way to combine the game objects. I can feel it changing my brain. I also feel like I need to lie down after a few levels and unravel my thoughts inside thoughts inside thoughts. This is one of those games where getting stuck means you should take a break and come back later.\n\nThe hidden stuff and extra mechanics added in an update are also an interesting tangent. I can\u2019t bring myself to find all the secrets, but it\u2019s probably several more hours a mental gymnastics if you need more.\n\nSo, if you like difficult puzzle games (Lolo, Braid, Ico, Snapshot, Talos Principle) give this a try.", "timestamp_created": 1483850611, "timestamp_updated": 1483890740, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.611512", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29002354": {"recommendationid": "29002354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002194919", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 180, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498862396}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very fun and interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1483525680, "timestamp_updated": 1483525680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28951952": {"recommendationid": "28951952", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970322506", "num_games_owned": 333, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485106153}, "language": "english", "review": "Learn you a functional programming.\n\nAmazing puzzle game.

There is a short tutorial which you can read before you start the game. \n\nThe gameplay basically is that you solve puzzles using chests which have the properties that once you get inside them they spawn a different room. Now the puzzles come for example with you basically starting in a room with a locked door and the chest having the key. You go into a chest which spawns a new room get the key and return back to the prior room to unlock the door. This is the basic puzzle mechanic and there are some very interesting puzzles designed around them. there are puzzles where if you submerge the chest in water the room gets flooded. The first 4 levels of the game are a bit repetitive but not that difficult and easy to breeze through. Then comes the last 3 level sets which introduces some new objects and those are pretty complex and difficult but gives you immense satisfaction on solving them. You basically unlock the next set of levels by collecting gems which are one each in the prior levels. There are also hidden gems which you can find out which are very cleverly placed and require some critical thinking to get to that part. The level design is stellar in this game especially the last 20 levels which if you are a hardcore puzzle gamer would give you immense pleasure to solve. i solved about 15 of them and the rest were too difficult for me. This would appeal to gamers who like logical puzzles. The failure states in the later levels are so abundant and one of the failure states leads you to a completely different puzzle which is excellent puzzle design.\n\n\nThe graphics are very simple and include a 2d character that you control. There are hints provided by a talking ring which you encounter in all the levels. The hints are very vague and basically explain the new mechanics which keep the game fresh and take it to absolutely epic difficulty levels. \n\nHighly recommended if you like logical puzzles. The game's name basically is taken from recursion in programming languages and boy the puzzles use that mechanic in some very intelligent ways. If you feel bored after the first 4 sets of level do continue ahead as before I mentioned the last 3 sets of levels are devilishly difficult and require all your puzzle solving abilities to be used. there are certain mechanics when you are experimenting with a level and it strikes what has to be done is so rewarding.\n\nThe only critism are the controls which are a little finicky with respect to throwing objects and stacking things which you would need to do a bit. but that is only a minor gripe.

Everything in Recursed (graphics, story, music) exists to serve the puzzles, so if you don't enjoy puzzles, there's nothing for you here. If you do enjoy puzzles - particularly puzzles with keys, locks, platforming, and green-tinted objects that are unaffected by your space powers - then you're in for a real treat.\n\nThe core mechanic is this: when you leave a room, its contents revert to their original state. This may remind you of old games like Megaman, where the hardware didn't have enough memory to remember the entire level at once. An enemy that followed you out of a room and then back into it might be duplicated, while an enemy that wandered off-screen would be erased. If you've ever thought that would make a good mechanic for a puzzle game: you're absolutely right. Recursed is that game.\n\nThe puzzles are masterfully designed. Many of them hinge on a single insight, and solving them will make you feel like a genius. There's lots of room for experimentation, and lots of opportunities to see how the puzzle elements interact that really makes you feel like you're learning the rules of this world. Even if what you've learned doesn't help you with this puzzle, it will almost certainly come back in a later one.\n\nRecursed encourages these moments of discovery. Sets them up, even. At least once in the game, you'll have a question about a particular mechanic, and you'll set up an experiment to find out the answer... and the game will reward your curiosity. \"Well done\", it seems to say. \"You spotted a cool thing, and I didn't even have to point you towards it.\" (And then you get a diamond.)\n\nThe game introduces its concepts very gradually, letting you experiment and master each one before throwing a new object at you. The first world doesn't even use the core mechanic, it just lets players familiarise themselves with the platforming and lock-and-key mechanics. Which is appreciated, because there are a couple of subtleties (the ability to throw objects, in particular) that veteran gamers may not expect, so they'll appreciate the slow start.\n\nThe green objects in the fourth world are something of a turning point. By then, you ought to understand the basic mechanics of Recursed well enough, and you'll have discovered that some things are impossible within the game's rules. Green breaks those rules, turning the discoveries you've made so far on their head, making some things possible that were impossible, and opening up new areas to explore. But unlike the start of the game where you had no idea what to expect, this time you'll have a framework to fit these new ideas into, and you may even think of a use for green objects before you see the puzzle that demonstrates it. It's from this point on that Recursed's puzzle design really shines.\n\nWith that high point in mind, I'm a little let down by the later areas. The new mechanics introduced are less obvious than the ones before - acid brings little novelty over water, and fissure jars are strangely complicated compared to the rest of the game's elements. But the new expansion The Oobleck Conundrum remedies this very well, as oobleck has a very simple behaviour from which complex and interesting puzzles flow.\n\nThe final level is one for the books, as well. Everything you've seen throughout the game comes back for one last hurrah, a final boss of a puzzle that uses all the most advanced tricks you've learned. Yet it's ultimately simple enough that you can beat it in three minutes, when you understand the solution. Worth playing through to the end.\n\nThe game took me about twelve hours to beat all-in-all, including the expansion. There's not much reason to play it again once you've gotten 100%.\n\nAlso, after I did beat it, I caught myself checking what I was holding before leaving my bedroom. 10/10, would attempt to use game mechanics in real life again.", "timestamp_created": 1479149708, "timestamp_updated": 1479150317, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.670334", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26590997": {"recommendationid": "26590997", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007752667", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508017401}, "language": "english", "review": "This game deserves more attention.\nIt's an example of a puzzle game done right; few mechanical elements that have their implications and interactions explored to great depth.

Or imagine two different sets of Matryoshka dolls, the first one containing the second one, and the second one containing the first one, both sets interlacing each other forever. These are the kind of structures that Recursed requires you to construct in order to solve platforming puzzles.\n\nRooms are chests that you can pick up, carry around, and enter in. By nesting them in other chests, you can shape the world by creating intricate entangled configurations that allow you to reach places otherwise unattainable.\n\nThe fun aspect of the game is to make mental maps of such knotted networks of chests, and to keep track of the relationships between rooms as you change them. It is an abstract mental maze of endless loops and infinite regressions. And when you get lost in that maze, it feels like rather than being lost in the game, you are instead lost in you own mind, since you are the one making the layout of that maze as you go along.\n\nThere is more than chests to the game, new gameplay elements are introduced throughout. For each new chapter, it starts straightforwardly but ultimately the concepts are pushed to the very limits of their imaginable uses.

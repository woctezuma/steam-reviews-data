Cendrillon (Cinders) se demande comment elle en est arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0 et se rappelle en se rem\u00e9morant un principe au choix :  \"Tout le monde m\u00e9rite une seconde chance\" ou bien \"Chacun r\u00e9colte ce qu'il a sem\u00e9\".\nA partir de l\u00e0, le jeu essaie de proposer une relcture plus mature de Cendrillon avec des personnages plus complexes. La mar\u00e2tre est toujours aussi tyrannique, mais c'est aussi une femme qui tente de prot\u00e9ger sa famille de la ruine par tous les moyens. Les deux soeurs de Cendrillon ont une r\u00e9elle personnalit\u00e9 et des c\u00f4tes attachants. Le Prince est pris dans un dilemne. De nouveaux personnages sont ajout\u00e9s.\nTout cela permet \u00e0 l'histoire de prendre diverses directions (m\u00eame si cela reste assez lin\u00e9aire) et am\u00e8nera \u00e0 4 grandes fins alternatives (selon que Cinders parviendra \u00e0 devenir reine, fuira, gagnera son id\u00e9pendance ou mourra). Et chaque fin peut prendre diverses formes en fonction des personnages auxquels Cendrillon s'est attach\u00e9e, de ses actions ou des traits de personnalit\u00e9 qu'elle a laiss\u00e9 appara\u00eetre.\n\nCet aspect-l\u00e0 du jeu est plut\u00f4t r\u00e9ussi.\n\n[u]Dialogues et personnages :[/u]\n\nN\u00e9anmoins, il faut bien avouer que les dialogues sont rarement passionnants. En effet, tout cela manque s\u00e9rieusement de finesse. Les personnages passent leur temps \u00e0 \u00e9taler leurs dilemnes moraux \u00e0 haute voix, de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s directe (on ne vous demandera pas de faire preuve de psychologie, c'est du tout cuit). Et les r\u00e9pliques \u00e9non\u00e7ant des principes de psychologie de cuisine s'enchainent... Bref, on s'ennuie souvent dans les dialogues (sauf par moment avec le personnage de Sophia qui est d'un cynisme parfois piquant).\n\n[u]Graphismes et animation :[/u]\n\nPremier point, l'animation des personnages demeure tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e (mais au pire pour un Visual Novel, ce n'est pas tr\u00e8s grave).\nCependant, les graphismes ne brillent pas non plus par leur force : les f\u00e9es manquent de f\u00e9erie, la magnifique robe de soir\u00e9e fait \"t\u00e9l\u00e9film \u00e0 petit budget\", les d\u00e9cors sont d'un extr\u00eame banalit\u00e9... Bref, il n'y a ni force, ni magie, ni tragique, ni v\u00e9ritable ambiance dans la forme.\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nTout cela fait que je m'\u00e9tonne des critiques extr\u00eamement positives de Kotaku, Indiegame et des joueurs. Ce n'est pas un mauvais jeu, mais il est terriblement oubliable.\nJ'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 mille fois plus touch\u00e9 par les point-and-click de chez Daedalus ou par des visual novel comme Narcissus.\n\nAlors comme le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation est binaire, je vais mettre un pouce rouge (pour compenser un peu l'enthousiasme ambiant trop marqu\u00e9), m\u00eame si le jeu n'est pas abominable non plus.

Yes, it's a wee bit cheesy at times, and can definitely get a bit repetitive if you reach the point I did of being determined to get all the endings, but it's still very replayable and takes a looooong time to reach that point. It's basically a visual novel of a retelling of Cinderella, but with it's own twists on the story. The graphics are very pretty, and the overall art style is really enjoyable. While there's very little animation, because it's a visual novel you don't really expect much either. The story (and all it's variations) is very well done, and it's a lot of fun to try and figure out different endings, and how different actions impact things. Like I said, it can eventually get a bit repetitive, but only if you're at that point where you're just bound and determined to get those last few endings.\n\nNow, that being said, once you've gotten all the endings and achievements, it's unlikely you'll play it again, or at least not for a good long while. This is the same experience I had with a different visual novel (based on Pride & Prejudice) I played elsewhere, however, so I sort of expected that once I finally completed everything. If you enjoy reading, making choices in books (sort of like a more interactive choose-your-own-adventure), fairy tale variations, or just visual novel type games, definitely buy this one.

I also liked that none of the endings, in my opinion, were perfectly satisfying, because a lot of visual novels have stuff like \"true endings\" and this one doesn't. I also liked the art style... to a point, which I'll get to shortly.\n\nFrankly, the writing style is kinda wonky. My main issue was with the dialogue. I'll be having a pretty casual conversation with my sisters one moment, and them suddenly I'm psychoanalyzing them and speak like a completely different person. This is especially noticeable when Cinders first speaks to the prince. They could have included the same subject matter without entirely changing Cinders' typical speech patterns. Also, I felt the dialogue gave way too much information a lot of times. Another issue was the design of the characters. They were kind of creepy looking... uncanny valley sorta?

You have three romance options, only one of which is worthy of Cinders's hand. The conversations with Sophia and Gloria, the \"evil stepsisters,\" are charming and at times vigorous rounds of badminton repartee. You can choose to warm up to either or both of them, as well as the opposite.\n\nThe events of the story play out like any soap opera would. You have a limited amount of freedom in choosing the order of the scenes and how they unfold. The dialogue is pleasant enough although the stylized \"ruffian\" speech of the top hat-wearing Obligatory Shady Person was a bit annoying to read through.\n\nIf I had my druthers, I would have left town with Sophia; I ended up leaving town on my own, thinking that this represented independence. The epilogue then presented me with an outcome that hand-waved away the panache with which Cinders had handled the entirety of the story. Apparently the independent ending requires you to administer a noble house as opposed to leaving a place that disliked you to start up your own life somewhere else.\n\nI didn't buy the premise or the variable representations of Cinders's intelligence, but it's a nice little romp through the fairy-filled forest.\n\nOverall, 7/10.

And I have to skip a lot of dialogue, when trying to go for another route because, like I said, the dialogue gets repetitive and I can almost remember the situations by heart now...\n\nPositive aspect though: The main really changes personalities depending on the romance options. But sometimes I don't really get why. [spoiler] When she romances her childhood friend, she wants to sleep with him after their first date, which makes me really confused because it's pretty not realistic... but not like a fairy tail either... [/spoiler]\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nIt was a really tough decision, but I can't recommend this game.\n\nI think the fault doesn't lie in the game itself, but in it's rating - I think the game got pretty much overrated by people saying that this \"is a new approach to the classic fairy tale with a lot of different paths to take\". Also that \"it's one of the best visual novels\". One thing I can agree with is that the art is really stunning. It was something new to see a visual novel made in this style and I think it really fits the game.\n\nOkay, now the not-so-great-things:\n\n1) They said it's not like a fairy tale... well okay, maybe they didn't, but I thought they would at least change the plot slightly so that e.g. you don't have to go to the prince in every route. Also I thought it fairly discouraging that you can't choose a lot of things... [spoiler] There are 4 types of different endings, in which you can either die, you can travel away or you can marry the prince. Also there is no \"happy end\" so to say... Well it's okay that there isn't though, but... [/spoiler] Well, I pretty much think that it is still the fairy tale...\n\n2) I felt that the plot was really rushed. You didn't have time to learn about the characters and you didn't have time to explore the environment. Also, I didn't quite like the pacing of the romance paths. The guard was a stranger to you, but you willingly chose to trust him [spoiler] even to travel with him [/spoiler]... And my, I think it's really naive... I wished there was more story... Also with the prince... [spoiler] why u go flirt with him, if you got another man waiting?? [/spoiler] 3) There was the feeling that they pretty much copy pasted, whenever they could, so at particular moments in the story the personality of the main and the other character just changes without reason....\n\nDo you still want to buy this game?\n\nWell, I'm not a jerk, so let's talk about the good points..\n\n1) The art is really amazing, like I said.\n\n2) The character are well done, expecially this is the reason, why I finished the game. Besides Cinders, who I found is a bit Mary Sue (idk, just my opinion), I really liked the description and the interaction with the other characters in the game. It is clearly visible that whoever wrote this, must have dealt with the human psyche a lot and succeeds in describing realistic characters, who are either nor good or bad and nor strong or weak. They have all their respectable opinions and struggle to live. My favorite was Sophia, who clearly shows that she can be a strong-willed woman, who has wits and who is trying to change her life little by little.\n\n\nFor my part, if you really want to play this game, buy it, when it's on sale. I got one route done in 3h, so I think it'll be 3-4h more to get everything else. \nAnd before you start judging: I DON'T THINK THE GAME IS BAD!

But after playing for a while I began to feel as if I was playing a preaching psychiatrist, not a teenage impoverished noble. Cinders' insights are rather amazing at times - as a teenager were you likely to understand why the school bully picked on you? - and her dialogue tended to become very \"I know what is wrong with you, and if you listen to me, I will tell you how to fix yourself\". At first I kind of thought it was interesting how fair Cinders was trying to be with her stepsisters. \"We were both wrong and if we acknowledge that, we can start having a positive relationship\" sounds great, but it starts feeling very out of place for the character and setting. Not to mention when Cinders isn't being wise, she is whining about her life. Not that she doesn't have some reason to whine, but it is disconcerting to jump from Wisdom to Whining. \n\nThe other problem I had with the game, was that no matter what choices you make, you go to the ball. Even if it doesn't make any sense for what it is you want to do. And when you get there, no matter what has happened between you and your family, their scenes are always the same. Your scene with the prince is the only thing that changes, except you only have like three potential scenes with him, despite the multitude of endings available. \n\nI did quite enjoy the concept of the \"Rewards\" where you get little pictures added to the start screen depending on which endings you have unlocked.\n\nFinally, the game always includes a perplexing scene between the shady figure and either the Fairy or the Witch (depending on which one you chose) that never really explains anything and seems to imply that any choice you make is not really the right one.", "timestamp_created": 1511707171, "timestamp_updated": 1511707171, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.631781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37389100": {"recommendationid": "37389100", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101588420", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508378888}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely LOVE this game.

A horrible stepmother and two unlikeable stepsisters...sounds familiar as it should because Cinders pays homage to \"Cinderella\", one of the most popular and beloved fairytales of all time. Cinders is a lovely young woman living out a quite mundane existence with her overbearing stepmother and two rude and constantly bickering stepsisters often wondering if life has something \"more\" in store for her. Tiring of the status quo of her current situation, she soon comes to a decision to make some changes...drastic changes that could possibly affect her entire life from this point forward forever. How will this fairytale end? This intriguing visual novel cleverly gives you the choices to shape Cinders personality while also determining how the story unfolds.\n\nVisually, this title is beautiful with a palette of bright colors and fantastic lighting that also compliments the gorgeous artstyle which I'm happy to report is not anime inspired considering that most of the visual novels that I've read on Steam to date have been. The characters themselves are wonderfully animated in that their eyes and mouths move during dialogue and the facial expressions vary accordingly to mood. Something else of note about Cinders that I've yet to see in any other V.N. is the animation applied to static objects in the backgrounds. For example, if a scene is taking place in a house, the fireplace is ablaze with flame while outside the window you can see trees and shrubery fluttering in the wind. Likewise in town, you'll notice birds flying about overhead as the lanterns on lamposts are gently swaying to and fro from a light breeze flowing through. This use of animation on normally still objects like this really serves well to immerse you within the story so my compliments to the developers for applying this terrific mechanic to the V.N.. The U.I. in this title is also quite impressive whether you're selecting choices in game or options in the menu screens. The sound effect, colors and animation used on something as simple as the selection process just looks and sounds excellent with beautiful sparkle effects attached. Speaking of sound, the original soundtrack by Rob Westwood is absolutely fantastic in this visual novel. I have no doubt that you will find many of these tracks quite memorable like myself. In short, the outstanding graphical and aural presentation of Cinders very much compliments the wonderful narrative of this great visual novel. \n\nAs \"Cinderella\" is one of my favorite fairytales I was extremely anxious to experience this unique take on the classic title. I very much enjoyed my read of Cinders from start to finish with it's compelling storyline and choices that actually matter and shape the narrative as you progress. I found myself connecting and really caring about what happens to her so it's always great when a V.N. can make you feel that way for a main character. I also thoroughly enjoyed many of the conversations between Cinders, her sisters and a few of the other N.P.C.'s in this title as they had some really thought provoking and hilarious dialogue. With over 120 decision points and multiple endings this visual novel has very high replayability. There are also a number of in-game trophies to be obtained but you'll have to discover for yourself how to unlock them as that is a total secret which is a nice additional feature. Option-wise, there are the basics for music, sound and text speed. There are a limited number of Steam Achievements to hunt down and Steam Trading Cards to collect as well. In conclusion, this V.N. takes a story that you've heard before and probably love but manages to add a unique and intriguing interactive spin to the narrative so Cinders is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to visual novel, fairytale and fantasy fans.", "timestamp_created": 1510476951, "timestamp_updated": 1510477021, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826817", "comment_count": "9", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36185588": {"recommendationid": "36185588", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055740888", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514967731}, "language": "english", "review": "If you like visual novels, you have to pick this one up!

It emphasizes that your chooices do make a differeance well not shoving it down your thoart or making you feel guilty when you make a \"evil\" or \"bad\" decision. Each character as their own voice and you and tell them apart by dialog thee sisters are sympathic And they make you understand the motivation of the step mother well still not condoning her actions. \nThough Cinders as a character herself is one of the weaker ones I think this is simply because of her roll She's too much personality to totally put yourself in her shoes but compared to the sisters, the mother, as well as Perrault and Madame Ghede she is diffently in the weaker tier. \nAs for the art. The backgrounds a lovely but the human characters too me a bit to get used to. The lip animations creeped me out and the eyes and lips have very strange propotions, and to me it seems everyone's arms are a bit short. Not to mentions some of the poses are a bit awkward. This is more of a personal taste but I would have liked the art a bit better if they had kept with the style in the title screen a bit more simple and elegant looking.\nFinally for me these games don't have a tone of replay value. Though I will say none of the ends I got so far could be defined as \"Good\" or \"Bad\" They both have a little bit of each in them which is nice. But I am totallly not intrested in any of the queen endings. Because like Cinders, the Prince is in the weaker teir. And I was happy with the endings I got.

Once you get past it being a western-made visual novel that doesn't have an anime artstyle, it's not really anything that hasn't been done better. The concept of a classic fairy tale with in-depth characters and new complexities has been done dozens of times and in more interesting ways to boot.\nFor starters, the characters: I like Sophia and the prince is an interesting take you don't see often (someone who is trying to create complete social reform with a lot of ambition but isn't portrayed as evil is oddly not portrayed often in media). Everyone else.....eh. The love interests that aren't the prince feel like they were put there for the sake of having more than one love interest. Gloria is failry generic. Carmosa really doesn't feel all that deep despite the game constantly telling me that there's more to her than meets the eye. Cinders feels like an attempt at having a capable female protagonist that remains feminine, but her only really strong and independant trait is that she isn't ever captured (meanwhile there are other similar female protagonists in visual novels, such as Code: Realize's Cardia, who manage to be portrayed as feminine but capable in spite of them being subjected to classic damsel-in-distress tropes). Everyone else ranges from meh to okay.\nThe art is...good? It is clearly done in a skillful manner, but something about it just feels uncanny valley, such as the way the eyes soullessly move back and fourth.\nThe music is honestly pretty forgettable.\nBut by far the worst trait about this game that makes me not recommend it is the endings. There are four endings, but there are numerous variations within those four endings. If you want to have every variation unlocked, you have to play the game all the way through 17 times at minimum (and if you don't use a guide, I could very easily see that number nearly doubling). And while that is a lot, it would be tolerable if it weren't for the fact that, aside from minor dialogue changes and the order some scenes happen, they all feel nearly identical. I got about 50% variation on all four endings before I decided to call it quits. And the worst part? You. Get. Nothing. For. Doing. It. There are only eight Steam Achievements in the game, for all eight in game rewards, none of which require you to get every ending variation.\nSo, in conclusion, this game has little to no value that isn't novelty.

You can be the nicest or toughest you want, the novel railroads you to a conclusion with regard to your stepmom and stepsisters. Are they well-written, well-rounded, kind of interesting? Sure. They're also massively frustrating, and the option to just leave town and join the army is not available (sadly).

I don't play a lot of visual novels but I've played some in the past and don't have anything against them, in fact liking some a lot (like Steins;Gate and Katawa Shoujo). This is not one of them and I do not recommend you play this unless you like being told what is right and how you should live your life by almost every character in an extremely preachy way - and what they preach is not exactly morally justifiable even; other reviews detail how the game consistently tells the player/main character that the abuser (the stepmother) is in the right and you should feel bad for wanting to rebel against her and take the house that is legally yours.\n\nTo clarify on my play length, I stopped playing after an hour and looked up videos to see if it got better, and from the conversations and scenes that I saw, it got worse so I didn't return.", "timestamp_created": 1492469411, "timestamp_updated": 1492469411, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31188243": {"recommendationid": "31188243", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000958288", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505593898}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a lovely little game.

No blood's in the shoe. The shoe's not too tight, This bride is right!\" - [i]Cinderella[/i], Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm[/b]\n\nAs the first of Moacube's visual novels, [i]Cinders[/i] is a roaring success both for its genre and as an example of literary deconstruction. I've been meaning to play this game for years, and now I did, I cannot stop myself from taking new playthroughs to unlock all ending variants, to see what else this game may have in store for me. This unconventional interpretation of the classical folktale [i]Cinderella[/i] breaks all stereotypes and social generalizations, presenting an in-depth analysis of all its characters and probable intervening dynamics. Kudos to the developer upfront!\n\nAt this point, everyone with a semi-European cultural understanding is familiar with the story of Cinderella. Poor, golden hearted young woman who is treated like a slave in her own home by her ambitious stepmother and evil stepsisters. All her kindness only meets with mistreatment until a fairy godmother appears to bless her with a magical dress, a pumpkin carriage and glass slippers to attend the ball of the Prince. There, she is to steal Prince's heart with a glance and become the queen of the kingdom after a short pursuit involving those glass slippers. There, happily ever after, right? Nope, not so much. The original story was a brutal one compared to the Disney-fied version anyhow, and with [i]Cinders[/i] now, we are in for a more realistic version of the old fairytale.\n\nHere, our protagonist' conditions are more or less the same with the original story. Her father has passed away, and now she is living with her stepmother and two stepsisters, whom treat her little better than a servant. She wishes to change her life, take the control of her future and decide the outcome of her own story though, rather than waiting for magic to happen! Sure, waiting for magic to happen is still our option, but just one of our options nonetheless. We are to live through a week of Cinders to witness the events just before the guard captain of his majesty knocks on our door. What happened to present such a necessity? Now, that is gonna be our choice. We will create a Cinders of our own. We'll make various choices, pick how to act towards whom and what to pursue in the way we chose. Eventually, we will meet one of the various endings appropriate for our personality.\n\nIn this glamorous visual novel, every single choice sincerely matters. Our actions determine our romance option - yup, we don't have to go happily ever after with the prince - , our character and eventually our own ending. Every single character involving - whether their role in the original story were small or grand - are reimagined into actual people, with their own personalities, background and aspirations. Did you ever think why the stepmother treated Cinderella the way she did? Just because she was evil? Or did you ever take a second glance at the captain of the guards? Why the fairy actually aided our girl the way she did? Because that's what fairies are supposed to do? Definitely not! Here, you are presented with a decent analysis of the story, stripped away from its embellishment and take a realistic approach to the situation, wrapped in genuine medieval context. The result is an incredible story with layers of characterization and perfect narrative with philosophical value.\n\nThe display is topnotch. All the artwork - both characters and the environment are fitting for a fairytale alright. Yet, this is not the strongest suit of the display. All character CG are presented in a way to maintain noteworthy body language and facial mimics, fortifying the narrative furthermore. Add a breathtaking soundtrack with various instrumental pieces of folk and epic music, and voila: here is a display environment you wouldn't grow tired of playing over and over again.\n\nNow, I've already noted that endings are various. There are mainly 4 endings: one fairytale, one lady of the house, one \u201cwhatever, I'm out of this place\" and one \"not so happy\". All these endings carry their own varieties within themselves however. According to the romance you pursue, the way you treated people and the amount of information you managed to gather by the end, you'll get a different variety of these endings. Every one of them can be tracked and re-read in the menu too.\n\nAt the end, [i]Cinders[/i] is one of the most imaginative, deep and successfully displayed visual novels that I've ever played. Even if you are not a fan of the genre, you may enjoy this one thanks to its narrative quality, depth and even sense of humor! At this point, I'll be looking forward for any VN that Moacube would throw my way.

No amount of witty dialogue could cover up the inherently bad-- and at times disturbing-- game writing.  \nThe game promised to add character depth to a familiar story, and it did-- to a point.  The stepsisters have a dynamic consistent with being raised by a manipulative, abusive mother who plays them against each other.  Lady Carmosa, the stepmother, is emotionally abusive in a realistic way.  Like many abusive people, she makes sure to micromanage the people that she's abusing, put them down, and try tell them constantly that they need her to treat them this way because of how pitiful/stupid/etc. they are.  Cinders mentions in the dialogue that she believes that Lady Carmosa is capable of killing, and it's implied in Carmosa's dailogue that she may have killed her second husband, so she represents a physical danger as well.\nThere's a point in the dialogue where Cinders is speaking to someone who knew her late mother.  It has already been established that her stepmother is abusive.  Cinders explains that she believes that she-- not her stepmother-- is the legal inheritor of the family estates.  I chose the option for wanting to get an attorney to get my house back.  Mom's friend promptly gave me a guilt trip about the \"consequences\" of such a harsh act when my stepmother was just keeping the family fortune together.  You know, the family fortune that wasn't even legally hers that she's only using to benefit herself.  Given the more realistic take on abuse dynamics that the writers had so far, I figured that this was intentional.  Abuse victims often hear similar things from third parties about why their husband/parent/etc. isn't such a bad person and they should be grateful.  I waited for the protagonist to have an opportunity to confront this clearly inappropriate behaviour.\nNope.  Wasn't happening.\nEvery time the option for getting an attorney to get my (expletive) house back came up, I clicked it.  Every time, I got an NPC guilt trip and dialogue to make sure that I knew that-- although there are officially no wrong choices in this game-- I had made a wrong choice.  Bad, BAD player wanting people to get stolen property back from their abuser through appropriate legal channels.  How could I!  No matter how many times you choose that option, you will not have the opportunity to seek legal assistance to get the family house which you believe you're the legal inheritor of back.  There's also this little bit of talking to herself that Cinders has about how she's materially better off than most of the women in town so maybe she should be grateful for the life that her stepmother has given her.  You know, because if an abusive person takes our stuff we should be grateful to the abuser for what they've deigned to give us.\nI played through the game just to be sure that there wasn't, you know, some upcoming branch in which the game would deal with the mess it made.

I appreciated that it focuses on the consequences of your character's developing personality, which you decide through dialogue and action choices, instead of focusing narrowly on the expected romantic relationship with \"Cinderella's\" prince. \n\nSome previous reviews criticized how the game punishes you monotonously for choosing \"the wrong\" character development choices. However, with that in mind, I noticed that the very 1st scene of the game, which foreshadows later events, hints at your win objective: your characters wonders if having a better relationship with the others in her life and making more empathetic yet pragmatic choices would have been better for her in the long-run. So, it's insinuated that the game will reward you for exploring her curiosity; punishing you when you're too romantic or too prejudiced. \n\nBut, there are issues with the game. It's fair for some to be disappointed that the game doesn't have good and bad ending for all the possible character arcs--romantic, headstrong, or pragmatic--when it invests so much in immersing you in the world and having you feel like you are the protagonist. It feels like the game is attacking you; not just the character you created. Also, if you have little tolerance for it, the overt callbacks to the original fairy tale by the protagonist and morality play can feel like it's hitting you over the head mercilessly. But, if you come in wanting what the adventure offers, it's good at what it intended to do.  \n\nI based this review off of Dizzi's gameplay.

I wanted to do so before posting my review of Cinders, as I usually like to complete a game as much as I can before I write a review. XD\n\nAnyway, as a fan of visual novel games, I'll be writing this review from that perspective. Without a doubt, Cinders is one of the best VNs I've had a chance of playing and this isn't an exaggeration. Upon starting a game, the first thing that one would notice right away is the art. It's absolutely beautiful, as though it came straight out of classic paintings. The art is different from those in other VNs in that it doesn't adopt the anime-style but because of the nature of the story, I believe it was a wise decision to steer away from the norm. The music as well was quite beautiful and I felt that it did fit for most of the characters. I only wish there had been a jukebox feature in the menu so players could have a chance to listen to various music pieces away from playing the game itself.\n\nWhat ends up sealing the deal for me, though, is the story. A VN must have an engaging story that I feel as though I can immerse myself in. It takes the classic story of Cinderella but adds a new twist to it. The protagonist, Cinders, doesn't have to be the helpless girl abused by her stepmother and stepsisters. The player can make decisions which shape Cinders' personality so she can range anywhere from being naive to cunning to rebellious. I loved the various branches that the games takes the player through so there are so many possible paths that one can take.\n\nIf there are any negatives, though, I'd say that there were a few typos here and there. I noticed a few grammar errors as well as some inconsistencies between using the American and British version of English words but honestly, these negatives are so minor. Although it certainly couldn't hurt to have the mistakes polished a bit, Cinders is such a beautiful, wonderful game itself that I can overlook them.\n\nI'm happy to see that Steam has made such a wonderful VN available to its community and I hope to see many more games from MoaCube in the future. ^^", "timestamp_created": 1484985175, "timestamp_updated": 1484985175, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29344836": {"recommendationid": "29344836", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255891085", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484695055}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall, Cinders was a joy to play. Some loveable characters, incredible art, charming music, and a fun retelling of Cinderella.\n\nGame Elements: First and foremost, Cinders is a game. It offers many choices to influence the outcome of the game, and the outcomes themselves are varied enough to offer plenty incentive for multiple playthroughs. The skip mode is nicely implemented, as it stops automatically on text you haven't seen before. However, it doesn't really do anything unique for its genre.\n\nStory and characters: It's good, but not great. Some fantastic character development with the sisters, but the love interests and the stepmother could use work. \n---------------Spoilers Ahead!\nCarmosa, the stepmother, as you could imagine, treats Cinders deplorably, but we aren't provided with much of a motive as to why she acts this way. Yes, Cinders is not a biological daughter, but that does not preclude Carmosa from treating Cinders with respect. What's more obnoxious about this is that the game writing hints to the player that we should understand Carmosa's actions and respect her for it! It's little things, however, that make this a contradictory stance for the game: Carmosa could have fed her daughters smaller portions of dinner rather than feeding Cinders cold scraps; Carmosa's daughters could wear cheaper dresses so Cinders could wear something other than rags. It does not make sense for Cinders to respect Carmosa in this game unless she forgets the way Carmosa has treated her, and so the Carmosa as advisor ending makes no sense.\nGloria and Sophie, however, are excellent characters with natural growth through the course of the game. Gloria is seemingly cruel but just trying to live up to her mother by copying her, and in the way loses herself; Sophie is bitter and cynical because Gloria and her mother constantly criticize her and so her self esteem is ruined. Cinders has the option to help both of them grow in the game by encouraging Gloria to explore her interests and encouraging Sophie to be proud of her intelligence and intellectualism. I was also impressed by their complex relationship with Carmosa, since they loved her for what she's done for them (climbing the social ladder so they could have a better life), but they also resent her for not letting them to be free to do as they wish. It culminates in the Grand Ball, where Sophie ultimately decides she doesn't want what her mother wants for her, and Gloria doesn't know if she wants it, either.\nNow the love interests. Let's start with Tobias, the childhood friend. He's got plenty of enjoyable one-liners and pleasant dialogue, should you interact with him. However, I never learn to trust him quite as much as Cinders does in his romance route. He puts his business ethics before Cinders's trust, worrying that she might ruin his reputation as a merchant. This is not a good start to a loving, trusting relationship. He wants to run away with Cinders in order to help her out in the traveler arc, but it would have been nice for his character development if we knew of some reason that he would want to run away from it all, much as Cinders wanted to run away in the Perrault traveler route. Maybe Tobias couldn't stand living in his hometown anymore; maybe he's actually not as honest as he appears, and he has some shady business he's running away from. I think my favorite route for him is Cinders as a noblewoman that marries her, as it seems totally believable that he would lend her a lot of money for social events and later marry her since they're in the same town. I do not like him as a lover to Queen Cinders, but that's because I'm trying to piece how they would stay in contact at court before he becomes a count.\nOh, Perrault. So many conflicting feelings. My absolute favorite ending is Perrault as the lover to the Machiavellian Queen Cinders, as it is incredibly believable that she would continue to see him after she becomes queen. He's an interesting character, indecisive on whether he likes killing and duty, but he would be improved by being more human and less tropey. I believe the true happy ending is Cinders adventuring with Perrault, btw ;)\nAnd the Prince. So much could have happened! He was a good character with lots of potential! But then he focused on Cinders's looks at the ball... I would've liked to see him spy on her after the ball to determine if she was truly smart, if he was so committed to personality. He just needed more. And he doesn't deserve any ending where he isn't happy. He has to have at least a few flaws!\nI think the rest of the cast is sufficiently likeable, with the exception of Shady Character. He baffles me. Where'd he come from?\nAnd finally, we have.... Cinders!! I love that she's so moldable depending on the player's actions. She can be aggressive and a trail-blazer, or she can be docile and simple. And the text is sufficiently clear that I know the outcome of my actions on Cinders's personality before they're revealed to me. A+.\n-----End Spoilers----\nOverall, Story is 7/10, and Characters are 6/10. There's a bit too much going on in plot and not enough going on in character reasoning/development for why they act the way they act.\n\nVisuals and Sound\nThis is where the game shines. The art style is stunning! The characters are all beautiful, and the landscapes are all engrossing. For the average person, there's not much more to ask for. Now, from the perspective of an artist, there is more that could go into the art design. The characters suffer from what I like to call \"Same Face Syndrome\": they all have the same face and differ in how they dress. What if Perrault had a hooked nose? Or Sophie's lips were super thin and had no cupid's bow? This isn't a huge deal, but it is something that I would like to see addressed in future releases. And for a bonus: Tobias's left hand looks super weird. \nThe soundtrack is really fun and fitting, but there could be more sound effects to provide immersion.\nOverall, Visuals are 8.5/10 and Sound is 7/10.\n\nEnjoyment\nDespite its flaws, it's still a very enjoyable game and a gem in the visual novel genre. I went and replayed it for all the different endings! I'd give it a total 7/10.", "timestamp_created": 1484775040, "timestamp_updated": 1484775040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29078037": {"recommendationid": "29078037", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048136838", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 429, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483762414}, "language": "english", "review": "It was a pretty fun story and great characterizations.

My one caveat is that you should snag this game on sale or as part of a bundle, as I'm not sure most people will find it justifies its full price.\n\nFirst, you should know that this game is a lot of reading relative to the interaction time.  As the game warns you about in the begining, this is more like a book where you can make some choices to change the ending, rather than a typical point-n-click story where you are making choices constantly.  Luckily, it has a very nice \"fast forward\" option for skipping dialgoue you've already seen on playthroughs, which is something that is lacking in many similar games and is amazingly wonderful if you're hunting down other endings.\n\nI like the concept of this game; building my own Cinders' personality and making my own choices and creating my own ending.  I also liked the take on the stepsisters as more than just evil sadists, and actually was fond of Sophie in particular.  It is a nice retake on a fairy tale in a less black & white perspective, especially since you can deivate significantly from the classic tale by making Cinders \"bad\" or reject the prince, etc.\n\nThe art is also beautiful, although I wish there had been more than a few backdrops, and a few characters whose faces and arms where animated.  I do like that there was some movement and facial expression over static art, just to keep things interesting through a lot of dialgoues boxes with otherwise identical visuals.  But like anything good, I want more than just a small taste of it!\n\nThe dialgue can be repetative, cliche, and predictible, but I didn't think it was totally awful (there was even a joke about the Captain's belts that genuinely made me laugh out loud).  Could it have been better?  Sure.  Did I find it turn me off from the game?  Nah.  Another review also complained that the writing was too blatant and the foreshadowing too obvious, but I find this preferrable in these types of games, otherwise it is too challenging and uninuititive to guide the story in the direction you desire.  While the choices are not always clear how they will affect the ending and you don't always get exactly what you were aiming for in this game, some opacity makes the gameplay more interesting.  There is a fine balance and I think the game gets it decently well.\n\nThe one change I would have made to this game would have been to add more frequent interactions with more choices.  They could have been additional conversation selections that were meaningless as far as the outcomes were concerned but valuable in terms of increasing replayability and creating more dynamic character personalities.  I think adding a number of trivial dialogue choices in between the \"important\" decisions would make players feel more engaged, break up the large amounts of reading, and make Cinders feel more realistic to each individual's vision of her.  There are already a huge amount of possibilities in terms of the endings, so I'm hesitant to wishlist for anything that increases those, but it would have been nice to have more options to influence the fates of more people in more ways.\n\nOverall, I quite liked this game and am glad I bought and played it.

I've played it a few times over the past couple years - whenever I feel like being whisked away into this magical, yet very realistic, fairytale world, and it never fails to make me smile.  It's always the first game I recommend to my friends that like choice driven VNs or fairytales.\n\nThe scenes are beautifully drawn in a sort of pastel style with vibrant colors to help set the mood.  The music is good too and very immersive.  Most importantly, the story is well-written.  The language can be a bit over-wrought at times, but that just adds to the old fairytale/literature feel.\n\nThere are quite a few ways the story can go, depending on your choices, and it's not always clear which choice made the diffference, but that's part of the charm for me.  It's not necessarily about where you wind up (it's definitely possible to get an unsatisfying ending), but about the journey of how you got there.  Each time I play, I feel like I learn something new about the characters and the world.  There were actually whole storylines I didn't even know existed on my first playthrough that made it pretty fun to play again.  Most of the characters are pretty intricate and more than willing to give you their soliliquy on life if you prod them the right way... or offer you a brutally scathing retort if you don't.  A few of them are really funny too!  Best of all, Cinders, herself, is a pretty relatable and empowering character with her own quirks and insecurities.  I could definitely see myself in her shoes (or glass slippers) if I lived in her fairy world.

For example, is the choice you picked \"good,\" \"bad,\" or \"naive?\" The lack of labelling makes the game a bit more challenging to get all the endings. If you are looking for a quick playthrough for 100% completion, you may have to go online if you don't want to do it through trial and error.\n\nOverall amazing game with great relationships, story, and visuals.

Just overall great execution, artwork, characters and storyline.\n\nDespite being built upon the old fairy tale, Cinders really went past the original in terms of storyline and setting (won't spoil it), I feel- while still being very faithful to the setting of the original, I feel. Or rather, Cinders established a believeable universe in which Cinderella would have occured, explained and went into detail on the otherwise normally supporting characters (the stepmother and sisters, the prince, the fairy godmother(s)), making them all not just believeable but very real and alive in the story itself. For such a short average playthrough (guesstimating 2~ hrs on the first run) everything really just fit in place so well.\n\nThe characters, as mentioned already, are exceptional. Even the typical villain (the stepmother and sisters) has complex motivations or reasoning- not to say they are morally ambiguous as I feel is a common flaw in such themes, but that their origins, their personal feelings whether right or wrong, their ambitions, etc... drive them. They're humans and they're inherently flawed, I guess. It seems like you really can reason, if you pursue it far enough, with any of them, really- even befriend them and mend the relationship. And the controlling family dynamic and how it affected each sister I also found a really unique take on such an environment. I found myself not really hating anyone in particular, [i]eventually.[/i]\n\nAll in all:\n\n+Excellent storyline and believeable, relateable characters. Just really well put together overall\n+Great art, personally enjoy the stylistic approach taken as well if that counts for anything\n+Some decent form of replayablity, I feel- I think I'll be coming back to this one\n\nCan't really think of any negatives to this.

That's not to say it's without faults but it's a very good take on the genre.\n\nPros:\n- The artwork. It's gorgeous, it's original, it's great.\n- Player agency. You have choices and they matter (GASP!). You get to see the consequences of some choices soon after making them, other later on but it's so rewarding to have a story that can go in so many different directions.\n- Endings. No 'secret' or 'true' ending, your choices can lead to an ending that fully reflects the kind of character you wanted Cinder to be and that ending can be good or bad depending on your actions.\n- The NPCs. They are more than one-trick ponies whose one-sided personality is the end-all be-all of whom they are.\n- Info. The information you get from certain actions can be used later on, if you choose, leading to a lot of branching in how you play.\n\nCons:\n- The labels. It's NOT an RPG. Labeling it as such is misleading to people who are looking for RPGs in the store. It's a visual novel, do not be fooled. (Yes, you take on the 'role' of Cinder but then EVERY game is an RPG and the label loses its meaning, not helping anyone anymore.)\n- The romance. If you're gonna add romance options, make them good. There could have been more depth to this aspect of the game as a lot of it was not as fleshed out as I could have wished.\n- The variation. With so much variations there's a lot of aspects of the story that are simply introduced and then not really explored, this is a real shame as some of them are really interesting.\n\nIn conclusion: I don't have a lot of gripes with this game as I truly enjoyed it.

Can't remember my exact time of my first run, but I think it was somewhere around 4 hours or more (my on-record-hours are off by several). \n\nNeutral\n- Many of the game's choices change character personality rather than storyline-- which is an interesting decision. The result is different flavoring in the endings. \n- The replay-ablity is decent. I'd say you could get 3 pretty solid play-throughs before too much of it starts to repeat. \n- Writting is better than it is worse. Though some converstations are too drawn out (see below). \n\nCons:\n- Cinder's posture is TERRIBLE. Stand up straight, gurl. I caNNOT STAND IT.\n- As mentioned by several others, the game does get preachy at times in conversation, making it feel tedious.

Not completely, but most VNs I've played just throw you headfirst into relationships with little to no development; so I'm glad they tried, even if it didn't totally work out that way. \n\nAll-in-all: A good visual novel.

Subsequent games go quickly as the Ctrl key allows portions of text you've previously read to be skipped.\n\nMy two complaints:\n[*]One - The writing. \nThe writing is not bad, it just needs improvement. There are quite a few typos; you can easily discern what is meant, but they are a distraction. To the developer's credit, there is a discussion in the community hub where typos can be submitted, but this game was released a few years ago, and more than enough typos remain to make me wonder if a patch was ever applied. Where is the game text stored? I'll edit typos for a reasonable rate.\n\nWith typos removed, I find the readability level directed towards younger readers. You won't find many big words, or stretch your vocabulary. This is not bad, as it makes for an easy read, and likely makes for a larger audience. I would have preferred the text to be geared more towards an adult audience.\n\n[*]Two \u2013 Some of the Choices / Paths\nOne that stands out to me is Cinders relationship with her younger sister Sophia. In one playthrough I felt I made some real progress in rebuilding a normal relationship between the two.

Of course, if she is not careful, her actions might just blow up in her face.", "timestamp_created": 1450616688, "timestamp_updated": 1450616705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780791", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19775453": {"recommendationid": "19775453", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166861770", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468083872}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely artwork, great story, and dialogue.", "timestamp_created": 1450502816, "timestamp_updated": 1450502816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19684943": {"recommendationid": "19684943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247347122", "num_games_owned": 204, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 567, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1448590879}, "language": "english", "review": "A western visual novel with a retelling of Cinderella through a different angel.", "timestamp_created": 1450047275, "timestamp_updated": 1450047275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.394536", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19671486": {"recommendationid": "19671486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004003717", "num_games_owned": 514, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425829865}, "language": "english", "review": "Cinders is a visual novel solid in every way and that's rare.\n\nFirst of all, it's gorgeous. I'm not teaching anything if you already glanced at the screenshots but it needs to be said because it's actually pretty important. Many visual novels have a cheap look, and I personally feel that it has a really negative impact on my enjoyment of the story. In Cinders you want to move forwards just to see the next picture.\n\nBut it's not just window dressing either. The writing is also great, and I do mean it. All the characters and situations are believable, the premise was enough to hook me in and the world is an interesting place to discover. It's nice for a change to play something that you never did before when many visual novels are pretty iterative.\n\nFinally, the choices. Nothing to write home about, but they are there and they are significant. I actually prefer something that really allows me to put my mark on the story rather than thousands of endings for the sake of it. It's good and having the opportunity to twist such an iconic story is a great pleasure.\n\nTo conclude, this game is amazing. Maybe even one of those niche games good enough to be enjoyed by someone who usually don't play them.\nA little caveat nonetheless: despite all my praises, I think the price is too steep.

It is not only an amazing visual novel with a dark, mature take on the story of Cinderella, but also contains elements of dating sims and roleplay as well.  I really enjoyed the wide ranges of decisions to make along with the variations of multiple endings.  Not to mention the dialogue is very well written, with very deep philosophical tones and also some comical moments as well - especially with a few fourth wall breakings.  All in all, this is a very good visual novel and certainly won't be disappointing.\n\nPros:\n- Beautiful artwork - every character and background is absolutely gorgeous\n- Nice subtle animation - it really helps bring the novel to life and draws more attention \n- Amazing soundtrack - I would purchase the soundtrack if they offered it \n- Interesting Storyline - has a nice, dark twist to Cinderella while also including elements such as identity, self-empowerment, independence, decisions, and more.  It's not only a story, it's plenty of food for thought as well.\n- Variety of Decisions - there are so many to make and it really helps drive the story in different directions, which makes things all the more interesting.\n- Great Character Development - all of the characters have a distinct appearance and personality and it really shows not only visually, but in their dialogue.  It's fascinating to get to know them and it also helps them feel very real.  This part was truly amazing.\n- Replay Value - you get different achievements from different decisions and different endings, so there's a nice challenge\n\nCons:\n- The dialogue can get a little repetitive at some points.  There's some parts where a character will emphasize something and then it will be emphasized again and again.  This part makes the subject they're emphasizing a little too drawn out.  \n- Replay Value can feel tedious if already played through trying to get the achievements.  \n- Personally, I wish it was longer.  \n\nOverall, this is a very charming visual novel with many great qualities in terms of aesthetic artwork, intriguing storyline, and heartfelt character development.", "timestamp_created": 1445825957, "timestamp_updated": 1445825957, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18681114": {"recommendationid": "18681114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991263358", "num_games_owned": 2539, "num_reviews": 146, "playtime_forever": 83, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405283352}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPfvoUXVCG4&list=PL3g25GfHOMYdA9Nvn6wr6lQ21LWW9Wa7U&index=13", "timestamp_created": 1445794032, "timestamp_updated": 1445794032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477778", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18680420": {"recommendationid": "18680420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249095142", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445882416}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a cute game and I really like the art.

This game, however, is not even close to being a dating sim (although there are different romance options you can choose to pursue) and the art style is miles away from anime and very beautiful.\n\nThe story is a retelling of the Cinderella fairytale with a lot more depth, featuring well-rounded characters, complicated familial relations and meaningful choices. It emphasizes the extent to which characters' personal choices are limited by/the product of their circumstances and surroundings. The wicked stepmother and stepsisters are not simple archetypal chracters but complex figures with motivations and agendas that arise from their life circumstances. The main character Cinders, the young woman who lives as a servant in her own house, is trying to take destiny in her own hands and break free from her current circumstances, but cannot do so without outside help. The game makes a point: despite her desire to be independent and have agency, her available options are nevertheless to some extent the product of particular conditions that are outside of her influence (of her father marrying as he did, of her mother ensuring Cinders gets help when she needs it, etc). \n\nThe writting is very good and the choices in the game are meaningful; I found replaying the game to explore different results very interesting.

You may even end up sympathizing them when you know what are the motivations behind their actions, which you don't actually see much in some other Cinderella stories - where the step family is just mean because potatoes.\nAlso the art in this game is just amazing, backgrounds are like atmospheric paintings... character art is nice too but sometimes the anatomy is maybe a bit awkward. But that is just nitpicking.\n\n[b](Small spoiler warning)[/b] Another thing what I liked about in the game is that it has few different endings, and none of them are actually truly happy endings... well maybe one could be counted as almost perfectly happy ending.

Also, for a game that seems to be trying to tout strong female characterization, the female characters in here sure are huge assholes. Not one of them is likable. \nIssues elsewhere include: only 8 save slots even though you get prompted for a choice every two minutes (filled all my saves in less than 20 minutes), protagonist's dialogue arbitrarily switches from outward conversation to internal narration with absolutely no visual or audio indicators, backgrounds have perspective completely wrong (for it to be right the camera POV would have to be at thigh-height, at least 15 meters away from the characters, which is absurd), no volume adjustment, only 3 text speed settings. \nThe only good things about it are the menu and background animations, which are pretty great, but it's unfortunate that they're wasted on this game.\nps: The wandering eyes and some of the expressions are really disturbing sometimes. http://puu.sh/idvkg.jpg\npss: Typos.

In Cinders, while still mostly despicable, they are fleshed out and given realistic motivations for their actions and that helps the whole tale resonate much more.

Cinders feels short but it does have a good story/alternate endings.\n\nArtwork - 9.5/10.\n\n* Cinders' facial anatomy is uneven in an unnattractive way and some expressions make her eyes rotate which uh they don't do in real life. Also the prince has a lazy eye.\n\n* Overall graphically the game looks great. It really does, it has a french painting type feel to the entire game, and it has wonderful coloring/shading [spoiler]Though the ballgowns were lazy recolorings with different lace/necklaces. Boring. Where's the creativity!?[/spoiler]\n\nStory/Gameplay - 8/10. \n\n* The story does change depending on what choice you make, but without looking up the wikia page of Cinders, there's  no way of knowing what skill you gain or didn't gain by choosing that option. It isn't always obvious what the smart/bad/good choices were. \n\n* Having a meter on the left side of the page would be super helpful as there's a lot of unused space there. (Spoiler following.) [spoiler](Getting the \"fair\" queen ending especially, as well as the Machiavellic Queen endings. First playthrough I had the Evil queen four times before figuring out what I was doing wrong. :/ Not fun. It made things extremely frustrating for me. [/spoiler]\n\n* Half point loss for me is lacking the ability to go back and see moments such as the (spoiler)[spoiler]Ball gowns and dancing with the prince at the end of the game.[/spoiler]. For me collecting the extra scenes/memories is half the fun in VN's. Cinders lacks this.\n\n* Half point loss also goes to the fact that the game controls are NOT the same as -most- other VN's, Having skip be keybound to left CTRL is a major annoyance, as the windows key is right beside it for my computer. :/  plus due to the location of the windows key on a US based keyboard. left control is not optimal.[/spoiler]\n\nMusic - 6/10. \n* The music does not loop seamlessly and it is quite noticeable, not to mention there is NO IN GAME VOLUME ADJUSTMENT OPTION. The game's music by default is -too loud.- This game lacks voice acting, so I did expect more out of the music in the game. \n\nPossible Bugs and updates to think about? - \n\n* When in the options menu, right clicking in attempt to return back to the game. causes the screen resolution of the game in windowed mode to switch resolution, which might be intentional but is very annoying especially to those of us who play many other VN's and right click normally exits menus/enters them no matter which page you're on.\n\n * The steam overlay is missing the ability to resize itself to the size of the window, meaning that it's rendered entirely useless the user is playing in full screen, which some may do, but I personally dislike doing as I often have friends in other chat clients, and as such may need to alt-tab to a different window. There's a fix for this although I'm not sure how, I do know that it does resize in other games however.\n\n* The text speed is uneven at times or lags and suddenly slingshot-text superspeeds across the UI screen, which made me skip several lines while on autoplay in Normal. AND I could not scroll back far enough to re-read/ There's no actual Script page with the full scene. As such - had I not already played Cinders once, I would have been entirely lost on the story. There's a limit to how fast a person can read, even on the Normal speed it would randomly speed up. Also the auto  play option did not last long enough/went past long paragraphy sentences in the same amount of time for a short sentence. Again made me miss some text. This isn't new to the steam release either. It's been there since I purchased the game originally. Pleeaaaase at the very least fix this.\n\n* If you attempt to skip text by pressing control once or twice the dialogue box disappears entirely, which obviously skipping text so whatever. But - when doing so sometimes the UI text box would be -gone- which also made the text-skip for that part of the game super quick. Bug methinks.\n\n---\n\nAs a final note:\n\nI'd like to mention that the Cinders for letting older users get Cinders on Steam instead of having to repurchase. :) That is  awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1435189528, "timestamp_updated": 1435189721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16686585": {"recommendationid": "16686585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043846522", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435025555}, "language": "english", "review": "I waited so long to be able to play this game, and it was definitely worth the wait.

Cinders also stood out as she was a very likeable protagonist, with a lot of personality. \n\nThe major con of this game is it's length, there are relatively few endings, it would have been nice to see more possible love interests/lifestyle paths for Cinders as a lot more of it is based on who is allied with her at the end and whether she is good, or bad.

It has all the elements of Cinderella: A ball, a prince you can pursue, evil stepsisters and stepmother, and a fairy godmother. However, Cinders herself is a strong, optimistic, and self-reliant woman capable of taking her future into her own hands. Her stepsisters and stepmother are well developed characters that you can get to know and maybe even understand. The fairy godmother isn't perfect and neither is the prince. Add to that the Captain, the town witch, and Cinder's old friend the merchant, and you have a variety of extremely interesting characters with their own stories and complicated relations to you and each other. Throughout the game, your interactions with them and your decisions for Cinders helps her decide which path to freedom to take. Each broad ending has a variety of unique and lovely sub-types.\n\nIf this hasn't told you this game is worth playing, then add to that the lovely artwork with small background animations and very realistic and expressive character art, the beautiful music, and the tiny fact that the dialogue speed matches the speed of the character speaking. This last fact really helps you mentally hear how people are speaking. Honestly, it's as close as you can get to voice acting without actually having voice acting in it.\n\ntl;dr Go play Cinders.

Turns out, it's a re-imagining of the tale of Cinderella. And it is a visual novel, where your choices have an actual impact on the story.\n\n[b]Graphics / art - 5/10[/b]\nLet me get this out of the way since this is what first pulled me in. Mmmm ... not that impressive at the end of the day. Most of the characters look a little weird, and there's just not much animation. I know it's a visual novel, but it feels like they could have done a little more. So it's not bad, just not quite up to its potential in this area.\n\n[b]Story / characters - 8/10[/b]\nThe story itself is slightly adapted, and I have to say the developers did a great job. The wicked stepmother and the two evil stepsisters are actual characters with personalities, and through the story you can understand some of the reasons why they behave as they do. Truly a tremendous spin on a stale old tale.\n\nThe developers also get into why there is a ball, which is pretty interesting.\n\nThe most annoying character is probably Cinders herself. In some ways she behaves like any normal person in a shitty situation would. However, other times she's a bit whiny and preachy.\n\nMy favorite character was actually the stepmother. She's less of a demon when you get to know her reasoning and motivations. And her drive is impressive.\n\nThe side characters beyond the main ones (Cinders and her step-family being the core characters), are less interesting, and it seems like there are some interesting mysteries into their backgrounds that unfortunately don't get fleshed out. Like what the relationship is between Cinder's mother and some of the other side characters. What happened to Cinder's mother?\n\n[b]Gameplay - 10/10[/b]\nAs with most visual novels, it's mostly reading. However, at key points you get to make decisions. I wish I had read about the game before playing to better appreciate the impact of decisions. It would have let me know how important it is to use all of your (I think) 10 save slots so that you don't have to restart the story from the beginning to find all the endings.\n\nBasically, you can be good, neutral or evil based on your decisions. And your decisions impact your route to the ball, which suitor you end up with, and whether you're even happy at the end. I overwrote a lot of my old saves as I went along, so I was really limited in my endings. However, I think there are a total of about 12 variations.\n\nPretty incredible, eh? The game itself isn't amazing, but when you realize how the developers freshened up the source material, you can't help but be impressed!\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1425653422, "timestamp_updated": 1425653422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14739693": {"recommendationid": "14739693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080760796", "num_games_owned": 725, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466918396}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my FAVORITE STEAM GAME EVER!!!

Every choice matters. \n\nThe only real fault I had with this game was the atrocious writing. It was painful--unrealistic language, blatant foreshadowing, laughable and sometimes downright confusing conversations. The makers of this game went so far into making sure that the player was aware of the nuances of each character that they beat you over the head with them, and then beat the horse you rode in on too. I like subtle, complex characterization, and character growth should be something developed over time and with a touch more realism. Rather than creating nuanced dialogue the game screams it at you, and then has the main character repeat it to herself in her alone time just to make sure you didn't misunderstand anything.\n\nI paid $4 for this game via Humble Bundle , and spend roughly 3 hours doing two playthroughs (with numerous bouts of getting up for pizza and tea).

I have tried it and I have to say that I'm slightly disapointed with the experience. I mean, don't get me wrong, the game itself is quite nice, it has wonderful artwork, the characters and scenario are very well made but, to me, it just lacks a few touches that would make it even more special. \n\nOne of the things that really bothered me right from the start was the awful sound you get when the text is being shown. After awhile it almost feels like needles in your brain! Since I couldn't take it I turned it off and to my surprise there wasn't a single alternative other than pure silence. Like I mentioned before, I have played similar games and most of them have someone reading the lines, which makes it less boring and easy on the eyes. I mean, lets face it, having to read several lines from beginning to end can get extremely boring after awhile. Especially since most people will have to do multiple playthroughs and the game doesn't offer a proper way of skipping the lines you already read. Yes, you have the option to re-read the previous line but you can't skip to the next. You can click several times to make the text appear a bit faster but imagine doing that, pretty much, from beginning to end...\n\nI believe the game should have other small touches such as background noises. For example, when we have the outdoor scenes it would be nice to have the sound of birds, wind, etc; when attending the ball at the palace we could have music playing, people talking or when Cinders is at home, in her room the sound of the fire in the fireplace.

The choices you make really do matter. The world will unfold around you according to the decisions you make\u2014and you will always be aware of how they affect what occurs next.

The characters are complex, disturbed, scarred, & much more. None of the characters are simply good or bad. They reach out and play with your emotions as if they were flesh & blood. \n\nThe artwork in [i]Cinders[/i] is colorful & vibrant. You\u2019ll oftentimes find yourself looking at the background scenery, to catch a look at the swaying shrubbery, or the flickering fire.

Your stepmother and stepsisters are more than just villians, they are characters/people with lives and motivations that you can choose to understand/learn about or not. The other characters you meet in the story also have histories and distinct personalites. Cinders' relationships with other characters are also affected by choices you make. References to the past/history are very fluidly revealed in conversations with people. The game does not just dump a bunch of backstory on you for seemingly no reason. The game is also filled with some excellent dry humor, and amusing banter.\n\nGameplay:\nIf there is a game where literally every choice has an impact, big or small, this is it. There are multiple personality types for Cinders (I've discovered three) that are shaped by the choices you make. Cinders' personality type will affect certain dialogues, the availability of certain choices, and the consequences of certain choices. Certain scenes or dialogues with other characters will also change depending on previous choices you have made. There are multiple endings with several variants of each, and it does not come down to one or two \"big choices\" at the end or anything simple like that. Whether or not you succeed in achieving your desired specific ending is dependent upon the cumulative effects of choices you have made throughout the game. That being said, the replay value is very high, in my opinion. I have enjoyed replaying it to find the different endings/variants and get the achievements.\n\nThe only downsides in terms of gameplay are minor, but still exist. There is no good \"rewind\" function. If you missed a line, or want to return to read an earlier part of the conversation, you are limited. The game is divided into \"scenes\" probably for program/design sake. However, you cannot scroll further back than the first line of your current \"scene.\" This could be several lines back, or just one. Fast-forward is sub-optimal. It just cycles through dialogue at rapid speed until you come to a scene/line you haven't viewed or a choice. You can't \"skip to next scene\" or \"skip to next choice\" which is disappointing on replays.\n\nPresentation:\nThe artwork is pretty, from the character portraits to the backgrounds and facial expressions change over the course of conversations. The music is good, and fits the scenes quite well. My only gripe was that introducing a character meant briefly interrupting a scene to focus on the character on a leafy-flower design background and a change in music that felt a little out of place.\n\nPros:\n+ Story\n+ Characters\n+ Artwork\n+ Choices & Consequences\n+ Replay Value\n\nCons:\n- Limited/sub-optimal fast-forward and rewind functions\n- Awkward character \"introductions\"", "timestamp_created": 1422383938, "timestamp_updated": 1422383938, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14187703": {"recommendationid": "14187703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159901669", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443965813}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u97f3\u4e50\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u4e5f\u5f88\u6f02\u4eae\u3002\u4ee3\u5165\u611f\u6ee1\u5f3a\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1422337209, "timestamp_updated": 1422337209, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505550", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14174125": {"recommendationid": "14174125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128392991", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445167199}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love reading, so for me, this made the game all the more interesting.

A stunning and interesting adaptation of Cinderella, Cinders is a visual novel and Choose Your Own Adventure story that captures, in a grown-up way, the spirit you had and the magic you felt reading as a child. The only two things creating this world are artwork and music, as the dialogue \u2013 the heart of the game \u2013 is all text. Surprisingly, I did not come across many grammatical errors, and being the English major I am, I was certainly looking. Editors have done quite the job. The storytelling was thoughtful and well-crafted; the writing was intelligent and contained more adult humour than I expected. In the short period of time it took to get through the first playthrough (roughly five hours), the writing delved into the pasts of a few characters and built them up to be more than just one-dimensional. \n\nThough most of the art is static, the odd flicker of the fireplace, shimmer of water or subtle eye and lip movements somehow bring it entirely to life. Though more colourful and detailed, the artwork does remind me of that which you would find in old hardcover fairytale books. The ambient music is absolutely beautiful and changes with each scene, though because it was the only auditory element it did have me longing for even more variety at times (as the songs are repeated); I wish the soundtrack contained even more. \n\nThough based on a traditional story with a subdued and passive female protagonist, this modern adaptation takes some unexpected and satisfying departures and shines more light on the complex relationships between the characters and Cinders\u2019 struggle for independence and thirst for freedom. There is a focus on family and the conflicts between taking care of others and taking care of oneself. The heart of the story is finding one\u2019s own path in life and understanding that each choice you make has a consequence, either immediately or in the future, for both yourself and those around you. In this way, the replay value of this game is pretty spectacular: it has four possible endings.

I've always criticized Cinderella as a character for being one of the most passive protagonists in the history of fairy tales, but in this game you can make her to be the woman you always wanted her to be. She also doesn't always have to marry the prince and sometimes the ending isn't going to be happy. You could even die and have no one mourn over you. The possibilities are vast, giving it lots of replay value. All the art is gorgeous to look at as well so oftentimes I just stop reading and take in the scene.\n\nThe developers were right in advertising this game as a \"mature\" take on the fairy tale, as all the characters are ambiguous. You can never truly figure each of them out and most of the time, they will surprise you. The game does a wonderful job of consistently claiming that no one is so simple as \"good\" or \"evil\" and even the kingdom is going through a metamorphosis if you pay attention to the Prince's plot. Speaking of which, the writing is downright brilliant and atmospheric since it is a western visual novel. There are unfortunately no voices, but little nuances in what the characters say give your imagination plenty to give the characters voices of your own.\n\nIf you enjoy visual novels with emphasis on dialogue choices, protagonist identity, relationships, and no stat building, definitely buy this game. I hate tedious stat building myself and much prefer making decisions through dialogue. All relationships are accessible provided you have made the choices to develop them; they don't rely on you being \"cute\" enough or \"intelligent\" enough.

It's not overly long (2.5 hours per playthrough depending on your speed and choices), and gives you hints as to how diverse the story could be on multiple playthroughs. This diversity of narrative is suggested through a collection of trophies that correlate to particular plot points that you unlock through role-playing in different ways. I've played through the game twice and have still only unlocked 3 of the 8 possible tropies, and definitely plan on playing through this game a few more times.\n\n4/5 - Would thoroughly recommend to any fans of this genre of game, but also to anyone contemplating trying it.", "timestamp_created": 1421666120, "timestamp_updated": 1421666120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13986125": {"recommendationid": "13986125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018969815", "num_games_owned": 460, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1421274104}, "language": "english", "review": "Lovely art, above-average writing, some replay value.  \n\nOne of the most impressive things that sets this apart from other visual novels (from any country) is the incredible attention to detail.

I got sucked into this game and I've absolutely loved it. I have some critical feedback for it, but that by no means negates the magificance of this interactive story.\n\nPros\n+ The writing is definitely the best I've ever encountered in a Steam visual novel. If you're a story-motivated gamer who appreciates a solid piece of high-quality writing, this game will be a breath of fresh air. \n+ Characterization goes above and beyond. No longer do you see the flat, 2-dimensional characters you've come to know from Disney's Cinderella. All the characters, even the \"bad\" ones, are more than what meets the eye. You also have a hand in tailoring Cinders's personality to your liking, which is fun. Cinders can be passive, manipulative, friendly, sensual, rebellious, responsible, romantic, family-oriented, or murderous... whatever floats your boat.\n+ The story gives you a feeling of control, which is imperative for me to enjoy VNs. Your choices *do* make a big difference, even if it seems like they're not really doing anything at first. The choices the story presents you with open up different paths and will give you different endings. Some choices create vastly different outcomes, others give more subtle changes.\n+ The artwork is stunning. Not only is it a unique style, but everything from the backgrounds to the characters looks polished and detailed. \n+ The characters are animated beautifully. Their expressions change, their postures change, and even their eyes move! I thought this was a nice touch.\n+ The soundtrack creates the perfect ambiance and it is simply exquisite to listen to.\n\nCons\n- It's not that long (I think my first playthrough was maybe 5 hours? but I read fast), especially when you do replays to get achievements and epilogues. A lot of time is spent skipping over scenes during replays because, depending on your choices, it's possible that only a few lines of text will change.\n- All relationship stats and personality stats are hidden, so you don't see how your stats are changing when you make choices. This makes it harder to see if you're on track with what you're wanting to do.\n- I wish there were more routes that could further deviate from the traditional Cinderella tale. For example, I wish there were options to not go to the ball, to choose no \"fairy godmother\" to help you, to gang up with your step-sisters to overtake Carmosa, to romance some other unexpected people (the Shady Character maybe? hahaha) or... the possibilities are endless! Basically, even though this game is already amazing, it could have been even cooler if there were some other creative pathways you could take.\n\nOverall, I whole-heartedly recommend this game.

A visual novel retelling of Cinderella, with beautiful graphics, the opportunity to come to see the characters in a new light, and a rather rewarding UI innovation that tells you whenever the dialogue snippet you're seeing could have gone differently had you chosen differently at some earlier juncture, making the game feel much more interactive.\n\nAlas, I couldn't, for the game had too many things that broke my immersion. The protagonist, like the classic Cinderella, is supposed to be living in a small medieval village and have been working basically as a servant for her family for the last several years, yet when she speaks to her stepsisters, she sounds as if she had been reading several books worth of modern pop psychology. At one point she even tells one of her stepsisters, \"you are the unknown variable in this equation\". Just how did she and her stepsister (who seems to understand the expression just fine) have the chance to learn algebra?\n\nFurthermore, although the process of Cinders winning over her stepsisters and allowing us to see them as people who had their reasons for treating Cinders badly could have been an enjoyable subversion of the original story, things seem to happen much too easily. At least with one of the stepsisters, the process starts with a conversation where Cinders basically asks whether the stepsister has considered that it would be nicer for everyone if they could be friends, and the stepsister goes \"oh, you're right\". (It's been a little while between me playing the game and writing the review, so I might misremember the details slightly, but even if they're a little off, this is still a good characterization of how sensible the conversion came off as.)\n\nI finally stopped playing in a dialogue when a conversation with one of the stepsisters seemed to be going well, but suddenly she started lashing out at me for no reason. That could have been intentional, but it looked more like a bug. Ordinarily that wouldn't have been a game-killer and I could have just gone back to an earlier save to see if I could get around it somehow, but with this game, it was the final straw.", "timestamp_created": 1419461859, "timestamp_updated": 1419461859, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13574610": {"recommendationid": "13574610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142498293", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 933, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472298404}, "language": "french", "review": "J'ai ador\u00e9 jouer \u00e0 ce jeu.

But on the otherhand, if you are then i garuntee you will love it if you play it all the way through. \nPROS:\nThis game has four different main endings each with a couple different epilogues you can get through the choices you make. I've seen some reviews on here that say the choices don't matter, which i have to disagree with. Every visual novel game will have choices that seem meaingless and pointless and may not exactly contribute to the main story, but they are there to give you a sense of control. Other choices will be vitally important like the first choice you make. It can change the whole story depending on what you choose. Some people are bothered by no voices or terrible music or any other thing that falls under that category, these people will be so pleased with the musical choice the creators went with. It is beautiful and one of my favorite soundtracks of any game i have ever played. It makes the game 10x better in my opinion. Like i said before, there are four main endings each with their own epilogues; if you are one of those gamers that like to get all they can in a game but hesitates because it takes too long, you will be pleased to find that you can skip through all the dialogue so it makes the replay value go up. Another thing to add would be the artwork for this game. It is amazingly beautiful. Most visual novels have static(stay still) artwork that changes when you move forward in the conversation, but this game has dynamic artwork that moves. Granted it is not much but fires flicker, and dust particles in the sunlight are visible. \nCONS:\nSaying all this, there are some faults. Not many, but they are there. Some characters seem useless and very unnatural along with some situations. Sometimes the words lag behind if you are running something in the background. There, that's all the cons in my opinion.

selon votre 'race' dans Masquerade, selon l'alignement dans Baldur's Gate)\n- dialogues disponibles en fonction des r\u00e9ponses qu'on donne\n- missions de classe\n- dans les jeux d'action, possibilit\u00e9 d'infiltration, qui se transforme en shoot si on se fait rep\u00e9rer\n- dans Knights of the Old Republic, les choix peuvent faire basculer le personnage du c\u00f4t\u00e9 obscur de la force (avec changement d'apparence)\n\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, on suit une ligne directrice, qui se s\u00e9pare parfois en plusieurs embranchements.\nOn choisit un des embranchements (avec rarement possibilit\u00e9 de retour en arri\u00e8re), et ainsi de suite jusqu'\u00e0 arriver \u00e0 la fin du jeu.\nAu final, on passe par quelques morceaux d'histoire uniques, avec \u00e9ventuellement plusieurs fin possibles, mais le plus gros de l'histoire est commun, quels que soient les choix effectu\u00e9s.\n\nPour bien se rendre compte des diff\u00e9rences selon les choix, on doit recommencer le jeu en prenant d'autres d\u00e9cisions (en esp\u00e9rant qu'elles aient un impact diff\u00e9rent, ce qui n'est pas gagn\u00e9).\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, je trouve que le principe n'est pas assez exploit\u00e9 (y compris dans Cinders). Il faudrait que l'univers dans lequel on \u00e9volue dans les jeux soit plus modelable, avec des d\u00e9cisions qui impactent r\u00e9ellement l'environnement.\nC'est \u00e0 dire pas seulement changer l'opinion des PNJ ou d\u00e9bloquer une fin alternative, mais voir aussi des changements moins \u00e9vidents ou plus radicaux, par exemple :\n- la destruction d'un commerce important qui reconditionne l'\u00e9conomie\n- on r\u00e9pand une mati\u00e8re toxique dans un quartier, ce qui transforme les habitants du coin en mutants et cr\u00e9e une zone de quarantaine\n- on peut m\u00eame imaginer des interactions multijoueurs (ou plut\u00f4t entre 2 sessions solo), o\u00f9 l'action d'un joueur impacte d'autres joueurs\n\nEnfin bref, quand on essaie de me vendre un jeu en vantant le fait que mes choix vont tout chambouler, je flaire la plupart du temps l'argument marketing, et malgr\u00e9 son status d'ind\u00e9, ce jeu ne fait pas exception, je suis d\u00e9\u00e7u, une fois de plus.", "timestamp_created": 1412616843, "timestamp_updated": 1412616843, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449493", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12368804": {"recommendationid": "12368804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078070930", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 771, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412534406}, "language": "english", "review": "Finally, I finished Cinders,.. so surprise for the ending.. it's too real and too close to player's personality.. such a great game indeed, a lot of options and endings,..

It also pleased me that the endings aren't entirely depended on whom Cinders falls in love with - they're about her choices for her future and who she wants to be in life. A hot guy can come along if he wants, sure. But Cinders is more than just a vehicle for player romance, she's a young woman looking for her path in life, for better or for worse.

The game takes the player down a very mature path within a classic children's fairytale.  The player has complete control over the decision making process of the main character.  Thus, with each choice the player makes for Cinders, her personality changes as the game progresses.  There is a large number of outcomes for this character based on those decisions she is presented with throughout the game.  For instance, with the decisions the player chooses for Cinders, she could become very evil or good, very sexual or timid, and/or anywhere in between.  I honestly couldn't believe the number of outcomes this game presents the player with!  The replayability is enormous.  The artwork is absolutely gorgeous.  The music is beautiful.  I applaud how the devs implemented the 'fast forward scene' ability within the game as even though this is a VN, thus a lot of reading, it allows the player to choose whether to read through a scene over and over if they wish OR fast forward through a scene that they have previously experienced.  Please remember, there are NUMEROUS outcomes to this game and over 300 different possible decisions to be made (at minimum)!  The player can also choose the rate of speed that the dialogue is presented, which gives the player a chance to choose either the slower paced dialogue which visually allows 'emphasis' placed on certain words or phrases 'spoken' by each character OR to speed it up and read at the players pace.  I literally just finished the very last outcome for this game before writing this review.  I sat back and just said \"WOW!\"  (yes, it's that good!)  I highly recommend this game to any VN lover --- and would really like to see others at least give it a shot.

The music is wonderful, with synchronized changes and leitmotif cues.\n\nI'm new to visual novels, and the concept and writing drew me in. Choices are presented frequently and sensibly enough, with a flower appearing in the top-right corner to note when your choice impacted your playthrough outcome. The nonlinearity of the choices provides multiple interesting paths to four basic outcomes with multiple permutations based on your relationships with other characters, as well as your protagonist's personality. Subsequent playthroughs are easy, as dialogue can be skipped (super fast-forward), automatically stopping at new dialogue or choices.\n\nThe writing is generally solid and engaging, with very few spots that are slightly clunky but easily forgivable. Character development is deep for the four women, and amusingly and probably intentionally, the supporting cast of men are somewhat one-dimensional. The concept of a reimagined Cinderella itself is quite fun and more contemporary with an emphasis on female protagonist agency, with some very helpful friends to retain the fanciful nature of the original story.\n\nIf you're new to visual novels but like things like Joe Dever's Lone Wolf saga, RPGs with deep character development, and Telltale's Walking Dead series, and consider the possibility that games can be art, you would probably enjoy this.", "timestamp_created": 1410066426, "timestamp_updated": 1410066426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12002070": {"recommendationid": "12002070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025857205", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1925, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464533299}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est vraiment tr\u00e8s bien !

It's a beautifully illustrated interactive storybook rather than a traditional game.  I should mention that I purchased it directly from Moa when it was first released and they kindly gave me a Steam key when it was released on Steam.  \n\nThe story is a familiar one: you are Cinderella and you have to decide how the events play out.  How will she/you react to your stepmother's machinations?  Will you tell her off or be meek?  Do you love the prince for himself or do you just want to increase your social stature?  Do you fall in love with a childhood friend instead of the prince?  Do you choose no one at all?\n\nThe graphics are flat-out gorgeous.  The art is lush, vibrant, and full of life.  Replayability is high due to the vast number of choices you can make.  I've finished one playthrough and am currently playing again to try some of the other options.  In the original version I had some issues with crashing and saves not actually saving and in one instance I had to completely restart, but these issues seem to have been fixed in the Steam version as I have not experienced any crashing/lockups/etc.\n\nTake a look at the screenshots and if you're even remotely intrigued, get this game.

Sure, there is a fairy, there is a ball, there is a Prince, there is a lost slipper (altough it's not a glass one, and she didn't really lose it...).\n\nWhat you get here instead, is a story about dealing with your broken family. Both, your Stepmother and your Stepsisters have developed troubled personalities hidden under masks of the roles they trying (or are simply forced) to fullfil, and it's up to you to chose what kind of \"happy ending\" do you want to get, not only for yourself, but also for your family. Will you try to work things out together and help them develop? Or will you destroy them, to get what you want? Or maybe you'll run away from everything and search for your Happy Ending somewhere else? Or maybe you'll become someone you used to despised yourself? Even though the story is set in stricte fairytale world, it portrays MODERN issues of many dysfunctional families out there. And that I find the biggest attraction of this game, along with very beautiful aesthetics. \n\nOn the downside... The game felt like it lacked some more individual panels to look at (as this is what the gameplay is all about- to look at lovely pictures and read a story you can influence with the choices of your own ).

The eponymous character, Cinders, is interesting, witty, and strong, no matter whether you choose to make her choose a more naive path or one taking a great deal more effort and self reliance. The romance element is nicely worked in such that you can entirely avoid having it be a big part of Cinders' life and future, or you can carry on multiple affairs at once, allowing them to shape that future. Although it was nice to see the \"evil\" stepsisters represented as a bit less two-dimensional, I can't help but feel an opportunity was lost in not giving them more of a role in the story. It would have been great to see endings in which Cinders assists one or both of the sisters in acheiving their goals.

In the case of Cinders, it also manages to update a classic fairytail into a far more mature and modern story, turning Cinderella into a newly captivating adventurer that eschews many of the originals childish elements for mystery and intrigue. It stumbles a bit along the way, as if walking in its own pair of undersized glass slippers, but on the whole amounts to something unexpectedly enthralling and maybe just a bit magical.\n\nI can't imagine anyone is unfamiliar with the story of Cinderella, so I'll skip the introductions. The vile mother and sisters, sad girl living as a servant waiting for the world to change, glass slippers and prince charming are all here as you'd expect, but where Cinders differs is in taking a simple fairy tail and turning it into a mature and intriguing story that is wildly different than how you remember it. Character interactions are full of personal dialogue and emotion, turning the original cliches into actual people you can relate and empathize with. Cinders sisters might be cold, but once their reasons are explained it's hard not to feel sorry for them despite their cruelties. The prince may appear to live a life of carefree amusement, but on the inside his constant questioning of his actions is tearing him apart and making him question his own motives. There are certainly moments when it becomes overly self indulgent with some of its writing, and a few endings feel a bit hollow (though that's to be expected with how many there are), but these moments are overshadowed by the majority of the dialog, which is hugely engrossing and when compiled with the element of your own choices becomes even more compelling, as you shape the outcome to any number of different paths.\n\nWhich brings me to one of the few areas Cinders slips up a bit, at least in the view of someone who wishes to see more than the one ending they arrive at. Throughout the story (which should take you around 2-5 hours depending on your reading speed) you encounter a myriad of choices which change the story and eventually decide your characters fate. The issue arises in the sheer number of decisions that can have an impact on the ending, and the very limited number of saves you are given, which means you are required to skip through huge amounts of text again and again as you reload and make minor alterations to your choices in the attempts to see a new ending. It all becomes greatly repetitive and takes far more time than it otherwise might had you been given more freedom in the number of saves you have, as well as making it quicker to skip through dialog you've already read before.\n\nBut ultimately it's a somewhat inconsequential complaint as for those not obsessed with seeing every ending, the first run through the story isn't the least bit affected and just as captivating as ever. Least I forget Cinders is also remarkably pretty to look at, with fantastic art and a ton of minor details bringing the picture to life, from background objects to character expressions. It's a bold new direction for visual novels, a genre that's been stagnant and underrepresented outside of Japan for a long time, and a brilliant first attempt by developer MoaCube which I hope is but the first of many more to come.", "timestamp_created": 1408044739, "timestamp_updated": 1408082607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639227", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11683973": {"recommendationid": "11683973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052377750", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407985946}, "language": "english", "review": "Wonderful game!

Having not played or researched many games of the genre, I can't really comment on how innovative this is within the context of its genre. I was thinking of postponing a review of Cinders until after I had played more of the genre, but I doubt I will do this in the near future. So here is a review, to be returned to if I do ever have something to add.\n\nA pretty great interactive take on a classic tale, the large amount of well thought-out endings based on choices made through the game lend well to the feeling of coming of age of the heroine, Cinders. It is also a refreshing take to give Cinderella more agency and control over her life, though she as a character may not realise how much influence she has. The endings closest to the original fairytale really felt well-earned as you really felt like you had to push Cinders to making responsible decisions despite the temptation to let Cinders be snarky and dwell on revenge.\n\nAll-in-all the decisions felt quite organic in how they impacted the story despite the fixed events throughout the story and the number of game-influencing variables which is remarkable in any game. I thoroughly enjoyed replaying to find all the endings and the variants therein, and the eight save slots, fast-forward function and the flower indicator for branching story moments were a great help in this. It would have been nice to have an even faster way of scrolling or even skipping to the next decision, but what was there worked well.\n\nThe music was great and perfectly suited to the mood of the game, and so were the beautiful painted-looking environments.  The touch of movement and change in lighting was also well done, present but subtle. The character design is very solidly well done, such that the few trappings of anime and manga in the style are not off-putting even to those who they do not appeal to.\n\nIt is great to see this smart and well-made interactive retelling of Cinderella come to Steam where sales will hopefully help it reach a much greater audience.", "timestamp_created": 1406385303, "timestamp_updated": 1406385303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537954", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11389944": {"recommendationid": "11389944", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026221093", "num_games_owned": 3436, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 673, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1406298451}, "language": "english", "review": "A more mature and realistic take on the classic fairy tale of Cinderella.

Why? Because Cinderella cries and her Fairy Godmother magically fixes everything for her. Seriously? A crybaby princess? I think I\u2019d prefer narcoleptic Sleeping Beauty over that.\n\nThankfully, Cinders is not that story.\n\nInstead, Cinders is a game where you need to decipher the motivations and secrets of the people around you. You want a Fairy Godmother? Of course you can have one! You just have to work for it. You have to use logic to figure out what the best choices are, and, unlike some other VNs, the choices you have to make actually do make sense when you think about it. There are also many choices to make (I counted 47 on my first playthrough), so the game has plenty of re-playability if you want to get every ending. In addition, I found the artwork to be beautiful (or at least charming) and the dialogue was very believable (and funny at times).\n\nThe two critiques I have of this game were easily overlooked by me, but I figured they were worth mentioning. First, the buttons are a little off. Intuitively, you would think that you would hover over the words for each button in order to make your choice. However, you actually have to be about half a centimeter above the buttons in order to click things. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker, but it\u2019s slightly annoying. Second, you\u2019re playing as Cinders. Therefore, the game has an obviously girly theme. Even as a girl, I always thought that fairy tale princesses were too girly, and I never cared for them that much. I can imagine that, as a guy, this game might be a bit much. However, I would like to say that you can definitely still enjoy Cinders if you\u2019re a masculine guy, as long as you\u2019re an avid fan of VNs. If you think it\u2019s still too girly, wait until Moa Cube releases Solstice.\n\nOverall, Cinders is a very good VN and if you\u2019re fan of the genre, you should definitely give this one a go.", "timestamp_created": 1406179005, "timestamp_updated": 1406179005, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490257", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11384365": {"recommendationid": "11384365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026325298", "num_games_owned": 1400, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404610640}, "language": "english", "review": "Score: 7/10\n\n'm not sure I'd pay the full $20 price for any visual novel, but if your going to throw out that kind of money it should be at a visual novel like this one.

I'll be honest, I don't know much about the original story, so I can't say how close it follows that story (all I can say for sure is that there are \"evil\" stepsisters and stepmother, and the whole \"glass slipper\" part, everything else I'm not familiar with), but the story presented in Cinders was very well done. During my three and a half hour playthrough, I had to choose between one of four endings, and many other side plots (such as romantic interests, how you interact with with your stepsisters, etc.). While most of your choices don't mean much in the grand scheme of things, I did appreciate the fact that you are presented with a fair amount of choices, and multiple interesting choices for each (for example, do I want to lower the price with the shopkeeper by haggling, being seductive, appealing to friendship, or just pay full price? And then, if you do get to lower the price, do you spend that money (which is your stepmother's) on yourself, or give it to her?).\n\nOne thing that I really enjoyed, that I haven't seen in my limited experience in VNs, is that the game tells you (visually, with a flower that is displayed in the top right of the screen) when you view a conversation that can have different outcomes. This, combined with the fact that you can super fast-forward through text you've already seen, means that it gave me a big enough incentive to replay the game multiple times. With four different endings, and multiple other minor differentiations, I ended up spending about eight hours total.\n\nWhile not important, the graphics are very impressive. Not only this, but characters are animated as are minor background pieces. This game definitely delivers in the \"Eye Candy\" department in the Humble Bundle I got it in.\n\nI can't think of anything negative about the game...it is a VN, so this game won't be for everyone, but for what it is, it does it well.

There is no voice acting so if that isn't your thing you should pass.  As the game's title suggests this is a different take on the classic fairy tale Cinderella with several differnt ways to end the story.  The biggest question in this style of game is usually \"How much does my decisions throughout the game change the story?\"  the answer to this question is the usual amount.  The decisions you make for the vast majority of the game seems to replace one piece of interchangable diologue with another.  It seems that if Cinders acts in a largely uncarictaristic manner the supporting will seem to forget previous conversations and act accordingly which kind of killed the mood for me.  Ultimately only a few decisions actually change the ending but an unexpected surprise is that the decisions you make add some nice flavor to the endings which is a really nice touch.  Often times in Cinders characters make social commentary this may rub some people the wrong way considering the political nature of video games at the moment, so, be prepared for that. \n\nAstetics and music: The game is illustrated by Gracjana Zielinska and the influence is there in spades and this gives the game an amazing look.  The music is nice and enjoyable but knows its place in a background role so if you are a slower reader the music doesn't get annoying which I think is important for this style of game. \n\nIs it worth the money?  The game is currently $19.99 on steam although it was recently a part of the humble eye candy bundle.  I can't reccomend this title at the current price tag.

Un racconto ramificato nel quale scegliere, di volta in volta, una versione diversa della \"nostra\" Cinders. Ma non \u00e8 questo l'aspetto veramente interessante della visual novel in questione, quanto il fatto che sia scritta in maniera ottima. Ogni personaggio - Cinders, le sue sorellastre Sophia e Gloria, sua madre, Lady Carmosa, e gli altri comprimari - emerge in maniera \"viva\" dal testo di questa specie di \"improvvisazione sul tema\".

The only character animations are really facial expressions, and sometimes they'll shift poses, but that's more of a rare thing... though the characters will change outfits or poses for different scenes.\nThe music is really well done and there's a good variety here, but nothing I really focused on much.\n\nThere are 4 endings, but multiple variations of those endings based on how you treated certain characters and things like that. So there's some replayability here, but the story still plays out mostly the same, with just some extra scenes and dialogue peppered in based on some choices you make. A lot of times I felt like the banter back and forth may not add a whole lot to the story, and doesn't create that much extra character depth... ultimately leading to longish periods of time between choice branches. This could also limit replayability, but there is a button to fast-forward through the dialogue that will still pause when there's a choice to be made, or when you reach a new scene you haven't seen before. A really awesome feature. Even though you can skip through quickly using this method, it still takes a LONG time to fast-forward through everything. The story is kind of that long... I think when I started a new story to get a different ending, it still took me an hour to play through even though I fast-forwarded through the majority of the story.\n\nThe choices in this game can affect a lot, I think. Even though the majority of scenes STILL happen no matter what, the differences in the story with how the characters treat you (and even how your character treats them) provides a more personal feel... rather than picking options that feel out-of-place of your character, your character changes with your options. It's pretty nice in this way.\n\nAnother really awesome detail this game provides is when you unlock achievements (which relate to the story and in-game decisions.) With each one you unlock, a change happens to the main menu screen... most of the time an item gets added to the scene. It's really a nice detail and just goes to show how much attention was put into this game. There's also a \"reward\" menu where you can see all the unique things you've unlocked, which is nice.\n\nOverall, the game is plenty long... I think my first play-through took around 3 hours... which is fairly typical. The long-windedness of some of the dialogue is the only thing that started to fatigue me. There are a lot of choices to be made to keep the interaction up and keep you engaged... the pacing is pretty good overall. When I first started playing the story seemed to throw in your face the fact that the story is Cinderella, which I found a bit annoying and obnoxious, but after that was over with I really enjoyed it. It's Cinderella, so don't expect anything crazy with the main story... you're able to personalize it a bit with your own choices, but all the major plot-points are always hit.\n\nI'm definitely keeping an eye out on what this developer puts out next.

This visual novel is all about giving us reasons to understand why these characters act the way they do, and obviously I don't want to spoil anything, but contrary to the popular notion that the antagonists (or anti-heroes in this story) are in cahoots, *nobody* likes each other. And despite her cruelty, even said step-mother has her issues, where most of her actions are explained, understandable, and sympathetic. (In my playthrough, I never got a good answer for why she treats Cinders like an old rag, though.)\n\nOf course, what to do with this information is for you to decide. If you feel like disregarding any understanding of these characters' own personal plights and personally attacking them whenever they get in your way, you are allowed this option. Maybe you want to pick a side in this sisterly conflict and get close to Sophia or Gloria; this is something you may do as well. In fact, participating in the subversion of this fairy tale is entirely up to you. You may wish to ask the fairies for help, marry the prince at the expense of your sisters' and step-mother's chances, and live Happily Ever After The End, assuming you can even reach that point. You can also be like me and revell in the story's subversive qualities, actively trying to understand and unite the sisters against their overbearing mother. It's all up to you, and no matter which path you take, the game's story never ever falters, because it's the story *you* want to make. It helps that the game's writing and story are (mostly) beautiful in each path and never fails to at least be interesting.\n\nAlso, if you couldn't tell by the video and screenshots, the visuals and audio are top-notch. While the somewhat sparse and somewhat static character models can be a bit stiff in their animations (Cinders herself seems to be placed in a perpetual slouch, which, when you think about it, is kind of the point), the backgrounds are always stunningly gorgeous, with details that come alive despite through their hand-drawn aesthetic. The BGM makes up for its limited selection by being amazingly well-produced, even while synthetic (nobody would have expected a full orchestra from an indie studio anyway). The design here is elegent in its subtlety, with slightly differing text sounds for different characters' speech and dim auras surrounding the current speaker.\n\nI only take small issue in some of the design choices. For instance, I wish that the game wouldn't notify me whenever a consequence of a certain past decision is being played out. Every time I make a choice, its resulting difference is noted by a small plant symbol that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen. Often these are made up of small speech alterations that have little effect on the main story except for alterations in the character's dispositions and their own personal decisions, and sometimes I couldn't tell how a certain sentence would have differed had I made a different choice, or what choice with which that particular piece of text was even associated. Regardless, I'd much rather the mystery of how my decisions change the story be left to my own intuition.\n\nAlso on the subject of choices, I wish the game wouldn't limit the ability to rewind through decisions made to see all of their immediate effects, especially if the feature's primary marketability involves important and lasting changes that won't necessarily take affect until much later in the story (and at that point, who wants to rewind that far back?). If the game wants me to shape the story the way I see fit, then there's really no need to limit this feature. I understand that certain decisions are meant to be important, lasting, and heavy, and perhaps a rewind feature would take away from this heaviness (there was a moment late in the game where I was confronted with a decision that would essentially determine the ending I'd get and I had to think very hard about my decision), but there are just as many conversational choices that have exactly the opposite effect of their perceived intention. I found myself in a conversation with Gloria on Day 4 during which I said some things I wish I hadn't, and, given the option to take them back, I probably would have. Perhaps this is meant to reflect the weight of real-life decision-making, but this game isn't about that. It's about player choice, and if I'm given a choice that, when chosen, results in the opposite of its intended effect (e.g. Cinders says something rude and condescending when I meant the comment to be compassionate and understanding), then I'd like the option to take it back.\n\nFinally, and least importantly, some of the writing in the game is a bit off. Cinders often goes about psychoanalyzing literally everybody she meets, and while this isn't chiefly wrong, since it supports the game's concept of fairy-tale subversion by revealing very real character traits in the people she encounters, it is a bit heavy-handed and perhaps a bit too obvious. Sometimes I wish I could figure these things out for myself without necessarily having Cinders tell me (and the character) directly, and there are other ways for Cinders to handle the conversations and actions she engages. There are a couple of blatant (but necessary) exposition dumps, but this isn't too horrible. There is also some questionable grammar, like the use of -t instead of -ed (e.g. \"spoilt\" instead of \"spoiled\") but this may be era-specific, or the use of a \"than\" in place of a \"then\" or a \"where\" in place of a \"were.\"\n\nThese are minor complaints compared to the quality of the game. If you want to play through it four times to unlock all four endings, it's definitely worth $20. Each playthrough will last you about 5 hours, depending on your reading speed. If you only want to play through it once, it's in the current Humble Bundle (as of writing this), or you can wait for the next big sale.", "timestamp_created": 1404459371, "timestamp_updated": 1404459371, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537954", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11063081": {"recommendationid": "11063081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037270831", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404276429}, "language": "english", "review": "Cinders is a lovely and charming game.

Le jeu reprend donc l'historie traditionnelle de Cendrillon mais en y rajoutant \u00e9norm\u00e9ment \u00e9norm\u00e9ment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments nouveaux et d'int\u00e9ractions entre les diff\u00e9rents personnages.\n\nLoin du conte de f\u00e9e, Cinders fait la part belle \u00e0 son histoire remarquablement bien \u00e9crite et mise en sc\u00e8ne graphiquement et musicalement. Le jeu est en anglais int\u00e9gral et autant vous dire qu'il faudra un certain niveau d'anglais pour tout suivre et comprendre les choix qui nous sont propos\u00e9s. Le jeu est donc lin\u00e9aire dans sa structure, on suit l'histoire et \u00e0 certains moments importants, le jeu nous demande de faire un choix, ca peut \u00eatre un soutien \u00e0 une de ses s\u0153urs, un endroit \u00e0 visiter plut\u00f4t qu'un autre ou alors des choix moraux qui vont influer sur la personnalit\u00e9 de notre personnage mais aussi des autres protagonistes.\n\nLe jeu ne reprend pas la structure vue dans Long Live The Queen, il n'y a pas de points \u00e0 affecter dans certaines comp\u00e9tences, ce sont de simples choix mais qui importent au final car de ces choix vont d\u00e9pendre la trame principale de l'histoire et la fin qui nous sera propos\u00e9e. Si vous souhaitez d\u00e9couvrir toutes les fins possibles et d\u00e9bloquer tous les achievements, il faudra compter 7-8 heures. Heureusement le jeu est bien fait et on peut acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer les dialogues que l'on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 lues pour arriver \u00e0 l'essentiel. Autre bon point, on peut revenir en arri\u00e8re si on a rat\u00e9 un dialogue important avec le scroll de la souris. On ne peut pas revenir sur un choix important en revanche, le jeu nous permet de sauvegarder ce qui vous \u00e9vitera de regretter un choix tendancieux.\n\nL'histoire est le vrai point fort du jeu, elle est rudement bien men\u00e9e, les choix sont int\u00e9ressants et le jeu n'est pas uniquement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 un public f\u00e9minin gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'intelligence des personnages et \u00e0 leurs personnalit\u00e9s. Il n'y a pas de m\u00e9chant ou de gentil, chacun fait ses propres choix en leur \u00e2me et conscience, les s\u0153urs ne sont pas fondamentalement mauvaises, elles ont leurs raisons, idem pour le prince et la m\u00e8re castratrice. On ne peut pas vraiment d\u00e9tester les personnages ce qui rend d'autant plus difficiles certains choix car il faudra faire des sacrifices pour avancer.\n\nLe jeu n'est pas tout jeune, il est disponible depuis 2012 mais il n'est disponible sur Steam que depuis quelques semaines \u00e0 un prix avantageux. Sachez \u00e9galement que la bande son est disponible au prix que vous le souhaitez ce qui est int\u00e9ressant tant elle ajoute une autre dimension au jeu. Je vous conseille donc fortement ce jeu si vous aimez les histoires adultes et non manich\u00e9ennes dot\u00e9es d'une tr\u00e8s belle r\u00e9alisation.

I know, anal right? But I'm loving this game at the moment. As you can see from the images previewed for this game, the art work is really beautiful, unlike some Visual novel games you see on the market that are drawn badly. The writing is really good also...havent found any spelling errors yet. The music in this game is really good too... so good that I had to purchase the download for the OST of Cinders and I love it... really good. It all works really well together and a lot of fun re-playing the game to try and get the different endings and achievements.

I think most people can agree that more gameplay time is preferable. However, I'd like to say that this is the ONLY flaw of this game (obviously, that's just my opinion though).\n\nIf you like visual novels, I highly recommend this one. Every single choice affects the ending of the story. There are also about a dozen different story ending combinations to be made. As the description of the game states, it is an adult version of the Cinderella story. However, Cinders (her name in this version) doesn't have to be the traditional character she's known to be. She can be villainous, independent, strong-willed, ambitious, etc. She can have whatever type of personality you want her to have. The best part is that she doesn't have to go after the prince. She can plot revenge against her stepmother and stepsisters, unlike the traditional character. She can be absolutely defiant and rebellious, also unlike the traditional character. But let's say you want her to be a nice, good person, but still establish her independence (from the Prince and her stepfamily), you can do that combination as well! Point being, this doesn't have to be the typical Cinderella story unless you want it to be. The story and the character are what you make it and for a visual novel, that's the best a gamer can ask for. \n\nOther good things about the game:\n- The artwork is beautiful (and sort of gothic).\n- The music is well-done and fitting to the atmosphere of the game.\n- There are other suitors Cinders can go for other than the Prince.\n- The gamer can see the point of view/character development of the stepsisters/stepmother if they wish to (making them more human than the original story).\n- The game truly causes the gamer to put thought into the choices they make. \n\nI'll say it again: if you like visual novels, I HIGHLY recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1404237425, "timestamp_updated": 1404237425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537242", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10966031": {"recommendationid": "10966031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137096530", "num_games_owned": 399, "num_reviews": 128, "playtime_forever": 2207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411068607}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um \u00f3timo ogo!

You do so through choices and map movement intermissions in the narrative. So as not to leave you confused, the game flashes a wooden branch icon on the upper right corner of the screen everytime a previous choice is showing its consequence.\n\nCinders is structured so as to give your choices an aspect of freedom: there are not correct choices and you will always reach a satisfying ending that reflects your behaviour throughout the story. This means one single playthrough will last for about two hours, but one ending is just a glimpse of the stories Cinders has to offer.\n\nThe greatest strength this visual novel has is probably its characters: no character is completely redeemed nor degraded. They are complex, round characters with motivations and goals that you can relate yourself to, enhancing the moral aspect of the choices: each and every character has a lot to be explored, making for a consistent world with strong characters - and many strong female characters - and a sense that you are free to make your own judgement. \n\nThis groundedness, however, doesn't stop the game from sporting a most pleasant fairytale atmosphere. The art and the music, through coherent design and stylistic choices, gives Cinders a fine identity and a unique feel down to minute details, such as small animations on the background and on the sprites. As such, it's easy to get used to the art style even if it's not commonly used in visual novels. Such attention to identity helps in the establshment of an emotional link between you and Cinders' world.\n\nIf only fow how bold it is, Cinders is a must for anyone who appreciates story-driven experiences with complex characters and a lot of room for the player to decide what happens next.\n\nPositive:\n\n*Great fairytale impression\n*Many choices and many endings\n*Fleshed out characters\n*Music is comfortable to listen to and the sound design is adequate\n*Consistent art and world\n\nNegative:\n\n*Short playthroughs.

La storia della giovane ragazza schiavizzata dalla sua matrigna ha una tradizione antichissima, tanto che le sue primissime versioni arrivano sia dall\u2019Egitto dei Faraoni che dalla Cina imperiale.

The many character trait and action choices that actually impact the story\u2019s end make this visual novel stand out. I\u2019ve played through it several times and still have not found all the paths.\n\nMusic: Most visual novels\u2019 and sims\u2019 soundtracks have me hunting for the mute button, but this one is gorgeous.\n\nVisuals: Gracjana Zielinska\u2019s art has a detailed, ethereal quality without becoming prissy or cutesy.\u00a0 It\u2019s beautiful.\u00a0 I\u2019m so pleased she\u2019s returning for Solstice.\n\nProgramming: I appreciate the ability to quickly skip through already viewed scenes with one button press.\u00a0 All visual novels should implement this.\n\nWriting: *thunk**thunk* *thunk*  That noise, dear friend, is the characters\u2019 dialog and the insights into their behavior being delivered with all the subtlety of a frying pan to the back of the skull. The reader is never left to infer anything. Cinders\u2019 inner monologue or other characters will spell it out. During the first long conversation between Cinders and Sophia, they tell their back-story and motivations to one another without the reservation and self-protection that the back-story would naturally have bred.  It drove me crazy until I remembered Dostoevsky\u2019s The Brothers Karamazov. Yes, the two works don\u2019t seem to have much in common but bear with me. Like Karazmov, Cinders uses characters to represent a consistent type of person rather than how you and I would interact on a day-to-day basis. Once you go with it, they both deliver a good story and observations on human nature.  Boom. A 2012 visual novel saved by Dostoevsky.\n\nWriting: The banter between characters usually makes me smirk (Sophia and Gloria should have their own spin-off). The only exception is the romantic dialog. Excuse me for a moment, game, while I fetch some nachos to go with all this cheese. Fortunately, the game has many endings with no romance whatsoever.\n\nWriting: The grammar, spelling, and word choice are nearly perfect. Kudos to the editor.\n\nFemale Characters: The writers clearly spent more of their effort developing the women. Cinders, Carmosa, Gloria, Sophia, and Madame Ghede all have distinct personalities and goals. Sophia\u2019s snark is always welcome: \u201cThe only things missing from this picture is holding hands and singing. And dancing. Possibly in circles. In the middle of a flowery meadow. I think I might throw up.\u201d I want an ending in which she and Cinders escape together.\n\nMale Characters: The men aren\u2019t bad, but they lack the depth and care the women received. I won\u2019t dwell on them (particularly since the developer has already addressed this), but here\u2019s a brief run-down.  Tobias is a childhood friend who tends to deliver motivation speaker advice with the aforementioned frying pan; I want to like you, Toby, but you have to stop thwacking me over the head.  Perrault is a guard captain caught between duty and ethics; he is my favorite of the three.  Prince Basile is he least developed of the three, though the conversations between him and Perrault are good. He and Cinders discuss Levia Malich\u2019s work in a scene ripped straight from Ever After, but other than that I enjoy their interactions.\n\nBottom Line: I recommend this to anyone (not just women) who wants a strong, competent protagonist and enjoys tinkering to discover different endings.

From the looks of it, Cinders seemed like it would be a wonderful game, and it definitely delivered! I just started my second playthrough, and I have been loving every minute of gameplay.\n\nFirst, I absolutely must rave about the gorgeous art by Gracjana Zielinska! The character designs were unique and stunning, and the backgrounds were lavish and interesting. I loved how little details would appear or move in the background - that gave the graphics a \"little something\" extra to catch the eye! I could not get enough of the beautiful visuals and tried to research if she had done work on other games. I found out about Solstice, a mystery thriller visual novel coming soon, and Phantasmat, a hidden objects game. I am much more into visual novels, but the artwork alone is compelling me to give Phantasmat a chance also!\n\nSecond, the gameplay placed player choice front and center, and especially in a visual novel, I appreciated this greatly. Choices were frequent and truly affected the story; the \"Rewards\" section from the game's menu lets you see how many of the variants you've explored to the ending, and in my ending, I've only explored 25% so far, so there is still a lot for me to experience! I did do some saving/loading to see what would happen with certain choices and was very pleased with the level of difference I discovered. In addition, certain choices add adornments to the menu page - this made game progress even more exciting because I wanted to see what else would be added where. :) ... and it brought out the completionist in me! I am excited to unlock all the endings and as many variants as I can.\n\nThird, the characters were unpredictably rich. Coming into a fairytale-inspired game, I expected the same character tropes, but while the characters were similarly-situated, they were far deeper than the superficial Cindarella cast I was used to! Cinders, for example, can be played to be quite pragmatic, or pig-headed, or honest, or devious, or a mix of the aforementioned, and based on my ending, I think the choice of these traits truly affects the outcome of the game. Madame Ghede was a favorite character of mine - I wanted to know so much more about her! She was enigmatic and wise, revealing a hint of the effects of what seemed to me a very detailed life. The stepmother (Carmosa) and step-sisters (Sophia and Gloria) were also multi-faceted, and there was more than meets the eye to Captain Perrault, as well.\n\nThe game's soundtrack suited it perfectly -- it was not overbearing, but rather complementary. Chimes indicated decisions, and subtle pieces (like at the Lake) would round out an enchanting experience. I wish the soundtrack had been included in a bundle because it would be a wonderful way to relax. :)\n\nIf you like visual novels, female protagonists, gorgeous artwork, fairytales, lots of choice that affects the ending, and a hint of romance, I highly recommend this game. If you adore Gracjana Zielinska's artwork (like I now do), you should also check out the upcoming visual novel from the same developer (Moacube) Solstice and the hidden objects game from Big Fish, Phantasmat.

There are even small background animations as well which makes the scenes livelier. I\u2019m so in love with the art is almost hurts!\n\n-If we make a decision and it affects the story differently, a flower appears on the top right of the screen. It\u2019s kind of like the Walking Dead\u2019s \u201c____ will remember that\u201d. Personally, I like the instant feedback on my decisions.\n\n-The dialouge between characters can feel a little stiff and awkward at times. Maybe it's because the characters aren't that close with each other and that's why it gives off that vibe.\n\n-I love how when we get achievements, the title screen updates and things are added as we discover more things. What in the jellybeans, that\u2019s AMAZING!\n\n-The music is gorgeous. There are times when I stop and listen and go \u201cwhoa!\u201d one of the conversations got pretty tense and the music followed suit.\n\n-I like the attention to detail when the words roll onto the screen. It is as if each word was cast into existence by a small fairy as little colourful sparks burst behind every appearing word.\n\nWe know when a person is speaking hurriedly, maybe even angrily since the text appears very quickly. When words are spoken by characters with emphasis, the text emerges slowly, and there are pauses at key moments to create tension. I\u2019m usually the type of person who clicks twice to see all the text appear all at once since I\u2019m an impatient reader, but Cinders has made me stop and enjoy watching the text tap happily along the screen.\n\n\n\n>>>STORY:\n-The story has a lot of variations (player choices and endings). One ending may have small, but still significant changes that shows up in the epilogue depending on the choices we made.\n\n-There is a convenient skip option as well so there isn\u2019t a big pain when replaying for different possibilities.\n\n-I personally loved bonding with Cinder\u2019s sisters. I love them and easily got attached to them, problems, flaws and all. If we bond with them a certain way, they react differently to us, differently to others, and maybe even towards themselves.\n\n\n>>>OVERALL:\nIt\u2019s a great game, with a great story, amazing music, stunning art, and the list goes on! It allows us to make choices as we read making us more invested. There are many paths and endings to discover.\n\nYou may not be too into it if you\u2019re not a big reading fan.

I have to say, this is probably the best one I've seen so far.\n\nThe aesthetics of this game are amazing. The art is beautiful, as you can see from the screenshots, but something they don't show is how everything looks in movement. The backgrounds are subtly animated and the text appears on the screen in a magical shine of color. It's mostly small touches, but it makes the game feel very unique from a lot of other indie visual novels that originally came out in English.\n\nAnother thing that makes Cinders really stand out is the way they show you how your choices are affecting the game. Every time a line is changed due to one of your choices, a chime plays and a symbol appears in the corner. Once you reach certain goals (which you gain achievements for on Steam) the starting menu will change to show your awards. And after you reach an ending, there's a screen that shows you all the possible variables in the ending you achieved. I'm impressed to see that it looks like there's a LOT of variables in the ending I got, which makes me really interested in what other possibilities there are! (It should also help the game have lots of value as well--my first playthrough was probably around three hours or so, so I'm expecting to get a good amount of playtime in to complete all the endings and branching paths...10-15 hours is what I'm estimating right now.) \n\nI was also impressed by the number of choices present in the game--they happen frequently, and never feel pointlessly shoved in. I don't know how well the illusion of choice will hold up in further playthroughs but at least in this first one I really felt like my choices had an impact, which makes me very pleased.\n\nAs for the story--I loved it. Nearly all of the characters are interesting and have different layers to uncover from what I've seen in the game so far. I particularly like what's been done with the stepsisters--the game doesn't quite make excuses for them, but does a lot to make it make sense why they'd be so cruel to Cinders. Finding out more about Sophia in particular (who is probably my favorite character) is something I'm looking forward to trying to uncover in later playthroughs.\n\nIf I had one complaint, the only thing I could come up with is that at times the game's dialogue clashes with the tone they seem to be going for. They're trying to make the story feel like it's in a historical place--one where there are elements of fantasy, but that could otherwise reasonably exist at some point in history. But a lot of the dialogue feels oddly modern and even occasionally slang-y. I don't think this is exactly a problem, but it does clash at times with their attempts to make things feel 'historical.' \n\nBut honestly, that's a nitpick, and one I gave partially so this review wouldn't be completely glowing.

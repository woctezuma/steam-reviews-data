It\u2019s a classic 90s FPS featuring fast-paced, skill-based combat where the only way to win is to get the super fun guns first and steam roll the competition. [i]Unreal Tournament[/i] was originally released in 1999 exclusively for Windows but later got ported to Mac, PlayStation 2, and the Dreamcast over the course of 2000 and 2001 (it was [b]that[/b] popular). And while originally intended as an expansion of the original [i]Unreal[/i], it was so successful, that it became its own series and pretty much overshadowed the original single-player focused game.\n\nThe story is pretty much what you\u2019d expect from a 90s FPS, you\u2019re the latest contestant in the titular tournament that started as a way to end violent miner riots and your goal is to win. And that\u2019s pretty much it. \n\nNow the game does have various modes to help spice things up (cause deathmatch would get boring after a while). First you have the standard deathmatch modes which basically are getting to the set number of frags first either in a chaotic free-for-all or as a team. Capture the flag, which is trying to take the enemy flag while defending yours. Last man standing which is pretty much FFA deathmatch with the added twist of limited lives. And assault which your basic attack/defend gamemode. All of these which can be played either with real world players or with various bots and even possibly putting some mutators to spice things a bit (or a lot. or in some cases [b]literally[/b]).\n\nNow running on the original Unreal Engine, this game runs like a dream on any modern computer with a graphics card and ran super well when I played this on a laptop running a 64-bit Windows 8.1 much like the Id Tech game released around the same time,\n\nOverall this game is worth the time and money and definitely pick up the deal pack when it\u2019s on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1516345800, "timestamp_updated": 1516345800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39393420": {"recommendationid": "39393420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021904135", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 179, "last_played": 1516184418}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just as much fun as back in the day.

In this review I will focus on what prevents UT99 from staying contemporary and what gradually have made it die out.\n\nUT was a great game despite some of its flaws but with time other games have come around and what was not much of a flaw back in the day had now become one (like the mouse issue, which probably was not sensible with a ball mouse).\n\nThe original flaw of weapon imbalance (which prevented it from becoming an esport) is a part of the game itself and others are the lack of certain settings that could and should have been added over the years to keep the game a bit \"up to date\".\n\nThis could especially have been expected to have happened along with a steam release or some anniversary but that has not been the case.\n\nOne of these elementary updates could have fixed the mouse problem for which I have tried just about everything to solve and still persists. Note, this mouse problem persists regardless of mouse, Windows version, Pointer Presicion on or off, OpenGL dll replacement or ingame settings and it manifests itself through sensitivity irregularities of some sort and what feels like some kind of filter.\n\n\nOther updates to the game could have included:\n\n\n- Resolution update so 1080p, 1440p, 4k etc and other resolutions and upcoming resolutions can be set via menu.\n\n- Centre all hits so that everything your fire lands in the middle of the screen (should atleast be optional for those who prefer it)\n\n- Steam Clouding for all settings and game progress\n\n- Various Crosshairsettings \n\n- Add FOV settings in regular menu (instead of consol commands)\n\n- Gun position option through coordinates (x y z)\n\n- Enemy brightskins or highlighters (everyone are currently a bit camoflaged)\n\n\nThere are more neutral updates like the ones above that would keep the game up to date without changing it.\n\n\nRecommended for:\n\n* People who want the good old game \n\n\nNot Recommended for:\n\n* Everyone that falls outside of \"People who want the good old game\"\n\n\nSince the latter one is the larger group I will

A problem easily bypassed by setting compatibility to wXPsp2 much like most games from that era on modern machines.\n\nThe online community is still there all be it small they are just as fun and ferocious. \nHowever, I don't play this to play online, i play it on LAN with my mates for 'retro' *shudder* lan party pissups and the experience reigns true to back in the day right down to the high pitched squeels people make when you run up to them with the Impact Hammer >:)\n\nThe maps and game modes are a true gem of this game. \nThe Maps are well balanced, exceptionally well designed and flow fantastically and a true testiment to the tallent behind it. The Game modes and Mutators keep it fresh even today. Getting bored? INSTAGIB FACING WORLDS BIIIISH\n\nNot to mention the music, ooohhh the music. (DM-Gothic wins)\n\nAs far as LAN play goes, you will have to 'set up' a dedicated server on some ones PC that runs in the background. \nIt unsurprisingly, has little to no hit to CPU power, even in large populated games.\n\nWhich brings me to the UUUUUUUUGE catalog of amazing mods. \nDue to the sheer amount of them i will name two of my favourites: \nCHAOS UT: adds mele weapons like battle axes and really mixes up the game. \nMatrix Mod: Adds wall running and Bullet time (i don't recommend the latter option)\n\nThe core gameplay is as fun as it was on release day with the added bonus of some mods that fix some niggling issues some might have.\n\nI can't recommend this game any higher than I do.

The maps are brilliant all perfectly designed for their specific game mode. Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Domination, Last Man Standing, Capture The Flag and Assault are the game modes available with Deathmatch and Assault being my personal favourites but all are entertaining in their own way.\n\nThe frantic pace of the game combined with the verticality of the maps provides for awesome action and never ending fun. The ai is amazing because they react and play almost like a real person would. There is a legendary selection of weapons in the game each with their own unique aesthetic and function and all have a primary and secondary firing modes, some of which can be combined for devastating effect. Each gun has its own strengths and none of them are really useless. \n\nThe soundtrack is also something of a masterpiece. The tracks perfectly fit the action and make the matches so intense. So what\u2019s wrong with it? Well...nothing really. You\u2019d have to seriously nitpick to find something because its just such a well designed game.

Sure, many people of the modern generation will denounce this game due to the aging graphics but there are plenty of redeeming factors about this game.\n\nThe first time you run this game, you're introduced to the kick ass soundtrack of Unreal Tournament. Many modern first person shooter games seem to make their soundtrack sound as if they are from some hollywood studio whilst this game's soundtrack doesn't many you feel like an actor but rather it makes you feel like you're going to unleash the ultimate killing spree. The soundtrack is probably by far the best video game soundtrack I have ever heard, it packs memorable beats and further encourages you to play this game.\n\nThe maps in this game are definitely unique to those of modern first person shooter games, the maps provide a consistent atmosphere to the environment the game is set in. The maps are also very well designed and take advantage of simplicity and maze-like patters to utilise the gameplay. It feels so awesome to be jumping in low gravity on a giant rock with two towers spinning around in space, or to be shooting bots off elongated platforms into a massive pile of biosludge. There is so many good maps (in my opinion Facing Worlds and Deck16 are by far the best maps this game has to provide) giving you plenty of different ways you could play this game, such as vast environments give you more room to dodge attacks etc. The maps on this game are fantastic.\n\nThe weapons offer you many different ways to kill someone, as most of them come with some pretty cool alt-fire modes (with the Rocket Launcher having the most combinations of these modes) which can solve many tough situations other players could place you in. The weapons include; The Impact Hammer / Chainsaw alteration (worst weapon in the game BY FAR), Enforcer Pistol (you can DUAL WIELD THESE MOTHERFUCKERS), Biorifle (Pretty useless, but best in confined areas), Minigun, Pulse Gun (You can shoot LIGHTNING with the alt fire mode), Razorjack (Shoot razors that bounce off walls and the alt fire mode can make them EXPLODE), ASMD Shock Rifle (Basically a plasma gun, has a really neat combo which allows you to make the alt-fire plasma ball explode creating a large explosion), Flak Cannon (Pray mercy for those on the recieving end of this weapon), Rocket Launcher (shoots sometimes guided rockets and also grenades, pretty good stuff), Sniper Rifle (alt fire just allows you to use the scope) and probably saved best to last... The Redeemer (a giant motherfucking bazooka which shoots guided nuclear warheads, either ways anyone you fire this at is fucked). These weapons are fantastic and define most of the game's actions.\n\nThe gamemodes are really cool on this game, you could be spending hours playing on classic Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch, have great time humiliating the enemy team on Capture The Flag, run around the match capturing points in Domination, liberating bases from the enemy team's hands in Assault and finally see who will survive last in Last Man Standing. These game modes can be enhanced by mutators which can significantly change the gameplay of each gamemode.\n\nThe modding community, still active appaently and provides hundreds of new maps, mutators, character skins, weapons, voice packs for taunts, modding still makes this nearly 20 year old gem still feel fresh, not to mention they are all FREE so you don't have to pay for extra content when the community offers all of this extra content for free. The community itself is fantastic and helpful on the forums despite all the years that have went by.\n\nSeriously there is so many awesome things I could talk about in this game which would've made this review even longer, but I give this game a solid 10/10 and would recommend this to anyone who wants to play an action packed FPS with friends or bots.", "timestamp_created": 1509888012, "timestamp_updated": 1509888012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562044", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36292307": {"recommendationid": "36292307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318791006", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515236868}, "language": "finnish", "review": "This game is so amazing I love it.

Se puede jugar solo (con bots o una \"campa\u00f1a\"), multijugador. Posee varios modos de juegos (en uno incluso tienes un aparato para teletransportarte), una gran cantidad de mapas. Y una variedad de armas raras con distintos usos, y dise\u00f1os \"raros\" (por as\u00ed decirlo), la \u00fanica semejante a un arma real ser\u00eda la Minigun y la Enforce (debo decir que tuvieron bastante creatividad al crear las armas). \n\n[*][h1][b]GR\u00c1FICOS 5/5[/b][/h1]\nPara el a\u00f1o, nada de lo que quejarse. Tiene buenos gr\u00e1ficos, buenos mapas en 3D, los personajes se ven bien, y especialmente el dise\u00f1o de las armas. \n\n[*][h1][b]JUGABILIDAD 5/5[/b][/h1]\nLa jugabilidad est\u00e1 perfecta, a mi parecer. El jugador tiene que ir acostumbr\u00e1ndose a los mapas mientras aprende los distintos usos de algunas armas, y con esto, adem\u00e1s poder crear t\u00e1cticas para el combate. \n\n[*][h1][b]OTROS 5/5[/b][/h1]\nLa trama gira que en el 2291 el gobierno crea unas ligas para un combate sin reglas, con el objetivo de frenar la violencia. Con esto supieron que era su mejor negocio, y crearon una liga de los profesionales, y somos elegidos para participar en esa liga. Si tengo que desatacar otra cosa, ser\u00eda una obvia: La IA. De seguro es una de los mejores en sus tiempos, adem\u00e1s de tener varias dificultados (desde novato, hasta maestro y godlike). Tal vez no es de las mejores, pero la OST es buena.\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]CONCLUSI\u00d3N[/b][/h1]\nPara el a\u00f1o, el premio GOTY, y los dem\u00e1s premios que gan\u00f3, los tiene merecido.

Weapons felt weak and didn't have much mechanics depth. But this game, sucked me in right on. Although I don't nowadays play the vanilla game really, more the numerous mods.\n\nPros:\n\n- Wide weapon variety, only 3 conventional firearms. Two weapons you spawn with are a pretty potent and satisfying sounding pistol, secondarily a pneumatic hammer device that can be used for jumping higher than without and it can deflect projectiles with the altfire. Third weapon shoots globs of volatile and sticky green goo, secondary fire loads up a larger glob that travels very painfully slow but can turn opposition inside out in a single hit. 4th weapon is a fully automatic plasma gun, altfire however is a cutter beam that is seriously deadly if you can keep aim on a frantically moving enemy. Fifth weapon is a minigun. Primary fire is slow but remains accurate on any range, secondary fire spews bullets madly but has high spread. Sixth weapon shoots sharp discs that are a one hit kill if they hit neck. Secondary fire has them explode on contact, handy for example so that you can push enemies over a ledge. Seventh weapon is a cumbersome shotgunish thing that shoots instead of pellets, about fist sized metal chunks. Secondary fire tosses the whole shell, it explodes on contact. Eighth one is a good old rocket launcher whose explosions seriously throw an enemy around nicely. Altfire lobs the rockets aa grenades. Ninth weapon is a sniper rifle. Nuff said. Last one is a mininuke missile launcher. Whoa, I wrote a book.\n\n- Bots' AI is impressive.\n\n- Lots of mods of all types kinds. I recommend Nali Weapons 3, Excessive Unreal 2, Xidia, Seven Bullets and Operation Na Pali.\n\n- Great map design. Most maps have beautiful scenery yet still perfect placement of pickups and smooth \"flow\".\n\n- Gunplay. While I told about the weapons already, what they do each, I didn't mention that they are satisfying to shoot. Loud and clear sounds. Proper viewshake.\n\n- Variety of gamemodes. Capture the flag, deathmatch, tdm.

Played this like crazy when I was younger.  \n\nDefinitely get this if its on sale, I scored it for $2.  The reason I say that, is there is some difficulty getting this game to run properly on modern machines.  When I first bought this game, I was running a Windows 8 machine.  I could start the game, the intro video would load all weird, then I could attempt to play, but once the actual gameplay launched the mouse didn't work and I was stuck spinning and staring at the ground or something.  Completely unplayable and never found a fix.\n\nFast forward to more recently, I have a different machine now running Windows 10 and I tried to get it running on this one.  It does not run perfectly, as the intro video is still all messed up, but when I enter the match things run solid.  Took some tweaking with resolution settings and stuff to get it to run how I wanted.\n\nSo just a heads up, as I do recommend the game, get it on sale, as there is no guarantee you may be able to get it running correctly, and may take a lot of work and research to do so.

In fact I have to think hard just to find some fault with it. It really is one of the highlights of 90s shooters, and I could say that very few games released since then have even come close to providing the same level of quality and quantity of things to do as this game. \n\nThe graphics are colourful and still look great, there are so many levels, characters, settings/modifiers for matches, game modes, and guns to play with. Back then game companies really wanted the player to have everything and this is one of the last great games where they thought about the gamer first. The only issue with this game really is that modern system may run it SO fast that you\u2019ll actually have to download a patch or two to slow the game down so your character doesn\u2019t run 100 times faster than they should.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough, it provides so much content and plays so well.

Surprisingly [b]Unreal Tournament[/b] still holds up today and i'm [i]stoked[/i]! Even though the online multiplayer is long dead but i already expected that from the get-go given the age of the game and the plethora of other more popular FPS.\n\nLuckily you can still play against bots and you can set a high difficulty which provides a decent challenge if you're so inclined to enjoy this game again. You can pick from the basic game modes like deathmatch, capture the flag, assault, etc. and you get to choose from a good range of maps. \n\nBut by far, my favorite thing about Unreal Tournament are the pre-loaded modifiers which create a whole new element to gameplay that still keeps me coming back i.e. zero gravity, one-shot kill, etc.. At the time this came out it was awesome and IMHO it still is! I still have clear memories burned deep of hours spent just zoning out on the maps and the soundtrack... oh the feels!\n\nMaps like Facing Worlds for Capture the Flag, and Morpheus for Zero Gravity Deathmatch are the prime reason why i went ahead and purchased Unreal Tournament on here and i can't tell you how happy i am that it runs like a dream!\n\nFunny enough, as much as i played the early multiplayer FPS's like Unreal Tournament and Quake 3 Arena... there are still a number of maps that i never touched on here. Definitely rectifying that!\n\n[h1]===== VERDICT =====[/h1]\n\nIf you want to see where the origins of multiplayer FPS came from and actually be able to enjoy it in a visual setting that still holds up, you need to just get this game and have a go at it. \n\nMind you, it's easy to dismiss Unreal Tournament given its age and how today we're used to better graphics, and the concept of multiplayer [b]bots[/b] isn't so acceptable nowadays when the alternative of playing online is available, but it's really not too shabby at all!

I was horrible at it but this game is the reason i play video games today. I actually made my steam account just so i would always have access to it since i had lost my disc a long time. I recently just bought a steam machine and windows 10 just so i could play this game. The new unreal tournament just doesn't satisfy the hunger for this game (The new one is still pretty awsome tho). Running on windows 10 was really simple by using the opengl as my renderer. I picked Direct3d at the initial setup and it did not work (super buggy, low frames, completely unplayable). Everything i googled about running on windows 10 required downloading drivers or messing with the files by copy and pasting into the unrealtournament.ini. I decided to give opengl a try before trying anything crazy and now it runs better than I remembered. Its not as fast as quake but its fast compared to alot of popular fps titles. If you love halo multiplayer or doom 2016 multiplayer you will fall in love with this classic. Steam gives you the 436 version.

However there are a select few games which I would consider \"Must Plays\". Games so important and timeless that - provided you have any interest in the genre what-so-ever - you have to own. Oblivion would be such a game for the open-world genre, Dawn of War for the RTS genre. Why? Neither game is perfect by any means, but they are landmarks, marking turning points and signifying a leap forwards.\n\nThe FPS genre could have a number of games put forwards for this presitgious honour, but for reasons which shall soon become apparent, the only real contender is Unreal Tournament.\n\nUT99 as it shall be referred to from here on, marked the modernisation of a format which had been in the making for several years. Quake 3 Arena was a popular alternative but play Quake 3 now, and while it is still thoroughly enjoyable, it feels old. It still has the terrible animations, the clinically un-atmospheric environments, the soapy aftertaste of a game lacking in passion and excitement.\n\nUT99 put all of this right. The levels were beautifully designed and characterful, with each and every square inch dripping with details and offering a plethora of combat options. Every weapon had its own personality, there was no progression or advancement from one to the next; just a change in options. Even the characters each had sparks of life in their eyes. But what really set it apart from the rest of the pack was the music. Without the music, UT99 would have been a great game. But the soundtrack elevated it up to the prestigious podium of mastercrafted perfection.\n\nUT99 set new standard for combat, level design, graphic capability, combat scale and bot intelligence. However it's use of  musical scores changed the way games would be designed forever. UT99's stablemates in its year of release almost uniformly did away with soundtracks, save for the occasional musical score. In the year following its release, soundtracks became more common, especially noticable in games like No One Lives Forever and Hitman. Go forwards just one more year, and games such as Halo and Serious Sam join the fray. Both very different games, but what do they have in common? Iconic soundtracks.\n\nUT99 is a fundementally vital game for the advancement of the FPS and the arena shooter, and it deserves its place in the halls of fame (and your library) for that alone. However the next time you notice the musical atmosphere in a game, remember that you have this game to thank.", "timestamp_created": 1480208186, "timestamp_updated": 1480208186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27752163": {"recommendationid": "27752163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035189771", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451085787}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un clasico entre clasicos, rapido e intenso", "timestamp_created": 1480205727, "timestamp_updated": 1480205727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27731433": {"recommendationid": "27731433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069790049", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480195263}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "TOP. melhor jogo que ja joguei, super viciante.

But here goes:\n\nMultiplayer:  Is insane.  And very customisable, especially given it's age.  So if you want to put 24 players into a map designed for a max of 6 and make every weapon a rocket launcher, go for it.  Want every gun to insta-kill and every player be invisible?  This game invented that.  Don't have even teams?  Put a few bots in, they have an option to scale their difficulty to that of the players.  Low-gravity & optinal item power-ups?  These are options from a game that was made in 1999.\n\nSingle Player:  Arguably as good as playing multiplayer, and that's BANANAS.  There are 5 different tournaments to win (1 for every play-mode, Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch/Domination/CTF/Assault) and that's plobably about 10 hours of gameplay already.  Assault in particular is like finding there's a rumpus room in a house you've been living in for a year and only just found out about.  Then there is also custom games where you can fill any map with AI players.  These bots can be customised to have names, favourite weapons, be aggressive or cowardly, more accurate or less accurate, and to have varying awareness levels.\n\nWeapons:  Best fps weapon design...maybe ever?  Every weapon has an alternate firing mode, and some have extra features on top of that, while still being completely accessible to a new player.  Take the Rocket Launcher;  Click fire once, fire one rocket.  Hold it down and it will load up to 6 rockets and fire them in a spread. If you follow a target for a few seconds before firing, your crosshair will change and that means you're locked on and your rockets will be homing. Hit right-click and you get a capped rocket instead that acts like a grenade.  Hold it down and it will load up to 6.  This is a single gun, and I'm not even joking when I say it's not overpowered, because every single weapon is just as deadly in it's own ways and thay all combine to be a ton of fun.\n\nThis game, at the time I write this, is less than $5.  Give it a shot.  I promise that if you look past graphics which are polygonal but far from unwatchable, this game will impress you.", "timestamp_created": 1480001442, "timestamp_updated": 1480001442, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27197902": {"recommendationid": "27197902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050200814", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 53, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511628565}, "language": "polish", "review": "Stae dobre czasy :).", "timestamp_created": 1480000012, "timestamp_updated": 1480000012, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27162238": {"recommendationid": "27162238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132958092", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497293588}, "language": "english", "review": "Most satisfying \"headshot\" you'd ever hear.", "timestamp_created": 1479994166, "timestamp_updated": 1479994166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27159058": {"recommendationid": "27159058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035110331", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467537968}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0432\u0430 , \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0435\u0435 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 , \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0438\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043c \u043b\u0430\u0439\u043a , \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0434\u0448\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0431\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043d\u0443\u0442!", "timestamp_created": 1479993611, "timestamp_updated": 1479993611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27158138": {"recommendationid": "27158138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085186841", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1514830436}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0435\u044e\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0435\u0441\u0442", "timestamp_created": 1479993447, "timestamp_updated": 1479993447, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27134459": {"recommendationid": "27134459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115659432", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507197482}, "language": "italian", "review": "Uno dei primi e classici sparattutto in prima persona genere arena, quello che ha fatto da padre della storia di questo genere.\nPuro e divertente, questo \u00e8 Unreal Tournament", "timestamp_created": 1479989142, "timestamp_updated": 1479989142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27124620": {"recommendationid": "27124620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039154314", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507892538}, "language": "english", "review": "Even 17 years after being released to the public, this game is my go-to when I get bored of modern games and can come back to an older time, a better time.

The variety of game types, the variety of weapons, the beauty of the maps, and the bot AI makes it the ultimate competitive FPS. It's all about the Tournament. And there are so many different kinds of tournament games to play, against real people or bots.\n\nWhat's also very nice is the ability to set up your own favourite kind of practice session, with bots of your choosing, on whatever map you want. So, for example, you can play capture the flag, you alone against a large army of stupid bots, or a single insanely good bot. Or you can have a bot team, and give them commands. Or you can just set up a bots-only competition, and just watch them go at it.\nUnreal Tournament has no need for a story. It's no-fuss interface allows the game-player to immediately launch themselves into the 'Unreal Tournament'- a futuristic fight-to-the-death, and as more scenarios are completed, four other game formats are introduced. There's 'capture the flag', in which you lead a team of fighters in an attempt to capture the opposing team's flag, all while defending your own. Following that, there's 'domination', a somewhat boring format that has your team controlling as many 'point scorers' as possible in order to amass your growing total to a winning score. The most exciting format is 'assault', whereby your team infiltrates either a submarine or a moving train, or whatever, in order to satisfy a number of mission objectives, all under a given time period. \nAnd don't forget that the game screams on today's machines -- smooth as silk, and very pretty.", "timestamp_created": 1477655166, "timestamp_updated": 1477655166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26261295": {"recommendationid": "26261295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152522109", "num_games_owned": 482, "num_reviews": 42, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514443126}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've ever played as a kid, Still the best", "timestamp_created": 1477640587, "timestamp_updated": 1477640587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26190662": {"recommendationid": "26190662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000577130", "num_games_owned": 387, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500601765}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite first person shooters of all time.

Simply being \"good\" is not enough to make it as a \"classic\", and the telltale sign of a classic since time immemorial, is that the game starts amazing and remains amazing even as it ages. It's a quality that transcends even nostalgia.\n\nUnreal Tournament (UT99), is one of those few \"true classic\" games. It's a genuine classic; among the pinnacle of shooters not only of its time, but of all FPS games ever made. The sheer versatility of the game engine, its incredible array of mods, the incredible depth and value of content that comes with just the base game...I do not exaggerate one bit when I say that nobody makes games of this quality and value anymore.\n\nIt isn't perfect, no game is, but in a game market historically plagued with style over substance design, UT99 managed to give us both in every way that matters.

All the guns perform great and are easy to use. The campaign is a biy meh, but the robustness of the matches you can create with the bots means you can sink hours into this just seeing how the matches will play out. There's well over 20 maps on offer here, which is something unheard of in the modern market. The graphics are simple and blocky, but are serviceable enough, and the music and sound effects are excellent. You can still play it online. I was able to find full servers for deathmatch even 17 years after the initial release. You can also mod it as much as you please, as the modding community is still active to this day. One mod I would suggest if you do this would be ChaosUT. It adds new maps and weapons, my personal favorite being the sword.

It was one of the best times of my life (Partially because of this game). This is one of the best Arena Shooters ever. If you ever played a good Halo game (Multiplayer) you can thank games like Unreal Tournament and Quake for that enjoyment. Because Halo is also an Arena shooter but these games brought the genre to the light. This game had gameplay beyond any other shooter in its time. Its a lot of fun, the bots in this game are amazing, and its probably one of the most bug free games I've ever played. The maps are mostly symmetrical (Caters towards fun and even gameplay so the only thing that seperates players is skill) and very easy to learn. If you want to get really good at games like this you're going to want to learn where the weapons spawn and how long it takes them to respawn. The movement mechanics in games like this are essentials to learn. You can learn to use the dodge feature, Rocket jumping and many other mechanics. Overall this game is one of the best shooters I've ever played. I recommend this game to everyone.

Still totally worth playing today. \n\nWhy to buy it: Historical masterpiece. Perfect for relaxation. It helps to find peace and emptiness after a hard day at work. More efficient than meditation, sauna, or sport. \n\nLong version:\n\nUnreal Tournament has something magical. It has been years since its original release, and still, it's amazingly good and definitely worth playing. For those who do not know this ultimate legend of FPS, let me introduce it in a few lines :\n\nMost FPS have tried to find a neat story to keep the player into the game. Then someone came and said: \"Hey, guys, why do we care with a story? Don't we play only to shoot and have fun, after all?\" And so came Unreal Tournament. The idea is that you are a gladiator in a futuristic universe, with some interesting background with appreciable ties with the Unreal universe. So you are in an arena with guns spread everywhere, and if you are killed, you just instantly respawn and continue the fight. It means there is no break, no searching for the way forward, for stupid opening buttons. You just fight and fight and fight endlessly, until you win the match. The experience was, and still remains, an extremely intense one. Videogame here is at its greater height, even if it's shear violence and barbarousness. \n\nNow, is it still worth today? The graphics have aged, for sure, but the level design was so good, that it doesn't matter a lot. They did not try to build magnificent open spaces areas in a luxurious nature: Most arenas are confined basements, and this is the kind of decor which cannot be much prettier today than it was seventeen years ago. Gameplay is still pretty much perfect. Weapons are sufficiently hidden so that you have to find out where they are while trying not being killed by those who already have them, and there is a good diversity of them. Everything was well-balanced then, and it has remained so up to now, as equilibrium never ages. \n\nWhat feels like the twentieth century, however, is the AI if you play solo, especially in Assault mode, where your team keeps following you, backing you up in the most useless manner. That means that if you are almost at the objective, and you die, you return to the starting point, and your team, instead of finishing what you were up to, just left the enemy base to greet you in pack at your respawn place. \n\nTo end this review, I will tell you some personal story I have with this game. In my youth years I was often bullied by a big tough guy; but one day we spoke and, I don't know really how, we ended up by him lending me his Unreal Tournament game. I enjoyed it a lot, and now that we had a common enthralling to share, we became good lads and he never bullied me again. Peace among people can be achieved through cathartic  videogaming, it would seem. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1467967150, "timestamp_updated": 1467967150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544656", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24152320": {"recommendationid": "24152320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107964888", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467648737}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good but no one plays it......", "timestamp_created": 1467879322, "timestamp_updated": 1467879322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24128838": {"recommendationid": "24128838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016259041", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465584405}, "language": "english", "review": "classic fps", "timestamp_created": 1467792157, "timestamp_updated": 1467792157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24113044": {"recommendationid": "24113044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074308189", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511148878}, "language": "spanish", "review": "lo mejor", "timestamp_created": 1467736664, "timestamp_updated": 1467736664, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24094721": {"recommendationid": "24094721", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984725886", "num_games_owned": 1384, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467670301}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, it's old, we get it.\nThe thing is: even with outdated graphics, it's still one of the best arena shooters around.\nIt even has a campaign (ok, it's a sequence of maps, but with a cool boss battle at the end).\nFast as hell, acrobatic, and FUN.\n\nIf you have a gaming group, buy it.\nIf you play alone, buy it and play with bots.", "timestamp_created": 1467670724, "timestamp_updated": 1467670724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24092634": {"recommendationid": "24092634", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989983420", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 313, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467914875}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c. \u041d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u0433\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442.", "timestamp_created": 1467665361, "timestamp_updated": 1480947544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.954265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24073100": {"recommendationid": "24073100", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986049273", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 923, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514088115}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played this game back in 2001/02 on my crappy HP Pavilion I got from Circuit City my freshman year at college.

I used to play DOOM 2 deathmatch over dialup when I was younger, and I was part of the Quake Alpha/Beta deathmatch trials back in the day. I loved online deathmatch, but went away from it for many years as FPS maps grew and gameplay slowed down. Playing DOOM 2016 deathmatch didn\u2019t feel \u201cright\u201d, and the STEAM comments kept referring to Unreal as a much better online shooter experience. So I grabbed UT GOTY and the rest of the UT series. How right these commenters were\u2026.Unreal Tournament GOTY is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are amazing, the gameplay is action packed \u2013 so fast and adrenaline pumping. It is a pure Arena FPS, and in my opinion Unreal perfected the formula with UT GOTY. I\u2019ve played the later games, which are fun in their own way \u2013 but this is just perfection. I loved the Mortal Kombat style voice over as the match went on\u2026\u201dKilling Spree\u2026.MULTI KILL\u201d \u2013 and the tirade of smartass one liners from the bots, full of personality each one of them. The science fiction theme allows so much variety in levels, which are all full of colour and life\u2026no brown and drab here. Musically, the tracks are all pumping electronica, that capture the essence of each level and the thrill of combat. The story, thin as it is, is all it needs to be \u2013 a couple of lines introducing the character or level, and the fact you are in an interstellar deathmatch tourney run by an evil corporation (cool!). The levels are awe inspiring, and I\u2019d have to say the Facing World CTF map is up there with icons such as the Colosseum and Pyramids in its grandeur and online community reverence. No wonder it appears in all the sequels! Even if the online community dies off for this game (I can still get a match online today (2016) through the game which was released in 1999!) \u2013 I could always play with the bots, which are powered by the amazing Reaper technology which kept me hooked on Quake when I was younger. Thankfully I discovered this game late in life, otherwise I probably would have been hooked and not able to study or work or find a relationship.

I used to love this game this is totally unplayable.\n\nThe company has put no effort into compatability with modern graphics cards and no effort into using better textures or using any of the better user designed levels. I stopped playing after just two screens and thought \"I've been had\". Can I get my money back?\n\n[EDIT]\nAfter a lot of trial and error I found that switching to OpenGL in the graphics options fixes the pause options I was getting. I'm quite enjoying the game now. I still think it should be cheaper, with better textures and additional maps.

The game was a spinoff title to Unreal. However unlike Unreal (which focused on single player), the game was instead an arena shooter with online multiplayer in mind. Despite this the game does have a single player campaign. The story for this game is as follows, 100 years has passed since the events within Unreal, a mining corporation known as Liandri is hosting a no-holds-barred fighting tournament. You have entered the Tournament to become the next champion, by competing in 4 different leagues which have their own game modes and unlock the fifth league in order to beat the previous tournament champion Xan. There really isn\u2019t much to the story and whilst there is more information within the single player campaign explaining the lore, character motivations and certain events within the Unreal Universe, it really doesn\u2019t add that much to the overall story.  \n\nThe graphics weren\u2019t a huge improvement over Unreal, the reason for this was to increase performance when playing the game and maintain a high framerate with its fast pace gameplay. Despite this the game was still good looking for its time and the locations, level design, ascetics and environments in some maps is absolutely jaw dropping. A lot of the maps where set in different locations such as inside a spaceship, on an asteroid floating in space, inside an old medieval castle etc. It made each map feel more different and unique from each other. The soundtrack is also to the same quality as Unreal and is extremely good with some standouts like Foregone Destruction and Mechanism Eight. \n\n In terms of gameplay you are given 6 different game modes, deathmatch which is a free for all, team deathmatch where two teams battle each other and the team with the most kills usually wins, capture the flag where two teams have to get the enemies team flag and bring it back to their own flag without the enemy taking theirs, domination where two teams have to take and keep control of key locations across the map, last man standing which is similar to deathmatch only players are given a full arsenal of weapons and have to stay alive as long as possible and assault which was a brand new game mode for its time. This is where players where broken up into two teams.(offensive and defensive)The offensive team have to complete key objectives in order to advance and win, the defenders have to prevent the other team from completing these objectives for as long as possible or until the timer ran out, both teams alternate and whichever team defends the longest wins. \n\nThe weapons in this game vary from familiar favourites such as the Flak Cannon and the Minigun and some new weapons like the Pulse Gun which replaces the Stinger. Each returning weapon has been given a minor tweak, such as having a faster rate of fire. The standout weapon among all of these is the newly added Redeemer a one use weapon which fires a rocket with a powerful area of effect annihilating anything within its radius. The bot\u2019s in this game are extremely good and highly intelligent offering up a challenge when the player needs it. Overall Unreal Tournament is a fantastic game and is still fun to play today. The bots are a good enough challenge to play with and even though it isn\u2019t played as much online today you can still find a game with a few people to fill in the server or if you\u2019re setting up a LAN event any time soon then this game should be on your list.\n", "timestamp_created": 1456761435, "timestamp_updated": 1456761435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21536929": {"recommendationid": "21536929", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169074310", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456707320}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Este foi o primeiro jogo que joguei quando era crian\u00e7a e continua lindo e maravilhoso!

If you get the game (which I heavily recommend you do on all levels) I'd try out Monsterhunt as a gamemode eventually but don't forget to try offline with bots. With all the mutators and modifications you can make to your private games it is endless joy. There is also an offline vs bots Tournament (hence the name) where you can climb the ladders of different gamemodes to fight the final boss who I will not spoil for you, but is also my favorite UT character.\n\nEnjoy!", "timestamp_created": 1454762638, "timestamp_updated": 1454762638, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.460696", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20954830": {"recommendationid": "20954830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274286623", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454601368}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430!) \u0432\u043e\u0442 \u0431\u044b \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0433\u043e\u0434 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0440\u043d\u0430\n\u0410", "timestamp_created": 1454613886, "timestamp_updated": 1454613886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20914600": {"recommendationid": "20914600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198146236337", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513103138}, "language": "italian", "review": "Great game for sure, it's made history, but on newer machines it might be a problem to run.", "timestamp_created": 1454431932, "timestamp_updated": 1500534521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20898049": {"recommendationid": "20898049", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058167263", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454351260}, "language": "english", "review": "Having been an avid fan of FPS  since Doom, Quake and then the deathmatch games Quake III arena and this since I was practically 9yrs old - even to this day as an adult this game is by far most enjoyable even in par with the latest fps releases. I still remember the era when online multiplayer gaming with likes of Quake arena and UT lead gaming forward and it was a massive hype. This game is a 10/10 especially rating as a retrogamer too. \nNo UT game compares to this one, not even the latest UT3 of 2008 and its disappointing to say that with every new game there doesnt seem to be much originality in the way of weapons, firing modes, environments unless its user generated even then not much. UT'99 beats even the latest releases. just repetition of old weapon designs and levels with very few innovations, which is probably what disappointed devoted fans overtime. \nOverall, the pros and cons; \nPROS: enjoyable replayable experience, a wide range of unlockable levels and gaming styles (Eg. Team deathmatch, single deatchmatch, CTF etc), quite fast paced and refreshing. \nCONS: Doesn't run well with newer systems since Win7 or newer. Win 8 and Win 10 users beware that you might suffer from fps lag and glitches unless you chaneg some of the preferrences settings.  Eg. I suffered a lot of fps lag while gaming for first time on my new win 8 system, and it was as slow as a snail until I changed the desired framerate in the video settings from 40 upto 100. ALSO to note that the default resolution doesnt help improve visual gameplay experience unless you switch it to 1024x780 or something.  \nBut overall - HIGHLY recommendable.", "timestamp_created": 1454351758, "timestamp_updated": 1454351758, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20885638": {"recommendationid": "20885638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059261354", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 47, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449267941}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "jogava isso no \"janela XP\"", "timestamp_created": 1454291924, "timestamp_updated": 1454291924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20522541": {"recommendationid": "20522541", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082770163", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455211381}, "language": "polish", "review": "good game :D", "timestamp_created": 1452781362, "timestamp_updated": 1514843939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20515223": {"recommendationid": "20515223", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984530593", "num_games_owned": 1258, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510524094}, "language": "english", "review": "Let's put it this way - I liked this game so much, that back in the mid-2000s, I was part of the development team of a group that tried to recreate it in UT2004 (the UTR/UT2341 project).

As such, I may be VERY biased, and my word might not be completely reliable, though I will try as usual to be as fair as possible.\n\nUnreal Tournament is an Arena FPS whom is THE grandfather of the entire genre, of games which are entirely based upon combat in planned stages designed solely for combat, not story. It has fallen into obscurity since Unreal Tournament 2004's release, so allow me to try and show you how this game became such a staple of gaming.\n\nThese days, you've got games that run natively at 60fps, support resolutions for 4K monitors and ultra-wide monitors, and you've got games now which are nearly realistic for appearance. Unreal Tournament, came a bit late, but used it's engine well, Unreal Engine 1, which originated in the first Unreal game, which is an Engine that, even in the 90s, was the cutting edge of graphic fidelity and quality. It stands up even now, despite using polygons, lacking facial animations, but each weapon, and each character looks great even still. Levels still look gorgeous and cool, and almost falling into space still makes me very antsy even after 12 years later.\n\nThe game has only three modes. The Singleplayer Campaign, Multiplayer, and an offline skirmish-style mode titled Instant Action. The Campaign is of you, a new combatant in the newest deathsport known as the Unreal Tournament, where convicts have been turned into gladiators whom kill one another and win with the goal of becoming The Tournament Champion, effectively attaining a sort of celebrity-status. Multiplayer is smooth and reliable. There are no problems with the game itself that I've found, even with this re-release. Modes for it, are identical to Instant Action, only some maps function with people, as you don't need AI pathing with human players.\nInstant Action's modes are Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Last Man Standing, Capture The Flag, Assault and Domination.\nThe only ones which aren't obvious and in other games, are Domination and Assault, so I will describe them.\nAssault, is by far my favorite mode in virtually any game and it is a team-based mode with two teams. One team attacks a base, completing preset objectives and eventually aiming to complete them all, while the other team's objective is to stop the attacking team from completing objectives by any means.\nOnce the attacking team completes their objectives, they win the match, should they do all objectives and both teams switch sides, the defensive team becomes the new attacker, and vice-versa. At this point, the newly attacking team must match the completion time of the other team, or they will suffer a loss of the match. Though the sides switch even if the first attackers don't succeed, allowing both teams to attack and defend each match.\nDomination, on the other hand, is a sort of variant of traditional King of The Hill gamemodes. Only there are multiple Hills, or Points, which either team (up to 4 teams, unlike other modes, save for TDM) must hold to win the match. Holding a point wil generate one score point for the team every 3 seconds or so, and holding more points will generate more.\nIt also has something no non-Unreal title has ever really adopted whole-heartedly; Mutators. Think of a mod, imagine how annoying it is that you can't just tick it on or off, or combine it with others witohut conflict for the most part. Mutators allow you to change parts of the game, like Low Gravity, and entirely different set of weapons, or powerful relics that change the game's strategies, or even classics like Volatile Ammo (ammo that is shot will discharge, resulting in hilarity from shooting ammo than the enemy) and Fatboy (Where your character model gets more \"fat\" or just wider, with obvious texture stretching, based on how well you're doing. Whoever wins, usually ends up being the fattest, while the one who did the worst, ends up like a skinny stick figure).\n\nDue to the game being made in the 90s, the options menu isn't TOO varied, but it sort of gets hte job done.\nIt's got Video Driver settings, Resolution, graphics quality, texture quality (32 bit and 16 bit), A minimum FPS setting for video settings. It has the usual for audio, which technically hasn't changed for many games in years. You can alter the in-game auto-swap priority for different weapons, I personally have dual enforcers at the top above the sniper rifle. Input options are fairly varied with two different forms of sensitivity, and different mouse-based look options.\n\nThe game is difficult... if you want it to be. It has quite literally 12 different difficulties, from Novice to Godlike, there's almost no way anybody is too awful to play any difficulty of this game. With Novice, AI are painfully stupid, maybe even intentionally avoiding powerups in at least early singleplayer levels, whereas in Godlike, the AI become Kung-Fu gun masters, constantly know where you are and instinctually know when items respawn and always try to hog powerups aswell as having almost perfect aim and reaction, even mimicking players by spastically jumping around.\n\nThis game's soundtrack holds up today. In Unreal Tournament 3, most of hte songs are simply remixes of classic songs from this game, there's almost no single song that hasn't made it, and the music in this game are great for listenning when working out, writing, or even playing other games with.\nThe announcer is also very well voiced. It's dominantly used for custom content quite often, mostly in Gmod, though it's confused for the Announcer in Quake 3 Arena... which is actually more of a knock-off with 90% less recorded dialogue and announcements.\n\nThe game has barely any Story. IN the campaign, you are a newly brought-in convict in charge of your own team. Your goal? To climb the ladder of this tournament deathsport (which is canon as a sort of reality show to the human race) and to become the Tournament Champion by defeating it's first champion, Xan Kreigor... who is really hard to kill in-game. That's it though. You gain trophies though, and they still look cool!\n\nThe game comes with a decent amount of content, but given how some still play multiplayer, and that if you look in the right places, you can find over 10 GBs worth of custome content. Given how I once had only 2 gbs of content on my copy of the game in the past, that was over 500 maps, 7 game modes, 4 mods, and many mutators.\nSome of these maps have neutral AI players which are super-powerful and are remixed versions of other official maps, using a different theme, or maps of such quality, you'd think\nSome of these custom gamemodes is the wonderful Monster Hunt, like Assault, but the defending team is always the monsters, and the players are always attacking to get to the end before losing all their lives, or the chaotic 4-Team Capture The Flag. My second favorite is Jailbreak, bbasically Team Deathmatch meets Capture The Flag. Two teams aiming to kill one another and jail them, then watch them get executed, sometimes able to have prisoners of either team pit against one another in a 1v1 where the winner goes free, and it's possible to release your team by going into enemy territory.\n\nThis game is simply one of my favorites. It's always been one of my favorite as I can't remember a time it wasn't installed on my computer. Even just to play the Campaign, I've never forgotten this game, and I always have had a copy of it since I first played it when I was 10. If you like FPS games, or the idea of a gladiatorial arena-style game tickles your fancy, then pick this game up. There's more custom content than what I suggested like voice packs, models, even Total Conversions and far more.\n\nI recommend this due to it simply being one of the best Arena FPS' to ever appear on the market.

Due to an increase in reports of violence among deep space miners, the NEG sees the organization of gladitorial tournaments as a means of redirecting unrest among the working class for profit.  The largest mining corporation, Liandri Mining Corp. (LMC) begins providing arenas for the Tournament as well as broadcasting the event throughout the known galaxy.  LMC's profits soar as athletes, condemned criminals, mercenaries, soldiers, and regular citizens travel across the universe to compete.\n\nThe game takes place fifty years after the NEG's unprecedented decision.  As one character from a diverse roster of participants, the player competes in the Tournament's various events for unique reasons.  The ultimate goal?  Depose Xan Kriegor, the undefeated Tournament champion, and claim universal renown.\n\n[b] Gameplay [/b]\n\nA first person shooter (FPS) in the truest sense, Unreal Tournament 1999 (UT99) sees players compete against AI and/or human opponents in a variety of game modes.  Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch have players racing to be the first to get a set amount of kills alone or as a team respectively.  Domination sees two teams fighting over control points, with every point controlled adding to the respective team's total; the first team to accrue a set amount of points wins.  Capture the Flag has the teams capture the enemy flag for points while defending their own at the same time.  Finally, Assault has one team in an offensive role while the opposite team plays a defensive role.  Maps that assualt take place on require the attacking team to complete a series of objectives while the defending team prevents them from doing so.  At the end of a round of Assault, the teams switch roles and the now attackers must either complete more of the assualt than the former attackers or complete the map in less than the time it took the former attackers to complete.  The singleplayer portion of the game involves playing through a certain amount of a particular gametype until the next Tournament rung is unlocked.  Each time you start a new rung, there is an optional tutorial level explaining how to play that particular gamemode.  Singleplayer is essentially matches against AI opponents who can be set to various difficulty levels.  The bot AI is one of the great things about UT99 because bots behave in a challenging, almost adaptive manner. \n\nEach game mode features maps designed solely for that gamemode with the exception of a few overlapping arenas.  Assault maps are the most linear whereas Deathmatch maps are more open. Some arenas are symmetric while others asymetric and complicated.  A few arenas even feature a special condition, such as \"Morpheus\" which takes place atop a stratospheric skyscraper and features low gravity for huge jumps.  Filling these outlandish arenas is a plethora of futuristic and conventional weaponry.  Take the plasma rifle for example: primary fire is a straight beam, secondary fire is a slower moving orb, but if you shoot the secondary projectile with the primary fire, it detonates causing a small explosion.  Most weapons feature an alternate fire mode and can only be reloaded by picking up ammo scattered around the arena.  Steady aim is important as most weapons chew through ammo fairly quick.  Health vials and various armor pieces can be picked up to increase your longevity although respawning is instantaneous, giving gameplay a brisk and hectic pace.  There are also items scattered around arenas to pick up like the anti-grav boots for huge jumps and scuba gear for underwater breathing.  Finally, modifiers can be found in somewhat hard to reach places that can boost your damage with weapons, health, or even make you invisble.  Knowing arena layouts, the limitations of each weapon, and where modifiers spawn is essential to victory.\n\nUnfortunately due to the age of the game, you should expect to only play UT99 in singleplayer as there are not many games to be found online.  Although sold as UT99: Game of the Year Edition, this version on Steam does not in fact include the game of the year content.  Ambitious players can attempt to track the extra content down however I have read that the missing content does not amount to much anyway compared to the base game. \n\n[b] Design [/b]\n\nEvery match in UT99 begins in free roam mode.  This allows you to fly around the map and learn where all the weapon/item spawns are, where the enemy base is, and where conflicts are likely to occur.  Free roam is also nice in that you can see just how detailed certain arenas can be.  Built on the same engine as Unreal (Epic Game's 1998 title), UT99 is definitely an old looking game in terms of chracter and environmental models.  However, every arena feels unique in its tone and atmosphere.  From the lighting to the architectural theme of each map, the level design feels thoughtful as well as considerate of the type of game UT99 is.  Adding to the frantic nature of the game is a nice electronic soundtrack featuring lots of drum and bass.  Who can forget the music of \"Facing Worlds\"?  Characters are voiced appropriately over-the-top and the weapons sound sharp and distinct.  The game features a thorough list of options so players can tailor and mod the game as they see fit.   \n\n[b] Final Thoughts [/b]\n\nLong before I was a PC gamer, I played the Infogrames Playstation 2 port of UT99.  It featured updated textures and additional maps not found here on the Steam version, but aiming was clunky with an analog stick.  I purchased the steam version largely out of nostalgia and a desire to play the game as it was meant to be played.  In these respects, UT99 did not disappoint me even though I was retreading ground.  Unfortunately due to the age of the game, you should expect to only play UT99 in singleplayer or with friends as there are not many games to be found online.  From the soundtrack to fast-paced tone of the game, UT99 and its 2004 successor are [i] the [/i] arena shooters in my mind.", "timestamp_created": 1450037208, "timestamp_updated": 1450058109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501482", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19678196": {"recommendationid": "19678196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073893350", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499273557}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 11/10.", "timestamp_created": 1450024795, "timestamp_updated": 1450024795, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19668886": {"recommendationid": "19668886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161341050", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507098919}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game and great gameplay\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1449990031, "timestamp_updated": 1449990031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19650380": {"recommendationid": "19650380", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058385193", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504372865}, "language": "english", "review": "The first game in the Tournament games and second Unreal game and the best one and may always be the best one.

Chock full of content, the game will likely keep you entertained for as long as it has me over the past decade. Steam may say I only have 70+ hours, but in actuality I have at least 500, and I've never played a single game online before. This game has flawless gameplay and the maps fulfill in both quantity and quality. The AI will kick your ass [i]fairly[/i] and the amount of game modes and mutators will keep you forever entertained. The graphics hold up miraculously with some impressive lighting and similar to its single-player focused predecessor, both the sound design and colourful art scheme remain impressive. A must-play for the ages.\n\n[b]The Great:[/b]\n++Flawless gameplay\n++Many, many maps that are all very impressive in every sense of the word\n++Balanced weaponry retaining the original Unreal's highly impressive arsenal\n++Forever replayable with so many game modes and gameplay tweaks to keep you ready for decades\n++Brilliant AI that is good for both simple target practise, virtual suicide or anything in-between\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n+Runs decently well on modern hardware\n+Fantastic graphics for 1999 that still hold up well enough today that bring impressive detail while also maintaining the perfect visual clarity needed for competitive gameplay\n+The perfect balance between highly competitive arena gameplay and power-fantasy\n+Decent character customization\n+Many options from gameplay mutators, to character customization, to being able to name all your enemies the names of your bullies from highschool so you can sadistically gib them in a virtual revenge fantasy (just me?)\n+Varied maps with unique hazards and gameplay features\n+The dodge system is the Unreal series' unique movement feature adding a whole new element to gameplay\n+Game will run on just about anything\n+Lots of console cheats that are accessible always\n\n[b]The Okay/Not Too Big of a Deal:[/b]\n+-Takes some tweaking to get perfect mouse input and proper graphical fidelity, as with all UE1 games. The game [i]is[/i] old though.\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n-Team AI are infuriatingly bad\n-Bots cheat (seeing through walls etc.)\n-You can't dodge when getting hit, so if a Godlike bot is hitting you with a stream of minigun or Link Gun blasts there's no possible way of getting away from it and it's not like you can fight back when it's so damaging.\n-Bullets bounce you around which is infuriating\n\n[b]The Horrible:[/b]\n--N/A\n\nSound: 10/10\nGraphics: 9.5/10\nGameplay: 10/10\nContent/Replayability: 10/10\nOverall: 10/10\n\nAwards:\nGame of the Year - 1999\nBest Multiplayer FPS of All Time\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nNot only one of the best arena multiplayer FPS ever, but also one of the best multiplayer FPS ever.

I have to say this game has aged quite well and is the best example in how to program a multi player FPS:\n\n- Awesome upbeat music, the best I have ever heard in a FPS and the voices of the combatans are superb, with insults and sreams.\n- Excellent bots AI. In high levels they move very fast and are accurate.\n- Masterfully designed maps, the very best I remember for a first person shooter. There are plenty maps to carry out very diverse combat situations. There are open fields or corridors, all filled with weapons, obstacles and original traps. You'll be fighting in water, with zero gravity.\n-Balanced and original weapons, all weapons are useful if you know when and where to use them and all weapons have a seconday fire which give you more options to engage combat.\n-Varied modes of play. The game features very interesting modes of play aside from the classic free-for all and team deathmatch, it offers you Domination and Assault. In Domination you have to secure the areas more time than your opponents and in Assault you have to complete a mission in a scenario and your opponents will try to frustrate your plans, in maps like trains, fortresses battleships, etc.\n-The controls are responsive and work perfect.\n\n\nThis game is so good that future iterations couldn't keep up the quality of this game...the game is perfect and there was no need to create a new version...

It may have aged, but only in graphics, because the gameplay is still fast and exciting. And with its many game modes and high quality maps, it\u2019s a game that you\u2019ll never get bored of.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nFirst-person shooters weren\u2019t always the on-rails, self-healing, cover-to-cover interactive movies they are today. This genre was a scene of highly competitive players who were constantly searching for the next game to test their limits. And in 1999 they got two of them, one being Unreal Tournament.\n\nThe game featured a bundle of innovative weapons with two fire modes; memorable map design that is copied even today; game modes that finally showed something innovative beyond the same old death matches; and finally, bots which may feel a little dumb and predictable today, but back then they were topped only by Half-Life 1.\n\nUT may have been designed as a multiplayer game, but it is also enjoyable in single player. It has an actual campaign mode, where the \u201cplot\u201d may be simple as a doornail (you play in a futuristic gladiator tournament) and most participants only have a single-paragraph story, but it is still enough to build the foundation of a world you can immerse yourself in and make you care about your team. Because despite the popularity of free-for-all death matches, this game is all about team play.\n\nWith the ever-increasing issues with the game engine (which was one of the best of its time) and the even more successful sequel, UT2004, UT \u201999 faded into obscurity, but if you ever want some really old-school FPS action, you can always rely on it.", "timestamp_created": 1430398256, "timestamp_updated": 1430398256, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686900", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15618027": {"recommendationid": "15618027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072240467", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447838629}, "language": "english", "review": "The first time I played this game I was about thirteen.

Out of all the Unreal Tournament games, this is probably my favorite game, and it isn't just nostalgia talking there either.\n\nUnreal Tournament is pretty fast-paced. The guns are also different; you have your standard bullet-firing Enforcer and Sniper Rifle, and you have more exotic types like the plasma-firing Pulse Gun and the bio-sludge firing... Bio Gun.\n\nThe modding community behind this game is immense, and is still alive even today. Installing mods is as easy as grabbing the right UMOD, and installing it, or in the absence of a UMOD, you just drag-and-drop files to the right directory.\n\nThis game offers a story-line too, but as with other games in the series, it's mainly you vs bots on known multiplayer game types (CTF, Deathmatch, etc). Bots have various levels of difficulty, and make great practice.\n\nMutators are also a fun way to spice-up matches. Tired of the old weapons, and want a match with more insta-kill shenanigans? Throw on Instagib and get a modified Shock Rifle that delivers red beams of insta-death :p New mutators can also be delivered through mods.\n\nA really popular recommended mod to get is ChaosUT, and I believe it even came with original Unreal Tournament GOTY discs back in the day (but is strangely absent from the Steam version).\n\nThe graphics may look a bit dated, but guess what? You can also fix that easily through mods :) Original GOTY discs also used to ship with ST3C textures to enhance the game's textures. These are nice and all, but the site UT Textures also offers even higher-quality textures for low-end (still better than the original ST3C textures), high-end, and extreme-end computers. Pair that with a newer renderer (like Marijn Kenti's D3D10 renderer, or the D3D9 or updated OpenGL renderer on Chris Dohnal's site), and you'll have yourself a very nice-looking classic! ENBSeries has nothing on those modifications.\n\nAudio can also be updated. The easiest way to do this is to grab the updated multimedia package from Oldunreal's site. This allows for updated audio backends, like OpenAL and FMOD.\n\nThis game is a real treat, and it's really hard to find a reason on why not to buy it.

Hell, maybe all FPS, it's so damn good. Facing Worlds is a reknown map to most gamers, and there's a reason for it.\nLet's get down to the basics of gameplay, what does it NEED to be a good game?\nScroll to the bottom for final verdict!\n\nGraphics - This game is old. 1999 old. That's really fucking old. And yet... I still find some of these textures pleasing to the eye. The color scheme works well, and the environmental effects on some maps are pretty decent, for when this game was released, these graphics were revolutionary, just like Half-Life's. Some of the skins for characters even look pretty cool. The only issue I have with the graphics is that if you're trapped in a small box, like an elevator, it gets REALLY confusing. \n\nCombat - HAHAHAHAHA, Wow, if there's one thing you CAN'T insult about Unreal Tournament without being a complete fucking MORON, it's the COMBAT. I.... I've never played a game that can replicate how intense Unreal's combat is, aside from Counter-Strike. And it's a slightly different style, so even i'm not sure if CS can apply to compete with Unreal. \nLike I said, it is INTENSE. Even with easy bots, EVERYTHING moves at hyperspeed. Not just that, but things actually take a few seconds to kill. You have to take your shots wisely, and quickly. Most any weapon in the game will give your opponent the chance to turn around and fire back. Rocket Launcher, Sniper, and if you can manage it, Impact Hammers are the only exception. Maybe the flak cannon, but you have to get lucky with the spread. It isn't Call of Duty where you can knife a camper, or kill him with 3 bullets from an Assault Rifle.\n...Speaking of camping, good luck with that. Standing still is just about the worst thing you can do in the game, not to mention there's barely any spots to do it. (Pillboxes on some of the maps excluded)\n\nWeapons - Unique as all hell! Lemme give you a run down of what weapons there are:\n-Impact Hammer: Your only melee. It sucks. Hold down your primary fire to charge it up and then slam it into someone to turn them into a meaty pile of flesh. Alternate Fire if they're at low health and you have nothing else.\n-Enforcer: Your pistol. Low in damage, and it also sucks. Primary fire does accurate shots, low fire-rate, alternate fire does highly inaccurate, high fire-rate shots. \n-GES biogun (or whatever it's called): A \"Sortof\" pistol, more like an SMG. It fires hazardous, glowing waste at your enemies, which procedes to melt them into a fine goo. Goo sticks to walls, and bursts after an amount of time, hurting any enemies nearby. Primary fire sprays it like a monkey throwing shit while on cocaine. Alternate fire charges a shot to make a giant, insta-kill ball of goo. \"Insta-kill is over-powered, don't you think?\" Nope. It is IMPOSSIBLE to hit somebody with the giant goo balls, the projectile is too slow, and the range is too short. You'd have to be hitting someone standing still, or get a lucky/skillfully aimed shot.\n-ASMD Shock Rifle: OH BOY A RAILGUN. Primary fire shoots a decently-powered bolt of blue energy, at instantanious speed. It is 100% accurate, no spread. Alternate fire shoots a ball of the same type of blue energy, at a slow speed. If you shoot the ball with another ball, or the primary fire bolt, it explodes into an electric explosion thingy that is sure to pastilize anyone nearby. In Unreal Tournament 3, the ball implodes, sucking any unlucky persons into a temporary black hole. THE MORE YOU KNOW!\n-Plasma Rifle: You can see the naming of this gun was just as unique as the previous ones /s. Primary fire shoots slow-moving tiny balls of green plasma ( that don't implode/explode D: ) which deal some.... pretty fucking good damage. Good for usage in tiny spaces like tunnels. Bad in outer areas. Like outside. Don't use it outside. Alternate fire shoots- ZOMG IT'S A FUKIN' LAZOR BEAM!!!1! The laser beam has shitty damage, but if you're accurate, you'll slice'n'dice your target in a second or two.\n-The Ripper: One of the nastiest ideas of a weapon i've heard of, The Ripper shoots giant mother-fucking razor blades at your target. Some explode. We're getting emo on these bitches. Primary fire shoots a highly volatile razor disc that ricochets like a bullet in a safe, and it doesn't stop until a while. WARNING: THERE IS A 75% CHANCE THESE BLADES WILL KILL YOU INSTEAD OF YOUR TARGET. DO NOT USE IN TIGHT QUARTERS. Alternate fire shoots an EXPLODING FUCKING RAZOR BLADE. WHO THOUGHT THIS ONE UP?!\n-Minigun: ....You know damn well what this gun does. Primary fire for semi-accurate, decent-speed minigun fire. Alternate for BBBBBBUUUUUULLLEEEEEETTTTT SSSSSSPPPPPAAAAAAAAMMMMM and extreme inaccuracy.\n-Flak Cannon: By far, my favorite gun. Essentially, it's a shotgun attached to a \"Thumper\" (grenade launcher). Primary fire shoots super-heated flak, which CAN bounce off of walls and kill you. Alternate fire shoots a grenade that explodes into flak.\n-Rocket Launcher: Primary fire for very slow rockets. Hold it down to prep up to 6 rockets, good for choke points. Alternate fire shoots shitty pipe-bombs that hardly work. Hold down to prep up to 6 of them to launch.\n-Sniper Rifle: Primary shoots. Alternate scopes.\n-Redeemer: Primary fire destroys the universe. Alternate let's you find where you want to begin the destruction of the universe.\n\nThey all feel good and fun, a generally enjoyable experience. The biggest complaint I have is with bots and Rocket Launchers, they aim a bit too good with those things in tight quarters.\n\n\nMaps: Some of the best map designs i've ever seen, I mean this game is doing better then CoD by a mile. There's hidden power-up rooms, treacherous hazards, risk-and-reward areas, seperate routes spread everywhere, and unique usage of the environment. Mother Nature(Property of Liandri Corp.) wants dat ass, boi.\n\nStory (for campaign): Ehhhh. This game didn't really have much. It gives you a starter intro, and some pretty good filler, as you can read up on your enemy's backstory as you prepare for battle. It even tells you their fighting styles. But the \"story\" is just some slapped on entertainment, the polish to the fancy sports car. \n\nBosses/end battles: There is one, and ONLY one.\nXan Kriegor.\nThe whole game is you fighting your way to the top of the ranks of the Unreal Tournament to hopefully beat him and become the true champion. Jesus fucking christ, even on the easiest difficulty, this guy can be difficult. I'm still trying to beat him on one of the harder difficulties (I'm dreading the God-Like difficulty when I reach it). Essentially, Xan is the Shao Kahn (Mortal Kombat's final boss) of Unreal Tournament.\n\nBonus Points: Terrific AI, and a SHITTON of difficulty settings. The options menu is also well-made, and the music is mindblowing.\n\nFinal verdict: TENOUTTATEN. I'm serious, full 10/10. I can't give it less. I have yet to find a bug (aside from a bot getting stuck in a window a few times. Heh.) or issue with the game I do not like. It is one of the most well-programmed games ever made, the music is action-packed or sometimes relaxing, the maps, omfg the maps... This game is just awesome extract.\nHOWEVER,\nDespite the 10/10 rating, I do NOT suggest this game for all gamers. It is EXTREMELY fast-paced, you need fast reactions and fast hands (huehue) to get through it as a pro. \n\nIs the price right? Yes and no. Yes, it's worth it for the game, I URGE you to buy it. But no, as the game is pretty old by now, it should be lowered to atleast $7.50, though I believe $5.00 would be more appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDO NOT LISTEN TO THE FUCKWITS GIVING IT BAD RATINGS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T INSTALL IT. The game was made in 1999, and it's Window's fault if anything at all that they aren't compatible. Dual drivers have issues with the game's framerate, and more issues.

This game is also a [b]total classic[/b]. It did come out in Oct 2000 so for it's age I personally think that this is one of those games that can stand the test of time simply for what the game offers. You may say, \"Well, it's graphics aren't too good\". There is a solution to that, a mod which can run the entire game in DirectX 10, which uses all of the fancy features that DX10 offers. So that gives gives it more longevity for those struggling to find a reason to get this game. For the actual content of the game there isn't much to say. It's an arena deathmatch game. It has a variety of maps; ranging from a tiny little elevator shaft to huge, low-gravity maps. There is a great selection of weapony from your ever handy impact hammer and supreme flak cannon which can obliterate enemies in close range (and yes this game is quite gory, but with the option of turning down or off gore) or your longer range rocket launcher, capable of both lock ons and 3 rockets at the same time, snipers, and ect. When it all comes down to it, [b]THIS GAME IS A MUST BUY!!![/b] That being said, I'd also highly recommend getting the Unreal Complete Pack as all of the Unreal games are great picks, ranging from the classics to modernized versions of those games.

While UT2004 (and 2003 and 3) are all great, the three are all their own entries, and this is probably the best. Nearly 15 years later, Unreal Tournament still remains an outstanding first-person shooter with some of the best FPS design (along with Q3A). \n\nNothing about it feels dated, and arguably first-person shooter game design as a whole has regressed from this and Q3A's high-level mental gaming and high skill ceiling shooters. Incredible pacing, maps designed to facilitate movement and area control, weapons with utility and balance, skillful gunplay all lead to the high-level mental games that really make the challenge and high skill ceiling the time.\n\nEpic really struck gold with this in every way, and I'd highly suggest that everyone give this game a weekend to start that spark within them. It's not particularly casual, but the bots are still plenty fun (especially for non-pros) and if that and the excellent design aren't enough to sway you, there're plenty of mods and custom maps for it as well (though I think UT2004 really is the best of the series for mods).", "timestamp_created": 1404893888, "timestamp_updated": 1404893888, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11114247": {"recommendationid": "11114247", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034574598", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450887217}, "language": "english", "review": "Do I even have to write a review for this?

Grab the Direct3D9 Renderer from [url=http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/][b]here[/b][/url].\n2. Put D3D9Drv.dll and D3D9Drv.int in your \"Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Unreal Tournament\\System\" folder\n3. Use your graphics card control panel to disable v-sync\n4. Use your graphics card control panel to limit your fps to your monitors refresh rate (i.e. 60Hz monitor = 60fps cap) this prevents the game from running in superfast mode. If you aren't sure of your monitors refresh rate, just cap it at 60. A useful program for doing this with Nvidia cards is [url=http://www.guru3d.com/files_details/nvidia_inspector_download.html][b]Nvidia Inspector[/b][/url].\n5.

I would advise all people who have never experianced UT or UT99 before to read that rather than the information just below this line. Thank you.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nOld review (Original Review) :\n\nI started to play this game back in 1999. I've been on and off for roughly 6-7 years and to this day i still play it everynow and then in my spare time or when i'm trying to kill time. \n\nTo me, this is the best FPS to ever exist in history and i think a large amount of old school players will say the same. I don't think an FPS game has came even close to knocking this off its throne, hands down this game deserves to be the king of FPS games for a VERY long time.\n\nNow you're probably asking.. \"Why do you rate it so highly?\" Well, apart from trusting what im saying - its a game you simply need to purchase and test for yourself to understand why. This may be old and outdated compared to everything you see today but despite that, it still has ONE of the BEST if not THE BEST gameplay and feel that you would expect every FPS to have. \n\nIf you're new to UT99 this game also features a \"Campaign\" if you would like to call it that where you can test your skills against bots on any difficulty you set as well as any gametype you desire. You can play all the gametypes offline and online. You have Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the flag (My personal favourite), Domination, Last man standing and finally Assault. \n \nPositives / + to this game (The good) : \n\u2713 Best FPS to exist.\n\u2713 Alot of gametypes.\n\u2713 A nice amount of players.\n\u2713 Unique maps.\n\u2713 Gore & taunts (Alot of BM = Instawin)\n\u2713 Doesn't need a powerful computer to play it.\n\nNegatives / - to this game (The bad) :\nx Cruel to new players, 90% of the servers are filled with experianced UT players.\nx Very fast paced.\nx A tiny amount of errors.\nx Nearly every server requires a plugin/mod that has to be downloaded in order for you to play on that server. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n28/10/2015 : \n\nThere is no other way to word it apart from the game being pretty much dead, if you're looking to play Unreal Tournament online and against other opponents then you are going to be restricted. If you do manage to find players they will be highly experianced players, old school veterans. \n\nThe only people who i personally suggest to invest in UT99 are ones who are well aware of its current state OR people who have previously played this before on disc and are looking to restore the feeling and passion they once had.\n\nIf you're new to the Unreal Tournament series then i would suggest playing the latest one released, it hurts me to say this because UT99 will always be the game i fell in love with as a child, the best Unreal Tournament as well as the best FPS in the world. \n\nUT4 Pre-Alpha is available on https://www.unrealtournament.com/ do not worry, this game is free. Yes you heard me, you do not have to pay anything. Anyone and everyone can download and start playing.\n\nThis review will not be updated or changed from this point on.", "timestamp_created": 1397965632, "timestamp_updated": 1446050939, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.691854", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9864445": {"recommendationid": "9864445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070063722", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502501725}, "language": "english", "review": "If your a person like me who likes classic shooters the start of it all I recommend this game for these reasons. My first is it has a great AI system for its time and can handle better than some of the AI systems today, and each difficulty actually corresponds with the how hard AI's get. My second reason would be the crazy fun of the arena shooter aspect I know the graphics are extremely dated but the actual gameplay is fun crazy and i get caught up in hours worth of gameplay because its just that fun.\nMy third and final reason is that its so vintage and that it change the gaming market because of the fun and idea of first person shooter's, the idea of being in the battlefield hands on combat, I mean look at some the great titles today. The Battlefield series known for its stunning graphics and intense tactical gameplay.

With an arsenal of weaponry at your command and over a 100 maps, both by the dev, and the community, this is a game that I think will never get old, and the best part is after all these years, UT multiplayer is still going strong, just make sure you join a game with actual players and NOT bots. Trust me, you'll know if you are playing with bots or not. Single player is simple, you play in a tournament against bots, but personally, I skipped the campaign and went straight for the real deal multiplayer since I find fighting against bots...well boring. The soundtrack is foot-tappin awesomeness with fast techno tunes that go perfect with the sounds of rocket launchers and screams in the distance followed by the sound of body parts hitting the floor.\n\nThere is a ton of gore in this game so be prepared. I think UT can stand up to any game today and still win, yes, even Battlefield 4. I like UT a lot more than Quake III for many reasons. It seems what Quake III was flawed at, UT 99 was improved in. Now don't get me wrong, I like UT 2004, but there is something about UT 99 that I like a lot more than 2004. I'm not sure but 99 is just wayyy more fun and awesome for me that 2004 ever was. What else is there to say, it's fast, it's action-packed, it's gruesome, it's frantic, it's insane, it's intense, it's UT 99! And no need to worry about specs, any modern CPU can run this game perfectly smooth with no lag at all, believe me, I have a 1.0 GHZ processor laptop with AMD c-50 dual core. This is essential if you call yourself a PC gamer, and for the price of a book, you'd be silly NOT to buy this game! Don't let the difficulty of this game turn you off at first, UT is a game that is fun to play, but hard to master, it just takes time and patience to finally start getting into the swing of things and starting to get kills. So play UT 99 today! I'm sure you'll enjoy seeing your avatar die in an explosion of blood and limbs...:3", "timestamp_created": 1389518713, "timestamp_updated": 1389518762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562905", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8665532": {"recommendationid": "8665532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038539063", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502356415}, "language": "russian", "review": "I F**IN LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YAAAAAAAAAAAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1389463171, "timestamp_updated": 1389463171, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560123", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8640278": {"recommendationid": "8640278", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986362857", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 1357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507321025}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so Unreal, it's not.

While id's Quake 3: Arena went with stripped-down gameplay polished to a high sheen, Epic crammed in as many features and game modes as they could.\n\nBesides the standard Deathmatch and CTF modes, UT introduced new modes like Assault that focused heavily on team-based action. Mutators that changed different aspects of the gameplay could be applied to any match and added lots of variety. Each weapon had a primary and secondary mode, which greatly increased the strategies available with each one. And while UT had the standard corridor-based Deathmatch maps, it also had huge open maps that were a sniper's dream, and many of them were larger than had ever been seen in a FPS at he time.\n\nThe classic gameplay still holds up, though most players gravitate to the game's successor, UT2K4, which took everything good about UT and cranked it up to 11 while adding many more unique features.

The gameplay is just as good as it always has been and hasn't added any unnecessary complexity with the GotY tag.  Its simplicity is what makes it so awesome, and this version is a prime example of that.  I could add that Mod support is built into the engine, the settings are excellent for such an old title, the gameplay is crisp, clean, and fast, the sound quality is superb...I could go on and on, but there shouldn't be any reason to.

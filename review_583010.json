However, it can be used for ANY program on your computer, and you can create multiple profiles that you can switch to as you switch programs.\n\nYou can try a free trial for 21 days (so at least try it out), but it took me all of an hour to buy this amazing gem.  Knowing what I know now, I'd pay $30 and be happy, as this keeps having updates added to it and expanded.  The functionality is solid, I've had no bugs, even with using some of the \"Advanced\" features.\n\nNow, to what it does:\n\nVoiceAttack uses a speech recognition engine (usually Windows by default, but this is changeable if you want to do that) to listen to voice commands and perform keyboard, joystick, or controller commands/keybinds/button presses/what have you.  Yes, it even works with joystick motions.  You can set it to also play sounds as part of the command, so if you have community made voice packs for a game, or use a text to speed engine, you can have it talk to you.  Or just play a beep or something.  Whatever you want.  It works amazingly for VR, and it is very easy to get immersed using voice commands.\n\nI can say (in my case for Elite Dangerous), \"Eden, prepare for docking.\" and VoiceAttack plays a sound from Eden (a voice pack dealio I got), reduces my thruster speed, balances my power out to normal, and retracts my docking gear all while I can be doing other things.\n\nAll commands in VoiceAttack can be run in parallel or one after the other.  I can have VoiceAttack do multiple commands together, and there are even settings to make sure your keybinds/commands don't conflict with each other.  There is soooo much flexibility, it's amazing.  It's also incredibly stable.  I have not had one single issue, even when I enabled some of the \"Unsupported Plugin\" features that had warning boxes and flashing lights (jk not really lol).\n\nNow, it can be a little daunting at first, as you have to basically \"program\" your commands in a very simple synatx, but I found it easy to pick up after an hour.  The documentation is absolutely incredible.  I work in the computer science field, and there are people who's entire jobs is writing documentation who write worse documentation than this software has.  Maybe I just work with some bad people, I don't know, but what I do know is it was written in a way that was easy to pick up for non-programmers and programmers alike.   That aside, the community and developer has some amazing support, and if you have trouble you can just ask.\n\nYou can even set up variables, and do loops.  I haven't got it working yet, but I plan on adding a command to constantly request docking permission from stations in Elite Dangerous every so many seconds in the event the docks are all full.  The software is capable of doing just that.\n\nSo, would I recommend this?  Yes.  Yes.

Sorry to see a negative review for VoiceAttack, as I would have loved to have at least been afforded a chance to solve your problem :(\n\nWhat I am understanding is that you are using a German Windows with a built-in English speech engine resident and that the speech engine is not working right for you.  Something you're going to have to understand is that, although you are speaking English, it could be that it's not clear to the speech engine that you are using.  There are alternate speech engines to try:  http://www.voiceattack.com/alternate\nI would try different variants of English, such as UK, US, Australian, etc.  It could be that one of those may work better for you than the others.\n\nAlso, there are lots and lots and LOTS of German users of VoiceAttack (although it is not advertised as anything other than English), all using the German version of Windows.  However, what you are trying to do may be confusing Windows and ultimately VA a bit.  Going to shoot from the hip here... if the locale is somehow being presented to VA as English, VA is going to follow suit.  You'll want to go into options and select the German keyboard layout to try to force VA to use a German keyboard.  Not entirely sure if your version of Windows is doing that, but it's something to consider.\n\nIf your speech engine is picking up words you are NOT saying, you have some type of line noise or, 'bleed' from another device, or, your environment is too loud and/or your mic volume is turned up too high (hot).  There are ways to fix that, and, again, that would have been something that a support inquiry could have ironed out quickly ;)\n\nI hope something in here works for you!"}, "35744520": {"recommendationid": "35744520", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970329706", "num_games_owned": 573, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 2099, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508327719}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you play games with so many buttons you can't possibly remember them all ? such as Flight sims, Star Citizen or Elite Danngerous ?

I really finnd this adds to the immersion of the games I use it with (i'm still working on my VR profiles atm :D )\n\nThere are a lot of ready made profiles in which people have added sounds to play when the command applys - Either a voice such as Glados from Portal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdpsAucSIgw&t) or an enntirely new creation such as HICS for Star Citizen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvs0ONdmP1c&list=PLz43ja9JnuqsrCAEgpCefFEDhHag8HeMu&index=2)\n\nI also use it for a Jukebox in my games as there is a simple feature which will play your music and also make sure that there are no repeats if your list is randomised. \n\nSetting up a new profile is actually quite simple aswell so you won't need to be a complete code wizard to use this - which in my case is excellent as I know nothing of coding/programming etc etc. It isd literally a case of the following :-\n\n1: create new profile\n2: edit new profile\n3: add new command\n4: type in the word you want to say and then click the \"key press button\" and put in the keyboard command you wish to activate when you say the word/phrase\n5: repeat step 2 to 4 for the rest of the commands\n6: launch game\n7: talk to game \n\nOnce you see the editing page you will see exactly how easy it is, The developer of this should be striking deals with Frontier and Cloud Imperium as they compliment each other so well, I can't comment exactly on flight sims ETC as I don't own any but I have no reason at all to think that the process would be any more difficult at all. I am really selling this software short for what it can do so I suggest you take this review as if I had just opened it for an hour and played around a bit - this can do so much more and it is still all simple.\n\nI honestly would have paid twice as much for this software but luckily for everyone else there is a demo available (iirc) for you to have a play around with before deciding to pay out your \u00a39 or local equivalent.", "timestamp_created": 1508066039, "timestamp_updated": 1508066039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591837", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35718099": {"recommendationid": "35718099", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143223512", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 44718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2800, "last_played": 1516531189}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Um software de reconhecimento de voz para execu\u00e7\u00e3o de uma varidade de fun\u00e7\u00f5es e macros (comandos em sequ\u00eancia que podem ser cliques, toques no teclado e a\u00e7\u00f5es diversas relacionadas a outros programas).

Find the keystroke, shortcut or button you wish to activate by voice, create the command and type what you want to say to activate it.

Then VoiceAttack would need to be able to listen to the voice of the computer to check if you repeated the words correctly. \nThat would be so cool!\n\nEdit: Regular expressions in the voice recognition would be also very helpful.", "timestamp_created": 1501513627, "timestamp_updated": 1501521985, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33924763": {"recommendationid": "33924763", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969831909", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1515582885}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing around with Voice Attack on Elite Dangerous.  Absolutely love it, makes playing Elite Dangerous so much more fun, enjoyable, and easier to control.  I highly recommend it.  It is very versatile and easy to create new commands and even macros so it can do several commands, or you can use someone else's profile and use their commands instead, and there is an easy to to print off a cheat sheet of what commands were created by you or the profile you downloaded.\n\nFor me I felt like I was even more into the future because I was able to talk to my ship and have it do several different things.\nI even have Macros where I say things like \"Code Red\" and what happens is my Weapons come on online, my power is redirected to my Weapons to full and the rest of the power into shielding.  Or when I am docked, I'll say \"Refuel and Repair\" and everything will automatically refuel and repair my ship for me.  I can say things like \"target highest threat\" and it will target the highest threat ship (usually the one attacking me). I can say \"Request Docking\" and the computer will request docking for me.\n\nI also suggest getting the HCS Voice Packs as well, I have found that got me more immersed into Elite Dangerous so much more.  HCS Voice Packs are add-ons created by a different developer, and it gives a voice to Voice Attack and it will respond to the things you say.  Many of the voice packs are voiced by celebrities like Brent Spiner, William Shatner, and many others.\n\nSo if you want something that can completely immerse you into Elite Dangerous or any other game, since you can use Voice Attack for any other games, I highly recommend you get this.", "timestamp_created": 1501497148, "timestamp_updated": 1501497148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33893248": {"recommendationid": "33893248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026203412", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 17615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509157287}, "language": "english", "review": "This makes playing Elite Dangerous even more awesome, shucks I like it so much I use it outside of Elite for automation.

VoiceAttack nailed it.\n\nI did a lot of research before spending my bucks, and I just found that Gary, the developer (hi Gary, I know you are reading this) is very active and kind with the comunity, this plus the great documentation made me spend the 11,99\u20ac without even trying the demo, I didn't care if it worked or not, just as a donation for Gary who deserves for over 7 years of work and still mantaining the good mood. @Gary great dedication dude, you deserve more appreciation.\n\nThe app as far as I used it is perfect. \nHowever, as a constructive feedback for Gary: the documentation needs bookmarks / table of contents urgently. I love the extensive documentation you made but its a pain in the *** to work with until you memorize the page numbers.\n\nAlso I would add the hability to send commands based on process name, for example with Spotify the window name is constantly changing per-song and I am unable to change the application volume from the \"Set Audio Level\" UI. I don't doubt that there will be a way to do it programmaticallly and I might end up doing it this way, but if it could be built in the app UI that would be awesome. \n\n10/10 \ud83d\udc97", "timestamp_created": 1500679396, "timestamp_updated": 1500679396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582138", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33603197": {"recommendationid": "33603197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062007606", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2769, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1516459478}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Yeni bir oculus rift kullan\u0131c\u0131s\u0131 olarak siddetle tavsiye edebilece\u011fim bir uygulama.

Good news if you speak English with a Kiwi, Aussie, South African, Indian or other accent.\nI'm from New Zealand, my accent in English isn't always recognized well by software that uses either \"American\" or \"British\" recognisers, but VoiceAttack uses the built-in windows speech recognition to great effect. Meaning if you're like me and you've already trained windows speech recognition to follow your accent, it'll work perfectly straight out of the box.  \n\n#2. It allows a bit more fine control over the programming of your voice commands.  \nIf you want to use it for applications besides just your games, you'll find this handy.  Steeper learning curve than Voicebot, but worth it.\n\n#3. Better control over MS Windows\nTucked away in the command options are fucntions for controlling Windows.  Just makes it easier than VoiceBot.\n \nEither software you choose, you're getting a good deal. \nGoogle \"Dragon Naturally Speaking\" and see what that'll set you back.

Theres many to download on the net but since I like to do this myself to get the hang of the way things works I did this on my own and I need to say that this really improved my gaming experience right away. \n\n- I lock my missiles and fire them, start counter meashures against enemy attacks, focus different targets, or lock the gimbals for my weapon systems without the need of taking my hands off the controls which is really awesome. \n- Then I got a bit crazy with it and tried if it would work to automatize the entire interaction with the cry astro service stations and it really works spot on. I\u00b4ve just set up a prefix and programmed suffixes with mouse coordinates, delays n clicks. Really awesome.\n- This really makes me curious for the Star Citizen alpha 3.0, so i can set up voice attack to assing weapons to groups and other functions which will be reactivated with the new MDF\u00b4s in game.\n- Another good thing is that you can output feedback messages via the windows text to speach engine. This is not only just cool, it also gives you feedback about if the macro was triggered if the game itself doesnt do it and even contributes to the immersion.\n- If you want to have it even a bit more fancy, you could download voice packs like for example the \"Alix Voice Pack\" from hcsvoicepacks. Alix is the lady who did the voice over for all the Anvil Aerospace ships in Star Citizen which is pretty cool. I didnt load it until now because SC is still in alpha and im not quite sure if they will update those packs in case future versions of the game will introduce new functions. But if they do I might go for it, though its only adding a nice touch to it but aint nesseccary at all. \n\n- one thing I need to mention is:\nYou dont need to switch your windows system to english in order to make Voice Attack recognize english commands. Simply add them to the text to speach engine. This also works if you talk with an accent or if you want to get sure macros will be triggered to 100 percent, even if you talk very fast. \n\n- Should you have a very good idea for a new funktion VA needs and which could also be cool to use for all the other users then just write them an email. They will answer as soon as they can, but please keep it short and simple to reduce the answer time and dont flood them with requests. \n\n- In the next days I will definitely make a video and publish it on youtube to introduce you guys to Voice Attack. Just find me by searching for \"The Whizkid\"\n\nThe Video: https://youtu.be/RZOpidapLew\n\n\nA big thank you to the guys from Voice Attack!

I use it on almost all of my space-centric games, Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, Homeworld, and STO. \n\nThe program will require a bit of windows setup to get speech recognition working just right for you, but that can take as little as 5-10 mins, depending on your computer and mike. If memory serves, i had everything installed and setup in under 30 mins, including multiple runthroughs of windows speech setup, (because i wanted to ensure i had a good starting point). \n\nThe community for this program is nothing short of FANTASTIC - and I do them all a great disservice by saying that. There are few words to describe just how helpful and encouraging I personally have found within this community. From having what I felt were dumb questions answered (and then re-answerd in a way I could understand as a non-programmer), to the wide variety of plugins and profiles shared, this community rivals that of Skyrim (which has a Voiceattack profile avaible), Homeworld, and Vampire the Masqurade: Bloodlines. \n\nProfile creation was easy to figure out, I think the hardest part starting out was finding the right TTS voice, than I upgraded to a few free and paid voicepacks, most notably from HCS Voice Packs (shameless plug there i know). \n\nUnderstanding the basic commands was realativly easy and hassle free. Moving on to more advanced commands was simply a matter of understanding the correct use of tolkens and in some cases, a post to the community provided a quick and timely answer.  There are several demos available, which can be found on youtube from HCS Voice Packs that will also help make the learning curve a breeze. \n\nOn profiles - you will get out what you put in. There are profiles avaible for many games, especially Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen. and while the basic profiles will help and add a level of depth and ease to gameplay. A new user could use a basic program to help with everything from takeoff in elite dangerous to basic scanning of a planet. Voicepacks are available from multiple sources, both free and paid. and these can and will add more depth. Plugins are avaible that will allow you to play internet radio, operate a program such as spotify or pandora, or even play a custom playlist with either vlc or winamp. A new offering is called Game Music Packs, which while recent, has the possiblity of changing the way I use custom playlists and use custom music during gameplay. (but that last bit may be me staring into a crystal ball - but the possibility IS present). \n\nThat said, the true power of VoiceAttack is found when you modify a profile to suit your tastes, or create your own. you can do anthing from creating a command to play specific soundfiles at your command, to creating a truly custom and unique AI experience with VoiceAttack. Weather you want your ship's Ai to be R2D2, C3PO, Spock, Worf, BB-8 or K-2SO,  Marvin, the Paranoid Android, or your own personal Vulcan Love Slave - all that is required is a little imagination, some study and (mostly easy), coding, and you will have the AI of your dreams. \n\nFor elite dangerous users,you will find a varitey of profiles readilly avaible wich contain abilties ranging from adding a jump counter to Plotting course & Map control, just to scratch the surface. Plugins will add even more flexibility and customizaton options - only your ability and imagination will limit you.  (DISCLAIMER: The author of this post is in no way to be held responsible for times when ability and imagination do NOT see eye to eye. As such, he is forthwith to be held blameless and non-liable for any lost sleep, time away from family, pets, plants, outdoor activiteis, other hobbies, etc.). \n\n\"Immersion\" is a term you will read alongside this program alot. We use it not because it is the correct term to describle the change we experience in gaming without it. We use it because it is the ONLY word that comes even remotely close to describling the joy it brings to the gaming experiences of those who love the program, and especially those who take the time to custom-create a profile for our favorite game(s).\n\nIn closing, I purchased a 2nd copy of VoiceAttack on steam the week of it's inital release. At the time, I had the ability to \"trade-in\" my current copy to get the program on steam. However after about 8 seconds of thought, I simply could find no better way to show the Developer my support and thanks for all the hard work and effort he's put into this program over the years. I feel that I got my money's worth years ago - buying a 2nd copy to say \"thanks again\" was a opportunity I could not pass up!", "timestamp_created": 1493338028, "timestamp_updated": 1493338028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31382627": {"recommendationid": "31382627", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089665594", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493761292}, "language": "english", "review": "This review is for everyone who is NOT from and English speaking country or from France, Germany, Japan, China or Spain.\n\nGiving it a thumbs up in spite of everything. I actually refunded the app at first because I didn't get it to work. And then bought it again once I had solved the issue.\n\nThe problem with VoiceAttack, and several other contemporary voice recognition/command apps, is that it depends on the built-in speech recognition system in Windows 10 (which Cortana uses for example). However, Windows speech recognition is only available for the respective language of the countries above (Mandarin for China). And I don't live in any of those. If you are from outside that region you will get an error message if you try to run the app. It won't start. It will say a SAPI-compatible speech engine is missing on your system.\n\nThere is, however, a workaround. What you do is add US English (provided you want to speak English with your game of choice) as an additional language under the Region & Language settings in Windows 10. You will then get the option to specifically install speech recognition for US English. Once that is installed VoiceAttack will run.\n\nYou don't have to make English (or German or Mandarin...) your default language on your computer for it to work. You just need to make sure the speech recognition system is installed. However, even if you imported this super duper profile that somebody made for your favorite game X, ideally you still will want to train your speech recognition system to recognize your voice and your speech quirks when it comes to accent, intonation etc. You can't train that within VoiceAttack. You need to train the Windows speech engine outside of the game. But that you will not be able to do unless you set your chosen speech engine language to be the default language on your system. This is something you hopefully only have to do once though, at least for a single game. And you can revert back to your old settings afterwards.\n\nOnce your get VoiceAttack to work it does what it is supposed to. As good as any voice command app, if not better. It's a GREAT help in complex games like ArmA or flight sims where it really makes sense. You wouldn't be pressing buttons if you led a real squad or captained an airliner. You would be giving various vocal commands to make others do the stuff you want them to while you focus on your specific tasks. And this is exactly what you can do with VoiceAttack, which both makes the game easier (since you won't be bothered by all these stupid user unfriendly interfaces and key bindings that are usually included with sims) and also more fun.", "timestamp_created": 1493239734, "timestamp_updated": 1493239734, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31367174": {"recommendationid": "31367174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031782423", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493525133}, "language": "english", "review": "I cant get this to work, window 10 pro Asus supreme fx sound card. it doesnt do anything when i speak to it and i dont know if its reciving my voice or not as cortanna seems to work fine.\n\nTo all who view this I was using a windows 10 pro os and a ASUS motherboard with the Sonic studio 3 software.\n\nThe Sonic Studio blocks Voice attack from using the default Mic despite being assigned to it in the Sonic studi and in the settings in voice attack.\n\nThe only souiltion i could find at this time to resolve this was to CRT+Alt+Del and disable the Sonicstudio service and also close it on the actice tools bar on the bottom right of my system.

The functionality is awesome. I downloaded a profile from the Frontier forums and I was off.

The program has some very advanced features using 'if' statements, loops, random variables (which is my favourite allowing you to play a random soundfile from a list) anyone with the slightest bit of knowledge can get some pretty awesome macros going all controlled by your voice, button presses, mouse clicks or even other commands.\n\nI have a thick accent, and after a little tinkering with windows learning my voice, it works nicely!\n\nDone some more digging on the web and found a free voicepack for Elite comes with a set of binds, doesn't seem to be as complete as the one I posted previously, but the custom audio is amazing [url=http://zenuel.com/anubis.html]Click Here[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1489906000, "timestamp_updated": 1490241069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803055", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 74, "total_negative": 4, "total_reviews": 78}}

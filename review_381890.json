I\u2019ve since grown to love this mechanical choice, and Induction remains one of the best examples of how teach a player without actually saying anything. This is all the more impressive because of how difficult Induction\u2019s puzzles are\n\nInduction will frustrate and confuse you. It will cause your brain to hurt. And then, in a moment that can only be described as the most glorious \u201ca-ha\u201d moment you\u2019re likely to have had, you\u2019ll get it and love every time-bending second of it.\n\nYou are given the ability to jump through time, and must use this to solve puzzles by co-operating with your past selves. As the game progresses, you must choreograph your actions across multiple timelines, and explore the counter-intuitive possibilities your increasing powers permit. You will learn to construct seemingly impossible solutions, such as paradoxical time loops, where the future depends on the past and the past depends on the future.\n\nThe mechanics of Induction all focus around it internal logic of time travel. It was initially a little odd to think of induction as a game about time travel; it looks like something more akin to a puzzle platformer, but the two concepts are not mutually exclusive, and Induction is ENTIRELY about time travel. in every level you have a spot you need to get your cube to. After the introductory levels (more on those later), you\u2019ll have to figure out how to create a path to that spot by activating bridges our pathways, often at a very specific time.\n\nYou accomplish this by choreographing time loops. You very quickly gain the ability to jump through time, seeming a former version of yourself performing the very action you performed in the exact timing you performed them in. you\u2019ll need to plan ahead and time yourself to make sure all the right movements are made to reveal you path to the end of the level.\n\nInduction's  logic is watertight. Complex, mind bending and at times incredibly frustrating, but watertight. It becomes very clear very quickly what you can and cannot do in this version of time travel, what will cause solution-ruining paradoxes, and what you can game for success. I think I was most surprised by how important patience was in Induction. At times, you\u2019ll simply need to sit and wait, giving your future self time to move into the correct position, before continuing on into that very future yourself. I can see some people being annoyed by the necessity to stop and do nothing for a while, but once i realized the inherent power of waiting, I loved it and Induction become a much slower, more tactical game for me.\n\nTypically, I would spend one or two attempts feeling out the level, learning what buttons activated what, where I could go, which drops i could get up and which i could not. Then i\u2019d sit. My brain would race with ideas and potential solution, when and where to travel in time, and which routes to open first.\n\nThen I\u2019d execute my plan, inevitably fail and have to go back to the beginning.\n\nInduction\u2019s tough. REALLY tough, and inevitably some people will get frustrated with its difficulty. However, like so many games with high difficulty, the pay off is that much sweeter. When you do solve a puzzle in Induction, its a fantastic feeling of accomplishment and success.\n\nAesthetically, Induction does a number of subtle things that work spectacularly well. The minimalist levels and blocks being moved the player are all defined in crisp lines, with bold solid colors  that make distinguishing levels and platforms very easy; an important factor when every move has to be planned out meticulously. The colors of the levels, background and pieces of Induction actually shift very gradually over the entire color spectrum as you play the game, which I though was a fantastic effect, and is seamlessly executed.\n\nThe music of Induction also deserves a specific mention. Tim Shiel has created a wonderfully ambient soundtrack that responds to your progress in an equally as seamless way as the shifting colors of the levels. It\u2019s always surprisingly happy, and brought a smile to my face every time a new refrain\n\nInduction is easily one of the best puzzle games I\u2019ve ever played. Not only does it look and sound fantastic, but it is wholly and completely challenging, while being trusting enough to let you, the player, figure everything out. It respects your intelligence in a way many games do not, and it\u2019s a refreshing feeling. Granted, at times, this means you have to think really REALLY hard to figure the game out, and this isn\u2019t always a relaxing prospect. If you\u2019re willing to step up and put your mind to these time-bending puzzle, Induction will not disappoint. \n\n[i]Make sure to check out our [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuIrqRTYyhA] IndieDev Interview with developer Bryan Gale[/url] if you\u2019d like to learn more about Induction\u2019s inspiration and his journey as an indie developer.[/i]\n\n[i] Find More Reviews, Interviews and Previews from the world of Indie Games and Indie Game Development at www.IndieHangover.com | On Twitter at [url=https://twitter.com/IndieHangover]@IndieHangover[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1492040333, "timestamp_updated": 1492040333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30930839": {"recommendationid": "30930839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133837537", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492214645}, "language": "english", "review": "As a massive fan of time travel in general, I've long hoped for a game that satisfyingly uses time travel as a game mechanic.

The brainchild of a single developer, I couldn't even begin to wrap my head around how to solve some of these later time-bending conundrums let alone how one person could dream up such an inventive and complex series of logic puzzles. It's a minimalist affair with a relaxing series of warm, neon colors enveloping abstract cubic structures of progressively twisting and complex architecture. Don't let it's attractive and simplistic coating fool you though, Induction is logic solving for only the most sharp-minded of puzzle game players.\n\nThe player starts off on their winding path of individual puzzles as a single cube. A small glowing white cube is visible in the distance, and the goal is simply to reach it and step into its light. Of course, all manner of tricks, traps and obstacles will block the path to this objective. The trick, as you soon learn is careful manipulation of a self-placed clone as it mimics every one of its creator's last movements. Solving solutions requires utilizing this with careful consideration to co-operate with your past self in operating a series of timed switches and movable barrels.\n\nIt doesn't take long before the stages evolve into complex M.C. Escher style constructs of intertwining walkways. Your clones begin to hauntingly outsmart you, blocking you off at the pass when least expected. With enough dedication and concentration you'll soon learn to outsmart you clones back, learning to hide behind their starting points or manipulate them into moving pieces of the complex puzzles into place for a satisfying solve.\n\nThe visuals feature an abstract, colorful and cubic style with a wonderfully hypnotizing and relaxing ambiance supplied by its soundtrack. As you progress through each vibrant construct the color palettes occasionally change to different welcoming hues. The further you spiral into the rotating selection of levels the more beats and rhythm are added to the meditative soundtrack.\n\nEvery action has a reaction, and every impossible situation solvable with only a little bit of exploration and trial-and-error. No matter how hard each progressively complex situation became I was always able to work it out through careful deliberation with my cloned reflection. Despite my general adversity and ineptitude towards puzzle games, especially of this difficulty, Induction had the perfect balance of experimentation and discovery that keeps me curiously coming back to the genre for more punishment.", "timestamp_created": 1487148419, "timestamp_updated": 1487148419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714224", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29927048": {"recommendationid": "29927048", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027204759", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 690, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488913078}, "language": "english", "review": "Great atmosphere and a lot of amazing puzzles.

You move a cube around, pushing cylinders into positions to open/close bridges to reach the exit node. The twist of the game is that you have to use multiple timelines of your own movement to solve the puzzle.\n\nThe overall difficulty is towards the upper end of the spectrum. It's not for the faint-hearted. It can tie your brain in knots trying to picture in your head the looping sequences of cause and effect. If I solve this part over here, then that other part I was planning won't work any more...\n\nThere is no timer, no scoring, no special/hidden elements, just pure, good quality puzzle solving with no distractions at all.\n\nControl mechanisms are excellent and intuitive. I used a controller and it's A to set a new timeline (the main focus of the puzzle); LT/RT to rewind/fast forward; Y to go back to the start; X to exit to level overview. There's no camera rotation but this is not really necessary.\n\nThere is no tutorial or text anywhere in the game. You're introduced with a few easy levels to demonstrate the concepts, but it is confusing for a while. There were a couple of early levels that I solved without understanding how I'd done it. Eventually you do get the hang of it though.\n\nLevel overview is a minimal concentric circles design and as you select a completed level you see a moving replay of your own solution being played out. I was well impressed with this.\n\n[h1]Sound & Vision[/h1]\n\nNothing fancy, just a minimal, clean layout with basic shapes and gentle pastel colours. The colour theme changes when you jump to another timeline - I thought it was random until someone explained it, and now it makes sense.\n\nBackground music is bland and forgettable, in a good way. It certainly won't interrupt your concentration.\n\n[h1]Difficulty Bottlenecks[/h1]\n\nThe only issue I have with this game is the linear nature of the level progression. Most puzzlers, and indeed most games in general, give you some degree of flexibility to move the game on. For example, allowing for an easier, lower quality solution so you can move on and then come back later for a better rating, or else branching the progression to give a choice of several different levels you can attempt to move on. Induction has none of this. You must complete one level before you can move on to the next, and there is only one solution - you either get it or not. Combine this with the fact that this has some very tough levels and you have a recipe for getting frustratingly stuck for long periods of time, with the rest of the game securely locked away.\n\nWhile stuck on a particularly fiendish level, I could hear the mad Scotsman in my head from the end of Pink Floyd's Another Brick In The Wall: \"If yer doohn't eet yer meet yer can't have any puddin'! Hoo can ye have any puddin' if yer doohn't eet yer meet?!\" This meat is too tough, I want some pudding!\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nThe system requirements are very low and it's fully cross-platform. No glitches or annoyances. Should run well on any computer.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\n6 achievements and cloud support but no trading cards yet.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\n50 levels may seem on the low side but the difficulty will increase your play duration somewhat, and the creative quality of the puzzles is top notch. The asking price is slightly high for me though, especially considering there is no replay value. I think I would wait for a small discount.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nThe general mood of this game reminds me very much of increpare games' work.

Every level fits on one screen and this presents a simple aesthetic that, at first, gives no indication of the complexity Induction is capable of. This complexity is created instead with the game's main puzzle mechanic, time travel.\n\nLevels are solved by moving around and interacting with the geometry; with bridges that fall down when you cross them or that require you to keep them raised by standing in specific locations and with barrels you can move, trigger switches with and ride upon. You can then use a power that resets the map to the start, only you stay where you are and a new version of you appears and proceeds to replicate exactly what you have just done. While it plays through your earlier motions you remain in control, interacting and augmenting your new pre-programmed duplicate, as you see fit. Later levels add new powers that complicate things further, letting you reset the level more times, carry barrels with your when you reset or swap back to your original cube.\n\nAll of the puzzles in Induction involve trying to predict what you're going to need yourself to do and then coordinating yourself with the ghost you set in motion. On top of that your ghost always has to finish off where you left it, with the ultimate goal of creating a paradoxical little time loop you can watch from the menu.\n\nIt's great, and It prevents the sort of accidental puzzle solving some games allow, to get through each puzzle here you're going to have to learn the level and plan a solution accordingly.\n\nIt reminds me in the most flattering way of Jonathan Blow's Braid, especially its late game puzzles solved with the protagonists shadow. It's a fantastic mechanic for a puzzle game and is explored in Induction with similar level of depth and complexity, albeit without any sort of highfalutin meta plot.  As with Braid, you can speed up and reverse time at will so having to restart puzzles is unlikely. You will probably find yourself idling round the more complicated ones, though, while your brain tries to figure out the solution.\n\nIt's Steam page claims that Induction does not pander with it's difficulty and to be honest, that's an understatement. It can be genuinely obtuse at times, with the cube switching mechanic introduced in later levels that makes planning your solutions brain-tormentingly complicated. That said, it is definitely a game that allows you to have many a eureka moment and given enough time all of the solutions can be planned out logically.\n\nIf you like puzzle games that slowly introduce you into a series of logical systems and expect you to work out the solutions without hand holding, you might find that Induction is for you. If you get frustrated at the prospect of being stuck on a single puzzle for 10-20 minutes, maybe not.", "timestamp_created": 1486462057, "timestamp_updated": 1486462161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623325", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 7, "review_score_desc": "Positive", "total_positive": 45, "total_negative": 0, "total_reviews": 45}}

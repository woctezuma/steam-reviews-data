Nach dem ersten Durchlauf bin ich sehr begeistert von dieser eigenwilligen Mischung aus Open World und Jump'n'Run. Das Exoskelett macht echt Spa\u00df und wird mittels Upgrades weiterentwickelt, was tolle neue F\u00e4higkeiten bringt. Jedes neue Techno-Spielzeug wird ganz kurz erkl\u00e4rt, und dann gibt's kleine Teststrecken, wo man sich gleich ausprobieren und den Umgang mit dem Gadget lernen kann. \nDie essentiellen Upgrades kann man nicht verfehlen. Aber selbst ohne voll ausgebautes Exoskelett kommt man gut voran und \u00fcberlebt die Story, die sich von idyllisch zu apokalyptisch entwickelt. \n\nDie Story ist unumg\u00e4nglich, aber die Hintergrundinfos sind bis auf die allerwichtigsten Funkspr\u00fcche eher im... nun ja, Hintergrund. Wer m\u00f6chte, kann sehr pers\u00f6nliche Notizen suchen, \u00fcber die meisten stolpert man sowieso irgendwie, und auch ohne die F\u00fclle an Informationen kommt man gut weiter. \n\nEin paar knackige Stellen gab's f\u00fcr mich als Novize im Bereich des Springens und Laufens, aber ein innovatives Wiederbelebungssystem und sehr h\u00e4ufige Checkpoints vermeiden stundenlanges Probieren, bis man endlich den richtigen Winkel etc. getroffen hat. \n\nEmpfehlenswert ist eine leistungsf\u00e4higere Grafikkarte als meine, was aber heutzutage sicher kein Problem darstellen sollte (meine ist einfach alt, ich sollte das so langsam einsehen :P). Ruckeln verdirbt die tolle Aussicht und macht es schwer, den einen oder anderen Sprung richtig einzusch\u00e4tzen. \n\nMein Fazit: Vielleicht nicht das neueste Spiel, aber lohnenswert, besonders wenn man es f\u00fcr wenig Geld im Sale ersteht. Sehr sch\u00f6nes Flair, gro\u00dfe Spielwiese und eine Story, die bestimmt nicht neu ist, aber gut erz\u00e4hlt, und das Austoben mehr lenkt als einschr\u00e4nkt. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516047164, "timestamp_updated": 1516047164, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39358972": {"recommendationid": "39358972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083502214", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 159, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 159, "last_played": 1516001502}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth the price for entry.

I would even say that those comparisons hold up fairly well in [i]Valley[/i]'s favor and the game manages to find its own distinct personality alongside those giants. In fact, the only criticism that I could make of this game would be that, for a game that only takes somewhere between 4 and 5 hours to complete (and probably still under 10 hours to complete with 100% of the upgrades/collectibles), it's a whole lot to take in and can, at times, feel a little bit schizophrenic.\n\n[i]Valley[/i] was at its best when I was tearing down a hill or flying through the air in the L.E.A.F. suit. There are a few upgrades that enhance your ability to traverse the environments, but the core loop of building up speed on a downslope and launching myself off a ramp to travel hundreds of feet through the air never got dull. Blue Isle's ability to convey the sensation of that speed is really something that you have to experience for yourself, it's just that much fun. The (numerous) indoor sections of the game, while interesting - if you're a fan of WW2 spy intrigue or weird/supernatural sci-fi, the game's plot is definitely a strong point here - slow things down and left me wanting more of that open-air freedom.\n\nIt also has to be said that the soundtrack is damn near perfect for setting the game's (many) moods. As stated above, the game goes through more than a few tonal shifts in its 5-ish hour playtime and I never once felt that the music was jarring or out-of-place. During the slower, more emotionally charged, moments it was a somber piano-heavy score with some beautiful harmonies while during the faster moments it became a mix of traditional and wooden percussion with a fast-paced pan flute melody that perfectly suits the feeling of speed and nature. Later, as the story took more control and the game wound towards its climax, it turned to a more traditional string orchestra and percussion setup to really push the urgency of what was happening.\n\nIf there were one thing I wish could have been included in [i]Valley[/i] it would be a free-play arena, custom designed to fully take advantage of the locomotion abilities that the developers (obviously) worked so hard to get right, especially as a way to wind down after the game's tense climax. That said, [i]Valley[/i] is truly a great game and I would recommend it to anyone looking to fill a few hours with some fun and intrigue.", "timestamp_created": 1515994544, "timestamp_updated": 1515994544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39356964": {"recommendationid": "39356964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086715027", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1515993472}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is extremely underrated.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful graphics\nUnprecedented soundtrack and sound design\nGameplay mechanics are fantastic\n\nCons:\nNot long enough\nThe combat feels like you're sucking your health away to attack enemies (which is literally what youre doing)\nCombat fairly clunky\n\nThis game is something I expect out of AAA developers, not indie. At the start of the game, when you first reach the top of a hill and can see over the valley, was a breathtaking moment. The shaders and textures were fantastic. This soundtrack literally adapts to what you're doing. I was running across water when one of the main two facilities, Astra, (the other being SOMA) sucked the life out of the world. The music seamlessly adapted to a darker, more suspenseful and dramatic tone. I don't know why, but that blew my mind for some reason. The LEAF suit mechanics are extremely fluid, and with each new upgrade to the suit I feel like more of a god. Your suit uses energy for everything, from double jumping, to using a grappling hook of sorts, to attacking enemies. When you run out, you die. Because of that, the attacking enemies bit is a bit weird to me. You have to give the enemies your energy to actually attack them, and even then you may accidentally take the energy back from their more docile form and then they go ballistic on your ass.\n\nBut regardless of the cons, the game feels like you're in a movie. You play as a character who finds bits and pieces of information about researchers who were here before you. You yourself are the narrator, which feels like the best type of game. You're discovering things as you go, and it feels like youre the character discovering it yourself. The feeding grounds boss fight--while not particularly difficult--was one of the most mindblowingly amazing boss fights I've ever played in a video game, because of the visuals and the way my character moved and adapted to its attacks.

The first three chapters have little to no conflict, luring the player into a sense of security before they truly reach the meat of the story.\n\nIn Valley, you play a protagonist searching for the mythical \"Lifeseed\", an artifact said to have the power to unmake worlds. Once you are strapped into your LEAF suit, you are then responsible for monitoring the life of the Valley around you -- collecting energy that acts as both your ammunition and your hit points. The interacting mechanic of quantum death keeps the player aware of their surroundings and constantly finding sources of energy to power their suit and protect themselves. \n\nThe story starts out deceptively pleasant too, but eventually slips the player into the harshness of World War 2, and the desparation of a team of researchers and scientists desperately attempting to create superweapons to defeat the Nazis. The player witnesses the length of the project taking place in the SOMA and ASTRA facilities, all while dealing with the results of the Hubris of Man. All told in audio logs that have been waiting to be heard for years, the player looks in through a time vortex to see how the facilities came to be abandoned and how the Valley has remained a secret all the time. This game could benefit from a \"suspense\" tag. \n\nThere's also a pretty impressive twist that made a choice I'd made under the assumption of it being the most moral one become one of the most horrific choices I've ever made in a video game. \n\nMy only complaint is that the ending leaves a lot of questions.

From pure exploration, to some awesome parkour, to shooting at things. It was outstanding. I've never had this much fun with a singleplayer game for quite some months. The game is rather short, but has lots of secrets, and many things to uncover after completion. I bought it while it was on sale, so definitely worth the money. 20 euro still seems like alot, but now that i know what to expect, i would fully pay it.

The story is very complete and the plot flows perfectly with the character and what he's trying to accomplish, but the developers made it difficult to determine where to go next at certain points in the game. All that aside, the suit is such a different concept that most gaming companies don't incorperate, which involves momentum and planning your next move before you hit the ground, and the game mechanics shine in that area with precision enhanced fun (if you like games like rocket league). There are also colectables throughout the entirety of the game for people striving for all the secrets and lore of the world, with some upgrades to help you along the way as well. The story and mechanics work nicely; however, the enemies are a different story, they are repetitive, bland, and very very easy to beat, but again they are very unusual and scary at first which was interesting and suspensful, and then they started to become annoying in the end. Also, the end boss doesn't necessarily complete the game's sincerity, which is why I would recommend playing this on a higher difficulty if you're looking to play for a decent amount of time or for a fun challenge. Altogether, I recommend this game on sale especially for $5.00 because it is a breath of fresh air if you're looking to take a short break from other games. \n\nSummary: It's a very fun game and is definetally worth your time which I recommend, but very short with fun mechanics and upgrades through the game, also with slightly repetitive enemies and pretty easy.

This is an awesome little game.  It's absolutely gorgeous.  The controls are smooth and enjoyable.  Additional abilities are introduced well, and at an easy pace.  The plot develops through automatically played audio clips, but is expanded by optional written pieces you can find in various areas.\n\nDon't go into it expecting high-difficulty play - just about anybody could finish this.  However, the parkour aspect is handled well enough that you can put yourself to the test, and find complicated ways to do things that the game provides paths to do simply; climb tough areas just for the fun of it.  There's pretty minimal replayability, but it really doesn't suffer from that at all - it tells its story and does it well.\n\nMy only real problem with it was that true save points are much, much too far apart.  While when you die you respawn basically in exactly the same place, if you ever have to close out the game, you'll be restarted at the beginning of that area (although it does save collectibles progress) - and some of the areas are pretty sizable.

This is just one of the best games that I have found here on Steam, and I happened upon it just because someone mentioned it was on sale, on Gamng on Linux. Graphically it is splendid. The level design is perfect: it is the outdoors exploration sim that I have been craving. The gameplay is awesome - so far it is about using your powers to improve life around you (imagine!) You are managing your environment to enrich and not to destroy, but not in a dull preachy way. It is just part of the excellent gameplay that makes you feel part of the environment as you are also moving through it.\n\nGive you an example of the gameplay: you are in the woods, see that the trail leads down to a river, you run full speed down the path, the motion blurring happens and there is a sound of air rushing past you, you leap into the air - over the river - and down into some photorealistic trees that are swaying in the wind, with a crunch that can almost make you feel the impact, and a plume of dust rises around you.\n\nThat is one of the many just-so-happens moments that this game gives you, just moving from place to place. I am not even going to try explaining the really special things that Valley delivers. And it gives a bunch of cool ideas.\n\nIt is challenging and compelling. I keep looking forward to coming back for the worldbuilding, the story, the level design, and everything else. And I bought this at such a huge discount that I feel like I robbed the developers.

I highly recommend it if you like exploration, old ruins or abandoned places and mystery.", "timestamp_created": 1514400233, "timestamp_updated": 1514400233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527721", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38748332": {"recommendationid": "38748332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006516101", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514397371}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0443 \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u0431\u044e\u0434\u0436\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u043f\u0440\u0438 \u0435\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0434\u0435\u044f \u0441 \u044d\u043a\u0437\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c. \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430. \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u044b\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u0430\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043e \u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432. \u0413\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044f\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0439 , \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u0443\u044e \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443. \n\u0418\u0437 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438. \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0437\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u043f\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437 \u0432\u044b\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438. \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e. \u041d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u044e \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043e \u0444\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043e\u043d \u0431\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u043b\u044f\u043b \u044d\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0438\u044e.\n\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u0430\u0448\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0422\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0440\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 ZOG \u0432\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u043e \u0432\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440.", "timestamp_created": 1514399285, "timestamp_updated": 1514399285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504878", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38746879": {"recommendationid": "38746879", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964389318", "num_games_owned": 311, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514396650}, "language": "italian", "review": "Un gioco breve e godibile.

Life and death play a key role in everything you do, in a really cool way.\n-Characters with a pulse: despite typicalness of everyone in the game, they still felt lively.  Basically good voice acting and development, pacing was just right on it.\n-Quantum puns and Schrodingers Video Game that never was but is at the same time. \n-Only a few hours of gameplay, but can easily see myself replaying once I'm done. There are also quite a few things I missed on the first run already, so there's a lot to explore here and there.\n-If you like stuff that makes you go \"woo\", then you'll have a fun time with this one. It's one of those games you'd really love playing in an IMAX theater if you had the opportunity.\n-You fucking control life and death.\n\nCONS\n-A bit redundant here and there. Once you get around to upgrading a few things and learning the overall controls, you find yourself repeating gameplay every now and again.\n-It's clunky at times, not nearly enough to be unplayable, but enough to irk you when it happens. Easy fixing w/settings and such, but still a con.\n-The enemies were awesome, but very limited for variety. There is basically a bad, baddie, and baddest. Although I did not complete the game at time of this review, may edit later.\n-I didn't have trouble personally with it, but my buddy pointed out that this type of game is better on a controller opposed to keyboard and mouse. It's subjective, really, but he brings up a valid point. \n-The animations for the rigs and models aren't TERRIBLE....but sometimes cheezy. Would have made this game a lot better for atmosphere if they worked on it more before release.\n\nTL;DR: \nIt's a solid game, as with any steam game, try to pick it up on sale. If you enjoy first person adventures and interesting little stories that have yet to be oversaturated on steam or by hollywood, it's worth it. It's no gem, could have been a little more worked on, but has replay value, is borderline fun, and at times was even reminiscent of classics like Portal. \n\n8/10 acorns for this game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1514339666, "timestamp_updated": 1514339666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38716485": {"recommendationid": "38716485", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961204745", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513088271}, "language": "english", "review": "Big, empty, and not a lot to do.

Other reviews are used to help stress my point across but are changed in such a way to make the review in my own wording [/h1]\n\nValley is a game developed and published by Blue Isle Studios, the same developers behind the remake of the Slender game called Slender: The Arrival\n\nThis game was... a hugely pleasant surprise. When I bought this, I thought it'd just be a nice, pleasant experience. I adored this game, and played it from beginning to end\n\nThe physics are fluid, and the exhiliration  is amazing. The graphics are fairly good especially the overall environmental graphics, but I noticed a few frame rate drops here and there in certain areas. Overall, it's a beautiful game though\n\nWhen you first see the valley in the game called... Valley, it's really something, and you might even amaze yourself with its wonder and beauty. The environment around you is absolutely beautiful and astonishing since it was created on the Unity engine\n\nThe gameplay is really fun and exhilirating and the achievements aren't actually that hard if you're into that. Absolutely recommended for anyone looking for a pleasant, fun, and slightly short gameplay experience\n\nValley has a somewhat interesting yet cliche story with some really fun and fast paced gameplay and some beautiful scenery and the ability to backtrack easily\n\nSadly however, there is no real replay value, just exploring the valley once you've finished, it's sadly really short, clocking in at only two hours long even though I wanted to play more and from what I saw, it's a bit pricey but it's definitely worth the grab during a sale or when the price drops\n \n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]\n[i] THEPCGAMER'S BEST GAME IN STEAM LIBRARY!

There are issues, of course (clipping and invisible walls are unforgivable in a game about freedom of movement, and what's up with the camera often sliding down to the character's crotch level?); but generally, the jumping and movement in [i]Valley[/i] feel great.\n\nThe level design is hit and miss. Mostly levels are great to navigate. However, there are two different types of levels in [i]Valley[/i]: some are fast theme park rides that want to pump your adrenaline with special effects, speed, and huge jumps; others are calmer and reward exploration. The issue is, they play completely differently, and it's not obvious at first glance which type of level you're on.\n\nI did, however, very much love the final run, that has you traverse a huge exploration-based level that is collapsing around you, turning into a linear path. It's a smart way to add spectacle and wink at the player, while making it clear what is expected of them.\n\nThe mechanics are numerous, but added gradually, so as not to overwhelm the player. And while it's definitely not a walking sim, it actually felt like one to me, since most challenges felt easy, and the mood was very relaxed; more than anything, [i]Valley[/i] invites you to absord the atmosphere, look for secrets, jump around, and hug trees.\n\nUnfortunately, the setting and story of [i]Valley[/i] are... shall we say, confused. They combine a mystical valley inhabited by Ghibli-like cute magical creatures, a Greek-named bomb, the Aztecs, a random explorer finding a military-grade suit, a semi-serious plot about a scientist competing with Oppenheimer, but also a plot about his fellow researcher trying to sabotage their work because the bomb HURTS THE TREES. It's an incomprehensible mess of references and styles that wants to be mystical, gritty, thoughtful, social, and emotional at the same time\u2014but ends up just silly.\n\nStill, if you don't pay close attention to a supposedly serious military researcher qualifying the newly-found source of unknown energy as 'cute' and thus worth more than human lives, [i]Valley[/i] provides an array of nicely-looking locations, good atmosphere, and fun, if easy, parkour.

It doesn't go out of it's way to kill you with punishing jump sequences, and instead focuses on providing cool movement mechanics and giving you opportunities to put them through there paces as you bound across the landscape.\n\nThe atmosphere was amazing, lots of great scenic outdoor locations, strewn with some ancient ruins and retro military-industrial facilities. The game is quite short, and the plot advances quickly, which keeps things fresh since you're constantly moving into new areas and aquiring encountering new mechanics.\n\nI did find the combat encounters a bit weak, even the big boss went down easily on the first try, but ultimately the combat was more a sideline than the focus of the game so this wasn't a huge problem.

That is what kept me playing to the end. It was awesome to run on rails that gave you superspeed, jump right before a giant hole, and fly through the air to the next part of the corridor. Awesome feeling... one that I don't think I've had in a game before. \n\nBut in my mind, sadly there is a huge con...\n\nIt's made in Unity, and it seems to be quite unoptimized. I have an i7 7700k, gtx 1080 and 16 GB Ram, as well as have this  game installed to my primary ssd. As it's Unity it's very GPU based. My GPU immediately shot up to 99% for the entire game, while my CPU stayed around 20%. My fps would swing from 144 (rarely) and around 28-32 (most of the time.) Even if I turned own AA to medium, it would only push the average up to about 38-40. That's just unacceptable, especially in a game based around movement. Now, I will say that it didn't seem to lag even though the fps were as low as they were, but there's no reason they should have been in the first place.\n\nRegardless though, I'd still recommend it.

It's quite different from any other 1st person game I've played and is quite relaxing to play in some ways. It's never frantic like a lot of shooters tend to be, the gameplay isn't that hard and the levels are enormous.\n\nPros:\nThe outdoors look fantastic and you get a real sense of size and space.\nEasy to get into and play.\nGameplay is fun.\nLevels and game is well designed and makes you want to play just one more mission!\nPlaying for 20 minutes turns out to be 3hrs ;)\nThe music is quite good (and really irritating too, see below).\n\nCons:\nControls! I'm a lefty and you can't change the key mappings (set for right handed players!) in the game. You have to launch the config utility for the game from within your Steam library in order to remap keys. What a pain in the backside that is!!! Oh, and if you launch the game any other way than via the library, it will ignore your mappings. From what I've read, this is a problem with the Unity Engine and not the game itself.\nMusic - every time I launch the game, I have to go into options and turn the music off. Even though it's set to silent in options, it still plays! Some new levels loading cause the music to start playing again and you have to turn it off, again. Really, really annoying bug!\nLinear - Ok, so the outdoor scenes are massive and look open. You can explore as much as you like and there are hidden crates in some odd places. The problem is that despite this illusion of it being an open game, there's only one exit to each scene/level/mission or whatever name you want to use. It's a linear game dressed up (cleverly, I might add) as an open world. That is a con because I don't like linear games and yet hasn't spoilt the game because it's well hidden in the level design.\nVariety - I think I'm almost near the end of the game after 4hrs+ and it is becoming a bit samey now.

I have found it to be refreshingly different from anything else I've played. Its free flowing movement system and clever way of unfolding the narrative are very well paired with an affective music score and beautiful environments. I do have two particular gripes with it however, which have given me reason to write this review granted that I don't usually bother to do so. \n\nFirstly the save system is pretty old school in that you start at the beginning of each level whenever you load up the game. It's not an awful hindrance given the fast pace at which you can traverse the levels, but it does seem to be an unneccesary bother. \n\nSecondly and most significantly is the lack of reward for exploration. There is a MASSIVE potential for exploration in this game because of its sprawling level designs and the way in which the L.E.A.F suit enables you to traverse the environment. I have continually exploited this, but am very rarely rewarded for it. There are item pick-ups throughout the game, but the vast majority are in plain sight. There are also \"acorn doors\" which are non-essential to the games completion and the majority of these are in plain sight too. I wonder if the developers have done this to encourage a fast paced playing style, but given that the game lends itself to that naturally I think they ought to have made room for a slower pace too. I have continually felt let down that my exploring yields no extra reward and feel as though the developers have gone to the trouble of designing something huge without providing an extra incentive to explore and make the most of it.\n\nAll of that being said the pros still very much weigh out the cons here. I have been continually drawn back to the game to unfold its story, environments, sounds and game mechanics.\n", "timestamp_created": 1512541781, "timestamp_updated": 1512541781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38093844": {"recommendationid": "38093844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012507724", "num_games_owned": 1516, "num_reviews": 168, "playtime_forever": 395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512528492}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game.

It has two things I absolutely hate, head bobbing and no manual save.  I almost said forget it.  But, I gave it another shot and got the L.E.A.F. suit and suddenly didn't notice the head bobbing anymore and the game just opened up.  The lack of a manual save however does give it some bad marks.  I had to redo stuff often because life got in the way and had to stop the game.  You devs HAVE to start putting in better save systems.  This goes across the board.  Not just this game, but a huge chunk of games popping up these days.  A large portion of the gaming community are adults with jobs and families.  They will turn away a game they can't progress in because they have to keep repeating stuff to get where they were.  Putting that aside though, the game was beautiful, the music was great, though very loud, the gameplay itself really interesting and enjoyable and I really enjoyed the story.  Mechanically, the audio had a little trouble with the music volume increasing on starting up the game and in some sections. ( The volume slider didn't really do what it was supposed to do.  Had to fiddle with it a bit which meant I missed most of the music, because sometimes it was blasting loud and other times completely silent.)  Overall I would say the gameplay reminded me a little of Portal 2, without going into spoilers, I'll just say, the recordings, the past, the ruins all gave me that same feel.  It was really fun.

I saw that some people disliked the fact that you usually need to stop running to loot, but I generally see it as a choice that only needs to be made once. What I would like to see from the game is a reason to re-run every area at least once without looting before I'm done playing. That said, the momentum and movement are enjoyable and the looting only gets ever so slightly in the way.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful but not overwhelming. The music is well composed, and I barely noticed it because it set the mood quite effectively without being in the way of the plot. And the game sounds were mostly good apart from a few of the character footsteps and a couple waterfalls or wind gusts or something. Occasionally there was something going on that I couldn't see, giving it an almost eerie feel. I'll be putting more time into this game than it requires, just because I enjoy the movement and atmosphere.\n\nEdit: For reference, it's kind of like A Story About My Uncle in play style.

The environments are a mix of forestry, mountains and indoor facilities.  Furthermore, the game does an excellent job of mixing up the environments between each of the 8 levels. \n\n+ Level design stands out; some levels are more linear while others are more open. \n\n+ The platforming feels fantastic, running and jumping around feels fluid and natural. \n\n+ Exploring the levels carefully rewards you with upgrades \n\n+ The story is told through audio logs and documents scattered throughout each of the levels. I found the story to be engaging and interesting and has a satisfying climactic conclusion.  \n\n+ Soundtrack \n\nThe Average:\n+/- This is a short and easy game. If you don\u2019t care about collectables or replaying levels then you are looking at around 5-6 hours game time. \n\n+/- The game features some very light combat.

Playing through the story is relatively quick(finished in 2.5 hours) other than that, I really have nothing to complain about. I honestly enjoyed the story to this game. It's played in the form of tape recordings that are qued at certain points within the chapters. The story is alos backed by bits of lore spread throughout the environment. Yes you can speed run through a good portion of the game, but you may find yourself missing out on some plot points.\n \nFor the most part the controls are smooth and easy to use(sometimes I found myself overshooting a platform). Since you're piloting an exoskeleton that grants increased speed and agility. And I actually feel it. The physics of the game are based on momentum. Running down hill, you will see a significant increase in speed. Running uphill, you slow down. This in turn will affect jump height and distance. \n\n The suit is upgradeable throughout the story to include a grappling hook, jump boost, push rods(makes for a fun sequence running through tunnels) and more. There is also the use of an energy based life-death manipulator. You can use it to bring dead things-trees, deer etc- to life or take the life from organic objects. The suit operates off energy that comes in the form of glowing orbs around the environment or you can retrieve this energy from living creatures if you need a boost in a pinch. \n\nThe combat is, well, simple. There are four types of enemies(5 including a boss fight) and these are normally won by using the life-death manipulator against them. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. I had fun playing it, and if you're into platformers and parkour type games, then this one should be up your alley", "timestamp_created": 1512137887, "timestamp_updated": 1512137887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37974991": {"recommendationid": "37974991", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970287177", "num_games_owned": 1425, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512129965}, "language": "english", "review": "What an incredible experience.

The dynamic music is not only memorable, but swells at exactly the right moments to make you go, \"Wow.\" The story is there, it's non-intrusive, but still quite interesting.

It's a beautiful game with really fun mechanics; jumping and gliding and swinging and running fast as a panther, it's just amazing! Ah just writing this makes me want to play it again. Other reviews might say it better but seriously, it really is an immersive, wonderful game with a pretty cool story. I couldn't stop playing it till I got to the end.

The about four minute non-stop, high speed run on electrified rails at the Soma Reactor was Pure. Freaking. Bliss. It certainly elicited a real physical response as I got shivers and a raised heartbeat. I replayed it. And I replayed it again. And again. I would sometimes boot up the game just to do this run - it's such a rush. Pretty on the eyes with the visual effects and boon for the ears with the sweet soundtack that played into the experience. From the story and universe standpoint this whole bit is near pointless, which makes me even happier that it was included in the game just to indulge the player in a bit of crazy fun.\n\nEnough of praising that one part lol. I just love it, so well done.\n\nI meant to write a review earlier but with this award nomination I simply had to (and give my thanks to the devs). Because that is what this game is - simple, rewarding fun. All the mechanics revolve around moving freely in the world and explore, they've been carefully honed to ensure a great experience. The character is very responsive and there isn't much to remember to maximize the focus on the world around you. The visuals are simply stunning, beautifully crafted levels - there's a ton of treasures hidden in the maps and the combat is non-existent to minimal so it's encouraged to take your time to enjoy. Kudos to the composer for an incredible, atmospheric soundtrack. It compliments the world really well.\n\nMy only complaints are the lack of a save system, the somewhat forced combat, and the \"horror\" elements of the later levels.\n- There isn't a clear distinction where one level ends and another one starts, and if you exit the game at the wrong point you have to navigate through the entire level to get to the next one. It's bad design to make your player to commit to playing one full level, that can take 20-40 minutes, in one sitting if they want to progress. This was hindering my own experience.\n- The combat, as many others have said, isn't particularly well executed. It was clunky and the preset of the game doesn't support it to make it a seamless part of the whole experience. The angry bug clouds I could understand, but not the stuff later on...\n- By \"horror\" elements I mean exploring the dark indoor facilities. At some points I had to check if I was still playing the same game, and not something like SOMA. Atmospheric, sure, but when you spend most of the game in open world, and build it to be a mostly peaceful experience, it's a notable shift in the mood. Of course the storyline and the build-up supports it but there was absolutely no need for the corridors to be so ominous - I was afraid something would jump at me at every corner, and wasn't really enjoying the stress it caused. \n\nA minor complaint is the strange timeline - it's hard to say how long these facilities and junk have been lying around because they're all clearly abandoned, but the immediate events affect the main character in the present. That being said, the story and the world/setting are engaging, and the voice acting well executed. The \"bad guy\" was a very believable character.\n\nI would definitely recommend giving this little gem a run. It's a light game, with about 8-10 hours of playtime, depending how thorough you are. The devs picked a few simple elements that succeed in making the player really enjoy the time spent with the game. The sense of movement and the unique momentum mechanic was something I personally enjoyed, and like mentioned earlier, visuals and audio are very notable strenghts. Thanks Blue Isle Studios for your game!

It reminds me a little of another game I played entitled \"A Story About My Uncle,\" so if you're a Valley fan, the one might be worth checking out too.\n\nAlmost immediately after starting the game, you find a \"LEAF\" suit. It's basically an exoskeleton that allows you to run faster, jump higher, and get this: revive or destroy local flora and fauna. When you're charging down a hill, gaining momentum the whole time, and you launch across a crevasse, the game is exhilarating. There are quite a few moments like this, and things get especially exciting when you find train tracks that seem to interface with your suit to generate more and more speed. In addition, it creates an oddly tranquil feeling in the player to revive deer and dead trees that you come across.\n\nHowever, I can't say that the story really resonated with me. First of all, your character is exploring ruins that seem to be at least 50 years old. The game attempts to create an immediate crisis that the player is responsible for solving, but the thought that these ruins have been sitting here without incident for so long really undermines the pressure and immediacy of the crisis. It is true, though, that someone else could happen upon the site and abuse the technology found within. So perhaps it's good that the protagonist stopped by, but she definitely doesn't need to be in a hurry.\n\nSecondly, and at the risk of giving too much away story-wise, I felt that one of the big \"reveals\" in the late game could be read as an allegory for the stem cell debate. This came to mind as I was playing, and actually soured me a little on the title as I tired long ago of conservative legislators delaying potentially life-changing medical advances.", "timestamp_created": 1511062465, "timestamp_updated": 1511064139, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36608532": {"recommendationid": "36608532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019005563", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511300753}, "language": "english", "review": "Great visuals, great gameplay, fairly easy but longer than I expected.

Can you tell me of any game where reviving and ressurecting dead things is so integral to the overall story and plot of the game? You get a jumping suit which does other cool things too once you unlock them; you can quite literally fly, in this game. There are also a few \"running very fast\" sections which were really fun.  Also a really good narrative to keep you interested. Anyways, my point is this game was definately worth every penny I spent on it. It's also pretty short; I finished the story in a bit over 6 hours, and that's with pleny of time spent on exploration. So, are we getting some DLC or expansions; or perhaps a sequel??

Non-violent, centred around movement through\u2014and state of\u2014'Valley'.\n\nThe game mechanics are centred around the locomotion enabled by the L.E.A.F. suit, that you get very early in the first area and it is to say very enjoyable experience. \nThere is something about running down the hill in first-person view, accelerating up to 110\u2014I think it was kilometres\u2014per hour and then jumping over a chasm onto the other side, landing and continuing to run, which makes this so much fun; fun that wouldn't be so great if I was controlling a car, or if it was 3rd person view.\n\nThe underground levels that let you run that fast (or faster) on electrified rails are extremely exhilarating, because of the combination of well-chosen awesome music, sound and visual effects.\nSent shivers down my spine many times and the levels are fun to repeat.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b] The game is pretty. It is not THE best looking game you can get, but it has it's charm and the style suits it like no other probably would. Not that I care\u2014I prefer games that don't sacrifice gameplay and story for pretty skyboxes, like it happens with many of those so-called AAA games these days.\n\n[b]Story:[/b] There is a mystery almost right to the end, gradually revealed through notes and audiologs, at which point you'll get satisfying answers to almost everything and the ending nicely  ties it all together.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] I praised this enough at the top, now to nitpick a bit. You are encouraged to explore, but given the freedom of movement, you can very easily get to places where's nothing or where they forgot to finish the objects, so you can get under a pile of rocks, see/walk/fall right through them. At one spot, this is even at the place you can simply walk to, right next to a chest with stuff.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this enough for something so unique and nice.

My steam library wouldn\u2019t be the same without it. The story is a fantasia of science fiction and historical fiction, with a touch of fantasy for good measure. The music is enchanting, the scenery is breathtaking, the motion controls are satisfying, the voice acting is on-point, and even the loading screens are beautiful enough that you won\u2019t mind them staying on the screen for a few more seconds. The L.E.A.F. suit\u2019s movement mechanics make you feel the way Sonic games would if they were any good. \n\nThe only significant drawback of this game is that it was shorter than anticipated, which is the only reason I feel as though the regular price is just a tad bit too high. The collectibles aren\u2019t as rewarding as I think they should be, which is another downside. Finally, although it is true that the developers didn\u2019t always seem to put enough thought into the level designs (e.g., I ended up getting to at least one place which, it became obvious in time, I was not supposed to have reached yet \u2013 and I did so merely by curiously exploring the terrain for the correct way to go) I actually appreciated the sense of freedom the maps afforded the player the illusion of having. These are all negligible drawbacks to an otherwise outstanding game.\n\nOverall, I\u2019m happy to give this game an 8/10. I very strongly recommend people buy it if it\u2019s on sale, and I applaud supporting the developers by buying it at full price. \n", "timestamp_created": 1508880659, "timestamp_updated": 1508880659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477528", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35965322": {"recommendationid": "35965322", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255789593", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511939733}, "language": "schinese", "review": "4\u5c0f\u65f6\u901a\u5173\uff0c\u4e0d\u957f\u4e0d\u77ed\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u521a\u521a\u597d\u3002\n\u552f\u7f8e\u7684\u753b\u9762\u914d\u4e0a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684BGM\u3002\n\u5f53\u6211\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u4e2d\u7a7f\u68ad\uff0c\u5728\u5c71\u5d16\u4e0a\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5728\u96a7\u9053\u91cc\u72c2\u5954\uff0c\u4e00\u76f4\u5230\u6700\u540e\u4eceAstra Facility\u91cc\u4e00\u8dc3\u800c\u51fa\u65f6\uff0c\u6574\u4e2aValley\u5728\u6211\u811a\u4e0b\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u542c\u7740\u98ce\u58f0\u4ece\u8033\u8fb9\u547c\u5578\u800c\u8fc7\uff0c\u5fc3\u91cc\u53ea\u5269\u4e0b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b57\uff1a\u9707\u64bc\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1508846983, "timestamp_updated": 1508846983, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35958436": {"recommendationid": "35958436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087840047", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 229, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508810858}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun little game.\n\nShort, but fun.\n\nGet it on sale for 5 bucks.

It doesn't recreate the wheel when it comes to the movement in this game but it feels good enough to basically carry the game.\n\nAnother highlight would be the sound design. The music always feels like it suits the moment and the one song that tends to repeat enough somehow managed to not get irritating. The sound effects are also good, with little things that you wouldn't expect from a game this small. An example being that if you jump through some leaves on a tree they actually rustle.\n\nThe story is quite cliche with a heavy emphasis on man corrupting nature. Whether that is a negetive is up to you really as I found the execution to be interesting enough within the setting they had created. But the game and the story itself is very short. I'd say 5 or 6 hours max just doing a normal run through without going out of your way to collect the in game collectibles.\n\nPerforamce was good, with only a couple hickups lowering 60fps to around 50fps, but I'm running a pretty decent rig so that wasn't much of a suprise.\n\nIf I was to point out negatives I would look at the lack of replayability and the combat. I doubt you're going to get another playthrough out of this game once you've already played it. It doesn't have the mesmerising visuals of a game like ABZ\u00db to make replaying worth it. Possibly if you really personally enjoy the movement and want to collect all the collectibles you might return.\n\nThe combat could honestly not be in the game. It feels like it's just there to give you something else to do for a few seconds before you resume your running about. It's also laughably easy. \n\nNow this review so far probably looked very middling, but I beat this game in one session. You could put that down to how short the game is but I genuinely enjoyed the game, even with it flaws.

The story is very interesting and kept me engaged from start to finish. Exploring Valley was very rewarding and memorable due to the awesome L.E.A.F. suit you acquire at the start of the game. This allows you to build up huge momentum as you run down hills or speed through underground tunnels on electrified rails. The various upgrades found as you complete the story add additional functions like a grappling hook (which is context sensitive unfortuantely), double jump, magnetic wall climbing, and water running. There is also a bit of an FPS element as you will need to use the suits ability to fire energy blasts to defeat enemies. The energy consumed for attacks is also your health and can be replenished by draining it from plants, animals, and generators. However if you drain too many animals and trees the health of the valley itself is lowered, if this reaches zero the game ends. Where Valley really shines is it's story and freedom of movement as you explore each beautiful area in search of secrets such as upgrades for the suits energy capacity. Once you have completed the main story you can revisit each area to hunt down any remaining secrets, there is a completion percentage shown for each level so you will know right away if you missed anything. The voice work and music are excellent throughout as was the overall performance, I did not encounter any major glitches or frame rate issues. Valley is an easy recommendation if you just want to relax and explore a fantastic environment while unraveling a mysterious story.

While it mostly is a \"walking sim,\" there's actually a little bit of combat thrown in. Nothing too crazy, so even those who don't normally play games can just enjoy the adventure at their own pace, and the enemies have a cool design, and tie-in to the main plot. \n\nStory is mostly told through audio logs, which is a pretty cool narrative tool I have never tired of since playing Bioshock. Unlike in older games such as Resident Evil, where you got most of the plot by only reading the notes and cutscenes, it got a tad overdone, leaving just a wee bit too much at the imagination at times, especially when you really wanted to know what happened to everyone, and not just the characters you played as. With the voice overs, you really get a sense of character from the world you're in, and changes up the many ways one can experience a world within a game.\n\nThat said, this is a very short adventure, much like Blue Isle Studios's previous project, Slender The Arrival, which also featured simple gameplay, but done in a unique fashion to cause paranoia and fear. That game still gives me the creeps just thinking about it, but here, Blue Isle Studios gets to make their own full project, with their own ideas, rather than taking off with a borrowed one and building from there. Not saying it was a bad thing for them to do that, I'm just happy they got to do a project that wasn't tied down to a mythos, and they really got to make their own here. \n\nNo, there is no horror here. This is, for the most part a very touching, and rather spirited adventure from beginning to end. It's been a longtime since a game has made me feel \"fun\" for the sake of fun. I was never bored here, and if you're someone who just enjoys taking in the scenery, and nature itself, you'll probably love it for that alone. \n\nI can't really think of any real negatives, except for the length. I feel the main adventure could have been an hour or two longer, but the game does leave itself open for you to explore long after finishing the storyline. Also, while the aspect of being able to give and take away life for survival is unique, and not something really explored in games, I feel like there could have been more developed here, but not sure what could have been done without adding characters. \n\nIf you enjoyed Soma, which was also another interesting walking sim, adventure type game, I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy this one. There's even an area named Soma, and while Soma itself is unrelated to this game and studio, I couldn't help but make the comparison once I made it to that point. Don't get me wrong, the tone is quite different, and this one is a more happy go lucky sort of experience, without too much thought being given to the morality of your abilities. \n\nIf you need an adventure, or a need to pass the time, by all means check this one out.

No regrets. \n\nPros:\n\n-Beautiful soundtrack, and matches every scene and action. From running through a sunrich valley filled with wildlife, to sparking down a railtrack at increasing speeds through an abandoned military base each score invokes the feeling you come to hope.\n\n-Response suit. Obviously the highlight of this game is the LEAF suit you wear. The parkour feels satisfying, and the movements are accurate to your input.\n\n-The envrionment. The is a beautiful world. A mix of nature, ancient ruins and abandoned military facilites keep everything very diverse. \n\nCons:\n\n-It's a fairly predictable story. It does not mean it isn't entertaining, as the voice actors do a good job at delivering their lines, it's just you've probably have come to see this type of plot more than once.\n\n-It's a rather short adventure. There isn't a lot of incentive to go back and find all the medallions unless you really want to uncover every last plot detail and upgrade. Expect anywhere between 4-5 hours for the story, but the good news is the whole of that has a lot action going on. \n", "timestamp_created": 1508039049, "timestamp_updated": 1508039049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473118", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35709958": {"recommendationid": "35709958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171365221", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 46, "last_played": 1515725684}, "language": "schinese", "review": "BGM\u548c\u753b\u9762\u8ba9\u6211\u6b32\u7f62\u4e0d\u80fd\u554a\uff0c\u4e70\u4e86\u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u4e8f\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u770b\u4e0d\u61c2\u82f1\u6587\u8001\u662f\u5361\u5173", "timestamp_created": 1507962677, "timestamp_updated": 1507962677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35661677": {"recommendationid": "35661677", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217286460", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509137387}, "language": "dutch", "review": "it's a dayum good gameeee, i love it", "timestamp_created": 1507823286, "timestamp_updated": 1507823286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35651120": {"recommendationid": "35651120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253468695", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507559383}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e45\u4e4b\u524d\u4e70\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u6401\u7f6e\u4e86\u597d\u4e45\u4e00\u76f4\u6ca1\u73a9\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff1a\n\u2460\u6e38\u620f\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u5f88\u8d5e\n\u2461\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4eba\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u7ec6\u8282\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u8d5e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u5c71\u8c37\u6216\u8005\u77f3\u5934\u89e6\u78b0\u65f6\u90a3\u79cd\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u771f\u5b9e\n\n\n\n\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e2d\u6587\uff01\nThe most important thing:    We need the language of Chinese in the game!", "timestamp_created": 1507776609, "timestamp_updated": 1507776609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653177", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35647383": {"recommendationid": "35647383", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072700968", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507757117}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0422\u0430\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0421 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0432\u044b -

Here's a quick glimpse of my pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- Moderately enjoyable running mechanics (but this has been done so many times before in so many games)\n\n- Fantastic soundtrack (by far the best part of the game)\n\n- Beautiful landscape and graphics\n\nCons:\n- Gameplay itself is simply not engrossing, except for the levels based solely on freerunning\n\n- Story is weak and overdone - mad scientist has developed device to take over world, you are discovering his plans through audio logs, etc. etc. Done it a million times over.\n\n- Combat is laughably easy - might as well not exist.\n\n- Collectibles are annoying and not rewarding to find. You find collectibles so you can unlock doors to find...really, really, dull upgrades for your suit. Rinse, repeat. And there are a lot of them. Not worth your time.\n\n- Game is incredibly short. Can be beat in a few hours.\n\n- Virtually zero replay value. As I noted earlier, there's not a great incentive to find all of the collectibles, so unless you're an achievement hunter, it's not entirely worth going through all the levels again just to search out every single crate in every corner of the valley. Would turn a 4 hour game into a 10 hour game. Again, waste of time.\n\nOverall, this game had a few good moments that made me think, \"yeah, this game was definitely worth the $5 I paid for it.\" And I certainly don't feel like I was robbed, by any means. I just think there's too many other great games out there to use your time on this one. To put it plainly, it's a boring game. But it is beautiful.

On one hand, it's a game that has a lot of fast and incredibly fun movement. It also has quite large areas which can be explored using this movement. As such, a lot of the time you're keeping the momentum going from one interesting place to another, getting some gradual upgrades to your movement option and able to always return to the completed levels. And it also has some very basic action moments, based around the concept of life/death manipulation mechanics that never really go anywhere and might as well just be considered \"ammo/life\".\n\nAnd the big problem, that not only this, but nothing ever really goes anywhere. The story is of bland, with a very primitive environmentalist motive that tries to be written into mechanics, but it never feels right. Movement itself, while fun, can be a pain due to character suddenly loosing momentum inexplicably or easily ploishing through the walls. A lot of the levels are boring to look at. And levels are big just for the sake of it, never really feeling thought out. It's a fun ride if you just run through the game, giving you a few hours of really exciting high-speed running and jumping not a lot of games can give (it was reminding me of Tribes at times, in the best ways).

It reminded me of Portal in a few ways, for instance I loved how the gameplay was based on physics. (I am not saying this IS Portal, mind!)\n\nThe graphics worked really well to create some fantastic sceneries - and the music was absolutly beautiful and fit very well.\n\nThe story is interesting and logical, I like how you get most of it handed to you buy the audio files that start up when you reach certain points in the game - but how you can still find out additional information through these notes lying around. I thought the story was something were you might say \"yeah, that's something I've heard before somewhere\" - but it was still effective and most importantly: not overcomplicated. Because I think that could have well happened with a different, less talented writer.\n\nNethertheless, while I really enjoyed playing it and had a great time at it, here are some nickpicks:\n- The time spent searching around the factory annoyed me. Mostly because it was too freaking dark, and the game has no option to set up the brightness or anything. And also because I had a really great time running down slops and feeling like Sonic the Hedgehog. (heh)\nThe game did make up for that later on with the tunnel rails that make you run very fast and the water skeeing part. But still. I was bored deep in the depths of the 1st facility.\n\n- My second and biggest complaint is... not really a complaint. Or...well maybe it is. I dunno. It was just something I was HOPING for while playing: \n\n+SPOILERS AHED+\nThis mostly goes to the developer, I suppose.\n\nAfter you extract the life seed and the reactor breaks down, it gets revealed that the second facility still runs, but now is sucking the life out of everything and you are being told that it will do so until the entire PLANET is dead. Wow. What an amazing way to rise the stakes! So - because I am a person who loves to get really lost in the world of a game - I went \"Oh no! I need to stop this! I need to save all the trees and animals in the valley - and save the planet eventually! - by shuting this thing down! Let's go!\" and I ran off. ... Coming to the next checkpoint the environment gets very dark as the facility emits a shockwave that kills off a bunch of trees. And I thought \"oh no! I better hurry! It will keep draining the life off the environment until the Valley health is to 0 - and than it will be game over for me too!\"\n\nExcept that... didn't happen. I usually hate being rushed in a game. Like when a mission in WatchDogs is so damn tightly timed that you can't possibly make it on your first try. But in this: I really had wished there'd be an element of the clock to it.\n\nThat every 30 seconds or so the Valley looses health through another shockwave from the facility. And you have to keep giving life back to the trees and animals (kinda wished there'd been more throughout the game) to keep it - and evidently yourself - alife. All while liberating (? cuz I don't think 'killing' would be the right word) the Verdigos. So... yeah.\n\nSo yeah. My thoughts.\nI'd love to see a second game come out of this. Even tough I guess the ending was pretty... ending. But I couldn't help but think when my character pushed the suit into the water \"No! I want to resurect that deer over there and all the trees! I want to run through the valley and revive everything!\"\n- uuuuntil I remembered that it would be kinda wrong because the blue things actually are +spoiler spoiler spoiler+\n\nStill: Amazing game. Go buy it - it's not that long, but worth it's price, I believe.\nAlso, on a last note: I loved that the wonderful original concept art was included in the cutscenes.\n", "timestamp_created": 1506688891, "timestamp_updated": 1506688891, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35245660": {"recommendationid": "35245660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082195576", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 424, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506531431}, "language": "english", "review": "Playing out like a kind of weird Portal/ Tomb Raider hybrid and with an unnecessarily interesting story this is definitley worth your time if you fancy something a bit different (if quite easy).

I think I would describe the genre as \"Traversal\". It has some light puzzle elements and some light shooting but neither of those are really the focus of the game. Instead this is a game about moving through the level using the environment to assist you. In this sense I would say it is very successful. The movement mechanics feel very smooth and the different tools you have mostly add to the experience (although I'd have liked to see more ability to use the grappling hook for general movement). The resource system is also interesting, using a single resource for your hit points, mana points and ammunition count. It forces you to keep an eye on things during the combat segments since if you shoot to much you can kill yourself.\n\nThe story is ok, not great but good enough.

And I bought it despite knowing from other reviews that this is a very short game and might leave me unsatisfied content wise. Surprisingly enough, I was pretty satisfied and did't feel cheated at all. \nI think the best way to describe this is: It's like an interactive movie where you wander around a beautiful world and find out about what has happened in the Valley.\nThe story is pretty simple, no major plot twists, not too deep, more or less a typical adventure movie story, when ancient artifacts are involved. But it is a nice story and it kept me interested in the happenings of the Valley, even if it went pretty much as I predicted. Since it is a running simulator and you dont actually meet any humans during the playtrough, the story is told exclusively trough recordings and notes left by the researchers. \nNow on to the main attraction of the game. Movement. You are equiped with a L.E.A.F. suit exo-skeleton that amplifies your speed and jumps and negates falling damage. This very simple concept along with well made levels is what makes this game truly shine, because running around high speed and jumping literal hundreds of meters trough the world feels AWESOME. And as you progress trough the game you gain many upgrades to your suit that let you travel in new ways, like hook-shotting or running on water. And the developers really tried to give you some fantastic experiences while traversing, making multiple long runs synchronised with music to really give you that feeling of epicness.\nBesides movement there is also your God-Hand gauntlet, that lets you literally draw from or give energy to any living being. Now this is a very important mechanic, as this energy is what keeps both you and the Valley alive... literally. Whenever you would die, thanks to the L.E.A.F. suit, Living things in Valley will die in your stead, and your actual life depends on the health of the Valley, meaning that, when the Valley dies it's game over as you will not be able to revive again. So, besides using your energy to keep the Valley alive, and thus yourself, you also use it for special actions, like double-jumping and hook-shotting, as well as shooting projectiles to deal with the enemies.\nCombat in itself is very simple, enemy shoots you and you shoot the enemy. In most cases you dont even have to partake in combat, you can just run past these enemies without consequences, combat really isn't forced upon you and neither rewards or punishes you. It's there to add a bit more action to the game if you choose so.\n\nNow, there are downsides to this game too, as is with most things in this world. The main downside, that has to be mentioned is price/content ratio. My game time of 3-4h is not from speedrunning trough the game, I actually spent some time enjoying the views and searching for collectables, as well as looking around and reading the notes that added flavor to the story and world. Overall I found about half or so of the collectables, and it probably wouldnt add more than 2h to 100% the game. The replayability of the game also isn't that high. I personally will probably play trough the game another time, but after that I will not touch the game for a very long time, if ever. Considering the 20 Euro price tag, that is a good argument to call it quite expensive and not buy it. \nThere is also the case of the afore mentioned collectibles and story related notes. Looking for these really breaks your flow of movement, which, in a game about fast movement and traversal, is very noticable. On the plus side, this allows you to appreciate the surroundings a bit more.\nAnd finally, some of the traversal upgrades on your suit feel like they are not used to their full potential. During the last phases of the game you get introduced to mupltiple mechanics that would allow for many interesting traversal puzzles, but end up being almost forgotten.\n\nOverall the game was very enjoyable with multiple unique and interesting gameplay concepts, but due to it's high price, I can only recommend this to people that really like these kinds of games. Definetly try to catch it during a sale though.\n\n7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1506013418, "timestamp_updated": 1506013418, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35108165": {"recommendationid": "35108165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285024693", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506010063}, "language": "english", "review": "I picked this game up a while back in a slender man bundle.

Most of the bad grades I gave were to students who either hadn't learned, or wilfully ignored, the basic building blocks of how to write an essay. How to structure an argument, and how to use sources. How to start with a thesis statement, how to support it, and so on. I never felt bad about giving these bad grades. I may have felt bad for those who were never taught how to write, but ultimately I was there to grade what was turned in. And yes, of course, sometimes there were some good papers too.\n\nEvery now and then, though, I got the kind of paper that I absolutely hated. This kind of paper was technically sound on all fronts. It had a thesis statement, and a body of supporting statements. It had citations for sources, and the general structure of an essay. It met the required word count. On paper, it hit all the criteria needed. But then I would read it, and it quickly became clear that the person writing this had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. Imagine a generic Freshman level Sociology student who just found out about Karl Marx, and writes his big paper on why Communism is the only true system of government that can serve the people, and that's why Mr. Robot is the best show on television, because it's all about bringing down Capitalism. \n\nOn a technical level, the paper is solid. But in terms of content, he has no idea how and why Marx's Communism failed, and failed badly. He has not taken an Intermediate or Expert level Sociological Theory course to learn more about why Marx's Communism can likely never succeed. He's given no thought to what governmental or economic systems Communism was derived from, nor any idea of the various semi-Communist states that have formed that are very different than what Marx intended. \n\nAnd so I was left with a technically proficient essay in which everything was wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nThat's Valley, in a nutshell.\n\nTechnically, the game is fine. It runs like a dream, the movement is fast and fluid and satisfying. I encountered no glitches or bugs. The... story... such as it is, has a recognizable beginning, middle, and end (don't laugh; Batman v. Superman couldn't even manage that). \n\nBut after about the first fifteen minutes, I started hating the game, and almost everything about it.\n\nLet's get the biggest complaint out of the way first: the game is called Valley, so you'd think it would take place in a valley. And about 30%-ish does. The rest takes place in generic abandoned warehouses and factories and military bases. All grey and dark and bland, filled with incredibly loud and grating sound effects. One could argue that making my ears bleed from screeching metal doors over and over again was intentional, because they wanted to contrast the beauty of nature with the monstrosity of machines. I would argue that (a) they could make that point WITHOUT making my ears bleed, and (b) any parts of the game set in nature are spent running so fast you can't actually hear any beautiful nature anyway.\n\nThe Valley is in a perpetual state of really late sunset, which means you get a nice orange glow where the sun hits, and total friggin' darkness everywhere else. Be ready to crank up the brightness, or play in the dark, or both, if you want to try to find Acorn doors on canyon walls. And be ready to drown at least a few times because the underground is so dark that even with the brightness up, you can't see where the water you're supposed to run on is.\n\nThe gameplay follows an unfortunate rhythm. You get a few minutes to run and jump and play out in the open valley. These moments are the best. Running down hill to build up steam, leaping off a ramp and flying through the air, feels amazing. Then after a few minutes of this, you're forced into small cramped areas with \"combat\" that amounts to litttle more than \"aim at the thing, click on the thing\". Find the generator to open the door. Climb through the vents. Listen to audio diaries. Read notes. Open crates. Are you falling asleep yet? I am. This game does one thing amazingly well - movement - yet it spends most of its time putting you in situations where you can't use this movement in any interesting ways. \n\nThe life-and-death mechanic feels much like the Edicts in Tyranny - clearly they planned to do something bigger with them, and just never got around to it. At no point in Valley was I ever so low on energy that I had to drain a living creature or tree to get ammo back. If it was meant to be a moral choice thing, it failed because I was never even tempted to suck the life force out of anything. The mechanic may as well not have existed. Just gather orbs and shoot stuff. Problem solved.\n\nSpeaking of which, holy hell, the LEAF suit grants you super speed, super jumping, AND POWER OVER LIFE AND DEATH? This is just one of many unintentionally gutbusting moments during the story. This must be the result of a late night \"Wouldn't it be cool if?\" brainstorming session in which no one had the heart to tell the guy everything wrong with that idea. If Quantum Immortality sucks the life out nearby living things to bring the user back to life, why the hell wouldn't you just send ONE LEAF SOLDIER into a battlefield? He dies, life from enemy soldiers gets sucked out, he revives. Repeat until he single-handedly wins the war. What on Earth is the running and jumping even for, if you can literally point at a living thing and drain its life force?\n\nThe gameplay demands the running and jumping, because that's what Valley does best. But the gameplay has no real use for the Life-or-Death mechanic. Conversely, the story cares a great deal about the Life-or-Death mechanic, but doing so means the rest of the LEAF suit makes absolutely no sense in the context of the story. \n\nSpeaking of the story, it's... functional? The writing isn't terrible, I guess? I'm struggling to come up with compliments here. The only really annoying thing is that the voice actors were apparently directed to read each audio diary as if the characters themselves were pausing and emphasizing for dramatic effect. They don't sound like people recording diaries; they sound like people giving line readings for a stage production, full of ACTING~! Also, just a thought: Virginia, if you're planning to sabotage the Astra plant, maybe DON'T record yourself talking about your plan? Maybe? Just a thought.\n\n---\n\nThe whole thing reminds me a bit of Thief: The Dark Project, and not in a good way. For you young whippersnappers who don't remember, Thief: The Dark Project was a game about a thief, Garrett, in a medieval steampunky kind of world. The first three or four levels had you breaking into Ye Olden Homes to steal stuff, and get out undetected. It was awesome! But the developers were worried that players wouldn't play a whole game like that, so starting in level five, zombies and monsters start showing up, and the whole thing goes off the rails.\n\nThat's Valley. It does one thing really, really well, then spends so much time getting in the way of that thing. It's like the developers were worried that the movement wasn't enough to make a game around, so they needed to add hidden collectibles and audio logs and running-sideways-on-walls platforming puzzles and \"combat\" (I use that term loosely) and the whole life/death thing. Like Thief, they didn't trust that the core gameplay conceit was enough to keep players hooked, so they started dumping in everything they could think of. \n\nI like variety in games. I like it when games give me lots of different things to do. But those things have to be fun, or at the very least, interesting. Every time Valley abandons the valley, the game becomes completely and utterly generic. If you took all the footage from the game's interior sections and told me it was from some Steam Greenlight shovelware called Base Escape, I would believe you.\n\nCan't recommend it to anyone.

I am at a loss for words for the Valley's beauty. I could only silently mutter \"wow\" in shear awe more times then I have in a long while.  \n  \nThis game dreams so big you wouldn't believe it, and it gets so much farther then you would realistically expect for an indie game. The only tell it's not triple A is it's brevity and originality. Valley also has possibly has the best sound track, audio cues and active layering I've ever heard in hundreds of games and tens of thousands of hours.  \n  \nThe spectacle starts strong, lures you into slower speculation and exploration before ramping up to a stunningly explosive finale. The ending is WELL worth getting and after everything it still took me off guard with how well executed it was.  \n  \nValley will leave on a surprising powerful and humbling note, though possibly a bit simple it's truly memorable. This game overflows with passion and creativity. Personally my game of the year.  \n \nMy hats off to the developers who I really want to thank, for a small indie studio that reached for the sky and made one of the best games I've ever played.

You can go back to collect items you couldn't get before due to some upgrades but I never felt the need to as they were very generous with the energy capsules and orbs. Most levels wasn't very hard and it was just mainly to get from point A to point B. What kept me going was the story, I wanted to know what was going on here and what the creatures was. As I don't want spoil but it's rather interesting and you won't be disappointed as far as that goes. Short but memorable game that had more potential when it comes to gameplay\n\nFinal score:\nFor bein' how short but how well made it was I would pay around \u20ac15 at most but I am disappointed that it wasn't an open world game as the L.E.A.F suit gave you so much freedom to explore.

After a while of happily exploring the beautifully arranged environment you start to encounter hostile creatures and at one point the game literally sent some chills down my spine (which only a few games have achieved so far). \n\nThe storyline is pretty good and brought across via audio logs and notes you can find throughout the levels. A twist at the end changes your view of certain aspects of the game and provides some \"oh-my-god\"-feeling.\n\nThe graphics aren't perfect but fittingly beautiful. Excellent world detail and lighting never fail to convey the right mood.\n\nThe soundtrack is awesome and adds to the atmosphere of the world.\n\nThe controls are decent and make running, jumping and grappling-hooking come to you naturally. Whenever you fail, it's because of you, not due to clunky controls.\n\n\nThe only thing I would have really liked is the possibility of exploring the valley as a whole and not only via the different level sections, since it feels like a complete world, waiting to be discovered.

Valley is about a man who found himself on an island with nobody else, for the first few minutes of wandering around, he finds himself the L.E.A.F. Suit which allows him to move at a incredible speed and along the way finding more upgrades that prove useful throughout the game. \n\nThe L.E.A.F. Suit was made way back during the World War times and was used by soldiers in hopes that however had these suits would win the war. The L.E.A.F. Suit  used energy from other life sources such as deers, which you can do in the game as well, however, the more energy you take, the faster the island dies. \n\nAlong the way there are crates which give you upgrades for your L.E.A.F. Suit and increases you energy bar and grappling hooks etc. As a result, the suit becomes more agile and allows you to access different parts of the island with ease.\n\nUnfortunately, the main power provided on the island to these L.E.A.F. Suits was a \"Life Seed\", which fell into the hands of a professor who sought to use its energy and turn it into a weapon (a bomb to be exact). As you venture deeper into the island, you find research labs and a generator underground hiding the Life Seed. Your goal is to destroy everything that the scientists made as it is killing the island and every animal that lives on it.The Life Seed will be used as a weapon but will be used for a better purpose than intended. \n\nI can't relate this game to any other game and it holds a unique story of its own. Many will fail to understand the designers view of the game but many will also understand what he intended to convey. In World War 1, man seeked for weapons that could destroy cities so as to put them in power. In World War 2, every country had the same weapons, making it pointless as the only people who won were the people who had more resources. \n\nI doubt that there will be a second part to Valley as it is already a very complete story on its own and leaves many of us touched and feeling slightly emotional. \n\nIf you are looking for a game that operates around the themes of parkour and adventure, this game is definately the game for you and will be worth your money and time.", "timestamp_created": 1504198296, "timestamp_updated": 1504403199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538690", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34637296": {"recommendationid": "34637296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137642520", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508088914}, "language": "english", "review": "Thus far I find this game INCREDIBLE!

Valley puts you in the shoes of wannabe Indiana Jones that finds himself in the mysterious valley in search of a mysterious lifeseed that grants power over life and death. Very mysterious! Mechanically it translates to running and jumping through some quite beautiful environments, looking for upgrades to your suit and shooting some spirit baddies once in a while. And it's very well done for what it is. The game is not challenging - it's possible to die but it's not easy - but it is very enjoyable and relaxing. Running very fast and jumping very high was more fun that I expected it to be.\n\nI mentioned The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. Visually the games are quite similar. Valley even uses the same font and text effect to tell you what your character is thinking. It's a little bit longer than Ethan Carter, but not too long, I clocked in ca. 7hrs, that's for going through the game once and a little bit of achievement hunting.

If you hit the side of a hill or even just jump at the wrong moment, all your momentum goes away. And the swinging mechanic (the viper coil) never worked like it felt like it should. Again, I would keep losing momentum midway through a swing, which isn't how swinging works. And the controls are either a bit too sluggish or a bit too fast. The enemies are okay, but not very varied. The final boss is just a bigger version of one of the standard enemies. And the story is a bit simplistic and anti-climactic. The notes you find along the way often just repeat the audio logs that you pick up.

The game itself is very different then any other game I have ever experienced.  \n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nThe graphics in Valley are well done for an indie title.  Although some muddy textures, the game world is brilliant. The large vistas and mountain-tops impressed me and the effects while running across water or jumping across valleys are top notch for an indie title.  The developer has put in about as much features as you would expect although I would suggest to keep the AA at SSAO (going any higher tanked my fps)\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\nValley is a fun game.  The thrill that you get from gaining momentum and making jumps is all around.  Valley will have you sprinting down mountain-tops and jumping across abusrd distances with help from a mechanical legs system called LEAP.  Spread across Valley are upgrades for your LEAP system that will allow you to explore as well.  The game is fairly linear and includes crates scattered across the world containing secrets and notes.  The game feels good to play, controls well and pretty easy to run as well.\n\nSTORY:\n\nValley's story is a short one although that is not a bad thing.  Ill save you the details but lets just say 1940s era nuclear-reactors, japenese style energy forms and lots of dialogue tapes.   The tapes provide interesting details on the backdrop and the ending gave me some satisfaction as well.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThe sound desigh is pretty average, I would even say good for an indie title however, the music is where Valley shines.  Valley's soundtrack is wide and diverse ranging from peppy folk music to the strong beat of african drums.  I loved it and can say that it is definitely one of the best parts of the game.  Running down your first hill with some fast paced folk music adds up for a great experience.\n\nOnce again,  if you can get this game on sale I would recommend it.  I beat it in 2 sweet hours, but those 2 hours were never frustrating or boring.  Maybe you can get a couple more hours out of it by collecting all the secrets and upgrades.", "timestamp_created": 1503219913, "timestamp_updated": 1503242812, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34368683": {"recommendationid": "34368683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043760171", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505002303}, "language": "english", "review": "Valley is an underacknowledged masterpiece. This is a game that has amazing mechanics for speed and traversal, but also a bit of a heart to it. The plot isn't anything too in-depth - a hiker comes across a supernatural part of the world, hidden from human eyes, only to discover a US military complex dedicated to creating a superweapon. But the gameplay is what really sells the experience here. Even more than 3D Sonic games, Valley has this incredible sense of speed and hugeness that I've never really seen quite on the scale I've seen here. Beautiful environments with lots of nature vs. technology themes, really great art direction, really great platforming and speed sections... I can't recommend this game enough. Easily my runner-up for GOTY 2016, after DOOM. Totally different narrative themes, but it's similar to DOOM in the sense that Valley knows its game mechanics make you feel powerful, and doesn't shy away from letting you feel like a badass,", "timestamp_created": 1503219035, "timestamp_updated": 1503219035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34366933": {"recommendationid": "34366933", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964400693", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 259, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503211672}, "language": "english", "review": "Good adventure FPS style with little combat and good exploration/narration.

I don't know if I would spend $20 on it though. Beatiful adventure, at times got my blood pumping but I'm not sure why; there's no real threat in the game. While there are enemies, they are fairly easily pacified. Yet, I still found myself enjoying \"fighting\" them.\n\n The running, jumping, and swinging sections gave me the same rush as playing some of the older Spiderman games. It felt very fluid.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game seems to pull you in two different directions. On one hand, you can speed through massive sections of the map with ease, all to a synchronized soundtrack. But there are collectibles scattered throughout the levels, and if you want to collet them, you have to interrupt the one thing that really makes the game fun, and that's the feeling of using the LEAF suit to glide through the levels.\n\nI hope the dev makes another game where you can navigate in a similar fashion, with speed and agility.\n\nSPOILERS ABOUT ENDGAME STUFF:\n[spoiler] Super good job on the final boss fight too. I don't think I took any damage, but it felt like the perfect fight for the environment you created. The LEAF suit gives you decent control in the air. Having to dance and shoot at the same time was fun and I could definitely see y'all making more difficult fights for future games. Keep up the good work and I hope to see more stuff from y'all soon!

If anything this game is a rather short experience. This may not justify the price tag from some players I managed to beat the game in around 2-3 hrs with somewhat minimal exploration, it is mostly linear with some exploration added, especially if you are wanting to find all the collectibles within the game.

The water effects are gorgeous and the lighting is very well done. The opening of the game is one of the most cinematic openings I've seen because you can simply see the light shine through the trees in real time. The enviornments are well made as well. Sometimes you'll be running along and you'll stop as you realize you're standing next to a giant statue, and the thing covering you wasn't a tree, it was its hand.\n\nThe land feels ancient as there are tons of visually appealing yet intruiging things lore-wise. The buildings are visually decayed and feel like they were once full of life. \n\nThe only con about the graphics are the enemy designs.\n\nYou have:\n\npurple cloud\n\ngreenish purple cloud \n\nblack and orange ghost dude\n\ngreen and orange ghost dude\n\nand the final boss isss\n\na red ghost dude but big\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nProbably the best part about Valley is its gameplay. Players are in control of what the game calls L.E.A.F suits, granting the player the ability to run incredibly fast, jump several stories at once, double jump, grapple hook, and even run on walls. The controls are very fluid (albeit a bit clunky while running in tight areas like vents or buildings) and the game encourages fast gameplay with the games multiple ramps and with the many running sections. \n\nMy only complaint about the gameplay is that it starts to fall apart when it tries to bring bigger things into play. One of the game's selling points is giving and taking life from living things. While that is an interesting idea, the game doesn't dwell on it too much. The giving life mechanic is really only useful for 3 things: shooting baddies, making the enviornment look prettier, and negating the effects of you dying (the valley has a health bar, and when you die, things start to die with in the valley so that you can be resurrected. Die too many times without giving life to the valley, and it's game over.) The take life button is even more simplified and useless. It takes life from living things to give you energy to do things, but that kills the valley, and there are plenty of energy sources to the point that it's only useful for grabbing orbs from far away. Then there's the combat. It's incredibly simplified  for a game that lets you double jump, run on walls, run on water, and grapple hook. The combat is shoot baddies with your give life button until they die. The boss dies in around 30-40 or so hits, and everything else dies in about 1-3 hits. The game isn't that difficult. \n\n\nSTORY\n\nThis is probably the worst part.\n\nThe story is split into 2 times. This is the main story, and it's set in present day, where our protagonist wakes up in the Valley after canoeing in the Alps in search of a world destroying item called the life seed.\n\nThis story is I'd say the weakest part. Apparently they couldn't find a person to voice the protagonist, so they made him a silent character. The problem is you can hear him grunting in game while you're running, and there are parts where the character talks. When I mean talks, I mean words float up on screen, apparently trying to reflect what the protagonist is thinking in that moment. The other problem is that the character has this \"cinematic\" form of thinking. They'll have a \"...\" when something major happens in the side story, like they're contemplating something. It's dumb, because it's basically saying they just trailed off in their own mind so they could contemplate about what happened in their own mind. Overall this story is incredibly weak, with a generic story about saving the earth and protecting mother nature. The character even undergoes a generic character arc. They come in looking for the life seed and come out with one of those \"the world isn't ready for it\" moments. \n\nOh yeah, by the way, the life seed becomes completely forgotten about until the end of the story, where it has a contrived reason about why you had to lug it around this whole time. This leads to some minor plot holes.\n\nOn to the second part of the story, which is set during world war 2. America discovers the valley and creates LEAF suits so they can look for the life seed.\n\nMajor fuck up right at the beginning. If they have suits that can make people run faster than a cheetah, sustain bone shattering jumps, run on walls, jump 5 stories, grapple hook, double jump, give and take life INSTANTLY, and allows people to be immortal, why do they need the life seed, which they might not know is real?\n\nBesides the slip up right there, this part of the story is relatively alright. The main woman is generally likeable until she does a character turnaround and decides to almost kill hundreds of workers for something that the game things is \"something a good guy would do\". The scientist is also generally likeable. He's human, he wants fame from this over the manhatten project, and he's excited over his discoveries and sometimes apathetic. Then he also does a turnaround and goes crazy, but everyone is oblivious to it except for the lady who tried to kill a bunch of innocent men.\n\nMy big problem with the second story is that it's told through (guess what?)  notes and audio recordings. The bread and butter of lazy lore implementing. There are notes scattered in rather strange places, and it's really weird that your suit just happens to play the audio files conveniently. It's also convenient that every person recorded what they're thinking about and what their secret plans are. \n\nOn to the lore!\n\nIt's bad.\n\nThe lore would probably be a lot better developed if it stopped asking more questions, and started answering things that the player is wondering about.\n\nWhen you first meet the ghost dudes your protagonist wonders \"what are those things?\" And it's never hinted at. It's only answered vaguely on a billboard at the end of the game.\n\n\n\nOverall, the game is well made visually and gameplay wise, but the story is less investing than a bucket of sand.", "timestamp_created": 1503021737, "timestamp_updated": 1503021737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502467", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34318373": {"recommendationid": "34318373", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017157569", "num_games_owned": 1204, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502976162}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't usually write reviews, but here I am regardless. \n\nValley is an interesting game. You will like it, IF\n\n-You come in with reasonable expectations of what it is\n\n-You're alright with 2-6 hours of gameplay, maybe a bit more if you go back for some secret areas\n\n-You're okay with some pacing that goes a bit wonky\n\nSo, to explain each point. Reasonable expectations means that you know it is an adventure platformer game with some combat, basic point and click stuff though. No combos or new weapons. The big pull are the large environments with the neat platforming bits. A few points for the story being decent at least. Not exactly up my alley, but some will really enjoy it. That is all this game is though. It doesn't do much more outside what I described (not that it should, I think it pulls off each thing reasonably well and doing more would hurt it). \n\nI don't like talking about hours, but it took me about 2 1/2 hours blazing through it a bit in one sitting. There are some places gated off by collectables, but they just contain tiny extra bits of story or some extra bits of upgrades. By no means are they needed. I think the game fits well in the 2-6 hours and doesn't overstay its welcome for the most part, however... \n\nThere are a couple places the pacing gets a bit wonky, once when you get stuck underground for a while, and overall I think the setpiece/speed chase sequences last a bit too long each time. Not bad by any means, the sense of speed is nice and the scenery pretty, but they drag on some. \n\nOverall, despite these complaints, I think it's a good game. I think it is a nice experience with some interesting story beats and very nice platforming at times.

Ci sono molti titoli che corrispondono a questa caratteristica, per\u00f2 questo \u00e8 uno dei casi dove delle buone idee, realizzate bene, possono diventare una valida ragione per soffermarsi.\nNei panni di un archeologo, alla ricerca di una reliquia chiamata [i]seme della vita[/i], ci troveremo bloccati in una valle totalmente isolata dal mondo comune. Nei primi minuti di gioco, entreremo in possesso di un esoscheletro che ci permetter\u00e0 di correre pi\u00f9 veloce e saltare pi\u00f9 in alto del normale, nonch\u00e8 di cedere o acquisire energie vitali dagli esseri viventi. Come anticipato, lo scopo finale del gioco \u00e8 trovare la reliquia e naturalmente riuscire ad uscire dalla valle, nel frattempo per\u00f2 il nostro obiettivo sar\u00e0 raccogliere degli elementi come ghiande e medaglioni, i quali serviranno sia per procedere nel gioco, sia per aumentare (seppur indirettamente) la capacit\u00e0 energetica del nostro esoscheletro. Col tempo otterremo dei potenziamenti per poter eseguire il doppio salto, per poter correre sull'acqua, per camminare sulle pareti metalliche o per usare il rampino. Essendo il level design piuttosto curato, ci troveremo spesso ad usare ognuno di questi elementi, spesso anche in maniera combinata, durante la corsa.\nIn alcuni momenti, ci troveremo di fronte a dei nemici, con i quali dovremo combattere a mo' di sparatutto, colpendoli con le energie vitali che abbiamo accumulato. In caso di morte, sia essa dovuta ad un combattimento perso, sia essa dovuta ad un salto mal calcolato, verremo riportati in vita a scapito di flora e fauna circostanti. Dovremo quindi tenere d'occhio lo stato della natura, cos\u00ec da porre eventualmente rimedio ed allungarci quindi la vita. Ricordo difatti che oltre ad acquisire energia, possiamo anche cederla, riportando quindi in vita gli organismi.\nDato che anche l'occhio vuole la sua parte, Valley ha una grafica colorata, piacevole, e fluida la quale accompagna bene il ritmo di gioco. Sebbene gli effetti sonori non siano particolarmente curati, la musica \u00e8 gradevole ed anch'essa cambia dinamicamente da fase a fase.\nDato il recente sconto ed il prezzo piuttosto arrivabile, mi sento di consigliare Valley a chi ha il piacere di passare qualche ora (andiamo dalle 5 alla decina, a seconda di quanto ci si sofferma a cercare) con un gioco dinamico, ben fatto e che sa di nuovo.", "timestamp_created": 1503002917, "timestamp_updated": 1503002917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.589255", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34314454": {"recommendationid": "34314454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198731187122", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502999557}, "language": "dutch", "review": "Prachtige omgeving, goede bijpassende muziek, erg meeslepende en rustgevende game!", "timestamp_created": 1503000958, "timestamp_updated": 1503000958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34312717": {"recommendationid": "34312717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198406187372", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506460570}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is so good. i cant reccomend it enough, the story was interesting, great graphics, and easy mechanics. by far one of th best games ive played in a while.", "timestamp_created": 1502994609, "timestamp_updated": 1502994609, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34309109": {"recommendationid": "34309109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115177944", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512787071}, "language": "english", "review": "Good story\nFun movement\n\n\nGet while it's on sale", "timestamp_created": 1502982622, "timestamp_updated": 1502982622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34308706": {"recommendationid": "34308706", "author": {"steamid": "76561198337580280", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 78, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503005562}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6e38\u620f", "timestamp_created": 1502981310, "timestamp_updated": 1502981310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.539936", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34307758": {"recommendationid": "34307758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052804993", "num_games_owned": 652, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504956565}, "language": "russian", "review": "HELL YEAH!!

However, the game still had some flaws that might turn one away from purchasing the game.\nHere are the things that I felt were keeping me away from giving it a perfect review. Just like almost every game, this one has it's little qwirks and issues that bog it down.\nHere are the pros and cons of this game (in my opinion)\n\nPros:\n[list]\n    [*]Good Music (really immersive, helps you get into the right mood to play it.)\n    [*]The story is good. It keeps you interested in it while not trying to hard to do so.\n    [*]The graphics are appealing to look at and really makes you feel like you are in the enviornment\n    [*]The gameplay is pretty entertaining and is enjoyable to use all the gadgets on your L.E.A.F suit\n    [*]The voice acting is very believable.\n    [/list]\nCons:\n[list]\n    [*]No replayability value. Once you finish the story mode (roughly 3-4ish hours) there isn't really too much else to do. It's like watching a \"popcorn movie\" It's enjoyable to watch once, but after the first time, there isn't much else to see.\n    [*]You never feel any danger in the game. Throughout the entire game, I never died once. I actually would've had to try really hard to get myself killed, thus making the game a little bit boring, but not enough to pull me out of it.\n    [*]The story (while nice) is a little bit predictable. Don't get me wrong, there are still parts in it that kept me guessing, but the outcome of some of the supporting characters were pretty obvious and didn't really keep my attention.\n    [*]The game feels a little bit too short for it's price. I bought this game while it was on sale for 5$ and I felt like I got my moneys worth, however, if I bought it for 20$ I would feel pretty ripped off.\n    [*]The variations in enemies are pretty weak. There's really only 2 different types of baddies that you can encounter, each with one with a green variation on it. Also, every enemy seemingly only took 2 or 3 shots to kill. If it weren't easy enough already, their attacks are really easy to dodge, giving no real tention to the player while in combat.\n   [/list]\n [b] These Next Few Cons have minor spoilers. Be advised [/b]\n[list]\n  [*][spoiler]The ending of the game is pretty shitty. The big escape from SOMA is pretty exillerating, but once you actually escape, it's pretty boring. Sure it ends on a calm and peaceful note, but I felt like it should've had a little more. Like, what happens to your character? Does he stay in the valley? What happens?[/spoiler]\n  [*][spoiler]The final boss battle (and only boss battle) is VERY boring. It pulls the cliche of just making one of the enemies into a bigger version of itself for a boss. I'd be completely fine with this if it wasn't the only boss in the game, but alas, it is. To put more salt on the wound, the boss never really varies with it's attacks, making the actual fight very dull and easy to do. All you do is shoot it 3 times then dodge its attacks, repeat that a few times then you win.[/spoiler}\n[/list]\n\nIt might look like I hate this game due to the number of cons outweighing the pros, but I don't. I actually reccomend this game, but only buy it if it's on sale. If you don't have the money, watch a playthrough of it on youtube and you'll probably get the same experience. So if you're looking for a game with a nice story, pretty graphics, and interesting gameplay, I'd reccomend this game for you.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1502932412, "timestamp_updated": 1502932412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34283945": {"recommendationid": "34283945", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081126181", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502915800}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Bir y\u00fcr\u00fcme ko\u015fma similasyonu oldu\u011funu bilerek ald\u0131m fazla bir aksiyon,olay olmayaca\u011f\u0131n\u0131 bilerek ald\u0131m fakat bu kadar da beklemiyordum durmadan ayn\u0131 \u015feyleri yap dur bi oraya bi buraya  o kadar sade ve bo\u015f ki hele konusu ve hikyesi nedir ne de\u011fildir belli de\u011fil ama yi\u011fidi \u00f6ld\u00fcr hakk\u0131n\u0131 ver HAYATIMDA G\u00d6RD\u00dc\u011e\u00dcM EN \u0130Y\u0130 MANZARALARA sahip bir oyun b\u00f6yle bir manzaray\u0131 \u00f6mr\u00fc hayat\u0131mda ba\u015fka bir yerde g\u00f6remiyece\u011fim b\u00fcy\u00fck ihtimalle k\u0131saca \u00f6zet ge\u00e7mek gerekirse cennet'de ko\u015fma similasyonu diyebiliriz etrafta ku\u015flar c\u0131v\u0131ld\u0131yor geyikler ko\u015fu\u015fturuyor ye\u015fillik ba\u015f salm\u0131\u015f atmosfer harikayd\u0131 \u00e7evre alan harikayd\u0131 fakat bana karl\u0131sa steamdeki fiyat\u0131na de\u011fmez bir ka\u00e7 manzara i\u00e7in o kadar para d\u00f6k\u00fclmez bana kal\u0131rsa \n\nk\u0131sacas\u0131 m\u00fczik ve atmosfer iyi fakat geriye kalan her \u015fey rezil denecek kadar berbat", "timestamp_created": 1502916468, "timestamp_updated": 1502916468, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497537", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34283533": {"recommendationid": "34283533", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097117041", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502914824}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful story, great visuals and a stunning soundtrack make this game a complete experience.", "timestamp_created": 1502915015, "timestamp_updated": 1502915015, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34282773": {"recommendationid": "34282773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353152757", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502913628}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome Game", "timestamp_created": 1502912357, "timestamp_updated": 1502912357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34282478": {"recommendationid": "34282478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008520942", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515074496}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, would be better if it had a mod comunnity much like portal so we could make our own levels.

And you\u00b4re right with that.\nBut there are a few things, which I really wanted to mention that early.\n\nFirst: The atmosphere.\n\nStarting the game you will hear the soundtrack for the first time. If you\u00b4re not in the mood for exploring the wonderful designed world by then, you should question your purchase.\nStarting the game you will get a quick introduction into the story. I won\u00b4t tell you more than you get to know from the intro:\nYou are playing some kind of archeologist, who wants to find a mystical thing called \"lifeseed\". \nYour friend questions the existence of it, but you start an adventure to find the \"lifeseed\" in a small area in the Rocky Mountains.\nAnd I have to admit, getting out of the cave and seeing the eponymously valley for the first time got me pretty melancholic.\nThe visual presentation at all is pretty stunning and I like the style of the graphics, which made me wanting to see and explore the whole world.\n\nSecond: Gameplay and Exploration \n\nTalking about protagonists, you have to talk about world, since the main character seems to be pretty flat, which does not present an issue though, because the game does not want to feature an interesting and developing character. \n\nIn the beginning you will start in a cave, slowly searching for an exit. If you think this is a walking simulator and therefore feature a pretty slow pace, you are wrong. You are able to sprint around and the game does not force you to slowly wander through the world. After at most 30 minutes (depending on how many screenshots you will take and how much time you spend looking around) the feel of the game slightly changes with the introduction of the L.E.A.F. suit.\nIt allows you to run pretty damn fast and jump very high. You might think, this will destroy the atmosphere of such a game, but you're wrong. Featuring wide open areas, the abilities of being that fast will still feel flowy and won\u00b4t give you the illusion, that you\u00b4re some kind of super soldier like in other games with exo-suits.\n\nThird: Mechanics\n\nTalking about the game, you need to talk about some pretty unique mechanics.\nHaving the L.E.A.F suit doesn't only allow you to jump high and move fast, you are also able to give life to eg. dead trees or animals or take life from them. Giving life costs energy, which will be taken from your 8 energy bars, which you have from the beginning. After a maximum of 60 minutes and a bit of exploring, you are easily able to upgrade it and double the amount. \nThis does not make you feel like god, since you only have a few charges and  every decision you make has consequences.\n\nJumping into water, you will die. This is not definitive, though, as your suit revives you at the cost of draining life from the world around you. An indicator will show you the health of the world, with leaves on a branch. If you don\u00b4't have any leaf left, the world is dead and you won't be able to respawn (I was told so). Dying makes it necessary to give life to trees, which are dead to restore the health of the world.\n\nThis mechanics pretty got me, since I\u00b4m kind of into philosophy and it made the game more interesting for me.\n\nSo, here a short version of pros and cons:\n\n+dense atmosphere, supported by a\n+great soundtrack\n+visually great presented world\n+wants you to explore, but doesn't force you to do so\n+freedom of movement because of the suit\n+neat and unique gameplay mechanics, which give the game a\n+philosophical meaning\n\n-the story is kind of flat\n\nAs I did not see much of the game, I probably will edit my review and add some points.", "timestamp_created": 1502889841, "timestamp_updated": 1502889841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34275759": {"recommendationid": "34275759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166816716", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503477402}, "language": "german", "review": "Steam unter Linux eine Mischung aus \u00dcberraschung und \u00c4rgernis!\n\nWie auch z.B. bei Grid ist auch bei diesem Spiel wohl ein Workaround n\u00f6tig.\nBei mir wird die Farbe schwarz durch ein grelles rot ersetz, was das spielen unm\u00f6glich macht!\n\nDeswegen vorerst unter Linux NEIN DANKE!", "timestamp_created": 1502888340, "timestamp_updated": 1502888340, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34275386": {"recommendationid": "34275386", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055712441", "num_games_owned": 871, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502884606}, "language": "german", "review": "Valley ist ein First Person Jump and Run Game.\n\nDie Grafik hat mich wirklich umgehauen, aufgrund der Unity Engine.\nHier zeigt die Engine wirklich was sie drauf hat.\n\nDas Gameplay an sich ist sehr fl\u00fcssig und bietet aufgrund von Upgrades des L.E.A.F.

If you're reading this before you purchase, I would highly recommend you play through it once ignoring all collectables other than those in your path of story and environment exploration. My 100% itch had me rubbing against every wall and poking my head into areas I shouldn\u2019t even be able to get to trying to find the collectables and it destroyed the game immersion. The rewards for collecting them are nice but insubstantial so enjoy the game first and if you enjoyed it enough to keep playing, you can warp around the worlds at will to do the collection afterward.\n\nCombat felt highly unnecessary. If you know what a first person shooter is you are not likely to have any issue with any enemies you encounter. They are all fought and defeated in the same way making encounters feel like they are designed to slow down your progression rather than provide meaning or challenge. \n\nStill, I do recommend bounding through Valley if you get a chance. Its not a long game, maybe 6-8 hours if you don\u2019t do collection 10-14 to 100% it so go enjoy the view :)", "timestamp_created": 1502855208, "timestamp_updated": 1502855208, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34268779": {"recommendationid": "34268779", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002379108", "num_games_owned": 989, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502854508}, "language": "english", "review": "Super short, but super fun - get it on sale, though, it takes 3-5 hours to beat.", "timestamp_created": 1502854541, "timestamp_updated": 1502854541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34267566": {"recommendationid": "34267566", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969210027", "num_games_owned": 159, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502847572}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.

Because there are not one, neither two, but THREE parts you need to suspend disbelief into simultaneously.\n\nOne is the usual culprit, the plot.\n\nSecond is the setting. It's so farfetched, it is unbelievable.\n\nAnd third is the... Well, your primary game tool.\n\nSo let me elaborate (no spoilers here, because all of this is thrown in your face within the intro/tutorial taking first 5 minutes of the game):\n\nDuring the World War II, a lot of new unrelated to each other technology is invented and developed.\n\nAmong others, two tested and working pieces are an extreme mobility \"grasshopper\" exoskeleton and a weapon/device that could instantly and effortlessly kill any living organism by simply draining its life energy at any range, though line of sight is required (possibly -- this is a prototype after all), but moreover, can also revive dead organisms using that energy.\n\nWhat do you do? Oh, what to with duch a tech during the most intense war in the human history?.. The choice... The dilemma... Should it be mass-produced and put on a front line as personal weapon or on some robust chassis like a tank? Or maybe, the atrocity, put them on a few long range bombers and wipe a couple enemy's cities?..\n\nNo! The best answer is to slap one onto the other, even though the grasshopper suit does not need the energy leeched by that weapon (don't worry, we'll invent some ways to waste it), build 25 units and get some special forces soldiers train to hop around the obstacles not encountered in combat scenarios. To make it make any sense, we'll divide them into teams and run competitions. And have dozens or hundeds of engineers build obstacle courses for them -- so difficult that we'll have lots of these engineers die in the process or while maintaining them. (No attempt to revive them should be made. The life giving device is strictly for toying around.)\n\nAnd let's also do that in a super-secret area, under complete lock-down because we need them to hop around while we develop an immense yield bomb dwarfing any nuclear device, so we can obliterate to dust entire cities. With all their infrastructure, of course. Wait, our rivals at the Manhattan Project just did that? We won't stop until we build a bomb that can wipe an entire continent!!!\n\nBecause killing off just the population is pointless.

The only challenge comes from exploration, which is... not worth doing, really. All you can get is upgrades that you don't and will never need, and even the big secret the medallions unlock is... pitiful at best. And there's just... too much to explore without enough to find. And the crates you're looking for are very hard to spot normally, put them in these huge maps with lots of absurdly hidden secrets and good luck finding everything without a guide.\n\nThe game itself looks great, but also a little... bland. I don't know. Visually it's just kind of generic. Good-looking but that's about it. The soundtrack is good but some tracks end up playing too long when you slow down and explore, and they all loop pretty fast. The story is solid, mostly told through audio logs and notes, it's nothing special but it works for the game.\n\nOn the whole I would say, yeah, this is a decent game, but it also feels like a lot of wasted potential. And for $20, for what amounts to probably a 3-4 hour experience if you don't explore much, I'd definitely say wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1500966265, "timestamp_updated": 1500966265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33776985": {"recommendationid": "33776985", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992098956", "num_games_owned": 593, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500941547}, "language": "english", "review": "A beautiful game of just the right length and just the right amount of challenge.

mention a few here. \u00a0Separate sliders for Brightness, Look Sensitivity (how fast you turn), FOV (Field of View), Master Volume and Music Volume. \u00a0'Replay Narrative Elements' is an option, you can have subtitles or no, and you can choose whether you have a Male or Female voice/character!\n\nWe have an insta-travel [b]MAP [/b]with nine areas that we can jump to (once unlocked), although there are points in the story where this option is not accessible.\n\nYou can have up to four profiles at any given time, and saves are automatic, though spaced far apart. \u00a0The did-it-save-or-not issue is one I saw a lot when looking through reviews, so here is a [b]saving tip:[/b] Pull up the menu and choose 'Travel'. \u00a0If a new area hasn't shown up on the map, the game probably hasn't saved.\n\nI played with a controller, but I think that keyboard & mouse would be just as good... perhaps even better!\n\n[b]Sights and Sounds:[/b]\n\nI was immediately mesmerized by the intro music. \u00a0I just sat here with a mostly-blank title screen enjoying the instrumental for I don't know how long. \u00a0Simply beautiful! \u2665 As a matter of fact, I just turned on the soundtrack for background inspiration whilst I write this review.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=Xvg7c_kj-AA\n\nThe graphics, while not the best I've ever seen, are quite lovely. \u00a0I think that I took more screenshots in [i]Valley[/i] than in any other game I've played (except for Tomb Raider 2013 - that remains #1 on my... well... most of my lists ;D )\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\n\nThings don't make much sense in the beginning. \u00a0There is no interface, you can't jump or climb, it's just walking (or running) around looking at things. \u00a0It won't be long until you find your L.E.A.F. suit, and that's when your movement becomes truly free. \u00a0There is something so satisfying about running like a deer through the forest and jumping and soaring through the air as if you were born to fly. \u00a0It makes me smile just to think about it.\n\n[b]The Basics:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]The story progresses through a combination of notes that you find and audio tapes that play when you hit certain trigger points (You can't miss the audio files - you find them at the beginning of the game). \u00a0There are also occasional text popups as our character talks to him/herself, \u00e0 la [i]Ethan Carter[/i]... I think it's even the same font!\n[*]Your special suit allows you to collect energized orbs, which seem to spawn all over the valley\n[*]You have an ugradeable energy gauge with up to 24 cells, each of which has four power bars. \u00a0If you take a hit and lose a bar, collect an orb to replenish it\n[*]Your suit has the power to give life... and to take it. \u00a0The controls are pretty simple. \u00a0Walk, run, jump, give life (shoot), take life\n[*]Whenever you give life to something, there is a chance of getting one or more golden acorns (I will come back to those later). \u00a0You don't get acorns if [i]you're[/i] the one who killed the animal/foliage, so keep that in mind ;)\n[*]The valley itself has a life gauge in the form of a tree branch with leaves to the left of OUR energy gauge (top left).

What you need to do is shoot them with your \"giving life\" energy. \u00a0Here's a secret for those who would like a bit of an advantage during gameplay: [spoiler]Try jumping through an amrita swarm once you've quelled it... it will fill up four bars of power, and you can do so as many times as necessary to get to full power![/spoiler]\n\n[b]Collectibles and Upgrades:[/b]\n\nI've mentioned them a couple of times, so it's about time I listed them.\n[list]\n[*]Story element pages\n[*]8 \"Easter Egg\" pages (references to another game by this dev - you'll know them by the \"unintelligible sketchings\" popup that appears when you get close)\n[*]Golden Acorns (used to open \"acorn doors\")\n[*]Medallions (used to open pyramid doors)\n[*]L.E.A.F. suit upgrades (mostly found via normal story progression)\n[*]Power modules for L.E.A.F. suit\n[/list]\n[b]Quick Info:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]No real puzzles\n[*]Revival of our character comes at cost of living things around you\n[*]Can \"pull\" orbs to you by using the \"take life\" button - you don't have to physically touch them to collect\n[*]Collectible items will either glow or flash\n[*]The \"crosshairs\" symbol changes to reflect possible actions (see \"Crosshairs\" above)\n[*]Shooting enemies is not a primary - or even secondary - focus, so don't expect to spend a lot of time doing so\n[*]Some platforming required, including an area where you have to take action mid-air. \u00a0(Not as difficult as in [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i])\u00a0\n[/list]\n[b]Achievements:[/b]\n\nThere are 30 achievements to be had in [i]Valley[/i]. \u00a0Many come via story-progression, but you're going to have to work for some of them! \u00a0If you're an achievement-hunter like me, I definitely recommend checking out the list (or my spoiler), because if you're not careful, you could end up having to re-play the game. [spoiler]The achievement: \u00a0Immortality - Complete the game without the valley dying[/spoiler]\n\nWhen you play through a chapter, you have objectives that you need to complete listed in the top right corner... but [b]when you go back to re-play a chapter, it will tell you how many collectibles are left in that region![/b] \u00a0Bonus! \u00a0Be aware that achievements - like finding a certain item - won't show up on the list.\n\n[b]Final thoughts:[/b]\n\nValley is a glorified walking simulator with some shooting later in the game. \u00a0It's not going to be something that appeals to everyone. \u00a0Me? \u00a0I loved it. \u00a0The combination of music and visuals is enchanting, and the story was interesting enough that I wanted to keep playing to find out more. \u00a0My only disappointment is that I really would have liked to see an epilogue, but that aside, I had a lot of fun with this title, and will be going back in to get the rest of my achievements. \u00a0Definitely a new favorite.", "timestamp_created": 1500583429, "timestamp_updated": 1500583490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829426", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33679581": {"recommendationid": "33679581", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990505721", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 272, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500579494}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Excelente jogo, vc anda com um equipamente q te faz correr, saltar, e outras coisas muito rapidamente.

That's the quick review. Seriously though, wow! I have only 2 cons on this game: 1 - you can't customize your controls. It uses WASD which I know is the default a lot of people use but I prefer the arrow keys (I hate when the spacebar is the jump key also). 2 - I wish it was longer! Everything else about Valley is simply first-person, platformer fun (and I'm not a big fan of platformers). I had a blast finding the next upgrades for the suit to see what I could do next. My favorite upgrade was the speed rails. No, the double-jump. No, the grapple! Hell, they're all great fun! For those looking to avoid hard games, I'm a 50 year old man and I found it fairly easy to get used to the controls (even though I'd prefer using my arrow keys) and also not too difficult to understand where to go next. That's not to say this game is simple. While it's very easy to learn and find your way around, it does have some challenging areas.\nOk the graphics were great. Not particularly exciting when in underground (cave) areas but quite beautiful when outdoors with trees and grass moving around with the wind and water rippling. Sometimes the sunflares can be a bit bright; I only found 1 situation where that was a minor issue.\nThe sound was also very well done. When you get the suit, you can hear the sound of the shocks in the legs when you land. Between that and the graphics, it made for a realistic experience. The music in this game is beautiful and can sometimes lull you into thinking everything is okay. Though I don't know if the soundtrack is worth $25 bucks (most music CDs are around $10 bucks). \nAnyway, I had a blast playing Valley. Completed in 5 hours, so yes, very short game. I do hope they pursue a larger game and really extend usage of the leaf suit. There are tons of possibilities. Oh, and it's probably worth mentioning that you can probably spend quite a bit more time with the game than I did by exploring every corner.

The L.E.A.F suit is quite a lot of fun to run around in thanks to a few different features that you unlock as you play the game. For example, when running downhill, you pick up a lot of speed which allows you to jump enormous distances, which feels great to do and there are plenty of sections in the game that make full use of this, in which you fly through the pretty environments, jumping over huge lakes or chasms and flying between trees. Similarly, there's an upgrade that lets you pick up enourmous speed when running along certain rails, and there are nice, high-speed segments that make good use of that, as well. Other upgrades include the ability to walk on metal walls, a really nice, weighty grappling hook, and the ability to run on water for a time. It's fun, and fluid and for some God forsaken reason the devs decided it would be a good idea to ditch it for half of the game, and have you wander around the inside of some buildings. Those parts of the game are really very boring, and also lack a lot of the pretty visuals you get outside in the valley, where there a hills in teh distances, and huge expanses of water and so on. You do still have the suit, but you only make use of the large default jump distance.\n\nAnd this is why the game fails to be a proper parkour game or 3D platformer. Only half of the time is spent actually making use of it. And what time is spent making use of it is very linear and leaves very little to be explored. This is a game that could benefit from being more open. People say that about literally every game that is at all linear but in this case it is actually true. It can't be open world for the sake of the narrative, but more large, open, explorable spaces is a must, and it doesn't have them.\n\nAs for the puzzles, they pretty much consist entirely of collecting some things to open a few optional doors, and shooting the right trees (which glow, so you can't miss them) in order to open up some other doors. Incredibly shallow, and clearly only there to spice things up slightly. But unfortunately, all they succeed in doing is slowing the game down more, which, as I've said, makes the game boring. \n\nThe atmosphere of the game is fairly competant. There is a nice contrast between the bright, vibrant outdoor valley segments, and the cramped, dark, industrial, and even menacing power plants and other human-built areas. The music, which is generally rather good, also helps to enhance this, particularly in the outdoor areas, where it is quite reminiscent of more light-hearted action-adventure titles like Zelda. Unfortunately, the music in the indoor sections is a lot more forgettable, and in fact, quite a lot of these parts have no music at all, which just serves to make them yet more dull. \n\nIn terms of the storytelling in the game....chances are you won't give a shit. It takes place many years before your character comes to the valley, at the height of World War 2, and is told to you through audio recordings in your suit from a couple of characters who were at the facilities in the valley at the time, as well as some optional notes that you find in boxes you can open, and on random tables and what have you. It blends together a sort of mythology with a fairly generic anti-war and environmentalist slant. It's nothing groundbreaking, but some people may enjoy it more than I did. There's a fairly respectable amount of content if you're willing to spend some time looking around for the notes. \n\nThe game also has combat. Sort of. It's bad.\n\nIn terms of the gameplay and story elements, it's an ok game. Some will probably really enjoy it, and even those who find themselves bored by the story and slower moments will probably enjoy the faster, platforming sections quite a lot. However, there is one major flaw that stems from a very fundamental system in the game that makes me unable to recommend this game. The L.E.A.F suit requires an energy source called amrita to function, which you can extract from living things (which kills them) or find in glowing orbs around the place, of which there are bloody millions. And the devs of this game thought it would be a great idea to make this energy come in the form of bright blue light. And if, like me, you have pussy eyes, the constant flashing that happens any time you do damn near anything in this game, will hurt your eyes, or even give you a headache after more than maybe 30 minutes playing. For me this is a deal breaker, and in fact I haven't even finished the game because every time I play it I end up with a headache and feeling nauseus. If you have slightly less sensitive eyes, you'll probably be fine, but if not, avoid this game. \n\nNow all that aside, here is how I would improve this game: remove the bright lights, or at least dim them significantly. This is, for me, the most important aspect, since I don't like being in pain just from playing a game. On top of that, however, I think this game would be at its best if it were an action game, probably a first person shooter, that uses the L.E.A.F suit  systems to make a fast-paced, frantic shooter, which makes use of wide open spaces. I honestly think that would be a very fun game indeed, but unfortunately this is what we got instead. \n\nTL;DR: Competant, but uninspiring linear platformer with fun, fast open sections, and boring, slow, restricted sections. The story is environmentalist and anti war, ad will appeal to those with similar leanings. Abundance of overly bright, flashing lights will probably give some users a headache. If you are usually unaffected by lights like these, it might be worth picking up on sale (it was 75% off in the Summer 2017 sale), but if not, avoid, it's not good enough to be worth the discomfort.", "timestamp_created": 1499717151, "timestamp_updated": 1499717151, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501953", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33437610": {"recommendationid": "33437610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260297637", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 368, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515170553}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has nice visuals and interesting story, but is a little bit short", "timestamp_created": 1499711552, "timestamp_updated": 1499711552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487805", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33437235": {"recommendationid": "33437235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198240463230", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500761717}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Umas das melhores trilhas sonoras que j\u00e1 ouvi em jogos.

I never considered myself a massive fan of them, but I definitely had some fun with them; especially 2, 3, and Sonic & Knuckles. The really fun parts for me were where you're running at high speeds, making long jumps, clearing huge sections of the level. However, unless you're really good at the game, most of the time, you'll be moving pretty slowly through the levels, except for those brief, high-speed, sometimes-scripted segments. Valley, on the other hand, offers to let players move at those high speeds at almost all times, making wild jumps, with cool suit upgrades that let you do even more than that. This is where Valley shines. It's those brief Sonic the Hedgehog moments, that I wished could last for significant lengths of time, that Valley accentuates and stands to rival this particular sensation for me from those older Sonic games.\n\n[h1]Hidden persistent upgrades...in a game almost exclusively designed around running and jumping fast from A to B...[/h1]\nUnfortunately, Valley has other features which are self-defeating when it comes to that potential. As much good as it does for offering high-speed gameplay, Valley contains health upgrades and what equate to keys for doors, often hidden out of the way in little boxes. To find many of these, you need to deliberately [i]stop[/i] moving at those fun, high speeds, instead wandering around, slowly and carefully searching everywhere, because the developer literally sticks some of these upgrades in some of the places you will be encouraged to zip by at the highest speeds possible in-game. Each time I started to get a big smile from exciting music, running fast, and pulling off cool jumps, I would spot another box I needed to screech to a stop to open, or worse yet, a cluttered area I would need to run around and search high and low, looking for crates to open. The game tries to be really fun, but the hidden crates do everything they can to interrupt that fun.\n\nNow, do you [i]need[/i] the hidden crates? No. Honestly, you don't. I'm not very good at games, and you don't need that many health upgrades. However, I didn't know one way or the other, starting the game out fresh. From what I now know, I would say that if you plan on playing this game and you can set aside the urge to go trying to find all of the crates, then you can probably have a good time by just opening crates and grabbing goodies you see while you run along. Don't explore at all. So to clarify: you're running, see a crate or unlockable door, grab it/go in, and then keep going after collecting the stuff. The momentum in this game is so fun, but these constant slow-downs were not.\n\nAlso, unlike some Metroidvanias (Dust, Shadow Complex, the Batman Arkham series, etc.), nothing tells you \"Hey, there's a secret somewhere in the area,\" or anything like that. You will actually have to run around, manually checking pretty much everywhere in a game where you cover many square miles of distance. I reiterate: unless searching for tons of hidden items that won't do you much good and don't feel like they really have a worthwhile payoff is something you love, just don't bother searching. Just grab goodies when you come across them, and life will be good. If I'd done that, I might have had a pretty good time with Valley, but as it is, the fun was spoiled thanks to all the stops and long searching.\n\n[h1]Clever Audio Logs...Not-So-Clever Documents[/h1]\nThe story is mostly told through audio logs, which is [i]brilliant[/i], because you can keep moving and listening while running along through the environment, and I thought the voice acting was well done. However, similar to what they did with upgrades, the developer put notes in crates, on the floor, on tables, and on walls, which have multiple lines of text for you to read. I would [i]love[/i] this in a slow-paced game like an older Resident Evil game, or the newer RE7, but not in Valley. This is a pretty game with pretty music, and it's fun using the L.E.A.F. suit to run fast and make crazy jumps, etc. Puttering around slowly looking for notes isn't all that fun, and though you obviously don't have to, you would be missing out on a wealth of lore. I think much of this lore could've been turned into audio logs for the voiced characters to discuss with slight changes to their voices (voice actors can do different voices, typically, of course). When the game has you stop or slow down, things like objects in the world and your perspective height being mismatched (you should be about 7 feet tall or so in the suit) kinda start to stand out.\n\nI will say, however, that there is [i]one[/i] room right after a big battle (there is only one \"big battle\" in the game in my opinion), which I do highly recommend taking your time to look around, read the notes, and look at everything. I found it pretty unsettling and well-done. Other than that, though, run like mad when you can to have the best experience.\n\n[h1]Zelda had the Hookshot. Valley has the Hookshit.[/h1]\nThe last thing I need to discuss is the grappling hook, also known as the \"viper coil.\" It's basically the hookshot from Zelda games if it was possibly the worst grappling hook to ever appear in a video game. There were many times I would perfectly grapple, get yanked toward my target, and not quite reach it. There didn't seem to be much rhyme or reason as to whether or not I would reach my destination, but I had many quantum deaths caused by this, and didn't really do anything differently on the times I was successful. It was a crapshoot whether or not the grapple would give me enough momentum. I tended to have better luck when standing perfectly still sometimes, and while running at average speed others. There wasn't much rhyme or reason to it, and dying when you didn't do anything wrong is pretty aggravating.\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1]\nI really wanted to enjoy Valley, and there were [i]moments[/i] that I did. However, the rubbish grappling hook and the game's built-in mechanic of hidden upgrades and notes to read slows down that glorious momentum each time the game tried to present something that would otherwise be really fun to do.

Flying through the air is a bunch of fun, and when you get to high speeds the movement feels really good. There are some really cool ideas here, like granting life and running on walls, that would have been really interesting in a bigger game with more going on. But here they feel more like a proof of concept. That was a lot of the game really, it didn't seem to go anywhere. It introduced some very basic combat, but then made it easier to just run past enemies. Despite the minimal combat, there was a big end boss that felt like it was out of a totally different game. \n\nThe movement in the game is really fun and feels great when it gets going, but there's not much else to the thing. Any time you don't have momentum it feels sluggish and dull, which makes exploring for collectables feel like a chore. There also really isn't much of a challenge to the game, it's mostly just moving through the levels, with the occasional confusing design choice that gets you killed or a quick and simple puzzle to keep moving. It's not quite simple enough to be a walking simulator, but not complex enough to stand out outside of the genre. Especially with a story this weak. The voice acting is a very mixed bag, ranging from decent to cringe-worthy. The acting itself isn't helped by bad recordings, poor audio editing, some writing that's fairly poor in places, and a story that isn't all that interesting. They have so little faith in their own material, they often have text pop up on screen to explain the audio tape you just heard in case you stopped paying attention.\n\nI'm probably being too hard on this game. It does certain things very well and it's quite pretty. But it doesn't really know what it wants to be, cribbing the plasmid tutorials from Bioshock, a pointless opening sequence reminiscent of SOMA, level design out of Temple of Doom, it's aesthetically all over the place. It's not worth full price when it's only three hours long, but if you like the look you could get plenty of value on sale.

I played it primarily with an XBox One controller over the Steam Link on my 50\" TV and the whole experience was just awesome.  No, it's not a difficult game, but it's beautiful, the game mechanics are fun, and the story is well done. It reminds me somewhat of A Story About My Uncle in that both titles use unique game mechanics (although they both share grapple hook gameplay) and tell the story little by little as you make your way across the map.  Valley is a very linear game--there's really only one way forward  but you are rewarded a bit by exploring the maps.  The voice acting is solid as is the music.  Graphics are often far above average, but can also be rather boring  in spots.  Specifically, some outdoor areas that you are meant to run through scale back the detail in order to focus you on the correct path forward.  Likewise, once inside some facilities, the rooms often blend together because they contain the same desks, etc.  That is, however, a small criticism because the majority of the graphics are superior--unique, imaginative, and authentic--giving a real sense of \"place\" and enhancing the atmosphere.\n\n\nThe only real complaint I have is that when you exit a game, you are generally forced to replay a portion of the mission unless you previously quit at the very beginning of a mission.  It's not a big deal, it just annoyed me slightly.\n\nThis title normally sells for $20, and at that price you probably want to wait for a sale.  It's not that the game isn't worth it, but it certainly isn't a AAA title, and it is rather short.  Replay value is questionable and the main draw is to just collect items you might have missed.

I appreciate that most surfaces you can reach by jumping are accesible. There are some rocks that are at the edges of the map where you fall inside them, but most places are walkable. It made exploring fun and the environments not feel purely cosmetic (take notes Firewatch). I was glad to learn that there was voice acting as well. Choosing what gender your main character is was interesting, but I was expecting there to be more a difference other than vocal grunts when moving around. The story was a been there done that kind of one. The military finds a source of something, exploits it, and mother nature steps in to reclaim its territory. I wish that it was a little more fleshed out though. I thought the speaking portions were good enough to give you the main parts, but I felt that the notes scattered around did little to expand on the plot. However, I enjoyed this game overall. Movement felt fluid and the length was what I expected.\n\nThe back end of Valley gets spooky I must say. I found myself getting pretty scared at parts. And THERE IS A PRETTY LEGIT JUMPSCARE.

None of these elements really go together for me, though I keep hoping it will click at some point.\n\nThe running and jumping mechanics on their own are really fun, but they are coupled with an energy mechanic that makes you want to do these cool actions as infrequently as possible. Speaking of the energy mechanic, you actually almost always have enough, due to the energy orbs being spread out everywhere - and you can always find a tree to bleed dry. The energy both makes the core mechanic less fun, and feels inconsequential on it's own. The scenery is beautiful - but the art design makes it hard to read the environments and determine where to go. It is also difficult to find the objects you are trying to collect, and I always feel like I have missed something. But then, it turns out you almost always have enough of the items when you get somewhere that needs them (which is rarely).\n\nThe story is not very engaging either. I would think learning about this secluded valley and what the army was doing there would be interesting, but there are no characters worth mentioning, and not much of a story really. It's all exposition. To make matters worse, even if you ignore the narrative, the beautiful environment fails to tell a story of it's own. You collect your upgrades from glorified ammo crates that were left there for no discernable reason.\n\nI wanted to like it, especially after the opening and the jaw-dropping reveal of the lush valley, but the more I played, the more annoyed I got.

I've been suffering from depression for a nice chunk of my life because of a life event I refer to as \"ghost\". A lot came from it, like suicidal thoughts, severe paranoia, depression, and more. I found gaming as an escape and started getting games off Steam once I got my new laptop for Christmas. Valley was one of the ones where I just glanced at it, and instantly bought it. I started playing this when I was going through some pretty heavy times. I saw Valley as an escape into an beautiful unknown world, and I absolutely enjoyed it. One day I sat down, and thoughts flooded my mind as the game was starting up. My aunt passed away weeks before, my dog was sick, my uncle died around the time I started playing Valley, and a whole lot of other things. The sadness just hit me like a tsunami. I just kind of sat there trying not to cry. Then the menu song started to play. It honestly never felt so good to cry and break down like that. After I was done, I started playing for a bit. Just seeing the Daemons play made me smile. I was at ease. I was happy. I absolutely loved the lore and storyline. I loved everything in it, from the beautiful graphics and landscape, to the random deer you'd find, all the way to the incredible creativity and concept of the game. I had to reset my laptop because it got a virus, so I plan on playing again soon so I have it finished again. I'd relive the journey in Valley over and over again. I love this game so much. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: My baby brother was born today 7/10/17. But I lost my bestest friend, Ginger. Me and that dog have been through so much together.

The story was good, but I feel like there was a lot of build up for little payout, but it was still remarkable. The whole backstory to the Valley is quite interesting, and it left me feeling hungry for more. Some concepts in the game work incredibly well, like the life give/take. Some things don't work well. Like using the same system for combat, and having your health and ammunition as the same bar. Some things become natural feeling, like using the jump to go across entire rivers and crevices(Though never ceases to be amazing). Some things? Not so much. Like running on water, which felt like it was introduced late and then was used very little, only in like 3 scenes. Then, in the end section, you cannot use them to simply run on water.

Definitely worth buying on sale (as I did), probably worth buying at full price\n\nIt's a first-person adventure-exploration-platforming game about jumping really high and running really fast. In that sense, it's a fantastic game, a lot of fun. The environments are beautiful, the platform puzzle/challenges have been challenging but forgiving (so far), and exploration has been fairly well rewarded with extra energy cell things. I wish things were a little lighter/brighter--turning the brightness up leaves things washed out, but too low and it's kind of hard to see things and really enjoy the environments (and see the side paths that lead to the bonus stuff).

It's also one of the very, very few games I've started for the first time and completed it in one sitting, about 6'ish hours.\n\nMy take on the game, and maybe I'm wrong--I haven't read other reviews on it--but I see Valley as a reminder of the harmful effects industry and the \"pursuit of progress\" can have on the environment, both flora and fauna. It also was a reminder that absolute power corrupts absolutely.\n\nNow, the information--mostly by Virginia since she's the anthropologist--about the statues in the valley and the other observations she mentioned along the way I'm still puzzling out in regards to how it relates to the Pendulum project. I'm not completely sure there IS a relation; it could just be circumstantial. Whether or not Andrew Fisher knew the place he set up Soma and Astra was considered sacred by the ancient civilization(s?) that lived in that area, BEFORE he set those facilities up, I'm not completely sure.\n\nRegarding the gameplay....for the most part it felt like a game of exploration, with the creatures you had to pacify being the only \"combat.\" However, I believe they were just put there to be another obstacle to consider, but there could have been more diversity.\n\nThere were a few bugs I found along the way, too, primarily the music sometimes would stop for long stretches of time and then start back up. Or it would start and never end when it should have ended. Once there were two soundtracks going at the same time and it had me wondering if maybe a webpage I had open was playing music. Other bugs I encountered was clipping almost entirely through large boulders when accelerating at greater speeds and acorns that could not be picked up.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys exploration and beautiful scenery.

Later on you gain the ability to latch onto hooks in the air that assist in traversing large gaps. Ultimately you get the ability to run on water for short periods, which is sparsely used towards the end of the game. There is no challenge in any of these activities and nothing complex or requiring of ingenuity or a mixture of gameplay elements to proceed.\n\nSo what's the draw? Quit simply; running. The game has a fantastic sense of speed and acceleration --- it's like Sonic the Hedgehog but in first person. The enjoyment doesn't come from any intricate plot, or complex game mechanics that are used ingenously. Rather, it's all about running really fast and doing so often. The developers punctuated the whole experience with a beautiful Nordic soundtrack that plays during certain portions which makes it all feel whimsical. A strange sort of game whereby the enjoyment and draw is more about fiddling with a game mechanic more than anything else. It's almost like a rollercoaster: you're there for the ride. And it's an enjoyable ride that doesn't overstay its welcome. Much like mirrors edge there's no challenge per-se; it's all about running and experiencing a sense of speed. \n\nSpeaking of Mirrors Edge; this title also suffers from unnecessary combat implemented into the game. It's not a big deal since the fights aren't long and you can run past the few, sparse enemies there are. But there's a half-assed boss fight towards the end that feels completely out of place, much like all the combat in Mirrors Edge. Just because your game is in first person doesn't mean it needs to also be a shooter. \n\nThe game also has a mechanic which allows you to give life or take life away from the environment around you, but it serves no purpose other than making the forest look nice and placing life back into the surroundings, which is displayed as a health gauge. Once the gauge reaches zero its game over. What does a game over look like? I honestly don't know and doubt that at least half the fanbase does either since it isn't a difficult game. Overall its another pointless mechanic that, with some fleshing out, might prove useful but otherwise does nothing of any significance. \n\nI'll also lambast the use of audio tapes: I liked them in Bioshock since they were audio files left about that characters left behind. There was no exposition: you might find an audio file belonging to a character that begins mid-sentence and he is speaking of characters you know nothing about. It's up to you to piece all the information together and understand what's going on. Valley on the other hand uses audio files as exposition, which doesn't make any sense. Have you ever recorded something for yourself or left a note for yourself that begins with you explaining who you are, what you do, the year and date, and what your occupation is? It's incredibly lazy. I'm tired of audio files since no one seems to understand how to properly use them as a narrative device. It's just another way of having a character talk whom isn't on-screen.\n\nMy complaints aside; this is a 5 hour game (max) that is all about experiencing a sense of speed across lush environments. There is no real challenge to any of this, it's like a rollercoaster: it's about experiencing it. It feels slightly experimental in that there are a lot of good ideas here that I'd like to see fleshed out. If some challenge was included and more of the experience was about picking up speed and maintaining it (much like in Sonic Generations) then I can see this game's length being extended. Otherwise, the game is enjoyable enough and doesn't overstay it's welcome. If there was ever a title that was made for VR, this is it.\n\nAnd on that note I'll also say that this game is one of those where graphical fidelity matters. So if you have a toaster I'd pass on it. I'll also say that it's worth nowhere near 20 dollars-10 dollars tops. Get it if you want to experience speed in beautiful environments punctuated by a wonderful soundtrack.

The \"rails\" section was probably the most fun.

It's a crying shame that I didn't play this gem sooner.\n\nThe gameplay is all about momentum. Remember the feeling of running down a hill as a kid? Well this game is the imitation of that feeling in video game form. It's actually quite similar to sonic in many ways, but I could say it tags a lot of games in terms of how it \"feels\" (Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Bioshock, SOMA, A Story About My Uncle, Portal, the list could go on...)\n\nI should make it clear that this game is less of a challenge and more of an experience. You probably won't find any area too difficult and the \"combat\" consists of pointing and shooting enemies with energy. If you die, you respawn, but you are held accountable for retaining your [strike]sonic rings[/strike] orbs and keeping the forest alive... The game will explain how that works. Also, my advice would be to explore, but not too much... The game encourages you to really go out of your way sometimes when it's obvious, but other times I found myself climbing a mountain that I suppose I actually wasn't supposed to climb... Getting out of the map essentially. If the developer wants you to go somewhere, they won't make it so difficult that you have to die 10 times to get there...

It's proof that honing in on a good mechanic can make a great game, even if all the pieces aren't the best. Jumping through the air, like I'm in an Ang Lee film, feels so good! The thud sound you hear when you land feels so realistic. It's worth a purchase just to experience that feeling.\n\nBut that's not the only thing Valley does right. There's enough exploration to keep you in wonder and discovery for hours. The game looks realistic, albiet a little too brown at times. This game also lends itself to speedrunning quite well. There's a good blend of skill and luck that keeps the game fresh, even when you backtrack to find that last medallion. \n\nAnother cool thing I'd like to give kudos for is the day/night cycle in this game. Time moves as you move through the various sections. It feel natural, unlike most games day/night where every 10 or 15 minutes it just changes. \n\nYou owe yourself the experience Valley has to offer!\n\nMinor Spoiler:\n[spoiler]If you had told me this game was about Wendigos, finding Slender Man posters, and paranormal events, I would not have purchased it. I've always found those games woeful. There's jump scares or lots of walking around in the dark.

Firstly, as some of the other reviews have expressed this isn't so much of a game as it is an experience. This game is meant to be played with a good pair of headphones, in a dark room, on a nice machine, alone. This isn't a game to chat with the boyz in discord while you play. \n\nThe graphics are fantastic, and the in game narrative is not only interesting, but in my opinion extrememly well voice-acted. \nFinding the in game notes lying around only adds to an, ableit short, but fantastic plot line. [spoiler] I think the idea of a separate secret government project going on alongside the Manhattan project is so interesting, and plausible. Definitely not so sci-fi, but all the same [/spoiler] There is much more depth to this game than you would imagine if you stop to look around and explore, which is much more difficult than you think. It's a ingenious formula they've created to make you want to speed through the game, but simulataneously make you feel bad for not stopping to take it all in and explore. It's a feeling I haven't had playing very many games. \n\nThe soundtrack is top notch, although I agree with other reviews that it is disappointing it only plays the first time you enter an area and never plays upon returning. \n\nThis game is a must play in my opinion. I picked it up for 8 bucks on sale and It was 8 dollars well spent. Hell I spent countless amounts of money on my last girlfriend and she still cheated on me after 3 years.

The environments are pretty enough, but again: The path is linear, and there are no puzzles or challenges.

The areas are really pretty, and sometimes quite memorable. But honestly, that's all there is to this game.\nIf the story was really inspirational, or if the level design had actual gameplay in mind, or if there was some kind of challenge of any kind, this game would be recommendable.\nBut props to the people who designed the visuals.

Even with an incredibally short play time, it was easily worth the sale price that I got it for, though I'd even pay full price. While short, it is an extremely well crafted masterpiece. However, keep in mind, this is much more of a subjective review. It is an amazing game to me, but I can see it as having a somewhat niche audience, so it may not be this incredible to you.\nAlso, please beware, this is an extremely long review. However, it will give you a good idea of if the game is for you. Also, there is a tl;dr pros and cons at the end of the review if you don't feel like reading all of it.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nFor the most part, it looks really good. Yeah, it's not amazing, and someparts show that, but it conveys what it means to in a visual appealing way. It looks good enough. A large part here is the landscapes. There were a few times in the game where I would come out of a cave or small passage way, and I would be greated with incredible landscape shots of mountains, forests, rivers, and fields, with some small animals running along. This, combined with the mix of old and new ruins, sometimes creates breathtaking shots that I won't soon forget in video games. \nThe graphics could be improved, but they still look good.\n\nSound: 8/10\nThe sound in this game...it's just so good. First of all, the sound effects are very well done. They create a good atmosphere that's a mix between natural and artifcial. Sometimes that makes me feel calm, while also slightly nervous. What really shines here though, even through that, is its soundtrack. The soundtrack here is beautiful. One of the best video game soundtracks I've heard. It just creates so much atmosphere. Of course the beautiful main menu piano piece is just amazingly played. But throughout, there's always perfect music for the occasion to create the best situation. When you first start out with the L.E.A.F. suit, and you're running through hills and forests with animals around you, the music has such a feeling of discovery, and almost child-like amazment. In high contrast, crawling through small shafts and abandoned facilities has music that just creates a sense of anticipation and fear. \nAll together, very atmospheric music, and great sound design.\n\nStory: 7/10\nThis is where I feel the game suffers the most. The story isn't bad by any means. However, it is pretty predictable at a lot of points, and the end feels a bit rushed. Also, some of the voice recordings you discover can sometimes feel fake and forced. However, they convey the story in a unique sense. Yes, there's your story, however, the main story is actually in the past. As you move along, you find voice recordings and notes that tell what happened in the ruins a long time ago. Instead of you being the main character, you slowly find notes that tell another person's story as you try to finish what they started. The notes are delivered in small doses, so you don't have to do to much reading at once, and the voice recordings are pretty straight forward, and they're easy to play and listen to at the same time. \nI think the biggest pitfall here is that it wasn't long enough. It was paced well, but it took me about 3 hours to finish the first time. I will be playing through it again, and there were some optional paths and branches that I could have taken but didn't, but overall, it dissapoints me how such an amazing game has such a small play time.\nStill, fairly well-written story, if a bit short, and delivered in a unique way.\n\nMovement Mechanics: 9/10\nThe gameplay mechanics in this game are really what made me go through it so fast. It was just so fun that I had to keep going. They aren't anything too unique, but combined with the location, landscapes, and music, it creates a experience I haven't felt in another game. Basically, you have a suit that allows you run really fast and jump really high, and you gradually find upgrades (like grappling hooks) to help you find different ways through the enviroment. What really makes this amazing though is the momentum mechanic. Basically, if you are running down hill, based on how steep it is and how long you're running, you'll start building up speed. Once you jump, you can end up going hundreds of feet into the air, and allows you to jump much farther. It's just so satisfying to do, and really gorgeous to see at times. Whether you're running through a forest, and flying into the air, greeted with a beatiful landscape beneath you, or sprinting through a mineshaft, suddenly launching into a wide open underground compartment, the feeling of being able to jump so high and run so fast is a feeling I haven't really come across before.\n\nCombat Mechanics: 5/10\nThe combat in this is game is bad. Now, the reason for this is because it is very sparse, and not at all the point of it. However, if you want deep or fun combat, this is not for it. It generally just consists of running around and shooting something a couple times so it explodes. There isn't even a dedicated weapon. It really is boring, but can add a little bit of challenge and stress to get your blood pumping. However, like I said, it's ok. You don't come across it very often, and it's not at a focus of the game. It's really mainly there just to add some danger.\nHowever, something in here that is somewhat related is the life and death mechanic. Basically, you have the ability to kill things, or keep it alive. This isn't used too often, but it is interesting. Basically, the Valley has \"health\". If it loses too much, it dies. It can lose health in a couple ways. One way is if you die (I'll talk about that in a minute), but another way is if you steal it's health. Basically, you can use your \"weapon\" to steal life from trees and plants and use that for energy, which you use to do things like double jump and use your grappling hook. However, you can also use your \"weapon\" to give life back to the plants, and restore it's health. It really creates an interesting affect of balancing how much energy you need, and needing to keep the Valley alive. This leads into my next point.\n\nLife and Death Mechanics: 8/10\nBasically, when you die, you'll immediately respawn almost exactly where you died. No checkpoints, nothing. You just respawn. However, they've added another things that makes death bad, which is pretty unique. I won't go through all of it to not give away spoilers, but, when you die, the Valley loses health. Die enough times, and the Valley dies. Now, I haven't done that, so I'm not sure what would happen. But, this creates an insentive not to die a lot. You can restore the Valley's health, but you have to use your energy, which you don't get back when you die (you have to find sources of energy). So, it's a nice risk, that dying can have potentially permenent affects on your surroundings.\n\nOverall Experience: 9/10\nOverall, this game to me is amazing. It has such an immersive atmosphere that I've thoroughly enjoyed playing in. While relying more on platforming and movement than combat, it has a story that, while somewhat predictable, is still easy to get sucked into, and amazing, fun mechanics.\n\ntl;dr\n\nPros:\n-beautiful landscape shots\n-amazingly done soundtrack and sound design\n-unique storytelling mechanic\n-amazingly fun movement and platforming\n-interesting life and death system\n-a very immersive experience\n\nCons:\n-graphics pretty average\n-predictable story\n-rushed ending\n-bad combat \n\nOverall, a great, immersive game with fun mechanics and a great soundtrack, but nothing too innovative, and it really appeals to a certain group up people.", "timestamp_created": 1497731762, "timestamp_updated": 1497731762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529746", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32516751": {"recommendationid": "32516751", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030829184", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498257043}, "language": "german", "review": "Das Spiel ist eher ein Erkundungsspiel mit Story und Jump'n Run Einlagen und ein wenig (jugendfreiem) anspruchslosem Geballer. \n\nMacht schon Laune mit dem Exoskelett durch die Pampa zu fetzen und zu h\u00fcpfen.\nDer Anzug wird nach und nach aufgewertet mit neuen Features und damit kann man sp\u00e4ter sogar nochmal zu vorherigen Lokationen reisen um noch Extras zu suchen. Und als ich mit Magnetschuhen an Metallbahnen an der Wand entlang gelaufen bin hat das wohlige Erinnerungen an Prey (das alte) hervorgehoben. Sehr sch\u00f6n. \nDie sensible Story mit der Lebensenergie und dem \"Lifeseed\" ist auch nett und mann m\u00f6chte immer wissen wie die Story weiter geht. \n\nDie auftauchenden Gegner sind leider keine echte Herausforderung. Wenn man mal stirbt dann weil man in den Sprungeinlagen mal in den Abgrund oder ins Wasser f\u00e4llt (Schwimmen ist nicht mit Exoskelett).\n\nDie Mechanik mit der Lebensenergie verspricht leider auch mehr als sie sp\u00e4ter h\u00e4lt. Enegiemangel hatte ich jedenfalls nie, auch weil die \"Energiekugeln\u00a7 immer wieder respawnen. Hier h\u00e4tte man noch etwas an der Balanceschraube drehen k\u00f6nnen. Es macht zwar Laune st\u00e4ndig tote B\u00e4ume neu zu beleben aber das macht man eigentlich nur um diese goldenen Eicheln zu sammeln die man dadurch bekommt und mit denen man dann antike T\u00fcren \u00f6ffnen kann. \nDer Endboss war als einziger Gegner ein wenig anspruchsvoll. H\u00fcbsche Angriffsanimationen da \u00fcbrigens. Aber selbst dort bin ich nicht wirklich in Bedr\u00e4ngnis geraten.\nDie \u00fcblichen \u00fcberall herumligenden Notizen welche zur Story beitragen haben mich allerdings schon irgendwann ein klein wenig genervt weil das einen immer wieder aus dem Spielfluss herausrei\u00dft. Meinetwegen \u00fcberall Audiologs verteilen (Die gibt es auch zur Hauptstory) aber ich will hier nicht st\u00e4ndig stehen bleiben um Notizen von irgendwelchen Leuten zu lesen.

Or a few more playthroughs.\n\nThe combat is simple yes but sometimes you will be overwhelmed with enemies so it does enhance the combat to some extent, but I think that this isn't the focus of the game so if you're looking for strong combat then I wouldn't recommend it but it is a nice change from heavy combat mechanics and games which I personally like.\n\nOverall I loved this game more than anything I played, it is short, but there is quite a bit of replayability with the medallions and acorn doors and I just know I've missed loads of content and boxes in the game so I'll definitely be replaying a few times not only for that, but just for the atmospherics of this game. I highly recommend it if you like these sort of games although I haven't come across anything like this yet.\n\nBy the end of the game you'll start to want to revive every tree and animal you see, you get attached", "timestamp_created": 1497565422, "timestamp_updated": 1511379023, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32445049": {"recommendationid": "32445049", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993657118", "num_games_owned": 315, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497547204}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game that somehow passed me by when it came out.

You might notice my strikingly minimal hours put into the game, but disregard that because this game is short. It takes roughly no more than 2-3 hours to complete the game, and the 100% completion status isn't appealing to a general gamer such as myself. But, that's not this games highlight. Instead, this game focuses on areas of a game that some big triple a video games fail to develop: the experience. \n\nThis game has no multiplayer or co-op because it doesn't need one. It's game mechanics are one of the game's main highlights as you get to jump around and sprint all over a breathtakingly beautiful landscape. That's another thing this unity game is beauitiful. its level design is, while a little too linear and too hand-holding at times, it is still entertaining and enjoyable to go through. Could this game be more popular, than it could potentionally be a pretty fun game to speed run. The player progression is satisfying at best, and the difficulty of the game is negligible. Like I said, the game hand-holds the player sometimes. \n\nWhat I remember most fondly about this game, however, is OST. The way this game blends in a beautiful landscape or a fast paced area exploration to test out a new suit mechanic with the music is nothing short of perfect. It creates, as i mentioned before, an experience. It's one that can't be replicated the way this game handles it.\n\nI would highly reccomend this game to anybody with a few dollars to spend even if a game like this isn't exactly what you're used to.", "timestamp_created": 1497477269, "timestamp_updated": 1497477269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.558994", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32416107": {"recommendationid": "32416107", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068213204", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497822351}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most entertaining games I've played in a long damn time", "timestamp_created": 1497465770, "timestamp_updated": 1497465770, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479798", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32413520": {"recommendationid": "32413520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100064923", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 13, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497457166}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u4e4b\u524d\u73a9\u7684D\u7248\uff0c\u8bb2\u771f\u6e38\u620f\u5355\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4f46\u662f\u505a\u7684\u5341\u5206\u60ca\u8273\u5341\u5206\u826f\u5fc3\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6b21\u8d81\u7740\u6253\u6298\u5c31\u628a\u95e8\u7968\u4ea4\u4e0a\u4e86\uff0c\u4e0d\u7ba1\u600e\u4e48\u6837\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e4c\u6258\u90a6\u6784\u60f3\u7684\u67b6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c\u771f\u7684\u662f\u592a\u7f8e\u4e86\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4ee4\u6211\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u662f\u5730\u4e0b\u96a7\u9053\u7a7f\u7740\u673a\u7532\u5728\u94c1\u8f68\u4e0a\u5954\u8dd1\u8df3\u8dc3\u90a3\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u5341\u5206\u6fc0\u52a8", "timestamp_created": 1497457230, "timestamp_updated": 1497457230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32412073": {"recommendationid": "32412073", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326023938", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 86, "playtime_forever": 1850, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503248911}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a nice game - it is for 99% of the time very chilled out - but what is it?\nwell its a parkour sort of game. Exploration is the main gameplay in the game and this is achieved through your char having access to a suit that allows him to perform superhuman jumps and speeds etc - the suit upgrades as you go along and none of the new abilities you gain is overused to the point where you get sick of it. Its a nice game to look at as well with great scenery - my only gripe with the graphics is that at times when you are stood still you can ascertain a kind of jerkiness in the animation of some tree branches but its very minor. The levels are quite big and credit to the design team the attention to detail when bulkhead doors etc open is really good giving the impression that a huge door is being opened. I completed the game in a little over 8 hours because i stopped a lot to see the sights and there are some very impressive vistas and herein lies my second complaint about this game - it has no photo mode - I really do feel like the devs could have really given a photomode or at least the ability to remove the HuD to take nice screenshots. However i brought this game for \u00a35 and it was a very good purchase - I managed to clock 73% of the achis on my first run through the game and its actually a game i would like to play a second time just to make sure i didnt miss any other nice sights.\nOverall a very nice exploration game with a hint of parkour and the odd enemy now and again to shoot at. Oh and the music is actually rather pleasent and works well with the game.\n\nedited-------\nFuck it this game is freaking awesome - you CAN HAVE PHOTO MODEE BY hitting tilde key and typing      togglegui", "timestamp_created": 1497452867, "timestamp_updated": 1497560961, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785829", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32408592": {"recommendationid": "32408592", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143024909", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 224, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497440342}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Kesinlikle al\u0131nmas\u0131 gereken oyunlardan, 3.5 saatte bitirdim ama bu 3.5 saatin hepsi dolu dolu ge\u00e7ti.M\u00fczikleri \u00e7ok uygun ve g\u00fczel, bilim kurgu olan oyunumuzda do\u011fan\u0131n g\u00fczelliklerine yer verilirken ayn\u0131 zaman sanayile\u015fmeninde en k\u00f6t\u00fc taraflar\u0131n\u0131 g\u00f6stermi\u015f.Baz\u0131 b\u00f6l\u00fcmlerde hafif gerilim de art\u0131yor.", "timestamp_created": 1497440544, "timestamp_updated": 1497440544, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32405624": {"recommendationid": "32405624", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169863890", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497426889}, "language": "english", "review": "i loved it only took 2h to compleyt and is over all a butiful game if you are as fast as me you can still play and get ypu money back", "timestamp_created": 1497427149, "timestamp_updated": 1497427149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495272", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32404584": {"recommendationid": "32404584", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997751821", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 45, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497421654}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely unplayable.

From the very moment you put on the L.E.A.F suit and the music kicks off, you feel like you are on a huge adventure.

The real story lies underneath all that, given to you both with audio recordings and notes. The notes can be hard to spot and are sometimes out of the way as many of them are in hidden crates but it does help breath life into the world if you track some down. The searching for crates does bring you out of the action sometimes and I wish that instead of being scattered here and there, that they had specific challenges to get to a large cache that you would have to go back to after getting the correct upgrades for the suit. My favorite part by far was the first time encountering the rails.

I will say if you're the kind of gamer who likes to do a lot of grinding and work between two remote locations seperated by a lot of landscape than this is your type of game. I will say that it lacks a lot of real content to warrent such large and spacious landscapes and underground railways to begin with. It feels almost incomplete. However I tend to think of that more as a drive to see what else there is out there to explore. Most of the game is optional. You have no real incentive to pickup acorns unless you plan on L.E.A.F upgrades (they're not required to complete the game) and the medallions as well.\n\nI've never seen a game where your health is effectively the health of the very island you're on. Your ability to traverse that island requires life from the island itself. Taking life from the island is how things around you die. Like tree and animals. Take too much and game over. Everytime you intentionally die the island helps you out. The game is very much about life balance. Keeping yourself and the island alive. However every action you take, in addition to defending yourself from enemies takes health.\n\nAbout those enemies. The game has no real variety of them, there is effectively three of them. One of which you can ignore since it's the final boss fight. The primary enemy you'll first encounter is a swarm of what appears to be fire flies which shoot what I can only assume is \"negative\" energy which then takes from your health. The way to attack these is to overpower them with your energy thus isolating them around a sphere of your own energy. If you're not following this game's concept of health and energy are the same thing. The second enemy is exactly the same except they're ghost-like monsters which move a lot quicker and a lot more randomly. The combat system in the game is pretty underdeveloped and could use a bit more work.\n\nThe game is very linear, perhaps too linear - forcing you down corridors and heating vents, train tracks you name it. However when you're not bombarded in all those tight spaces you're out in the open with absolutely no restrictions on where you can go. The game gives you a wide variety of mechanices for traversing this island. Perhaps too many mechanics?\n\nThe first mechanic you learn is effectively how to give and take energy/health/life (again all the same thing here). The second mechanic is the jump. This game loves jumping, to the point where you eventually gain a double-jumping mechanic. The island you're on has very low gravity allowing you to leap incredible distances, especially when you build up momentum. The two most important mechanics to the game however are more interesting. Walking on walls, which is used only rarely in the game and the grappling hook. This game has a lot of vertical open places where the use of the grappling hook is requireds and boy is it absolutely fun. Did I mention that once you get going you can reach incredible movement speeds the likes of which destroy games like Tribes?\n\nIf I were to give it a rating I would say a 7/10. There is definitely something here, it needs to be fleshed out a little further with more set pieces and mini missions. More variety of weapons and a better combat system and it would probably be a massive hit.\n\nThere is one other thing I forgot to mention and it really deserves it's own section in here. The soundtrack is absolutely one of the best I've ever heard in any form of digital enterainment / medium bar none. The game makes incredible use of 3D sound, ambient sounds, exceptional music, played at the right time, very organic and very well done.

It's games where the joy of movement is a central feature. A lot of parkour games capture this, though I'd say every genre has a few examples.\n\nValley captures this feeling so well that some of the other stuff it does almost feels superfluous. The running and jumping feels great on its own, and many set pieces are built around that. The sound and the music combine with this to make some sections downright exhilirating.\n\nBut it shoots itself in the foot a bit with the other items it adds on, stuff that seems geared to make it more marketable. Having enemies you have to shoot was mediocre, but making your ammo come out of the same pool as your other abilities made a few parts frustrating. And having to hunt for upgrades involves the sort of environment scouring that didn't feel proper in a game built around speed and jumping.\n\nAlso, and this goes out to all gamemakers, this is not elementary school, quit trying to pass me notes. Reading huge chunks of text while I'm trying to play a video game is a sloppy way to stuff more lore and background into your product.

Though it is a small game, to find most of the secrets it takes about 6 hours, it's fun to go back and rediscover the wonderful world this game can immerse you in.", "timestamp_created": 1494903961, "timestamp_updated": 1511504009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31755171": {"recommendationid": "31755171", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097224301", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494788003}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0448\u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043a\u043e:\n\n\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043b\u0438\u0446\u0430. \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0438 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430.\n\n\n\u0421\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\u043c\u0438:\n\u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 -

Hun eerste spel was Slender Man: The Arrival, dat ik - ondanks de hoge score op Steam - niet zou aanraden. Valley was daarom een onverwachte verassing. Het spel doet een beetje denken aan een kruising tussen Shadow Complex, Singularity en Dying Light. Je bent een archeoloog of archeologe die op zoek naar de mytische 'Lifeseed' met planeetverwoestende krachten met zijn of haar kano wordt meegesleurd door een rivier en uiteindelijk in een verborgen vallei in de Rocky Mountains terecht komt (vandaar de titel van het spel Valley). \n\n[b]Het verhaal[/b]\nIn de vallei vind je de restanten van installaties waar de geallieerden gedurende de Tweede Wereldoorlog onderzoek hebben gedaan naar een geheimzinnige energiebron die alleen in deze vallei gevonden wordt en die verbonden is met de Lifeseed waar je naar op zoek bent. Deze energie is enerzijds gebruikt voor de ontwikkeling van de L.E.A.F. suit, een exoskelet waarmee snel kunt rennen en  hoge sprongen kunt maken. En anderzijds voor de ontwikkeling van een bom die de atoombom van Oppenheimer naar de kroon moet steken. Het exoskelet is uitgevoerd met een apparaat dat de God Hand wordt genoemd en waarmee je leven kunt nemen en geven (vergelijkbaar met de Time Manipulation Device uit Singularity waarmee je dingen kon verouderen of verjongen). De enige tegenstanders die je tegenkomt zijn zwermen vuurvliegjes en natuurgeesten die agressief zijn door een gebrek aan de energie die door de installaties aan de valei wordt onttrokken. Je kunt ze uitschakelen door ze met je God Hand te beschieten, maar dat is alle actie die je in dit spel zult vinden. De rest van je tijd ben je vooral bezig met rondrennen, springen, glijden, klauteren en slingeren op zoek naar een manier om de vallei te redden. Het verhaal achter deze installaties en de reden waarom ze verlaten zijn, wordt beetje bij beetje door middel van briefjes en bandopnames onthuld. Erg cliche, maar de briefjes en opnames zijn kort en goed geschreven en geven vanuit verschillende standpunten weer wat er gebeurd is en hoe verschillende mensen de gebeurtenissen hebben ervaren. Het spel houdt je aandacht verder vast door je beetje bij beetje nieuwe uitbreidingen voor je L.E.A.F. suit te geven. Eerst een boost, waardoor je een dubbele sprong kunt maken, daarna een ketting waarmee je aan specifieke blokken kunt slingeren, magneetlaarzen waarmee je tegen bepaalde wanden kunt lopen en nog meer. \n\n[b]De lengte van het spel[/b]\nAls je de verhaallijn volgt en braaf de opdrachten die je krijgt opvolgt, kun je het spel in een uur of drie uitspelen. Als je het spel voor de eerste keer speelt, zou ik je die strategie aanbevelen. Vervolgens kun je alle levels opnieuw spelen en op zoek gaan naar verschillende voorwerpen die in de levels zijn verstopt. In de verschillende levels zijn kisten met briefjes, eikels en medaillons te vinden. De eikels kun je gebruiken om poorten te openen en de medaillons openen een pyramide waarin je twee verbeteringen vindt die het ontdekken van de levels nog makkelijker maken. \nHet is niet eenvoudig om alle kisten te vinden, omdat de verschillende gebieden waar je doorheen trekt groot zijn. Hieraan zie je ook de aandacht die de ontwikkelaars hebben gestopt in dit spel. Waar je in veel spellen voortdurend tegen onzichtbare muren oploopt, moet je hier enorm je best doen voordat dat gebeurt. Het spel is verdeeld in negen van deze grote gebieden die zich afwisselend bovengronds en in ondergrondse installaties plaatsvinden. Omdat je voortdurend nieuwe manieren krijgt om je voort te bewegen, kun je ook steeds moeilijk bereikbare gebieden bereiken, ook in de gebieden die je al bezocht hebt.\n\n[b]De kwaliteit van het spel[/b]\nEen van de grote nadelen van spellen van kleine ontwikkelaars is vaak dat er veel bugs en glitches in het spel zitten, dat het spel niet goed in elkaar steekt (gauw eentonig wordt of onverwachts eindigt), dat de besturing slecht is of dat de User Interface onduidelijk is. Maar dat is hier niet het geval, hoewel je soms wel merkt dat het spel door een klein team is gemaakt, voelt het spel over het algemeen net zo solide aan als de eerder genoemde spellen van gevestigde ontwikkelaars. \nWaar ik ook nog een compliment voor wil geven is de kwaliteit van de achtergrondmuziek. Deze varieert van rustgevende Ierse/keltische deuntjes in de zonovergoten bossen tot dreigende muziek tijdens de ondergrondse gebieden. De aandacht die in veel onderdelen van het spel is gestoken, is ook hier merkbaar. Soms verandert de muziek van vrolijk naar opgewekt, naar dreigend afhankelijk van het gebied waar je bent. \nOok op andere vlakken merk je dat de ontwikkelaars zorg hebben besteed aan het spel. Het rondrennen voelt heel natuurlijk aan en het gevoel van snelheid is indrukwekkend. Het camerastandpunt is bewust laag aan de grond, waardoor je soms het gevoel hebt een dwerg te zijn in plaats van een reus. Volgens een van de ontwikkelaars is dit bewust gedaan, omdat het anders te moeilijk was om sprongen goed in te schatten. Daarnaast verhoogt het ook het gevoel van snelheid. Ik kon me er persoonlijk niet aan ergeren, maar het viel me - net als andere spelers - wel af en toe op.\nVind je het leuk om de verschillende gebieden uit te kammen op zoek naar alle kisten en het behalen van de achievements dan ben je al gauw zo'n 10 tot 15 uur zoet met het spel.\n\n[b]Conclusie[/b]\nSommige reviews en opmerkingen in het forum zijn ronduit negatief over het spel. Daar ben ik het, zoals je hebt kunnen lezen, niet mee eens. De oorzaak is denk ik dat het spel zich moeilijk laat classificeren. Het heeft veel elementen van een walking simulator zoals Dear Esther of Gone Home of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, maar de L.E.A.F. suit maakt er veel meer een platformachtig spel van zoals The Story of My Uncle of Mirror's Edge. Als je echter een aantal verbeteringen hebt gevonden voor de L.E.A.F. suit en je wat meer ervaring hebt met het rondrennen en springen dan worden deze platformachtige elementen zo makkelijk dat je het moeilijk een platformer kunt noemen. Een echt actiespel is het ook niet, daarvoor zijn er te weinig verschillende tegenstanders die bovendien niet al te veel tegenstand bieden. Dat maakt het moeilijk om Valley te vergelijken met andere spellen, want hoewel het veel elementen van andere spellen in zich heeft, is het nergens mee te vergelijken. De Steam score geeft in dit geval een betere beoordeling, want op een schaal van 1 tot 10, zou ik het een ruime 7 geven. Sommige elementen hadden beter gekund, het spel had groter en uitdagender kunnen zijn. Maar voor een kleine studio als Blue Isle is dit een goede prestatie. Het feit dat er een drietal updates zijn gedaan waarmee een groot aantal problemen die zijn gerapporteerd door spelers zijn weggenomen, geeft bovendien aan dat Blue Isle zijn klanten serieus neemt. Het is geen spel dat iedere speler zal aanspreken, daarvoor is de actie en de uitdaging te beperkt, maar zeker voor veel 'casual' spelers is dit spel een aanrader.", "timestamp_created": 1493582479, "timestamp_updated": 1493745205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31467117": {"recommendationid": "31467117", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135712460", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493567014}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521a\u521a\u73a9\u5b8c\u6765\u5199\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff01\u97f3\u4e50\u975e\u5e38\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u753b\u9762\u597d\u8bc4\uff0c\u8282\u594f\u9002\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u611f\u53d7\u7740\u522b\u6837\u9a70\u9a8b\u7684\u5feb\u611f\uff01\uff01\u5927\u7ea64\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c[spoiler] \u4e00\u51719\u7ae0\uff0c \u867d\u7136\u5728\u8bbe\u65bd\u91cc\u7ed5\u90a3\u6bb5\u6709\u70b9\u67af\u71e5\uff0c[/spoiler]\u6574\u4f53\u8fd8\u662f\u4e00\u573a\u60ca\u5fc3\u52a8\u9b44\u7684\u5192\u9669\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6162\u6162\u89e3\u5f00valley\u7684\u79d8\u5bc6\uff0c[spoiler]\u987a\u4fbf\u62ef\u6551\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\uff0c[/spoiler]\u6253\u6298\u8d2d\u5165\u7684\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\uff01\uff01\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1493568683, "timestamp_updated": 1493568683, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31428286": {"recommendationid": "31428286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132670253", "num_games_owned": 385, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499538718}, "language": "english", "review": "\u901a\u5173\u611f\u53d7\n\u8ba9\u8001\u592b\u627e\u56de\u4e86\u8ffd\u98ce\u5c11\u5e74\u7684\u611f\u89c9\n[b]\u98ce\u9a70\u7535\u63a3\uff0c\u7535\u5149\u706b\u77f3[/b]\n\u7a33\u5982\u9999\u6e2f\u8bb0\u8005\u6a21\u62df\u5668\n\nRunning...FLYing simulator.\nThe music itself is decent enough for the price.\nStage design feels strange yet compelling.\nStory is concise and satisfying.\nVery Zen style.

I enjoyed every moment of the game even whilst 100% with achievements and collectables. The story was interesting enough to maintain my attention and keep me immersed in the world of valley there are also a fair few extra skills and movement abilities unlocked throughout playing which keeps the play style fresh and prevents the game from getting boring, but the main factor of me playing and 100% the game was its awesome landscape and views.\n\nPROS\n-Beautiful Landscapes and scenery\n-Amazing soundtrack\n-New movement abilities every level or so to keep gameplay fresh and exciting\n-Non challenging enemies (as its not a large feature of this game)\n-Decent story\n-Replayability if you appreciate scenery and the game mechanics\n\nCONS\n-Short game (3 and half hours of gameplay or so, 5-8 if you are collecting all upgrades and medallions) -Not necessarily a bad thing\n-Not much replayability if you don't like linear story driven games\n-If you combat is a big feature for you this game will disappoint you\n\nThe reason I am listing the pros and cons like this are as followed, combat can be an important part of a game for some people but this game is more about exploration and movement ability, as of which the enemies are very easy to deal with and are not very threatening, which makes this the perfect game to relax with and have a good chilled time. The length of the game is listed under cons simply as the longer the game the more worth you get for your money, of course I would love this game to be longer but at the same time I feel that this could end up dragging out the plot too much and ultimately spoiling a great game so I don't think its a big deal and I am happy with the game length and of course with a longer game length you would end up having styles of levels that are repeated and would end up being boring and tacky. \n\nAs this game is a linear story game it would be great to one day have some additional content for this game, maybe an extra level or something but its not needed for this game to be replayed, I shall probably revisit this game every few months to replay it on a fresh save. \n\nSUMMARY\nOverall I think Valley is a beautiful game with outstanding visuals and soundtrack, the story and atmosphere of the game shall leave you fully immersed, the gameplay is fun and exciting as well as leisurely and calm.

So many, in fact, that no one will find them all in the first playthrough.  Come to think of it, it's impossible until you obtain some suit upgrades.  If you want to find all of the secrets, upgrades, and collectibles, this game is guaranteed to keep you busy for awhile.\n\nPros:\n- The graphics in this game is one of the best I've ever seen\n- The voice acting is decent (all from recordings)\n- Decent replay value\n- Lengthy game play\n- Various areas to explore\n- Plot twist\n- Easter Eggs\n\nCons:\n- Animals and enemies stand still when far away\n- The player can get stuck\n- No character development\n- You can't save progress until the end of the chapter\n\nSome of the areas, most of them in the beginning, are extremely beautiful.  I was very impressed by how the sun shown through the trees, how the sun glistened off of the waterfalls, and how the wild life moved and looked (very lifelike).  The entire game has some of the best graphics I've ever seen, along with an ending that I didn't see coming.  I took my time with this game and it I played it for about 18 hours before getting to the end, then another 6 or 7 hours trying to obtain all of the achievements.  When you finish the game, you can travel to any of the chapters to try for an achievement.  Best of all, you keep all of your upgrades and abilities as well.\n\nIf you want to fly through this game, you can finish in about 2 or 3 hours but where is the fun in that?\n\nOnly a couple of things about Valley really bothered me.  First, the wildlife and enemies are visible far into the distance and they stand there as if they're waiting for their cue.  Once you're close enough, then they go into action.  Once you realize this, enemies become very easy targets, but not of them are visible so you still want to stay vigilant.  Second, there are several places where the player can get stuck forcing you so start the chapter over.  Since there is no save system, be very mindful where you jump (The game automatically saves when you complete a chapter).\n\nOn a side note, when the player obtains an upgrade, I thought it was very reminiscent of Bioshock.

However, as other reviewers have stated before, the game feels unfinished. It just feels... empty. \n\nThere are only two kinds of enemies you face: swarms and wendigos. Even the single \"boss\" falls into one of those categories. I rarely took damage from enemies - water was the most dangerous part of my Valley experience, killing me maybe 5 times through the whole game (never was killed by a monster, including the boss). Aside from that, there are only two kinds of non-combatant creatures you will come across: deer (I counted 3) and the little green sprites. \n\nThere are a lot of ledges to jump on, and once your LEAF suit has some upgrades, it becomes very easy to access areas you shouldn't be able to get to. I clipped through map elements many, many times. The endgame experience where you have to go hunt down medallions and other upgrades you missed is boring. The areas are vast, and an indicator to point you in a general direction would be appreciated. Otherwise aimless hunting and running around just isn't fun.\n\nIt's a beautiful game. I got it at $8, and I don't regret my purchase. But the full retail price of $20 is exorbitant for this game.

VERY weak.  While it saves what you've found and upgraded constantly, it does not save your position at all.  When you see the game's load screen pop up, check the clock.  If you don't have at least an hour left in your game session, stop playing!  Because however far you get, you're going to be sent back to the start of the zone when you come back with all the opposition restored.  You'll know where to go and where the opposition is hiding so it won't take even half as long to get back where you were but it's still pretty frustrating.  If you can't play an hour at a time, consider this review a down vote.\n\nFor the most part, this game is really a joy to play.  It's a simple game, both in difficulty and mechanics.  You get some simple tasks to do in a pretty environment with some relaxing music playing.  There's some areas to explore, too, with objects hidden out of the way.  There are some enemies to fight but, if you have any first person shooter experience at all, you'll laugh all but the final boss off.\n\nThere are some blemishes, too, though.  The save system is easily the biggest for me.  The story is a bit contrived, especially near the start (it isn't easy to come up with a reason for you to be stomping around in a forgotten valley ;).  If you're into screenshots then you'll find it difficult to toggle the HUD on and off (you'll need to use the console).  Finally, while I understand that the L.E.A.F. suit isn't made for swimming, the way the game kills you for landing in water that would barely cover the thing's feet is a bit rediculous.\n\nNone of those are really terrible assuming you've got game sessions long enough to deal with the save situation or don't mind going back over some territory.

Great if you love exploring places but are a bit ADHD.\n\nGraphics are generally beautiful but some of the textures are a bit low which makes it look a bit PS3 at times. Soundtrack is amazing, some really beautiful atmospheric, emotional, uplifting music which was composed for the game.\n\nI'm running it on a GTX 980 ti and get around 60 fps maxed out. If I take the anti aliasing down a notch I get 80+ fps which is a VERY noticeable improvement on a high refresh rate G-Sync monitor. When you jump and twirl it's sooo smooth.

By utilising a secret suit discovered within the ruins, called L.E.A.F. (Leap Effortlessly through Air Functionality), you start to put together not only the story around the expedition but also the ancient inhabitants that lived within the mysterious valley and their origins.\n\n\"Relaxed\" is the key word in [b]Valley[/b], as there is no real pressure of pressing forward at breakneck speed or challenging enemies to fight but rather an open world with linear progression, which is completely up-to you if you want to zoom through it or take the time to appreciate and explore it (the travel option can be used at any time to return to any reached areas for further exploring).\n\n[b]Valley[/b] takes around 6-8hrs to complete (~12hrs with all achievements) and has a reasonable price (a steal at it's current \u00a36 discounted tag).

First, the story was well thought out and developed (dear reviewers, did you take time to read all the notes?) Second, the fall of momentum while running, jumping or sliding at high speed is not in the least disturbing, as it gives you the opportunity to explore the sometimes stunningly beautiful surroundings. Also, it takes certain skills to avoid obstacles as you speed up while after a stop it is quite easy to be on the move again in no time. Third, as you progress, you obtain a variety of technical means to race and jump about, while at the same time the environment becomes more challenging and game play remains easy.

And I can't do that without expressing the massive scope of this world. Yes, it's a Unity game, and in most cases, would be a turn off. But the world that was created within the engine is fuckin' jaw dropping. It is MASSIVE! At times I felt like a speck in this world. Everywhere you look, you will find beautiful set peices. Even in the warehouse areas, where most people have complaints about detail, I still found myself understanding the once vibrant mechanical installation being taken over by the nature on this planet. It's gorgeous. \n\nNext, the gameplay. It's a perfect build up that follows the story the dev's are selling. You learn your way at a perfect pace. With every enhancement to my L.E.A.F. suit, I found myself giddy at the thought of what I can do next. And also, thinking about all those places I was not able to get to previously. Couldn't wait to play through again with all my new found gadgetry. This sucker has replay value. Maybe not forever, but absolutely worth a few play throughs. Your L.E.A.F. suit grants you the ability to swing, jump, run, fly? through this world at insane speeds and it never gets old. Seriously, never gets old. It's SO fun!\n\nNow the story and soundtrack. They compliment the gameplay down to a science. While the story isn't the greatest epic I've ever heard, It was intriguing, and kept me wanting to find the \"notes\" around the world to get back story as to what happened in this place, and what I'm supposed to do now that I'm here. You really feel like this enviroment you're exploring was here long before you arrived, and you can feel the history of it. Totally cool, kept me going. And the soundtrack. Good lord, the soundtrack. Amazing scores that fit the situation you're in, perfect. Yes, I said scores. This is some orchestral shit right here. You ever watch Braveheart and pay attention to the music? It's no too far off from that. High five to whomever put this together. \n\nAre there flaws? Sure, every game has them. But the joy I found playing this game overshadows anything I could mention here. Once you find yourself on those rails, you won't care either. :-)\n\nIf you're on the fence, take a flyer on this one.

My thoughts?  It's pretty darn good.  I like indie first person storyline games, and this one did not fail to impress.\n\nPros:\n\n- Interesting backstory\n- The controls are both fluid and solid.  I didnt feel strained to control the character even in the most intense moments.\n- The parkour and combat is both enjoyable and difficult, without being too frustrating.\n- Graphics are quite good overall.  Decent detail but some things are not as good (look at cons below)\n- Some very tense moments\n- The music is amazing!  Syncs quite well with afore mentioned tense moments (and exciting ones too)!\n- Ran 80+ fps on my Asus Strix rx 480 8gb oc with Highest Settings.\n- Indiana Jones meets Fallout 4 and Skyrim. :D\n\nCons:\n\n- The story could have used a little more time after the ending (SPOILERS!!!) I feel like after the character wakes up from being in the water in the final scene, that he/she should have had some time to re-explore the valley and see the difference.\n- Not enough static objects: (trees, bushes, crates in buildings, debris, etc)  Not unbearable but could have used some more interesting things.\n- Maybe more creatures???\n- Graphics looked somewhat bad at long distances.\n- Deer movement animation looked a bit... fake xD\n\nOverall I would reccomend this game!\n", "timestamp_created": 1489453457, "timestamp_updated": 1489453457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30484008": {"recommendationid": "30484008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042025055", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 362, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489356304}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautiful and well made game all around. Scenery, gameplay, art, design and music - they all interwine harmoniously together creating a solid and enjoyable game. \n\nThe gameplay itself is simple and works. There is a wonderful dreamlike sense of freedom when running like the wind and leaping over boulders and things. You just want to go faster and higher. Come to think of it, the whole game gave me this familiar feeling: \"I've had this dream before.\" \n\nThe story was interesting and well told. I usually don't much care about the story in games - for me it's all about the gameplay and atmosphere. But this time I found myself reading all the notes I could find sprinkled around the gameworld - just out of curiosity. Piece by piece the story and mysteries unfold. I was never given a huge wall of text to read - nor did I feel that the story was forced into my face. Nay, the game gradually reveals the story, mixed with some science, humor and philosophy just the right amounts. I guess this way of telling the story works for me. \n\nOn the technical side I experienced a few bugs and crashes here and there under Linux (thanks for making a port btw). Had to re-replay some parts - but other than that the game ran absolutely great (AMD fx-6300, 8GiB ddr3, Radeon R9 270). \n\nOverall very well done game that L.E.A.Fs one wanting more.\n\nP.S.\n\nMy personal wishes if there will ever be a sequel of sorts:\n- Make the gameplay even faster\n- Increase the difficulty and challenge\n- Make a port for us Linux peasants", "timestamp_created": 1489374073, "timestamp_updated": 1489374073, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30479425": {"recommendationid": "30479425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027942416", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489350919}, "language": "english", "review": "It takes a few things implemented well to make a good game. Team Fortress and well balanced character classes, Warcraft and gazillions of things to do, Skyrim and the feeling of a living worlds... Valley does a few things well enough that it can easily be considered a great game. First, it has these 'lively' environments for you to explore. The lightning and the lay out encourages you to go to places. It would be a shame if you could not get everywhere (Remember climbing the Throat of the World for the Notched Pickaxe? what a chore that was...). That is where Valley truly shines, as the second thing it does well is to give you mobility. The controls are very intuitive, so that you are not struggling to figure out how to do that double jump / rope combo to get there. The only difficulty is getting creative in using the skills given to you. Normally these would make an interesting game, but what tops off the Valley is the storyline given through audio logs and personal communications left by the research team. The storyline complements the atmosphere created by the lively environments and actually encourages you to explore more. The only down side is the medium length duration.

The pace, in my opinion, is also quite good. You are regularly rewarded with new upgrades to your suit and the new abilities they add are incorporated into the gameplay well. Nothing feels too tacked on. I even found myself going back after I completed the game to use the fully upgraded suit to find new areas in the earlier levels.\n\nI only have a couple of gripes about this game and they are super minor and nitpicky: \n\nOne is that two of the voices are terrible. The first is the guy in the LEAF suit video. They're trying to make him sound old-timey, but it just sounds like a teenager doing a bad impression. The second is the female automated/computer/warning voice that you hear in the elevators.\n\nMy other (again, really nitpicky) complaint is that the signage all over the place uses really modern fonts.

Otherwise, definitely give it a try! \n\nWhile I really like this game, it has a major flaw that I haven't seen mentioned in any other reviews I've seen: the audio design for most of the game is 1,000% horror, even though it's not trying to be a hardcore horror game. \n[list]\n   [*] Many enviormental noises are creepily loud compared to everything else (metal walkways, branches, the small generators, bursts of wind, etc.)\n   [*] Eerie dissonant hums or dead silence instead of background music for big chunks of the game \n   [*] It becomes 'Jump Scare: Attack of the Orchestra!' at many points of interest\n[/list]\n\nAs someone who can't play most horror games without freezing up, this made many parts of the game almost unplayable. I lost track of the number of times I had to pause and walk away for a minute to get away from the ambiance. The rest of the game was good enough that I kept coming back, though.\n\nPros:\nOk story, fun gameplay mechanics, great visual design, and solid voice acting. Amazing soundtrack. Decent enemy progression: it started off with things that aren't that menacing, and the ones that were suppossed to be a little scary were introduced with enough warning that you could tell that something creepy was ahead of you (no jump scares). \n\nCons:\nMinor glitches (lighting, audio, and collision detection don't always work right in obscure corners).

All of the visuals, particularly the lighting in the outdoor areas, are extremely well done - I may have had a personal record high screenshots-per-hour while playing Valley.

Thanks to the suit your character can run faster, jump great heights and interact with other objects in the environment: in other words, it's used for the platforming elements that made most of this game's gameplay, and it does its job pretty well.\n\n- The life manipulation function of the L.E.A.F. suit. Basically, your character has an energy (life) bar he/she can use to give life to death animals and plants in the environment: vice versa, he/she can absorb energy from the environment to replenish his/her own. If your character dies, he/she will consume a \"Energy of the Valley\" bar instead and respawn with a bit of energy. While this system sounds unique and interesting on paper, it's undermined by (A) your energy/life being far too easy to recover, even without drining everything else of theirs (B) the total lack of any consequence whatsoever if you end up consuming far too much Energy of the Valley (C) the few sources that can actually be harvested, making the whole thing a bit repetitive.\n\n- The L.E.A.F. suit's combat abilities, which basically boil down to shooting balls of your own energy at enemies. The whole thing is standard FPS fare, and it's not helped by the enemies being basically the same mook over and over again, only with different models.\n\nTo be fair, Valley's scenery really is beautiful and haunting at times, and you are given an incentive to explore the various levels by the existence of hidden collectables that allow you to further power-up your L.E.A.F. suit. Unfortunately, though, more often than note you can witness the limits of the game's graphics (lack of polished textures above all the others) first hand.\n\nFor being a simple indie product, Valley surely is a more than acceptable videogame with at times original ideas and which is generally fun to play, but it has its clear limits you should keep in mind in deciding to buy it or not and kinda the short lenght (being beatable, exclusind the extras, in well under five hours)", "timestamp_created": 1488748926, "timestamp_updated": 1488749004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30334923": {"recommendationid": "30334923", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999654663", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488057728}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a good entertaining little game as long as you take it for what it is and dont make up your own expectations.\n\nIt is rather short and could have done alot more with its premise but all in all it was enjoyable and gave me a few hours of good fun, graphics are pretty but its excessively clear it could have been so much more as a PC game primarily, unfortunately as always inclusion of consoles results in a game that is lowered to the common denominator rather than made for PC and then lowered to match other platforms.\n\nDont expect any ground-heaving revelations of game design but its a nice mix of platformer, walking simulator with a couple of extremely rudimentary combat mechanics.\n\nConsidering its short length and limited scope the price can be discussed so if its a hold-back for you i heartily recommend grabbing it on a sale instead.", "timestamp_created": 1488712364, "timestamp_updated": 1490984271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30331392": {"recommendationid": "30331392", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988924072", "num_games_owned": 207, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488697858}, "language": "english", "review": "Gorgeous, fun platformer - with just the right amount of story to leave you thinking...", "timestamp_created": 1488698456, "timestamp_updated": 1488698456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30330561": {"recommendationid": "30330561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276979308", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487492953}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u662f\u86ee\u63a8\u8350\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u662f\u540e\u9762\u6709\u4e9b\u5173\u5361\u6bd4\u8f83\u96be\uff0c\u5361\u4f4f\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\uff0c\u5c31\u6ca1\u4e86\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u4e5f\u662f\u6b3e\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1488694379, "timestamp_updated": 1488694379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30328474": {"recommendationid": "30328474", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117350699", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488744346}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't even finished the game yet but i would already recommed to anyone looking for a change in pace advneture game.

It means it's always fresh, there's always something new to do.\nCons:\nThe story is short - 3 hours isn't that long.\nCombat isn't great - it's not bad, but not great. It's not really a focus, and is pretty much more of a distraction than anything else.\n... that's about it really, it's a great indie game with unique mechanics.

You're in possession of the L.E.A.F. suit, an old time-y exoskeleton which will empower the player with extraordinary abilities and features. You can run extremely fast, fall through great heights without incident, jump to amazing heights, swing from place to place and the most extraordinary of all... taking or giving life to the flora and fauna of the Valley. The lifeforce of your surroundings powers up the suit but be warned; to gain power by taking lifeforce away is a slippery slope to ruination but more on that later.\n\nThere's very little combat in the game but it is there, nothing that will hinder progress or get you stuck, if anything I'd say is too easy but nonetheless I believe it was a very sound decision by the developers in order to preserve the spirit of the game without diverging into more of a shooter.\n\nAs you explore the Valley the story is told by 1940's style gramophone recordings, extremely similar storytelling like in the Bioshock series, that is to say it is almost identical. Imitation is the highest form of flattery as they say and I'd have to admit that the plot device works like a charm in this particular case. Without spoiling too much of the story because it is certainly interesting although a tad bit on the clich\u00e9 side, you can take life from the Valley, either from plants or animals but there's always a cost. Should you die in during your endeavors, the Valley will sacrifice part of its life force to bring you back. Die too many times and face the consequences. The game tends to try too hard with the dialogue and narration especially with quantum theories which I did find a tad bit bizzare but I can understand that it was there to explain a few things regarding the origin of the Valley and its inhabitants. Besides the recordings, there's plenty of notes written by people who've been on the Valley which offer a little bit more lore about the game. \n\nIf you like collectibles and secrets, there are a few spread around the levels and you'll be rewarded with upgrades to your L.E.A.F suit.\n\nValley however is not without its flaws. There's this huge Valley to explore but the game is fairly linear. Exploration will be done solely on the boundaries of the playable zone and there's not really any motivation besides finding the odd collectible. Some areas are unreachable, some might a little bit glitchy, there's not really lots of items and doodads to interact with and so on. I feel that the game would be even better if it was less linear and offered more side areas to explore but that's not the case.\n \nGraphically the game is pretty to look at times... and pretty dull at others. There's some inconsistency and that's a shame cause the environment and effects look pretty darn nice from a distance. Staring at the godrays on the horizon, auroras, sunsets etc, are really great moments in the game but when you get close to some trees or rocks that feeling goes away real quick.\n\nThe game is short, ~5 hours to complete but I have to admit that's not actually a terrible thing when compared to the overall spirit of the game. Valley has a story to tell and 'guide' you through it but it doesn't become tedious at any point. Like I mentioned above, combat is pretty scarce and rudimentary and it won't challenge one bit with one minor exception: [spoiler]fighting the Alpha near the end of the game.[/spoiler]\n\nTo sum up, Valley is very nicely unique adventure. I loved the story and the storytelling devices, the world is very interesting and there's a nice air of mystery surrounding the place, the L.E.A.F suit feels good for the player to use and upgrade and the developers created an enjoyable experience for the player.

sale.\n\nPros:\n+ A good story that not only deals with the mystique of the valley itself, but also about the risks of science that focuses on weapons for warfare and dangers of only taking from nature.\n+ Great voice acting. Even though only two of the actors are in focus, they give very strong performances.\n+ Extremly fun gameplay. The game takes great inspirations from Bioshock, but with the L.E.A.F.-suit it almost feels like playing a first-person Sonic game.\n+ Beautiful visuals with varied enviornments, a lot of the time very pleasing and with very fitting music.\n+ The Daemons are adorable!\n\nNeutral:\n* The first 5-10 minutes are very Walking Simulator-like. It may give off the wrong first impression, but once you get the L.E.A.F.-suit, everything changes in the best possible way.\n* You can choose between male or female voice for player character. It only changes the voice grunts and nothing else, as the game is in first-person and the player-character never outright speaks, but I do think that it's a nice feature to have.\n* Combat varies between fun and boring. Sometimes I had a challenging time combatting enemies, while other times I could just snipe them from afar.\n\nCons:\n- There's a mechanic that you can both give life to nature and take life from it. That could potentially create some challenge, trying to balance the use of giving life, but as there are a lot of orbs around, that challenge is rendered moot. I completed the entire game without ever taking life from nature or animals on purpose.\n- Some graphical glitches can occur. There were some times where I could walk through large objects and one point where I accidentally got stuck.\n\nNote: Like some of the people here, I first heard about this game from Jim Sterling's positive impressions-video. I only bought it recently, but I'm very glad that I bought it.", "timestamp_created": 1487371981, "timestamp_updated": 1487371981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29994698": {"recommendationid": "29994698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064325288", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510595615}, "language": "italian", "review": "Superrrrr !!!", "timestamp_created": 1487370031, "timestamp_updated": 1487370031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29993469": {"recommendationid": "29993469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001622086", "num_games_owned": 1319, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484766019}, "language": "german", "review": "Ein sehr beeindruckendes Spiel von den \"Slender - the Arrival\" Machern. Ich hab nat\u00fcrlich auch Slender gespielt was ja auch ein Grund war warum ich the Valley \u00fcberhaupt bemerkt und gekauft hab. Eben weil die Atmosph\u00e4re in Slender schon so extrem gut war und das Level Design und die story einfach alles. Und dann diese komplett fremdartige spiel the valley. Ich hab ein paar mal herum-\u00fcberlegt und am ende musste ich es einfach haben und spielen, tja und ich sag euch dieses Spiel ist jeden Cent wert. Absolut Top. Das gameplax erinnert an \"a story about my uncle\" oder \"Bioshock infinite\", mit abwechselnder heller und dunkler Atmosph\u00e4re. Du steckst in einer Art Poweranzug mit verschiedenen F\u00e4higkeiten wie hoch oder weit springen sogar kurzzeitiges \u00fcber Wasser laufen, denn schwimmen kann man nicht und Wasser ist dein Feind unter anderem, denn dein Anzug ist schwer und du stirbst wenn du in tiefes Wasser springst. Und wenn du stirbst zieht es der Valley Lebenskraft ab, den du durch deine Energiehandschuhe aber wieder aufladen bzw retten kannst, indem  du mit Energiegeschossen auf d\u00fcrre B\u00e4ume, B\u00fcsche, Kletterplanzen oder tote Tiere schiesst um sie wieder zu beleben. Man sch\u00e4tzt sein Leben in the Valley mehr als in anderen Spielen, weil schnell mal neu laden geht nich dann musst du das Level neu starten. Man kann sich auch mit Energie durch die Luft schwingen und ein paar Gegnertypen gibt es auch welche wiederum mit Energiegeschossen auszuschalten sind.

The outdoor scenery is beautiful and it's awesome to experience it at a neckbreaking pace - no time to look at the details (which are a bit dated like the two dimensional grass and flowers). Speed is what the game excells in - with tight controls and cool visuals. There's the lovely idea of giving and taking life to survive but it doesn't amount to much. A more philosophical game is hinted at but never realised.\nBut who thought it was a good idea to put item and log searching in a game that's all about running and jumping? Why are there so many dark and boring indoor levels with ugly textures? Why is there monster shooting at all when it's neither challenging nor interesting? The worst might be the note reading. It's just such an overused and stupid story telling device - and there are tons of notes everywhere! This design decision really confuses me, all the more because the game found a sufficient solution with the auto activating audio logs. Their existence may not make much sense either but at least they don't interrupt the gameplay.\nTo me Valley is like an overproduced hollywood movie: At the bottom is a brilliant, rather simple idea but in the process more and more stuff got added because the producers didn't trust the original idea (\"Hey, why not add a crazy WW2 weapon scientist, those are always fun!\") to carry the whole thing. So in the end there's just too much and a lot of it not done right.\nI don't mind short games; I completed it under 5 hours but after finishing I had no desire to go back and search for more notes, runes or nuts and I felt no regret when I uninstalled it.\nI'd still recommend to play Valley, but be prepared to be a bit disappointed, because with more focus on its mechanics and less story it could have been awesome. 6/10", "timestamp_created": 1487176716, "timestamp_updated": 1487177044, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484649", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29933494": {"recommendationid": "29933494", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974924420", "num_games_owned": 390, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 403, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487126924}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game", "timestamp_created": 1487127102, "timestamp_updated": 1487127102, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484649", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29931203": {"recommendationid": "29931203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014194125", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487116284}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is lovely. The scenery is incredible and the graphics are beautiful, and holy shit the music fits this game perfectly. Sadly this game is trying to do far too much.

The combat is boring and unchallenging, and the game is constantly slowing you down when you start to build up speed to open chests and read notes. There's sadly just not enough of the fun, fast-paced platforming that I was expecting.

The graphics and visuals? Hands down, best in 2016. I knew this game was beautiful before I bought it because it's made my Blue isle Studios, which also made Slender: The Arrival, (which you should also check out), and that game was GORGEOUS, even though it was just supposed to be about the horror aspect, and this game definitely kicked it up a couple notches and showed that this company is professional in its story telling and visuals. Though the entire story is about 3 - 4 hours long, that's if you just wander around, doing everything your told and not hunting for secrets. This game has LOADS of secrets and easter eggs that mostly require acorns or medals, (you'll find out once you play), and it's fun to try to track them all down. The challenging level was not as much as some other games out there, it's mostly pretty calm, (besides the monsters), and there's not a place you'll just get stuck at and can't get through, which is nice.  Throughout the entire story, I only lost all my \"lives\" once, but there was definitely times where I would be VERY close to dying completely, and have to figure out how to gain my lives back.\n\nThis game is definitely worth a try, no matter what kind of games you like, and after you beat the game, go try out Slender: The Arrival, because this company is amazing ;)", "timestamp_created": 1486917064, "timestamp_updated": 1486917064, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29876800": {"recommendationid": "29876800", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162672291", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 394, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486938044}, "language": "french", "review": "plus vite! plus haut!

You're character is highly mobile and capable of a handful of acrobatic, albeit standard, maneuvers by the end of the game. This is thank to the L.E.A.F. suit which in addition to allowing you to run much faster and jump higher allows you to both give life back to dead fauna and flora or drain them of life for energy. This ability is more intriguing in concept than in practice as I rarely ever saw a reason to drain life from anything. Even during the games weak combat you give life rather than taking it and there's an abundance of energy pickups scattered throughout the game anyway.  \n\nDespite the short game length Valley has, it manages to overstay its welcome and lose all the monentum it intially has rather quickly. Even so the developers tried to desperately pad out the length of the game by including optional powerups you can find and letting you travel back to previous areas but the upgrades are always just more energy for your suit which is totally unnecessary. \n\nThe second big draw that most games have is the story and while I didn't find this particular entry offensive it wasn't interesting either. The story unfolds through audio diaries that automatically play during your time exploring the world much in the same way it's done in Bioshock, although in this case you don't actually need to find them. The characters seem to exist more as vehicle for the story rather than actual people. The plot does actually have one decent point you uncover towards the end but for the most part is forgettable.\n\nSo if the gameplay and story are bad, is there anything redeemable about the game? Yes, there is actually. The game has great visuals, the world can be a little sparse but there's some great vistas to be seen in the game. Also the soundtrack is top-notch and matches what is happening in the game quite well. Unforunately these aspects aren't enough to carry the game but they certainly are worth mentioning.\n\nUltimately the game comes close to being something I enjoyed but fell just a bit short.

It's populated by derpy little forest sprites known as 'deamons' throughout the story, deer, a few rabbits, all scampering across gorgeous fields.\n\nThe combat is not exceedingly great, however it is enough to provide some exhiliration when enemies get the drop on you -- which they will, as vertigo can overtake you in a moment and a enemy will sometimes be positioned just right to capitalize on it.\n\nI've recently finished the game, and am going back to peck around for all the hidden tidbits that I missed -- which is quite fortunate because, that means replay value for those who search for such things! In a almost MetroidVania sort of fashion, you can use the cahpter select with all the upgrades you currently posess for your L.E.A.F. suit, and use them to access spots you might be very shocked you missed before, or simply disregarded while being swept up in the colors and speed.\n\nWithout being too spoliery, the story isn't half bad. The 'evil scientist' has all the proper motivaitons to drive him to his own doom, the ecologist girl is pretty, intelligent, and thoughtful.\n\nThe musical score is phenomenal, and well keyed to certain points of action, where a sudden crescendo will kick in at the pinnacle of your jump, leave the air empty except for the whistling of wind, and then suddenly pick back up at double pace on your flawless landing. It sends a real chill up the spine and for me, at least, sends a chill up the spine and puts a grin on the face.\n\nSo, to break it down. Story, pretty good. Combat, so so, nothing extraordinary. But the platforming, and speed? 10/10.\n\nOn a personal note, if the developers should happen to see this, I think the rail segment of the facility has a really intriguing chance to be turned into its own thing. Racing games have lacked a unique angle for years now, and Valley might just secretly have what's needed to breathe some life into the genre.

To sum up the gameplay in a single idea - for me when I would ride in the car as a young girl, I would imagine running alongside the road, leaping from place to place with ease and joy. That is what Valley feels like. But it's so much more. \n\nIn Valley, you play as an investagive journalist (I think) who seeks to discover the truth about the \"Lifeseed,\" a mysterious mythic artifact capable of great destruction and creation. The game opens dynamically as your canoe topples down a waterfall. After crawling through a small cave, you emerge into a beautiful sunlit valley filled with deer, rabbits, and strange sprites. It is an exciting and appropriate opening that emphasizes Valley's two main themes: movement, and life.\n\nYou explore mysterious doors and run obstacle courses, but the main activity in the game is wonder. The feeling of running alongside a doe and her faun across the open meadow, bounding up the hill ahead of you and leaping into the air as a new landscape of the valley unfolds to you. \n\nThe game shifts often. The way you move in the valley is always changing and the tone shifts often from immersing you in the beauty and love of life and plunging you into truly terrifying places deep below the ground. There are a few notes that are missed that keep these moments from making Valley a horror game, but the atmosphere is there and the ultimate subject of the game is truly the stuff of horror stories. \n\nValley's overarching message is anti-nuclear and anti-war. The game gives you the mostly joyously free movement, power over life and death, and immortality and by the end, you are eager to give it up to stop the terrible power accumulating in the idyllic valley and what that power represents. You are eager to give it up because of how much the game immerses you in the joy of life. Honestly this game is remarkable. It is determined and powerful in its themes and message. It's not subtle, but it is graceful. \n\nSome notes: \nI like that you choose your gender at the beginning of the game. It doesn't impact the story at all, but it does wonders for feeling like *you* are there running alongside the deer and leaping through the air and controlling great and terrible powers and that is important in this game. \n\nI don't like the combat very much. It's simple and elegant and really there isn't too much of it. Mostly it serves as like, a jump scare or an abrupt change of tempo in the game. The issue is, the game achieves both those things better in other ways. \n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1486672722, "timestamp_updated": 1486672722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29807939": {"recommendationid": "29807939", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013424387", "num_games_owned": 653, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486666832}, "language": "english", "review": "I didn't think I was going to finish this game (not my cup of team).

Whilst not particularly difficult, soaring through the air after a well timed jump only to land and do it again, only much faster, is incredibly satisfying. Interesting level design made sure it never gets old either.\n\nThe game's narrative, although not it's strongest point, also added to the experience in a positive way. There is a mystery to uncover, as well as many secrets to discover hidden throughout the Valley. This gives you direction during the game, and the ending is well done too.\n\nCons-\n\nThe combat was stupid. No depth, it was just there to give you something extra to click at while running about. The enemies themselves were well designed (all three of them) but the way you go about disposing all of them is the same. You shoot them. Sometimes from so far away the don't even react.\n\nIt doesn't run fantastic. Multiple random frame drops throughout the game and my PC is nothing to laugh at. It doesn't ruin the game by any means, but it's still a nuisance.\n\nIt was disappointingly short. Although all the content that was there is high quality, there just wasn't much of it. You can draw out the experience by trying to collect everything and open every door, but if that isn't your idea of fun (I know it isn't mine), there isn't too much to see.\n\nConclusion-\n\nOverall, Valley is nothing short good and nothing more than great. It does what it does very well. And although I have to class it as yet another \"short and sweet indie game\" it's still a wonderful experience that is well worth the price.

But then an enthusiastic Jim Sterling recommendation of Valley caught my attention. I'm no Sterling sycophant, but in this case he was spot-on: Valley is an absolute gem, one of those rare independent games with little to no hype but mountains of high-quality heart. Oh, and it's actually FUN! Who doesn't want to run around the Rocky Mountains at breakneck speed challenging every deer you meet to a race and jumping over hilltops like a cow over the moon? And on this point, Valley absolutely nails the vertigo-inducing feeling of launching yourself into the atmosphere at inhuman speed and impossible height. The story is good, the lore believable, the voice acting superb, and the visuals are almost-Ethan-Carter pretty (playing at ultra widescreen 3440x1440 is nearly breathtaking). Sure, seeing the cute little pacman-ghost-like deamons flitting about the countryside almost gave me pause: Uh, is this some saccharine kiddie game dressed up in an action suit? Thankfully, the answer is no. Much to the contrary, the themes in Valley are actually steeped in death--well, the constant cycle of life and death. But the game somehow takes that gravitas and flings it into a positive, thrilling--and FUN--experience. First-person adventure seekers need not hesitate.\n\nPostscript-- I openly admit this is blatant nitpicking, but if I have really only one critique/suggestion for the game, it would be this: I'd bet a paycheck that the same actor who portrays protagonist Virginia King (reading her logs) is the same actor who does the recorded \"warning\" announcements at the various sites (Astra, Soma, etc.). Though EQ manipulation and distortion are used over the loudspeakers to hide this fact, it is pretty obviously the same person. I get it; good voice actors are probably pricey, and this is a budget title created by a small developer. But still...it would be a bonus to not have this (slightly) immersion-breaking element in the game. I only mention it because I like the game tremendously. And no, I'm not looking for voice work.\n\nPostscript postcript-- ...aaand, guess I just lost a paycheck. Just got to the credits at the end,  and I see that Virginia King and the announcement voice are two different actors after all--Claudia Lenz and Ashley Marie--but wow, they sound amazingly alike.

It's a shame that this game didn't get much attention. Valley could easily be confused for a 'walking sim' style game like Dear Esther or even Firewatch, and it might seem that way for the first few minutes, but it quickly becomes a fast moving platformer and eventually delves into some action as it takes provides some 1st-person shooter qualities. The way the abilities and combat draw from the same energy, including your health, made a really cool system of risk and reward.\n\nVisually, on a technical level and artistic level, Valley is fanstastic. Also, the performance is amzing and mind-boggling given the visuals and scale of the game. The story is pretty good and unfolds through a mix of audio logs and papers scattered about the world. If you don't care about the story, the game doesn't force you to it. The audio is great though I do have a massive issue with the ding noise while mousing over items in the menus. Holy crap is that loud even when the master volume is at ~20%. \n\nFor me, the biggest draw was the gameplay. I saw the trailer on Steam and thought it looked like a fast paced platformer, and it is. I wish Capcom would play this and take notes as to how they should make a Sonic game in 2017.

Ich schl\u00fcssele mal auf:\n\nBioshock:\nDie Story handelt von einem mysteri\u00f6sen Lifeseed, einen Trupp Soldaten aus dem zweiten Weltkrieg - inkl. fanatischen Wissenschaftler - und einen mystischen eingeborenen Stamm. Die Erz\u00e4hlweise durch Audiologs, Briefen und Umwelt scheint sehr stark an Bioshock angelehnt zu sein, auch wenn noch Feinheiten fehlen und nicht mit gro\u00dfen Plottwists zu rechnen ist. Hier wurde Potential verschenkt. Und es w\u00e4re noch viel mehr m\u00f6glich gewesen. \nGunplay gibt es auch, aber die Anzahl der Gegnertypen ist gering und die einzige Waffe ist der LEAF Suit. Auf Dauer fand ich die K\u00e4mpfe sogar etwas st\u00f6rend - aber nicht zu sehr. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist insbesondere bei K\u00e4mpfen sehr niedrig, ein Tod ist nicht wirklich bestrafend, sondern l\u00e4sst einen direkt weiterspielen. Ein paar B\u00e4ume wiederbeleben sollte aber drin sein. \n\nWalking Simulator:\nDer Begriff Walking Simulator ist f\u00fcr viele negativ besetzt, f\u00fcr mich nicht. Valley f\u00fchrt uns durch mehr oder weniger sch\u00f6n detaillierte Landschaften. Grafisch kommt es nicht an ein \"Ethan Carter\" ran, aber dass muss es auch nicht. Der Levelaufbau ist sehr linear, erz\u00e4hlt aber \u00fcberall kleine Geschichten. \n\nPortal: \nDer Leaf Suit erinnert schon sehr stark an Chells Anzug aus Portal. Spr\u00fcnge aus gro\u00dfen H\u00f6hen sind kein Problem. Es gibt viele kleine R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen und die werden durch Adrenalingeladene Sprung und Laufpassagen abgel\u00f6st. Die Schienenpassage im ersten Drittel ist \u00fcbrigens mein Highlight! Man kann auch ein paar Parallelen zu \"Story of my Uncle\" ziehen.\n\nWenn man erst einmal im Spiel drin ist, will man erst nicht mehr aufh\u00f6ren. Ich habe ca 80% des Spiels in einer Session durchgespielt und die Zeit ist an mir vorbeigerast. Leider ist es mit knapp 3h nicht sehr lang, gerne h\u00e4tte ich noch weitere Abschnitte gespielt. \n\nLohnt es sich? \nKurz: Ja \nLang: Wenn ihr den obigen Games und Genres etwas abgewinnen k\u00f6nnt, holt es euch. Man darf aber keinen Actiongeladenen Shooter erwarten. \n\nAchja: Die Medallienjagd ist ein Witz. Hat man die erste T\u00fcr (mit 30 Medallien) geknackt, kommt ein recht sinnfreies Update und eine zweite T\u00fcr mit 40 Medallien). Nachdem ich auf YT gesehen haben was sich dahinter versteckt bin ich froh dass ich meine Lebenszeit hier nicht verschwendet habe.

The sound of your feet on metal, wood, and grass, are all nicely done when compared to the same sounds in other games.\nSoundtrack - Stunning.  This is definitely a highlight of the game.  The soundtrack, just like the audio, is very nicely done.  Very relaxing and majestic.\nMechanics - Also great.  The suit that you wear just gets better and better throughout the game.

(The concept art work at the end credits is worth checking out too.)\n\nThe story isn't Earth-shattering (excuse the pun), but is well told and sufficiently engaging. There are notes scattered about if you care to read more into the story, but the majority is (very well) voice-acted in-game while continuing to play. This means there are no flow-breaking cutscenes, which was an excellent choice here; far more immersive.\n\nI thought the game length was ideal for the price. It felt varied, complete and rewarding. Without outstaying its welcome or intruducing 'padding' just for the sake of making the game longer. It's certainly not a challenging game; yet I still felt involved enough to play all the way through before I realised this.\n\nOn the negatives side, there were a couple of places where it was really unclear what to do; which were inevitably game-blocking. This in not unusual in this kind of game, and it's probably better than never feeling that you actually had to contribute something to progress.\n\nAlso, there is no save feature; instead checkpoints are used. This actually works really well while playing; being able to save before every single action would probably break the game considerably. The problem comes when you have to stop playing (yes; some of us do ;). Then you can only re-start and the beginning of the entire area, potentially losing considerable progress. \n\nA final negative is that I didn't enjoy the in-door sections nearly as much as being outside. Unfortunately, the majority of the game seemed to be played in some kind of 'facility' or another.

Even though there aren't any challenges or puzzles it could have done some real visual story telling. The environments look very good, but they aren't utilized to their fullest. You could have had the whole story told through what you were walking through without a word being told to you.

It was insulting seeing these texts pop up on screen instead of just letting me feel and decide this on my own. \n\nThe reason visual story telling would have made this game great is because the story being told was mediocre at best. It was also filled to the brim with cliche's. It's a very generic story where some evil scientist wants to make a weapon. The weapon is powered by the life in the valley, and the good guy must stop them. Another reason why the audio should have been cut out is because the characters aren't fleshed out enough to care for them or relate to. The bad guy wants to make the weapon to compete with the Manhatten Project. He does it because he's evil. The protagonist is along to document life. She see's the weapon is damaging to the environment and must stop the bad guy.

The devs are really good at making beautiful landscapes and this game is their talent utilized to its fullest extent. But the gameplay should always be the forefront of the attraction and this is where Valley really shines. The first-person running and platforming is amazing and the abilities are creative and fun to use. The whole game felt like one big rollercoaster from start to finish, flinging you through the air at fantastic speeds while whimsical music is playing. It's not a difficult game in the slightest, but this isn't a game meant to give you a serious challenge (other than finding all the collectables): It's a game designed to take you on a ride and not let go until the end credits, like Half-Life or Tearaway.\nIf I had any complaints about the game, it would probably be level design. The [u]amazing[/u] rail section is the only time where rails are used. The ability to run on water is only used for one long segment near the end. And yet the grapple and magnetic walls are used throughout. This isn't something many people would have a problem with, it's just something I noticed. But the worst parts of the game are the shooting segments. The game throws enemies at you and expects you to stop and fight them. They're tedious and I usually ran past as many as I could, especially towards the end. And the [b]boss fight[/b]. This game should [u]not[/u] have had a boss fight. \nThe story is interesting, not incredible but a good complement to the rest of the ride. I did appreciate how they tried to make the areas feel lived in, though. And the game letting you find out about what happened to the characters before it tells you about their fate was a great touch of storytelling. The game is kind of short, I beat it in one three-hour sitting. That being said, I don't think my complaints detract from the game enough for me to not recommend it to you.\nI don't think this game will make any top 10 lists of 2016, but I do think it will be a shining star on the big list of good games of this year.

It lets you go fast. And it feels amazing, going fast.\n\nYou go faster running downhill than uphill.

But the combat is not as much about defeating enemies as it is getting obstacles out of your way.\n\nSo what's playing this game like? Amazing. You're running through the valley at breakneck speeds. Or, you're swinging through a tall forest, with the next platform miles below you. Sometimes you're not moving as fast. Maybe you're exploring, looking for collectibles, maybe you need to fill up your energy.\n\nThe path is straightforward. Whether that's a plus or a fault is your interpretation. Moving around is the exhilirating part. There are some REALLY good movement parts in this game - look forward to those.\n\nBuy this? Yes.

At first there isn't too much of a story, you came here looking for a thing and you're gonna find that thing if it kills you, probably at least once (but then again not really.) After the story really ramps up, it just keeps getting more tense and adding more reason for you to see your journey through to the end and the finale certainly gives you a great payoff and sense of accomplisment.\n\nGraphics: Certainly one of the prettier games you can get and I ran everything maxed on a buget build PC so I doubt anyone will have much trouble running it (although there were some rare moments of slowdows.) The FX are wonderful throughout and the artwork and landscapes are fantastical while still remaining grounded in reality, you really feel like you're just running through an exceptionally senic location. \n\nGameplay: Its a mix of somewhat slower parkour with a few key parts that will really get your heart racing, a sort of FPS style battle but they generally pass quickly(this is all about discovery after all.) The movement of the L.E.A.F. suit felt very realistic for me and you can almost feel the impact whenever you land. It could get boring overtime but for this games shorter runtime, I think its perfect. Along the way you'll get multiple additions to your L.E.A.F. suit all adding new and interesting abilities to use HOWEVER I must deduct a few points in this section. Each addition you get, although fun and well thought out is left solely to certain sections(one upgrade of the suit is used only for one section of the whole game), I understand that could be a minor gripe but I just feel like given the world you're allowed to explore that there should be more creative ways to use these peices of technology such as along natural structures rather than the designated areas you are given.\n\nRuntime: I'd like to think I'm in majority in that I played through not nessercarily searching every single nook and cranny but also exploring anywhere I thought look fun so I guess the average playtime for your average person is going to be between 4-5 hours so take that into account when you buy. That said if you really want there are a few things left to discover hidden around although from what I personally saw there really weren't too many things hidden from sight. \n\nClosing: Vally is certainly a unique game and I'll get this out of the way now, its one I might play again in passing but not something I particularly think I'll ever return to so if you're looking for replayability, this may not be your game that said the single playthrough experience was plenty and I quite enjoyed it.\n\nBecause of the short run time, I'd suggest you try and play through the full thing in one sitting, the story certainly lends itself to a more full experience like that. I'd recommend the game for most people to at least try but just keep in mind you're paying more for what I'd call an experience rather than the average game.", "timestamp_created": 1481420518, "timestamp_updated": 1481421314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499429", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28296463": {"recommendationid": "28296463", "author": {"steamid": "76561197968626825", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481402879}, "language": "norwegian", "review": "Spennende, variert og kort.

ballistic missiles.\n\ni feel bad trying to kill anything since if i die i dont even wanna know what happens when the valley dies.\n\nthe acorns and medallions get annoying too. i hope i dont get caught out without enough of either when theres an upgrade to be found.\n\noverall theres a lot to think about while you're playing, with a narrator periodically speaking like she's from firewatch and not the 40s.\n\nthe game looks well-polished. soundtrack is great.\n\ngameplay wise i have to just power through it and hope it'll get interesting on its own.\n\ni still recommend it because jim

This was a blind purchase for me! Did it deliver on the devs' claim on being an adventure unlike any other or did it fail? Read on.\n\nStory - Not much is known about our protagonist other than the fact that he or she, is an archaeologist. What is known is that he or she is after a Life-seed, an ancient relic with amazing properties.  \n\nGraphics/Presentation/Sound - From the first minute of controlling your protagonist, you have a small hint of how beautiful the visuals will be. It's not the greatest graphics ever seen, but it isn't remotely bad either. Walk further along and one will get to see just how beautiful Valley truly is. The environment, some of the life that inhabits it, and colors are nicely done. Add the chirping and other sounds of nearby creatures, combined with breathtaking views when in flight (more on that later), you feel like you want to take a vacation here, never to return home. I have to admit, I have stopped to admire the visuals and sounds a couple times while playing. The music fits perfectly with the environment, and speeds up the tempo when danger is near. \n\nGameplay - You manage to find an exoskeleton suit called L.E.A.F. With it equipped, you have the agility and speed to cover a lot of area that would deem impossible for a regular man or woman. With your momentum, you dash on some land and leap off ramps to feel the breeze as you glide in the air. The suit also gives a god like ability to restore life, as well as take it away. See a dead lifeless thing, bring it back to life with some color. Want to take the energy away from said thing, do so and it becomes lifeless and dull again. Such power isn't unlimited as there's a meter that measures how much energy you will have. Run low on energy and you are powerless. Fortunately, you can look for energy orbs that are scattered throughout the world. There are enemies abound in this world. They will try to halt your progress to the life-seed. With your energy shooting abilities, you can dispatch them quickly and collect any loot that is dropped. As you travel in this world, you find upgrades for your suit to help you advance further. The game does an excellent job in making all of your abilities useful in some way. The excellent level design supports this in that you get to use most of your upgrades to advance and feel cool doing so. \n\nPros - The controls are excellent. When a game has outstanding responsive controls, it helps make the experience that much more enjoyable. As already mentioned, impressive visuals and sound makes the world come alive. The level designs are really varied and unique to your newfound abilities. Puzzles are not too difficult or frustrating to figure out. Useful upgrades work well to help you in your journey. This gives the game a sense of balance often missing in most other titles. The pacing is very good. From the characters you encounter, the voice acting is done well.\n\nCons - As beautiful as the world of Valley is, there are some cons. Lack of wildlife. Valley doesn't have as much wildlife as I thought it should. For such a big world with mountains, plush landscapes and terrain, and sea, I would have liked to have seen more in it. This is a minor con as it didn't take too much away from my immersion. Another gripe I had was that the enemies seemed fairly easy to dispatch. There's no difficulty settings to adjust from what I noticed. Anyone looking for a challenging encounter may feel like they want more.\n\nConclusion - I purchased Valley on sale (Cyber Monday), not knowing what to expect. The asking price however, is not unreasonable. You can finish the game in about 5 hours. The replay value is definitely there as you can speed run through if you wish to start over. Overall, with what Valley has going for it, the beautiful atmosphere, nice audio, unique level designs, excellent controls, and god like ability to take or give life, Valley is as the developers have stated, it's a game unlike any other!", "timestamp_created": 1480648329, "timestamp_updated": 1480711666, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673048", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28098874": {"recommendationid": "28098874", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070234511", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487353129}, "language": "english", "review": "A wonderful game with great scenery, It's truly a great game.

It is fun to use and you will acquire upgrades as the story unfolds, however, the level design, no matter how polished, restricts many abilities to self-contained areas. For example, one of the upgrades to your suit gives you the ability to run fast through certain marked tracks, but it comes too late into the game (which not only feels but actually is very short) and seems detached from the rest of the levels. Same with your magnetic ability. Why are \"these set pieces here and not in other places in the valley?\" is a question that you'll raise several times. Contrast this to the Portal gun in both 1 & 2, which is perhaps the only gimmick in your repertoire, and the games give you a great variety of uses with its environment even though you possess just one ability. Or, if not, try a comparison to Metroidvania-style games where each new ability gives you new opportunities to explore those games' worlds, designed around that very fact. Valley is not like that.\n\nThe story unfolds through audiologs, which is becoming quite a tiresome way of telling a story these days, but unlike Bioshock, you will not collect them (where you could very well miss some of them and still understand the backstory of those games) so much as be guided to them and somewhat forced to listen to them right there on the spot. The story leaves much to be desired, as it is very conventional and your silent protagonist dujour takes it all in and accepts it at face value, and for all we know he is just some random explorer who might as well be called \"Player: Your Name\". As for characters, there are none besides those mentioned in the logs. The premise that the environment itself can take the shape of a character is nice, but it's lacking and despite being titled Valley, you will spend half the game in decadent industrial settings. You will encounter many of the creatures called 'daemons' along the way, but you won't form a bond with them, even though they become central to the storyline right when the adventure comes to an abrupt ending, which is detrimental to your enjoyment of this \"wildlife\" you'll encounter through most of the game but won't have a clue as to what they really add to the experience until its too late.\n\nSomewhere in Valley there is a very good to even great game, but its flaws are hard to overlook. Despite great environmental design, quality voice acting, superb audio, and the amazing potential in the L.E.A.F. suit, it simply doesn't come together in the end despite the promise of a unique gaming platform.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed my time in the game, warts and all, and kudos to the Dev team, but I feel compelled to add a contrast to the mostly positive reviews the game has gotten since those warts can very well be deal breakers for other players looking for a different kind of game.

It's being set up for a sequel (I really hope so)?\n\nSo in short, it's a part platformer, part shooter, part \"walking simulator\" with some RPG elements (key word being \"elements\") as you collect items to open up certain areas and finding upgrades for your \"LEAF\" suit which acts as the mobility device throughout the game, as well as finding notes scattered throughout the game that give further exposition. The music is GREAT with some really memorable moments created by it working in conjuction with the gameplay. The life/death mechanic is also very inventive, and like the rest of the game, is satisfying to use.\n\nSatisfying. Entertaining.

The sound design, visual changes, and especially animation all blend together to form something exhilarating.

While [I]Valley[/I] certainly isn't an open-world game, the mechanics involved let you make your own playground. Equipment you get later in the game can also be used in earlier levels, both in developer-implemented secrets and with your own ingenuity. Now, this isn't to say that this game is difficult. In actuality it's incredibly easy; the few enemies that are involved move little and your health pool is easily replenished from sources in the environment, but as said earlier there are a variety of tricks and techniques you can pull off that require somewhat larger-than-average understanding of the game.\n\nThe story is simple and sweet, with enviromentalist tones and a decently enough developed romance wrapped throughout. If there's one criticism I have it's the game was too short, primarily due to the introduction of elements and questions from the narrative that were never addressed.

Interesting story given to you through narration, delivered well.  Play if you like collecting all the little widgets.\nDon't play if you're looking for: A first person shooter or complex puzzler.  Both elements are present, but they are by no means the focus of the game.\n\nValley is a game about the joy of moving fast and looking at pretty scenery, and it does very well in both respects.  It's rare to find a first person game that does movement and jumping puzzles well, and a lot of effort obviously went in to making it work.  It's more than just moving in the right direction and hitting the jump button at the right time: you pick up momentum by sprinting a distance, more momentum by going downhill (less uphill), and the direction of momentum when you leave ground plays a big role in where you'll go and how far.  Later mobility upgrades (such as double jumping, grappling hook, and other cooler upgrades I won't mention) increase the variety of puzzles, how you can approach them, and greatly extend those movements of blissful, sprinting through the wilderness joy.  The game encourages speed too: between the shape of the valley ahead, the energetic music that just started, and the wild deer running alongside you can't help but be pulled along.\n\nScenery and setting are done very well.  The scenery is a joy to explore and look at, from the close up to the distant skyboxes, and there were a lot of moments I stopped to stare (or moved to a better vantage point and did it there).  Indoor areas feel immensely large but that way do not interfere with movement and gameplay (more cramped areas would be difficult to navigate and break that feeling of freedom of movement).  A lot of games look good, though, what makes this one special?  The little ways that it presents you with this beauty: coming out in to the valley for the first time with the sun shining through the trees as the cave slowly opens up in front of you, hearing a door mechanism screech a few seconds before it opens, having your eye drawn to something important or impressive by a glimmer of light from a wandering sprite or the sun's reflection or a flashing emergency light; it's all perfectly designed to get you to look there.  And on that note, it's hard to get lost: there's usually something fairly unintrusive such as fireflies, lights, even the slope of the valley or shape of a peak that draws your eyes (sometimes without you realizing it) and says \"go here to advance level.\"\n\nThe game isn't perfect: it's a game about movement, but sometimes you're forced to stop and at that point it gets frustrating.  I want to run, you told me I could run!  Generally, narration is well timed, but occasionally it will pop up at a wrong momement and I would stop to listen because I didn't want to miss part of it or potentially interrupt it with another narration cue.  The game features collectibles, some of them scattered during joyous runs through valleys or underground pipes, and interrupting that to go poking in corners brings the game to a screeching halt.  You can go back to any previous level fairly easily to collect more things (in fact, you have to for some as they require later game upgrades), which is good, but there was little encouragement to me to do so which meant I got them the first time or not at all.  Occasionally, the overly large areas also get in the way of play: pretty to look at, but when you're still hiking around that giant mound two minutes later to see if there's a box or secret room hidden behind it that kind of sucks.\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable experience.

A tale is weaved of an abandoned WWII research facility and it's patrons, a results driven overseer, a group of elite soldiers known as the Pathfinders, and an archeaologist discovering secrets of the namesake Valley and a mysterious Lifeseed. You yourself, an archaeologist whom after a canoeing accident, finds yourself wandering this same valley, once stumbling upon the LEAF suit the Pathfinders had used, find yourself unraveling the mysteries buried within the Valley. The narrative of the base in its prime is told through audio logs and notes littered about the environments, from multiple points of view, all the while leaving the character just as intrigued as the player. While it starts off slowly, it becomes a rather compelling tale as time progresses.\n\nThe audio design is excellent. An orchestral soundtrack with a variety of themes, all fitting to the current situation you find yourself in. From slow, sweeping ambient backdrops to heart pumping banging overtures, everything is encapsulated very well in the sound design. The sound effects as well, from ambient noise to the sounds of the power suit, the archaic machinery springing to life, all of it is crafted excellently and unobtrusively. The voice acting, while not incredible, is still above average.\n\nVisually, the game is stunning. Vivid details in the surrounding area, excellent shaders and lighting effects contribute greatly to the aesthetic and charm of the game. The variety comes in between areas, with large open natural maps, to dilapidated military installations, to dark underground bunkers and caves. However, two of my major complaints come in the graphical department. One, the distant LOD textures leave a lot to be desired, especially in a game where many areas are so open you'll constantly be observing them. Secondly, while I understand the darkness in certain areas is there with good reason, many feel slightly too dark, leading to many a circle ran trying to find out where to go. Thankfully, with the latter, the brightness can be adjusted up in the menu if you don't mind a slight gray haze to everything.\n\nThe gameplay, as was said before, is simple. Once obtaining your LEAF suit, you're able to give and take energy from surrounding flora and fauna in order to progress, and throughout the experience, many upgrades will be found, allowing you to grapple, double jump, as well as increase your energy reserves. Taking energy from the environment however, is not without cost. Take too much, and the Valley's life meter diminishes, the same as if you miss jump and fall to your death. Let it fall too far, and on your next death, the Valley dies. Unfortunately, as the game is very forgiving and all in all, very low on the difficulty scale, the implications never feel too dire, as I'm sure they were intended to be. There are a multitude of secrets hidden in each map, between doors unlocked with golden acorns received from giving life back to the Valley, the plethora of lore notes and audio logs, and collectible medallions used to unlock an ancient ruin, some of which are gated behind later upgrades, you'll find yourself exploring each map time again. And though the game itself is relatively linear in where to go, there will be a few instances of having to evaluate your surroundings and the potential of getting lost, as there's very little in the way of signposting your direction beyond the occasional quest marker.\n\nThere is a combat portion in the game as well, though it isn't particularly complex or difficult either. Enemies will fire projectiles that sap your energy reserves until they are pacified by being hit with energy themselves. In many cases, combat isn't even required as if you have an idea where to go, the projectiles move slowly enough they can be avoided as you travel.\n\nIn conclusion, Valley is a game that didn't try anything esoteric or outrageous, but instead opted to provide a simple, but incredibly polished experience. It is an unfortunately short game, and the lack of difficulty can sometimes detract from the experience, but as a whole product, is well worth the time.\n\nStory: 8/10\nVisuals: 8/10\nAudio: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nOverall: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1478116920, "timestamp_updated": 1478116920, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562198", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26327009": {"recommendationid": "26327009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052952947", "num_games_owned": 239, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475615330}, "language": "english", "review": "very nice game  but kinda easy and short", "timestamp_created": 1477873195, "timestamp_updated": 1477873195, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481013", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26296958": {"recommendationid": "26296958", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005445918", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483334980}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but enjoyable.

Its feels more like a puzzle platformer (think portal) but there happens to be shooting as well.  Although, the shooting feels very peaceful.  I would even say, there is a bit of 'walking simulator' in this game too.  But that's a big caveat, the walking/running/jumping is WAY WAY WAY better than any walking simulator that I have played so far.  Primarily b/c jumping/running/grappling are so damn fun!\n\nOh, did I mention there is a grappling hook!  The grappling hook isn't free form though (which is a bit of a bummer) and requires specific mount points to use.  I'm ok with that though as I am guessing the game would be too easy if you could grapple anywhere.  \n\nWhen I started playing this game, I got the same feeling I did when playing the original portal (not portal 2, as I don't know why but portal 2 just wasn't as engaging for me as portal).  Maybe its the landscape, maybe its the great sound track, maybe its the unique little creatures, maybe its the elf like unity with the environment.  I don't know, but this game has the magic for me.\n\nOnto the performance.  Its not great but is still playable.  I get between 30 to 60 fps on my NVidia GTX 960 + Core i7-4770 3.4GHz + 16GB Ram runnong on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.  It also has that unity Setting screen before the game.  I don't know why b/c their in-game settings seem pretty decent.  It seems the developer would know how to turn off those settings since the game overall feels fairly polished (sans the frame drops).  I also experienced 1 game crash at the beginning of the game which made me go through the first section again (at least I had my suit so it was easy to repeat that first walk plus I took a slightly different route)  \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this title.", "timestamp_created": 1477459923, "timestamp_updated": 1477459923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578320", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26160838": {"recommendationid": "26160838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008281514", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477054861}, "language": "english", "review": "POSSIBLE MILD SPOILERS BELOW\n\nOk so: Valley. An uncut gem of a game whose devs need a second shot and a ton more money.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nNot bad. Good optimization. A very efficient use of polys, some great water effects, and kudos for showing a ton of grass/particles at a respectable distance without mutilating the performance (played on a GTX 960). It's not jaw-dropping but it more than does it's job. I've seen far worse FPS on graphics that were perhaps only slightly better.\nEnviromentally, the game is really pretty to look at, both when you're leaping across hills or exploring abandoned structures. There is much love evident in the crafting, as also shown by the beautiful concept art you see in the ending credits. Made me think of Elysium when i played Sacrifice, long ago not so very long ago.\n\nSOUND\n\nMajor point of strenght. The ST is very suggestive and also often dynamic. Pan-flute galore. There's perhaps a couple moments of annoyance where the game expects you to just run like crazy but you feel more like slowly exploring and poking around, yet have to deal with frantic rythms. That's hardly a flaw, though. Nothing bad to say about sound fx, either. Character voices are also good.\n\nPLOT\n\nNicely executed, but rock-bottom unoriginal and predictable. It has an enjoyable feel-good vibe (if you're into talks of nature and balance and preservation and mysticism and life vs tech etc., like me, otherwise it could just register as \"hippy bullcrap\") and some moments of genuine drama and tension, but it will hardly surprise you. \nThere are many entries from well-voiced characters and lots of docs to read, if you're into it. Major kudos for having chosen a system where the various docs' and diaries' text is just shown in mid-air when you mouse over them, without having to open each one. There is no journal to keep all those entries (not that i could find) but this way the whole thing is appropriately uninvasive for a game whose primary point is mobility.\n\nJust one thing i wish to say directly to the developers: there is a secret base in your game and you call it SOMA? Are you fucking serious? I hope that's some sort of knowing homage.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nHeh. This is where i find the game is at it's weakest. From the jumping puzzles to the combat, the challenge is absolute zero, unless you're really new to FPS. It all feels like a formality you have to go through to get to the next plot point (a plot that, as already said, is seldom rewarding). Unless you refuse to open the average loot crates and upgrade your suit's energy for some reason (the mobility upgrades are mandatory) soon enough you're virtually a god no enemy can threaten unless you really let them. \nAnd when you die... you actually don't: each death (you'll die mostly by slightly touching water) immediately respawns you and reduces \"valley health\" which you can quickly replenish by shooting lifeforce from your suit (more on that later) into dead things, like withered plants or animal corpses. And the game's enviroment does a great job in keeping you absolutely STUFFED with dat shit. I never once ran out of valley health and died for real, earning the achievement \"immortality\", which really didn't feel like one.\nIt is, however, a more elegant system than merely having you die and reload the last checkpoint. Kudos to every game that incorporates the dynamics of death and rebirth within it's own story mechanics.\n\nExploration? Zero. Which is perhaps this game's greatest shame. When i first heard of this game i thought it would've been set in a sandbox, and that would've been awesome. Instead you're pretty much railroaded everywhere, without even a faint illusion of true freedom. You can free-roam after you've beaten the story and find secret rooms/ledges using the fullness of your suit powers, but that's pretty much it. \n\nNow then: Suit powers. Your suit is this exoskeleton that basically turns you into Roadrunner. You can go crazy fast and jump crazy far when running downhill, you get a grappling hook, you can walk upside-down on magnetized surfaces, land from any heigth and even skip across water if you approach it at a low angle (but still, be extremely careful around the damn thing). Insane, right? Yet, given the railroading nature of the game, you really won't enjoy these abilities fully unless the game decides it's time. You really aren't that fast without a hill to run down from. IMAGINE how great this system would've been in a Far-Cry like sandbox, or in The Forest (punching one of those cannibal assholes in the face while coming at him at 100 kmh? Pure candy).\nThere are some truly exhilarating running sessions: but what is a point of strenght also gets across the point of weakness. You run like hell because there's pretty much nothing else you can do. The environment in that moment is shaped to allow you to run like hell, and in no other point of the game you can equally run like hell because you chose to.\n\nNow, on to more underused powers: your suit can both give and take lifeforce freely (WTF), in the form of this blue energy called \"Amrita\" (the water of ethernal life in hinduism. Nice to see the devs chose to come up with a name that makes sense and not something made-up and/or cheesy) which opens to some truly sick possibilities, yet the game's exploitation of them is skin-deep. You basically pac-man these light balls that are almost everywhere and charge your suit, then using either left or right mouse you can give lifeforce (which is also your one and only weapon against enemies) or take it, either from trees or wildlife. Such energy also acts as your health during combat, but by the time you meet enemies that can actually put a dent in it, you'll have unlocked reserves too massive to worry. \nThe game gives the Treehugger achievement for mending enough trees, and i guess it'll also give one if you play Gul'dan and drain the fuck out of X things, but there is no karma/morality system in the game to punish or reward either behaviour.\n\nBottom line: not terrible, really. I played far worse for far more. Such a shame to see big ideas and love crammed in a vessel so tight because of mere lack of means. The guys that made this game should be plucked from wherever the hell they are now and dropped in a major company's computer room, given all the toys and funds so that Valley 2 is a proper soil for their very good ideas to grow.

If you're looking for a FPS or RPG, this isn't it. If you're even looking for a game with a deep story, this isn't really it. But I have several reasons why I enjoyed this game so much. The game is just BEAUTIFUL. The sun rays peeking through the trees, the golden hues of sunset, the fall colored leaves and trees, the aurora borealis at night, the shimmering waterfalls, etc. Add to the scenery beautiful, serene music and this game is almost relaxing! Also, I found the game metaphorically beautiful as well. I can't even explain the warm, fuzzy feelings I got being able to breathe life back into a dead, broken tree or a fallen deer... you use the \"amrita\" energy and suddenly the dead trees are lush and full of splendor, and the deer stands up and gracefully bounds away. I mean, if you wore a suit capable of giving dead things life, wouldn't you use it? I know I would. The small amount of voice acting there was in the game was good, and I enjoyed searching for notes and supply boxes as I continued the story. Also, the key mapping for PC gameplay was very comfortable to me. WASD to walk, space to jump, left mouse button to give life, right mouse button to take it away. All in all, this game is not perfect, but it was a fun and enjoyable little escape from reality for me.

I will say it is a beautiful game and has fantastic music.  The music is especially worth noting.  It's seriously great.\n\nThe main issue I have with the game is that the story sucks.  I haven't finished it, mind you, but I don't want to because I don't care.  I won't give any spoilers but the story is generic as hell, and barely qualifies as a story, as there really aren't any characters, and the ones that exist (mind you, you only hear them through audiologs) are not rich, interesting characters, but mere nararrtors spewing out information about the land you are in.  There is no character development, no real struggles, just some audiologs about the weird place you are in, and a ton of notes that really don't serve the game well.  For example, notes between scientists telling each other to stop stealing the other's coffee or pens...\n\nThis game seems to want to be Bioshock very badly, but doesn't have combat, an upgrade system, or real characters, so you are left with a pretty world, a shitty story and audiologs.\n\nThe people harping about how fun the movement is blow my mind, as it's adequate but not something I give a shit about.  Playing a game like Prototype has 10x the satisfaction of movement.  Running down a hill and gaining momentum is not my idea of a thrill ride, and once you do a huge jump once you have seen what it has to offer (i.e. Assassin's Creed 1 tower jump).\n\nI bought this because I don't really give a shit about gameplay if a story is good, and couldn't care less about the next \"Call of Duty\" or whatever.

Seriously This game really amazed me from the beginning. The graphics mixed with the great story telling as you progress thru the game is just what I needed. I was hit by the feeling of nostalgia, while playing this game, it reminded me of a time when games didn't focus on just first person shooter genere, with crazy multiplayer perks. It took me back to a time when I was just a kid and would play a game that focused on a good story and caused me to feel creative in my own being. If you are looking for a game that is visually stunning, and has a great story linked to it, then I recommend this game to you. If you are looking for a game with a lot of action packed gun shooting, gun slinging, explosion extravaganza every corner you turn, then this game isn't for you. Yes Valley does have quite a bit of action experience as you play thru the game, but it doesn't focus on that primarly. The game focuses on telling you a story as you progress, with recordings that play on your exoskeleton suit and even notes left behind from people of the past, you are bound to get a immersive experience. Once again just disclaimer this game is more focused on showing you great visuals along with great story telling. I feel like the people who give this game a bad rating should have viewed the game from a unbiased stand point and under stand that the game isn't supposed to be like most games are like today.

AMAZING soundtrack. Really beautiful and lots of great music to listen to (the railways was my favorite moment of all with the music sync to gameplay)\n2. Many moments in game where you feel like you're running very fast and it is quite thrilling\n3. Very nice graphics for an indie game\n4. Great voice acting and level design\n5. Tutorial sections when you get upgrades to your suit feel natural and the game keeps flowing which is nice.\n6. Game runs really well, never crashed, no hitching, no fps drops.\n7. Overall a very peaceful experience at times and thrilling at others.\n\n-Cons-\n1. Like I mentioned, the game is short, only ~4 hours but I tried to explore as much as I could whilst I played. So if you really speed run it, it might be more like 3. Based on this I'd say wait for a sale.\n2. The screenshots look like you always get to go fast like sanic whenever you want but many moments go from running at incredible speeds to a sudden screeching halt where it's just normally paced which can be annoying after such intense high speeds.\n3. I found that some levels I explored too much and found that after doing some running and jumping over hills I ended up back at the beginning where I started. (luckily I Skyrim jumped my way back over) But this made me painfulyl aware of how \"on a rail\" this game is. Some points are open and some are really condensed with only one way to go.\n4. The story is told through audio logs and letters with story elements around the levels which I really don't care for as a means of storytelling\n5. Enemies really pose no threat, even the main boss of the game was really easy and the fight was over before I even knew it.\n6. Story is really generic, seen it a dozen times before\n\nAs far as the story goes it's nothing special. You're an archeologist that goes to find the \"lifeseed\" and in turn track it down to this valley, when you get there you find men and women were there during WW1 (or 2?) and were performing experiments in the valley, you go on a journey to find the lifeseed and find out what they were doing there.\n\nOverall the game isn't really \"Bad\" per say, just short and not really challenging. I'd say it is a fun and relaxing game to play but a sale when you buy it is a good idea. \n\nI'd give it a 7.5/10 for the gameplay\nA 5/10 for the story, something new to the genreral idea but nothing we aint seen before\n10/10 on the soundtrack, I bought the game and started playing and wanted to go back and buy it right away.", "timestamp_created": 1476229583, "timestamp_updated": 1476229919, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25989946": {"recommendationid": "25989946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154862632", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477133794}, "language": "english", "review": "Coming into this game you will enjoy the atmosphere set and the flexibility to progress at any speed.\nOnce you go fast you will never go back.

While looking for the Lifeseed, said to be powerful enough to shatter the Earth, you come across an old military crate.

[spoiler]Upgrades include the ability to run on water, along magnetic walls, a double jump, and increased top speed.[/spoiler]\n\nThe gameplay is actually kinda like a simplified Metroid Prime. Technically, you go from point A to B through the adventure, but you can go back to early stages to look for collectibles at any point. The game does introduce enemies pretty early on (and one of the screenshots does show this) but combat is never the focus of the game, the platforming is. [strike]Also worth mentioning: The game does NOT track your collectible progress, so trying to find the last ones for 100% completion can be quite tedious without a video walkthrough.[/strike]\n\nMy opinion: This one surprised me quite a bit. What initially starts out as just a platformer does take on different forms of gameplay as you go, with the rail sections being the most memorable, but overall it's a very solid adventure with some interesting gameplay to keep you engaged. [strike]Just don't expect a fun post-game (after the approx. 5 hr. story) unless progress for it is patched in later.[/strike] [b]EDIT: The devs added collectible tracking when you go to the level select, so ignore the crossed out parts.[/b]\n\n[b]Recommendation:[/b] As someone that has played some of the Sonic the Hedgehog games (which this has been compared to), this is the best first person equivalent yet.

The movement is excellent, and your character is always fun to control.\n\nI highly recommend playing this game through at least one time not looking for any secrets though, because they really do ruin the pacing and slow you down. Other than that the game is great.\n\n-----\n\nAs someone who really can't get into most survival horror, and especially hated the effects of slender on the internet, I almost dismissed this game outright based on its developers. After watching 4 minutes of Jim Sterling's video on it, though, I soon came around to wanting it. Though by the time I bought it, on sale for $14, I had forgotten what about the game made it so interesting to me.\n\nWhen I opened it up I was expecting a bog standard walking simulator, minus the needed plot. After a few minutes, I found the game's L.E.A.F. suit and soon remembered what made the game great. Valley isn't a walking simulator, but a running one, one where one must travel between points quickly by managing and balancing their inertia. One might compare it to Sonic the Hedgehog but I think a more apt comparison is the Marble Blast games.\n\nUnlike those however, Valley is beautiful. You will need a monster of a card to run it, I have a 660 and I was barely getting 60 fps at 1080p on low on the later levels (albeit at a very high fov since I am super prone to montion sickness). I think a 960/Rx 480 is nessisary for getting 60 fps on ultra, though. It's definitely not Ark bad though, and the game looks good enough to make up for it in my opinion.\n\nThe music design is excellent, mostly. It tries to match the mood of you or your character as you traverse the valley. There is one level where this is pulled off perfectly with it matching the tension and happiness of your character as he or she speeds down a railway. There were several sections where I missed the trigger to play the next song and was left with a few minutes of silence.\n\nThis happened because I spent a significant amount of time looking around for collectables and upgrades. If you do this you will both mess with the pasing of the game, and its scripting. For this reason I highly recommend just avoiding going out of your way as much as you can. To do this will require significantly more skill, since you won't have as many energy pickups, but will lead to a more satasfying experience overall, I think.", "timestamp_created": 1475961136, "timestamp_updated": 1475961136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25927951": {"recommendationid": "25927951", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052313304", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475849152}, "language": "german", "review": "Valley will mehr sein als es ist. \nIch bin recht unbefangen in das Spiel hineingekommen und es machte die ersten 10 Minuten einen passablen Eindruck. Grafik ganz gut und der Sound angenehm.\n\nKurze Vorinformation: Das ist die erste negative Kritik, die ich verfasse. \nUnd ich habe mich lange gescheut diese zu schreiben, doch jetzt bekommt ihr eine volle Breitseite meiner Ansichten!\nSorry wenn dieser Text unn\u00f6tig lang wird (wird er).\n\nEs hat Potential, das es nicht ausnutz und Spielmechaniken, die man meiner Meinung nach anders einbringen h\u00e4tte k\u00f6nnen.\nEs k\u00f6nnte mehr sein, will es auch, ist es aber nicht.\nDie Story ist meiner Meinung nach fast zu vernachl\u00e4ssigen und sehr Klischeebehaftet (dazu sp\u00e4ter mehr).\n\nEs wird geworben mit einer lebendigen Welt, in der man Leben manipulieren kann und der eigene Tod das Verderben des Tals sein kann. Soweit stimmt das.\nDas Tal hat 10 \"Lebensbl\u00e4tter\". Stirbt man verliert der Ast mit den Bl\u00e4ttern zwei Bl\u00e4tter, die durch wiederbeleben der Natur wieder hergestellt werden k\u00f6nnen. Und hier haben wir schon einen gro\u00dfe L\u00fccke: Es stehen \u00fcberall tote B\u00e4ume rum und es scheint das Tal nicht zu k\u00fcmmern. Erst wenn man stirbt und diese wiederbelebt tritt der vermeintliche \"Untergang des Tals\" in Kraft und es verliert Bl\u00e4tter.\nAndererseits kann man vorher 10000 B\u00e4ume wiederbeleben und trotzdem wird das Tal 20% Leben bei deinem Tod verlieren. Diese Mechanik ist entweder schlecht durchdacht oder soll einfach nur irgendeine Art von Challenge reinbringne. Meiner Meinung nach ziemlich schlecht umgesetzt und auch nicht glaubw\u00fcrdig der Welt gegen\u00fcber.\nUm \u00fcberhaupt Leben zu manipulieren braucht man Orbs, die sich \u00fcberall auf der Map befinden und scheinbar nach spawnen (Story erkl\u00e4rt sp\u00e4ter warum). Das hei\u00dft ein wirkliches Energieproblem hat man nie, und selbst wenn einem die Energie mal ausgehen sollte, kann man Tieren und B\u00e4umen Leben entziehen auf Kosten des Tals.\nIn diesem Fall greift wieder: \n-Du entziehst 10 B\u00e4umen Leben und das Tal stirbt fast, obwohl du vorher deutlich mehr B\u00e4umen Leben geschenkt hast\nTriffst du nicht mit deinen Energieorbs die toten B\u00e4ume oder Tiere verschwinden diese einfach im Nirvana.\n\nDann der L.E.A.F. Suit\nes k\u00f6nnte so sch\u00f6n sein, allerdings wird einem nur in bestimmten Situationen ein wirklich interessantes Upgrade gew\u00e4hrt.\nMan kann unendlich lange schneller laufen, h\u00f6her springen und einiges mehr.\nMan beschleunigt nur wenn es bergab geht, oder wenn eine Rampe vor einem ist. Oder wenn eine Rampe auf dem H\u00fcgel ist und du bergauf laufen musst. Meeh.\n\nVor jeder neuen Herausforderung findest du genau was du suchst!\nOh die Klippe ist zu hoch? Ah hier direkt vor der Klippe ist das Upgrade welches du brauchst.\n\nDa ist Wasser und du kommst nicht weiter?\nEine Kiste! Hiermit kannst du f\u00fcr begrenzte Zeit \u00fcber Wasser laufen! Mach das noch 10 mal, damit sich das Upgrade auch lohnt! Gut das vorher solche Herausforderungen nicht da waren.\nDazu noch folgendes: Es wird gesagt man kann nicht in das Wasser, da der Anzug zu schwer ist. Ok akzeptiere ich.\nAber wenn einem ein Upgrade gew\u00e4hrt wird um \u00fcber Wasser zu laufen, ist dies doch eher der Geschwindigkeit zu verdanken und nicht der Energie die der Anzug noch hat (Vorher gab eine keine zeitliche Begrenzung f\u00fcr die Upgrades, nur Energiekosten)\n\nDas Spiel will soviel innehaben und doch wirkt alles nur hineingezw\u00e4ngt als h\u00e4tte jemand gesagt: Macht alles rein und guckt mal was passiert.\n\n\n\n\n\nSPOILER!!\n\n\n\n\n\nDie Story handelt vom gierigen Milit\u00e4r, dass den Lifeseed besorgt hat um unendlich Energie daraus zu schlagen um den Krieg zu f\u00f6rdern. Punkt.

For those that like game that let you move fast, it's like Sonic the Hedghog mixed with Tribes ascend, except not as good as either.\n\nThe movement has that very irritating \"Bounciness\" where if you are running really fast and hit, say, a 3 inch rock, you will go sailing 30ft in the air. This isn't usually that big of a deal, but at one point the game literally has you speed boosting over large moguls, and instead of running, you just keep flying off and have to repeatedly build up your speed.\n\nYou also die in like an Inch of water. If you miss a jump by a hair (which is hard to do because your speed is always changing and it's hard to get a reference point) your big toe will touch the water and think it's to cold, causing you to instantly die.\n\nEvery character in this game is also dumb as a sack of bricks. This is especially bad when the main character pops up one of his box blurbs that just states LITERALLY what we already just heard. EX: Audio log \"I am going to betray someone.\" Cue our character poping up one of their moronic statements \"I wonder if that person was planning on betraying someone?\" This is never worse than the main point of the story. I'm going to put it in spoiler tags, but It's seriously not even a spoiler if you have wached any movie focused on a magical forest in your life: [spoiler]Early on we find that they are trying to make weapons for the war using the magic spirit energy from the forest. When things start to die, OBVIOUSLY IT'S THE BIG LIFE SUCKING REACTOR YOU BUILT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DARN PLACE!!! [/spoiler] the fact that it takes hours for every character to come to this conclusion is downright PAINFUL!\n\nThe gameplay is pretty fun though. Other than the afformentioned bouncing problem, it flows pretty nicely. It would have benifitted without collectables, as collecting things really breaks the pace which is supposed to be really fast and kenetic. The grapaling hook is pretty bad though. It could have searved as more of a hookshot/blink type transportation, zooming from point A to point B and would have felt fine, or even just a normal rope/lasso, but instead we get this weird rubber band... thing, where you move in a streight line directly from where you are standing, past the anchor point, and then bungie chord back.

They're wrong though: there are many moments of pure movement bliss. I don't normally pay attention to blurbs, considering them to be about as useful as a jelly brick, so imagine my surprise when, while I was playing, I was in pure awe at the sheer fun of the game. Just running along at insane speeds, afraid to blink lest I miss something, leaping across chasms and flying through the air like some beast...\n\nValley's a short game. As I write I've got 15.5 hours logged, about a third of which is hunting for missed collectibles. For all that it's not very long to play through it, it's rich in story. Some minimal combat scattered here and there to break things up, but it's the least part of the game. What's fun is [i]moving[/i]. I don't want to go too much into it so as to not spoil the surprises, but this game encourages you to [i]speed[/i]. And it's sheer bliss the whole time. Imagine, travelling (according to the game) at 110 miles per hour and suddenly hitting a slight upwards ramp, only to find yourself soaring one hundred feet in the air without even having jumped, passing over gigantic trees, slowly returning to the ground like you're coming down at an extremely low orbit, and then landing still at top speed and charging down a hillside only to [b]do it again and again[/b]...\n\nDoesn't sound like much to base a game on, but it's pure fun, and it keeps bringing me back. Best of all, once you're near the end of the game, you get to explore all the old areas all over again, going over the places you missed and discovering all new secrets that make the game even better. And since it's a wide open world instead of claustrophobic hallways (most of the time), then you'll have plenty to explore to find all those tiny little secrets.\n\nWhich is a bit of a downside. There are, barring 'upgrades' for the L.E.A.F. suit, two types of collectibles. One is trivially easy to get and can even be farmed beyond what you'd ever need, and the other one is scattered across everywhere in everything. You need 70 out of the 80 of them, as there are apparently ten extra, but when your collectibles are kept in little boxes that are insanely easy to miss when you're moving at blurred speeds, soaring through the air, unable to see what's on the ground or behind that inconvenient rock or on that distant island that you missed when you blinked... the collecting is a bit tedious. The game is about speed and movement, and to enjoy it you have to go really fast to get places, and then stop. Kind of kills the buzz.\n\nStill, those moments of bliss are worth it. The full price might be a tad much, but I don't regret the 30% off I bought it at.\n\nAstute readers will have noticed I don't really mention any of the other gameplay elements, like the health/life system or the various suit upgrades. The former's not super important and the latter is best left to discover as you go. I know I'm casually dismissing something that's constantly used, but it's simply [i]there[/i], and for the upgrades I wouldn't want the surprises spoiled if it were me! Half the pleasure is suddenly being able to do something amazing and using it to the fullest.\n\nIt's a fun game. Especially if you've done some Tribes \"skiiing\" and loved it. It's that on overdrive. Wait for a sale and give it a shot. It's short lived, but it has moments of pure ecstasy.

For one thing, I can't imagine any possible way anyone could play this game in less that 10 hours!  Maybe a replay where you run as fast as possible and don't try to find any items along the way.  I'm not sure how long I played (doesn't show!?) but I know it must have been close to 15-20 hours, and I thought I was going at a fair pace too, but then I'm more of a casual player than an expert gaming master.\n\nThis is a first person adventure game with a little bit of everything - running, jumping, a sort of puzzle solving in path decisions, grav boots, grappling hooks, aqua boots, and super high speed running - which I really enjoyed!

The maps are well-designed, but occasionally seem a bit too large and physically stretched out near the end, but not too much.  Interesting site-seeing, unusual topographic artifacts, good story, a beautiful score, and overall a very good and classy game that would be well worth a AAA title cost, for me.\n\nOn a 10 point scoring system, I'm giving this game a solid 8.\n\nA higher score would be given for a more complete ending (it's a little abrupt!), a more forgiving respawn system (because the grappling effect can be very tricky in quick sequencing), better fade-outs for the score changes, and a little less rambling around, and a little more getting to the point (I'd rather have a tight game with less fluff, than a longer game that felt like it had pointless padding).  I'd like to have seen a bit more resolution and explanation for some of the interesting creature and forest issues, which could have been made in to a nice ending with more closure, a little denouement, if you will.\n\nSo if adventure gaming with less shooting than a typical FPS, exceptional graphics, good story, level design as good as most AAA titles, interesting and unusual gaming elements that lasts a fair amount of playing time - I would highly recommend this game, and if it's on sale - it's an absolute must buy and try, IMO.", "timestamp_created": 1475757040, "timestamp_updated": 1475757040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25880610": {"recommendationid": "25880610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093334059", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488099937}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply amazing. 10/10.

I highly recommend this game if you like a fun FPS action adventure game.  Here is my breakdown of what I think of all the parts:\n\nThe Graphics and visluals were very good and well done.  My only issue was vysnc did not always work 100% so I got some screen tearing at time but not enough to make it awful.   I loved the world they created.\n\nThe sound and music in the game was also done well too.  Some times it was even down right creepy.  They did a good job with the sounds of your metal feet when running over different materials.\n\nThe gameplay is where this game was a blast to play. It was so much fun to run and jump in this game.  I really enjoyed giving life back to trees and animals.  You find upgrades to your LEAF suit and get rewarded for looking everywhere.  There is combat in this game and was not too hard either.  The death mechanic was a new one in that when you die so does some of the world, so keep giving back life to make up for it.\n\nThe story is good and told through papers and film reels throughout the game world.  I found it fun looking for the next piece of the puzzle and watching it unload as you progressed in the game.   \n", "timestamp_created": 1475719244, "timestamp_updated": 1475719244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25877907": {"recommendationid": "25877907", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970653312", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475715784}, "language": "english", "review": "A charming and enjoyable little game, I had a lot of fun with it.", "timestamp_created": 1475716004, "timestamp_updated": 1475716004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25877528": {"recommendationid": "25877528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067070008", "num_games_owned": 238, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476925937}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is fairly straight forward and easy, but it is incredibly fun.

I know the game calls the Power Legs the \"LEAF Suit\", but the acronym that it stands for (as told to you in brief cutscene that manages to last far too long & be far too aggravating) is such an absolute insult to the player's intelligence that I'm pretty sure each word knocks a point off of the IQ of anyone who hears it.\n\nBut anyway.\n\nNow you have the Power Legs.\n\nYou have the TOUCH.\n\nYou have the POWER.\n\nYou are the Flash mixed with Usain Bolt mixed with perhaps a certain type of land mammal with spines that is known on occasion for being expedient & fighting evil doctors who wanna bend nature to their will or whatever. (This is a very relevant comparison, as the game's main antagonist ends up being every bit as cartoonishly evil in his nefarious plots to harness the power of the Valley to accomplish his own nefarious plans- namely, making a literal Spirit Bomb via the power of Nut. Did I mention that? Your character's motivation for this journey, as explained in the opening cutscene, is that he's searching for the Life Nut. God, I wish I was making this shit up.)\n\nSo you roll around at the speed of sound for a bit and almost entirely give up on looking at the pretty scenery because it's flashing by too goddamn fast for you to make anything out anyway, and it's a blast. \n\nThen, you start climbing a mountain for some reason, which is not at all conducive to going fast at all, so it's pretty lame. You get a grappling hook, but it's a shitty grappling hook, & any game with a shitty grappling hook is almost always a steaming load, something Valley doesn't entirely manage to redeem itself of.\n\nSince the grappling hook sucks, you may realize some of the game's advertized mechanics do indeed exist- namely, if you die, you respawn at the cost of some of the Valley's \"health\"- but they're almost entirely inconsequential as you can refill this health bar within seconds of respawning. They say that dire consequences will befall you should you sacrifice the Valley to save yourself, but I'm pretty sure nobody will never find out what said consequences are unless they deliberately hurtle themselves off of a mountain a few dozen times to do so.\n\nOh yeah, you climbed the mountain. Now you get to play \"wander slowly through the dingy corridors for far too goddamn long\" and \"feel absolutely none of the tension the game is desperately trying to build because there's literally nothing here\" while the game's shitty, shitty story unfolds itself. Thankfully the devs were kind enough to add an option to skip story elements entirely when replaying maps, so you're not forced to suffer through the---the---Shut up shut up SHUT UP YOU ARE A SHITTY CHARACTER WITH SHITTY MOTIVATIONS AND I DON'T WANNA HEAR YOU TALKING IN MY EAR WITHOUT MY CONSENT ABOUT YOUR ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS AND POORLY WRITTEN GARBAGE THAT /ISN'T EVEN HAPPENING RIGHT NOW/, SHUT UP, GO AWAY, THIS IS HARRASSMENT, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n...\n\nSo yeah. Dingy corridors. The game wants to be Bioshock or something all of a sudden. It sucks.\n\nThen you get to the SPEEEEED TUUUUUBES.\n\nWait, maybe something happened between then and now? I don't remember. \n\nSPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED TUUUUUUUUUUUUUBES. \n\nHighlight of the whole game, in my opinion, and even though you're in a grungy underground tunnel, some of the game's best creative direction shines through here. Not just in the art, but in the music. You're not just going fast, you're SUPERCHARGED, sparks are flying all around you, the music knows exactly what you're doing at all time, a high-tempo piece that gets more intense the faster you go & swells and crashes perfectly in time with your danger-filled jumps over giant chasms & really enforces the feeling that YES, this is what the game is about, it is about being fast and awesome and everything else is just filler, just RUN! \n\nAnd then the Speed Tube Fun Time is over & everything else is kind of depressing in comparison, aside from any other SPEEEEED TUUUUUBE encounters you may have. \n\nLet's see, uhh, next, you uhh... There's something about walking on walls, and uhh... can I go back to the Speed Tubes yet? Please? Oh, I can run on water for a bit now if I have enough speed built up? That's cool, I guess...\n\nAnd then you do... something... (I can't even remember, it felt so inconsequential) to fix the things Mr. Evil Cartoon Villain messed up some 60 years before you ever arrived on the scene; and your character walks away from it all empty handed- and I mean entirely empty handed, he even discards his Power Legs, because he's apparently a stupid jackass who hates fun- and... game over. It's done, folks. You can replay everything, you can hunt for tokens that unlock doors in a temple on one level that apparently contains (useless) bonus upgrades- I only bothered to hunt down enough tokens to open the first door, which gave me unlimited use of the shitty grappling hook that was absolutely no problem to use in the first place before giving up. Maybe the other doors had something a little less depressing, but I personally don't intend to find out.\n\n\"So\", you may ask, \"why the Thumbs Down? It seems like outside of its problems you absolutely love the game!\" To which I must say, well, yeah. As I said, the good things are great and the bad things are utter shit. But the biggest factor into my thumbs down has to be the play time. With 23/30 achievements unlocked, nearly fully upgraded Power Legs, as well as several secrets & aforementioned Bonus Tokens, I've only spent 7 hours in the game. 2 of those hours were probably spent replaying the SPEEEEED TUUUUUBES. The game is depressingly short. A straight run through of the game with minimal time spent upgrade-hunting & replaying the SPEEEEED TUUUUUBES would probably last about 3-4 hours, tops. Maybe even less. I've probably spent longer writing this review than it'd take to do a direct runthrough. And at $20, that's not the best money-to-game ratio you could ask for, and it compounds the negative aspects of the game into absolutely crippling problems that the positives don't balance out, but instead end up leaving you feeling short-changed & making you wish there was more.

Personally, I like it just for the storyline and atmosphere it sets. It's a fascinating tale it spins of life, death, jealousy, human hubris, victory at all cost and love.  The music is top notch.\n\nAs for the mechanics? Not as satisfying as I had hoped. The game has a marvelous sense of movement. You really feel like you have mechanical legs, landing with a satisfying metal thud and leaping across hills, lakes and chasms is utterly exilerating, but there's very few situations where the game's marvelous sense of movement counts. 80% of the time in this already very short adventure, you're just trudging through bland rooms and while there are very memorable moments, god knows why the Dev didn't seek to repeat those more often. Furthermore, the shooting and enemy mechanics are non existant.\n\n\nI'm absolutely torn between these two qualities and if I had the option, I'd leave this review without a negative or positive recommendation.

It's kind of hard to pin it to an exact genre, but I suppose it's a mix between FPS and platformer.  It's probably not going to blow your mind, but I found it a lot of fun.  Basically, you're given a suit of power armor that has all kinds of weird abilities (like super fast running and jumping) and asked to traverse a bunch of levels with it.\n\nIf I had to pick one flaw, it would be the lack of difficulty.  This isn't really an issue for me, I don't mind \"easy\" games, but if you're looking for a challenge, this probably isn't going to provide it.  The shooting is pretty rudimentary and you get enough health upgrades to make most encounters fairly easy.  The platforming is also pretty easy, and though there are a few instant death pits that might get you, the penalty for dying is pretty light.\n\nHowever, while it might not be super challenging, I thought it was pretty fun.  You're given enough abilities that make moving around the world feel exciting and interesting.  While the platforming didn't make me sweat, it did get me to say \"wheeeee\" a bunch of times.  It's hard to describe, but I defintitely found a lot to like in the movement mechanics in this game.\n\nThe story is decent, if a bit cliche.  The visuals can be surprisingly gorgeous at times, and the soundtrack is really nice as well.  The level design is kind of middling, sometimes being really exhilirating to move through but boring to look at, and sometimes being really pretty to look at but kind of tedious to actually traverse.  I did like the touch that allows you to choose if the main character is male or female; since the game is in first person, it doesn't change much aside from the  \"oof\" noises you make when you get hit, but it's a nice feature.\n\nOverall, I really liked this one.

The game opens in a big, hilly valley, so it's easy to build up momentum and you've got a lot of space to run in.

There's a few areas where you get to go pretty fast, but they're all pretty on rails, sometimes literally.\n\nThe game's more of a point and click adventure than a platformer.  And even then, I can hardly remember any of the puzzles.  You spend most of the time picking up notes and listening to audio tapes.\nThe story was okay, a bit of a cliche.  Evil WW2 scientists use magic to try to build super weapons, nothing really new.  \nCombat is also pretty braindead, enemies are all really weak and simple to fight.\n\nI had fun, but I don't think the game is worth 20 dollars.

Didn't even know it existed. A friend of mine raved about the game the day it was released, and I got it the next day.\nI can't believe there wasn't hype for this game.\n\nThe graphics of this game are gorgeous. Unfortunately, they are also a bit hard on some computers. I am stuck on a laptop that, even on medium settings, lags a bit with the graphics.\n\nThe music is also beautiful. If you are into game soundtracks, I highly recommend this one. The soundtrack is also on Youtube, if you want to check it there before committing to it.\n\nThe gameplay is so, so satisfying.\nThe game incorporates some physics a lot of games don't, such as accelerating you if you are moving downhill, which in turn has an enormous impact on your flight distance if you jump. As a result, you get to soar through some very gorgeous scenery.\nThe life/death mechanic is something I haven't seen before in a game, [spoiler] and though I feel like they could have done a bit more with the life-taking mechanic [/spoiler], I rather liked it.\nCombat is not particularly challenging, as this game is more focused on story and atmosphere. If you need a game to punish you to like it, Valley may not be for you. For those of us who are not masochists, this should not be a problem.\n\nWhile I am not finished with the game, if you explore as you play, this could be a longer game (I had some friends try out the game, so my current play time is a few hours shorter than what is listed). Someone who speed runs this game could potentially finish in only a couple hours. Take that as you will.\n---\n\nOverall, if you like exploration games with fun gameplay and story, I HIGHLY recommend this game (and soundtrack).

If you're a casual gamer like myself, this game will be sure to be a hit!  I just completed my Let's Play series and it's available [url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_8AuschIyY1DbEFilKjqse8ZkguOvOF4]Here on YouTube[/url] if you'd like to check it out - including the Medallion Temple reveal!\n\nOn to a bit more thorough of a review.  On my first playthrough of the game, it was very easy to get engrossed in the storyline.  Any enemies you encounter are fairly easy to dispose of, but add a level of stress to the game that makes it just a little more challenging - and really embraces the thoughts of the characters you read about in the notes along the way.\n\nI felt particularly taken in by the way the main story is told in a narrative, at critical points in the game and it was done very well.  At points, the sound effects alone are enough to get the heart really pumping!  All of that being said, I did have to go back and re-play a majority of the game to get some of the medallions, and it was still a riot.\n\nI think I developed stockholme syndrome and a touch of paranoia in doing so, though.\n\nThe only thing I didn't really like about the game is that there are certain things that are generally anti-climactic.  When you expect to finally have reached a point in the story line, it gets pushed back just a little further out.  No big deal, really.  It added a little suspense.\n\nI logged 20 hours on this game and ended up with 25/30 achievements.  There's still room for some replay, but I'm a bit burnt out!\n\nFor the $20?  A+ game, and Blue Isle did an incredible job.

There are remnants of an old American WWII science team and WWII army units who used exosuits called the L.E.A.F. suits. Able to run incredibly fast, jump incredibly high, able to manipulate life & death itself, there is a lot you can do with the L.E.A.F. suit.\n\nThis is a game that's best played without knowing much about it going in. I didn't spoil anything in my description that you wouldn't have figured out in the first 5 minutes of playing or from the store page trailer. Part of the appeal of it to me personally was all the mystery and wonder of the game world Blue Isle Studios built. I won't talk too much more about the story but I will say that this game has a ton of platforming, secrets and suit upgrades. The game is also beautiful to look at and the soundtrack is perfect for it. The best words I could use to describe the soundtrack during some parts of the game is \"enchanting\" and \"whimsical\". The music is adaptive, meaning it changes with your actions. During certain parts, if you're running and jumping the music will change to reflect that. Lastly, this is NOT a walking simulator. There is a combat system in place that you will learn how to use fairly early on, as well as some really fast paced sections that are a treat to play through.\n\nI highly recommend this game and it's definitely one of my favorites this year. It would have totally been out of sight, out of mind if I didn't watch Jim Sterling play the first 5 minutes of it so credit to him for turning me on to it. Game length averages anywhere from 4-6 hours if you breeze through it but it can last a few more hours than that if you look for all the secrets and go for all the achievements. You can return to any previous area you've been through via fast travel so there is absolutely nothing keeping you from going back and collecting everything. Whether you feel that length of game time is worth $20 I'll leave that up to you but I do not regret my full price purchase.", "timestamp_created": 1472827538, "timestamp_updated": 1472828695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25301497": {"recommendationid": "25301497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275354386", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482652162}, "language": "english", "review": "This game looked beautiful and was very fun.", "timestamp_created": 1472809157, "timestamp_updated": 1472809157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25296642": {"recommendationid": "25296642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067393128", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 283, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472778861}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the most original and engrossing games I've ever played.

My biggest issues are it's really short and offers no replayability.  The timer says I clocked 7.3 hours in the game, but I beat it in about 5 hours or so.  I ran around for a while after beating it to try to find the rest of the upgrades and get achievements, but got bored and quit without finding all the \"acorn doors.\"\n\nWhat the game does right (mostly):\n\n- The story idea is interesting.  It's not really all that fleshed out in the game, and some plot points that are hinted at never really turn into anything.\n\n- The controls for jumping and running feel decently fluid.  The grappling hook was a little buggy/imprecise for me.\n\n- No game-breaking bugs at launch.  I fell through the world and got stuck once, and some geometry was a little glitchy, but nothing major since it takes no time at all to run back to where you were.\n\n- The voice acting is not terrible.  The guy doing the voice-over for the Fallout-esque \"L.E.A.F.\" videos is pretty bad, though.  He's not fooling anyone with that accent.\n\n- Fall damage?  YOU are the fall damage.\n\nWhat could be better:\n\n- The game could use actual combat*.  Your toughest foe is water.  This is a walking simulator with some running and jumping.\n\n- Because there is no combat, the game is laughably easy.  There's a reason why there is no difficulty setting.\n\n- It would be nice if the map would indicate when you had found all upgrades and \"acorn doors\" in a particular zone.\n\n- Too much of the game is underground and/or in tunnels, and it's so dark in there...\n\nIn conclusion, I guess I just wish there was more to this game.  The first time you do a downhill momentum running jump, it's actually very cool.  Unfortunately, after the novelty of that wears off, you're left with a pretty bare bones game.  Is it worth $20?  Well, I don't regret buying it, so I guess that's a yes.  If something else really good was on sale right now, I might feel differently.\n\nIt should also be noted that $20 will get you 40 of the best/worst tacos from Jack in the Box.

There have been few games over the past few years that have gotten my adrenaline punmping and all with minimal combat and no cutscenes. Some will write this game off as a walking/running simulator, but it is much deeper. You'll explore, upgrade, engage in light combat and there are even puzzle elements. Moving through this game is exhilerating and while there are invisible walls to hit, it is no easy task to do so. Everything feels open and flowing, even when the path is actually linear. \n\nIt is a bit short, story-wise, but exploring and collectables will add to playtime. Audio recordings fill you in on the story as you progress, but you can find notes hidden throughout the game that give you more background.\n\nThe game is not perfect. The are some glitches here and there and sometimes the freedom of movement can actually work against you as I found several places where I was able to get into areas I wasn't supposed to be able to access yet and got stuck as a result. Also it is very easy. The game makes a big deal about balancing life and death of the valley, but energy orbs are plentiful and regenerate so I never really risked running out of energy. If you die, the valley will lose some health as a result, but restoring a half dozen trees will bring it back to full.

First off I'll say I love this game, it's so incredibly well designed.

You can either fly through it running blazing fast, or stop to take in all the details. The game mechanic itself is really unique and well designed, allowing for lots of exploration. One neutral is that the story can be played through in about 4 or 5 hours. The reason that this is not a con is that you can go back to every location and re-explore, and with suit upgrades you can reach areas previosuly unavailable. I won't complain about the price either, as it was only $20.00. For the experience I had, I would say that is worth it. It's really the most fun I've had in an adventure/puzzle game since Portal 2. The only con (to me) is the fighting mechanic, it's not bad, it's well designed, it just gets a little boring.

With a fun focus on movement, it is certainly a good, if somewhat brief, time. \n\nThe difficulty in the game is very low, and though there are combat elements within the game, the combat is hardly a central part to the game, and can hardly be called combat. The real joy of the experience is certainly within the fast paced freedom of movement. \n\nIt's a little on the short side, but not excessively short, leaving room for exploration and experimentation. \n\nPros:\n+Beautiful visuals and art direction, if a bit minimalistic at times. Does not try to exploit nostalgia.\n+Great sense of movement, exhilirating even.\n+An engaging and memorable though ultimately minimalistic story and setting, though a bit short as well. \n+A spectacular soundtrack, definitely worth purchasing the Game + Soundtrack combo. \n\nCons:\n-Uses the Unity engine, bringing performance troubles with it.\n-Could have used a bit more length overall. \n-Though the linearity is not necessarily a bad thing and is not poorly executed, it does feel like there is a lot of potential that could have been had with more open world elements.\n\nYMMV:\n/ Low difficulty provides relatively little threat and challenge, or much need to use resources or health wisely. Some may prefer this as it will allow them a streamlined, easygoing experience. Some may have desired more challenge to accompany the freedom of movement.\n/ Underdeveloped combat and resource management elements may hint at unused potential. Some will prefer this easygoing experience, others may have desired more depth to those elements and a stronger need to utilize them.\n\nOverall, Valley is a brief but memorable experience that is certainly worth a play if you find yourself desiring a simple, low-stress and straightforward yet still strong and engaging game, providing that much needed sense of wonder and fantasy without having too much depth to the lore to try and dig for or search out. It is best described as a definite gem, unfortunately overshadowed by higher profile releases around the same time, but absolutely deserves more attention!\n\nVerdicts: \nBuy it now: Those who are very hungry for an engaging yet simple and stress-free experience, craving a sense of wonder and immersion.\nWait for sale: All others", "timestamp_created": 1472315240, "timestamp_updated": 1472315240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.588434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25180021": {"recommendationid": "25180021", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988744354", "num_games_owned": 1330, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 285, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495140834}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good.", "timestamp_created": 1472298641, "timestamp_updated": 1472298641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.442776", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25179921": {"recommendationid": "25179921", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970929179", "num_games_owned": 1091, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508968799}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost like another version of Tomb Raider situated out in the wide open spaces , is it worth playing , absolutely yes , if you don't want to spend much just wait till the next Steam sale but it is really worth a try , love it .

Just wow! This game came unexpected. Never heard of it before. The screenshots looked a bit like a walking simulator with a few gameplay elements. The description was vague. I didn't expect too much. To be honest, I just bought it because I had wallet left from trading card sales, so I had to pay only 2\u20ac on top of that. But now that I know the game - it's easily worth the money. It really blew me away!\n\nWhen you start the game, you will in fact think this is a walking simulator. After just a few minutes - when you get your suit - you will probably think: oh, it's more of a running simulator. This will be fun! Well, the game actually has absolutely nothing to do with a walking simulator. It opens up more and more and more. At some point even combat is introduced. The game takes its time, so that when you have your first fight, you are really surprised that this is in the game. You get new upgrades for your suit on a regular basis. And what awesome upgrades those are. I'd say the double jump is the least exciting of them. Wait until you are in your first speed tunnel... ;)\n\nAside from all that the game has this really great life/death mechanic. You can take life, and you can give life. This works with animals, trees and other plants. So if you really need it, you can take from nature. But don't take too much. The valley itself also has some sort of HP meter. It's an interesting and innovative concept. I like it a lot.\n\nThe story is mostly told through audio logs and notes. This may sound boring to some of you, but it really isn't. You listen to the audio logs while playing, and the notes are pretty short - so neither of those will hinder your game flow. The story is pretty interesting. It didn't take long until I really wanted to know what the hell happened in the valley.\n\nThe graphics are awesome. And the sound design is absolutely fantastic. The world is well designed and interesting. Well, almost everything about this game is just great. The only negative thing I can think of is the difficulty. It's a little too easy. But that's really a minor complaint.\n\nMy playthrough was exactly 5:57h long.\n\nOverall this is just a great game. A real indie gem. And I hope it get's the attention it deserves.\n\nAnd if you're using a 21:9 monitor like me, please check this out: http://steamcommunity.com/app/378610/discussions/0/352792037314730094/", "timestamp_created": 1472292634, "timestamp_updated": 1480158403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862576", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25178553": {"recommendationid": "25178553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048895045", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 276, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506746507}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a short game but its a heap of fun.

There's some pretty janky things going on right now. Mouse sensitivity is WAY too high, I had to lower the sensitivity as far as it would go AND reduce my mouse' DPI to 200 to get a playable sensitivity. To make the game run higher than 60fps I had to set VSync ON to 60 fps, at which point the game ran at around 90-100 in open areas, and a nice 144 in indoor areas. There is combat in the game, but it's really basic and pitifully easy. The devs have stated that they are going to attempt to fix the technical issues in a patch hopefully by 8/29, this is going up on 8/26.\n\nAll of that being said, it was a wonderful experience. The meat of the game is the first-person platforming. This game is a bit deceptive, in the first five minutes it feels like a walking simulator. Then suddenly it opens up and gives you a powered exoskeleton that sets you loose to perform incredible feats of strength and agility. The mechanic of being able to drain life of plants and animals to power your suit to perform some of the more intensive functions is cool, as is being able to give that life back through the aptly named \"God Hand.\" What the game ends up being is an interesting science fiction romp through a visually pleasing mountain valley and eerie dilapidated  WWII research facilities. The soundtrack is also excellent and fit the theme of each level that I dashed, jumped, and swung my way through. I felt like I was playing a Miyazaki film, and that\u2019s high praise. \n\nFor those of you that like to get that little bit extra out of your games, there\u2019s a couple types of collectables to gather, and secret areas to find that either give you some more of the collectables, a bit more background story, or both. These collectables are scattered throughout the world in chests, and the secret areas often hide upgrades to your exoskeleton itself. The bad here is there is no sort of tracker in regards to how many of each level\u2019s collectables and secret areas you\u2019ve located. I found just the simple exercise of finding collectables and secret areas enjoyable in and of itself. If you only go for collectables for the sake of getting that 100% completion, I can see you getting irritated. If you\u2019re like me and you\u2019re interested more in the gratification of finding these things yourself, that little thrill when you find them, you\u2019ll probably have plenty of fun. You can travel back to areas earlier in the game and keep your suit upgrades, your total item collections, and even story progress. This takes away some of the sting of missing things earlier on, because you can return, and since just traversing the levels is often the most fun part, it still feels satisfying. \n\nMechanically, the movement mechanics feel satisfying. First person platforming can often feel frustrating and unresponsive, but here everything felt appropriate. The ability to look down and see your feet helps you to guide yourself to exactly where you want to land, and enough variety in the puzzles to keep things feeling fresh throughout the four to six hours that the game will likely take you to reach the end. What combat there is didn\u2019t blow my mind, and while it feels a bit lackluster compared to the platforming, it\u2019s not so hard as to ever become tedious. The one boss battle of the game was interesting enough for me to accept it, as it was as enjoyable as the combat ever got and did add a lot more to a fight, and added in more complex movement and dodging that played more to the game\u2019s strength than the rest of the combat in the game. \n\nI enjoyed my time with the game enough after my six hours of playing to get through the main story. I am also planning on to go back and get the collectables that I missed. I highly recommend this game, but as always, do the proper research before buying.

For instance, it almost reminds me of a walking sim early on, and then when you get a L.E.A.F. suit it's a bit more exploratory.  The suit itself has some nice capabilities, like taking and giving life to creatures around you.  The running and jumping is a really nice aspect to the suit, which feels very free and invigorating to me in a sense.  You can also essentially \"live forever\" as long as you have energy to replenish the life around you as you take life from the areas you are in.  This is key for collecting the acorns as well, since trees tend to drop acorns on a regular basis.  \n\nIt's not a very long game, but the areas are fairly sizable and vast.  There is some really nice equipment upgrading as you continue on, and several types of collectible items to collect for acorn doors, which are locked without the proper amount of acorns, and some mysterious medallions you find in certain boxes with a slight shiny glint you can see from afar if you're in the right spots called pendulum cases as you travel different areas.  You can go back and forth as you please with the Travel option in the pause menu as well, if you gain new upgrades and want to explore around some previous areas.\n\nWhen hostiles start to appear on the map, you have some very slight FPS elements involved in targeting while being attacked.  This is extremely light, and I don't find the difficulty to be a problem at all in this game.  I find it a little short, but compared to other games at this price range, the grapics and music and complete package make it one of the better games on Steam I have played in this price range.\n\nOne gripe I have is the look sensitivity was extremely fast!  I had to move it all the way to about five percent from the lowest setting in options to use it with my controller.  This probably should be updated.  I also fell through rocks a few times while exploring out of the way areas, as well as some ceilings that I went above.  A few times I was completely stuck, and I had to restart the area.  Things you collect are still accounted for, so you don't have to redo everything again and again, aside from getting to the spot where you need to be.  In this suit, that's not too hard to do, generally.\n\nAs mentioned, the time was a little short, but I'd rather complain a good game was too short, than play a bad game and constantly hope the next part is the end of it.  Most people don't even bother in the latter case, but I can be a bit of a masochist in that respect...  Sometimes bad games are so bad they end up good, and sometimes they are so bad they have a lot of humor along the way.  It's refreshing when I find one of those that bring something to the table, intentional or not.\n\n\n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n\nGreat graphics!  I really loved the colors as I went from area to area.  It kind of speaks for itself in game photos and video, or some of the screenshots I took as I travelled around.  It's beautiful!\n\nThe music is really relaxing on relaxing parts, pretty intense on intense parts, and overall fits your surrounding scenery or goals.  It's what I would call \"world music\" if I were selecting a style or genre, but the use of instrumentation reminded me of the Uncharted games a bit.  It's not constant, but will change or calm down.  It is not overpowering, and I liked not feeling like I needed to cut the volume down or anything while playing at any point.\n\nThe L.E.A.F. suit is a lot of fun!  The jumping and running around is very freeing and you can almost feel it as you traverse landscapes.  I won't go into detail on this one, but they have some really good upgrades too, especially later on as you move through the game's story.\n\nThe creatures you encounter are awesome too!  They are called, or rather nicknamed, daemons, as you learn, and the bigger ones don't really have a name.  I won't talk much about that, since that is something the story will eventually get you up to speed with.\n\nCollecting things along the way to unlock other things.  This is something you can go back through to balance out some of the shortness factor that I kind of complained a bit about, sort of.  Going back with all the upgrades can help you find a lot of what you may have missed earlier, or just focusing on finding the rest of the items, if you choose to do so.\n\nI liked the text that would come up here and there of your own thoughts.  As you entered an area that sparked a thought, you would see something on the sides of the screen as you went along.  Simple concept, but it worked, I thought.\n\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n\nThe length of the game could be a little longer, but honestly, this is not a huge complaint for me.  It fit the whole story well for me, but in a way I always want games to be longer, even a game I spend 100 hours or more on, if it's good. \n\nGlitches where I was stuck in rocks, or fell through and couldn't get back into the map.  I only fell a little, but I usually had trouble finding a way back, especially when I only had the basic suit.  \n\nI would like to see difficulty created.  It was very very easy for me.  I'm not so much complaining about my own experience as much as for some that might like a more challenging experience.\n\nA map.  I couldn't find any sort of a map feature.  There is a small bar, like many Bethesda games have, where it has the compass kind of thing near the top, and the \"point of interest\" is marked as a red spot, but I would like one where I could see the layout of everything. Wasn't able to find this, if in fact there is one.  Would love it if there ever is one!\n\nThe story is... a bit generic in some respects, but in others I like that it sort of makes you wonder and question things as you're going along.  There are some twists that make it more interesting than your average story of this type of war and madness-driven power.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI think I stated it all in the original few paragraphs, but for this price range, this is one of the best games I've played on Steam.  It's an experience all its own, and I recommend this at full price if you're looking for a single game on Steam you want to spend $20 (or whatever your currency may be).  I personally love sales, since I have a big frugal side, but this game is something I doubt anyone purchasing will regret playing!

However, I didn't 100% it, and I intend to go back and do more.\n\nBut value propositions aside, I got this game after seeing Jim Sterling play it, and the running and jumping, the sense of speed and momentum, looked so fun. It is. I did not get tired of it at all. This game does speed excellently. Perhaps perfectly. Thus, it was worth the price to me. Whethe it provides enough value to you, well, is up to you.\n\nIn addition it solves the problem of first-person platforming by both letting you see your feet, and always providing platforms big enough you can judge your positioning with no problem. Thus, the platforming is very fun.\n\nThe shooting, too, is quite good. It's minimal, but where it shines is when you find yourself soaring through the air and shooting things (to life or death) before you land. That is quite satisfying, and almost makes me want a challenge mode or to try speedrunning it.\n\nThere are two other mechanics: a grappling hook and magnetic boots. The magnetic boots, in my opinion, feel awful. The transition from walking on a wall to jumping off or vice versa is jarring and not at all smooth. In addition, twice it bugged out and gravity still applied to me, so I just fell. The grappling hook, however, I quite liked, once I got used to it, though it can be fiddly remembering to hold down the button to keep it attached, which killed me a couple times.\n\nThen there's the fact it is gorgeous and the soundtrack is amazing. My only complaint with this is that about half the game isn't in the gorgeous valley but often rather dull interiors, which is quite a shame. They could've easily been designed better to solve the dullness problem too, but I shant spoil how.\n\nThe soundtrack, meanwhile, has only one problem: the running tracks are too good. Too exciting. And when you're just wanting to pause and find collectibles or read notes in a speedy section that can be a bit jarring.\n\nLastly, the story's good. It's not remarkable, but it's solid. And it is told all through environmental notes scattered around and audio logs, in very much a walking simulatoresque style, which some people will have a problem with, but I found myself engaged in it.\n\nReally, in many ways this game feels like it owes much to walking simulators like Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, except they then made it a proper game. They added gameplay. I don't hate walking simulators, but really, they're not games, they're digital art pieces, and can only be judged by their story and beauty.

Reminds me of SOMA in terms of gameplay vs. \"walking simulator\" as well as solid depth of story. Truthfully I bought the game more for the soundtrack...\n\nI'm not a fan of walking simulators, but thankfully Valley introduces new gameplay elements each chapter so even the game play changes so the game is not boring to play. If you've ever wanted to play a game piloting a mech that is stronger and faster than you, this is a very enjoyable game. \n\nBeginning is a bit slow, but that's fine.

This adventure will find himself in new land that to the world doesnt exist which leads into the question could the thing he is searching for truly be real.\n\nREVIEW\nNote i haven't completely finished this game so may take this review as you like. Also there is a video attached to this just see the beginning of the game. So with that i must mention i have been waiting for this game since it was announced by Blue Isle Studios. To start I think the idea of this game is quiet brilliant and even if some say it is a walking simulator that is not true. The Mechanics work like their supposed to and i haven't seen any glitches so far. The Graphics are very well done and it actual looks like the studio put a lot of work into this game.\n\nOPITMIZATION\nMost of you want to know if it runs well on your computer. Well knowing it just released it's not 100% polished which i have come to expect as of late of most games. However, it runs way better than most.\nMy Rig Runs on a 1080gtx and I5 core processor with 16gb ram. So i can say that i dont have a overpowered PC. \nMax Settings at 2560 x 1440 gives me an average of 30-40 Frames which is probably due to its jsut release. For those who have a 2k moniter i suggest that you turn the AA to FXAA or SMAA Low/Medium which seems to run at 55-60fps. For 1080p, my rig easily runs the game at 60fps with not drops even with SMAA high so for those who don't really care about resolution you will have no issues running it if you have a some what similar rig. NOTE: that it might be different for those who have lower end PCs\n\nCONCLUSION\nI would surely try this game becauase it is rare thing to see a game such as this to come out. Especially when the current stance of the PC community as gone to the wolves(aka developers who dont care about us). However, i will leave up for you to decide if you want to play this game. If you think that its not worth the price just remember that these game designers put alot of work into it and it is their livlihood. \n\nVIDEO\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=751275412", "timestamp_created": 1472085182, "timestamp_updated": 1472085182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25122621": {"recommendationid": "25122621", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994372073", "num_games_owned": 595, "num_reviews": 337, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488419659}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This game is absolutely breathtaking.[/h1]\n\nWhat starts for five minutes as a walking simulator immediately evolves into Tribes Ascend, skiing down slopes and shooting projectile ressurection into dead flora and fauna like Captain Planet.

It will take you 3 hours.\nEveryone else, please read on.\n\nSince installation I have been glued to my computer. I would say it is worth full price as long as you can afford it and understand that, as an indie game, it will be short. It is absolutely worth purchasing while on sale.\nThat being said, [b]it is 70% parkour exploration and 30% adventure.[/b]\n\nThe [b]graphics[/b] are beautiful. You will journey through, over, and under gorgeous landscapes. More than once I found myself staring out across a vista just taking in the view. Even the dull industrial areas have openings and windows to pretty views.\n\nThe [b]sound track[/b] is very nice and goes well with the current scene. Tempo will pick up as action increases and sweeping vistas get the \u201clord of the rings\u201d type of instrumental they deserve.\n\nThe [b]voice acting[/b] was well done and seemed natural.\n\nThe [b]controls[/b] are simple and smooth, yet accomplish a great deal, especially later in the game. Your abilities will grow but you will continue to use the same 5 controls intuitively. (wasd excluded since some might use controller.)\n\nThe [b]story[/b] unfolds as you go, through audio playbacks. More depth can be gained by reading optional notes throughout the game. The notes are optional, most are easy to find but some are hidden gems. There are writings, symbols, and pictures within the game that add to the story/lore. These won\u2019t be as obvious as the notes. Once, near the end of the game, I found one such diagram that really filled in some back story/lore. Occasionally I found it necessary to stop while I listened to the audio playback. But this is seconds not minutes. I did turn the music down a few notches to help isolate the story audio playback. This may not be necessary for you. My ears are not all that great.\n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] is good. In my intro I tagged the game Parkour Exploration and Adventure. There is Action but it is not very hard. The Death Penalty is an interesting mechanic of the game. I thought it worked very well with the entire story/plot of the game. Honestly you will die more from parkour plummets than from any \u201cbad guy.\u201d\n\nAdditional abilities and their mechanics are introduced and paced out well. You will test them and yourself more if you explore. Exploration is really the point of the game. Your character is not a solider (s)he is exploring to find something specific. If you choose not to explore this will be a quick 3 hour game. I spent around 13 hours over three days on the first play through. I am now on 16 hours exploring on replay.\n\nAchievements and collecting are the reward for exploration beyond the pure enjoyment of parkour, discovering what is beyond that hill and around that corner. Did I mention the views?\n\nThere is no save game. When you exit the game, you keep all upgrades, and items you collect but you will start at the beginning of the current level. If this bothers you, don\u2019t start playing the next level if you have to leave in 10 minutes. If you grew up playing games in the 80s you won\u2019t have a problem with this.\n\n[b]Replay-ability[/b] is part of the game. At the end of the credits, you are encouraged to replay. In fact, there are areas in all the early levels that you need some of the upgrades you get in later levels, during the first play through. You probably won\u2019t recognize the advanced mechanic areas on your first play through. I think the developers hide these more advanced mechanics in the earlier levels so completionists, like me, would not go crazy trying to use them without the proper upgrade. The menu has a Travel option that takes you to any level you already opened up. The Quest tracker becomes a Goals tracker and tells you how many collectables you need on each level. Yup it is designed for replay.\n\nHighly recommended if you like exploration games with smooth movement mechanics. Do not expect Bioshock, portal, or (insert multi-million $ dev game here).\n", "timestamp_created": 1516853532, "timestamp_updated": 1516853532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40978961": {"recommendationid": "40978961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024929461", "num_games_owned": 466, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518201631}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, but VERY engaging story and beautiful graphics.

I'll make this short: great story, good voice acting, original idea, gameplay a little different than what we're used to, orchestra-driven soundtrack, good balance of combat and exploration/collecting, great movement mechanics, beautiful graphics and well-optimized (my rig is 10 years old and ran it no problem and it never even stuttered), awesome climax. A few unanswered questions, but doesn't affect the experience negatively. At the time of this review I \"beat\" it in 3.8 hours, but has a moderately high replay factor that will have me revisitng the Valley in no time.

However on controller, you can't do this and you must enable in the options to auto sprint otherwise you'll have a very hard time playing through the game\n=Occassional sound cue glitches where passing through a door can trigger a random sound (typically the first note of a song and then stops quickly, kind of becomes fun to repeatedly run through the door to make it go off numerous times)\n=A very open feel to the game, but this is rather linear. Not a bad thing, just letting you know that you can't go wandering off as much as you'd probably want to\n=Combat is very simple but also entirely random without an exact purpose. Amrita swarms come out of nowhere and other enemies also appear randomly and sometimes even jumpscare you (See \"The Bad Stuff\")\n\n[h1]The Bad Stuff[/h1]\n-The transitioning of music can be quite obvious and almost always abrupt. The peaceful melody will suddenly cut without reason, or epic music will start playing to the point where it can startle you from its randomness\n-A bunch of sound effects in the game are significantly louder than others, primarily enemies. Now it makes sense to have them be louder of course, but they're VERY loud and if you're pretty jumpy like me, you WILL get jumpscared towards the latter half of the game\n\n[h1]The Truthful Hard Facts[/h1]\n[table]\n[tr][td]Acquirement Method[/td][th]Nemesis Bundle 4 @ Fanatical[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Price Paid[/td][th]$4.99[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Length[/td][th]3-6 hours[/th][/tr]\n[tr][td]Rig Used[/td][th][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thisgrouplinkwasavailable/discussions/0/1473095331487872526/]Main Computer[/url][/th][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]Check out my Steam group for more Reviews![/h1]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thisgrouplinkwasavailable]STEAM REVIEWS GROUP![/url]\n\n[h1]My YouTube Channel![/h1]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4BQSDGExl23rHcd9ML2mRw", "timestamp_created": 1520920670, "timestamp_updated": 1521684816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536517", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40776088": {"recommendationid": "40776088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081227565", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515783008}, "language": "english", "review": "Runs well under Ubuntu 17.10 (CPU AMD Ryzen 1600, 8GB RAM, GPU AMD RX560 with amdgpu driver).

Bom, como j\u00e1 diria Jack o Estripador, vamos por partes. [/h1]\n\n[b] Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o [/b]\n\nO jogo come\u00e7a com voc\u00ea, o pesquisador, procurando pela Semente da Vida. Essa procura o leva at\u00e9 um vale [strike] Como j\u00e1 diz o nome, Valley [/strike] onde a Semente da Vida foi encontrada no passado, e utilizada pelos \"cientistas\" em um projeto chamado Pendulo. (Pendulum)\n\n[b] Ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o [/b]\n\nA ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o se passa inteiramente em um vale, mas, esse motivo n\u00e3o limita a varia\u00e7\u00e3o de paisagem. Florestas gigantes, planices enormes, montanhas de gelo, um lago gigante, cavernas subterraneas e instala\u00e7\u00f5es cientificas do projeto Pendulum deixam esse jogo com uma ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o incirvel, al\u00e9m de uma variedade de ambientes que faz o jogo n\u00e3o ficar entediante.\n\n[b] Jogabilidade [/b]\n\nPosso falar sobre a jogabilidade no Joypad (No caso, um controle de X360) que \u00e9 incrivel.. A jogabilidade do jogo se baseia em ser o \"Senhor da Vida e da Morte\". Como assim? A roupa mecanica encontrada pelo seu personagem (A L.E.A.F Suit), al\u00e9m de te dar velocidade e pulos sobre-humanos, te permite absorver a energia vital de tudo que \u00e9 vivo (Que ser\u00e1 chamada de \"alma\" por mim) para recarregar a energia da bateria... Ou para reviver coisas mortas.\n\nMesmo a variedade de seres que voc\u00ea pode tirar a alma, sendo bem pequena (Cervos, coelhos, plantas e os Daemons), ela \u00e9 essencial. Tem uma habilidade da roupa mecanica que o protagonista usa, que se chama \"Morte Quantica (Quantum Death)\" que depende da quantidade de pessoas vivas no Vale. A cada vez que voc\u00ea morre, voc\u00ea \u00e9 revivido, ao custo de energia vital (almas) do Vale. Ou seja, ele mata seres no lugar de voc\u00ea. Com isso, voc\u00ea tem de reviver seres para poder utilizar a Quantum Death, e, se o Vale inteiro morrer, voc\u00ea perde.\n\n[b] Gr\u00e1ficos [/b]\n\nOs gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o incriveis, al\u00e9m de serem leves, considerando o visual. Os efeitos gr\u00e1ficos s\u00e3o \u00f3timos, e os gr\u00e1ficos gerais s\u00e3o bons, al\u00e9m de o mapa ser incrivelmente bonito, cheio de vida [strike]~Ou morte, dependendo do estado do Vale [/strike] temos os Daemons, uns \"fantasmas\" verdes que s\u00e3o extremamente bonitos, al\u00e9m de importantes pra lore. \n\n[b] O que tem para fazer [/b]\n\nMas, o que temos a fazer? Bom, al\u00e9m da hist\u00f3ria principal, com uma lore incrivel, temos coletaveis e upgrades para pegar durante o jogo, al\u00e9m de Audio Logs e documentos para incrementar na lore. Temos tamb\u00e9m, um mapa incrivelmente aberto pra um jogo linear, onde voc\u00ea pode ir e voltar andando pelo mapa, independente da parte do jogo onde voc\u00ea est\u00e1.\n\n[b] O Final e \"moral\" [/b]\n\nNo final, n\u00f3s temos uma mensagem bem clich\u00ea (A de preserva\u00e7\u00e3o do meio ambiente) sendo apresentada de forma muito impactante. O final do game te deixa arrepiado at\u00e9 o ultimo segundo, al\u00e9m de revela\u00e7\u00f5es incriveis sobre a L.E.A.F Suit e o projeto Pendulum, e o que realmente aconteceu naquele vale.\n\n[b] Em suma [/b]\n\nEsse jogo tem de ser jogado at\u00e9 por aqueles que n\u00e3o gostam dos famigerados Walk Simulators, por ser um jogo, de certa forma, fren\u00e9tico e que quebra suas espectativas com uma lore extremamente incrivel, com revela\u00e7\u00f5es do come\u00e7o at\u00e9 o fim... \u00c9 como ler um livro de fic\u00e7\u00e3o, que te deixa vidrado por 9 horas de gameplay principal.\n\n[b] Nota: 9,5/10 [/b]", "timestamp_created": 1520739082, "timestamp_updated": 1520739082, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40710375": {"recommendationid": "40710375", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028163308", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 310, "last_played": 1520689423}, "language": "french", "review": "Un petit jeu tr\u00e8s sympa de 6-7h en prenant son temps, de beaux paysages, de belles musiques et un gameplay assez vif bien que simple \u00e0 base de sauts, de slides et de vitesse! \nNe pas s'attendre \u00e0 du challenge que ce soit niveau \u00e9nigme, plateforme ou ennemis, c'est plus une balade agr\u00e9able qu'un d\u00e9fi :) \n\u00e7a change, j'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 m\u00eame si je trouve le prix de base peut-\u00eatre un poil \u00e9lev\u00e9, attendre une promo! :)", "timestamp_created": 1520685892, "timestamp_updated": 1520686018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40704356": {"recommendationid": "40704356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220008733", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519585342}, "language": "english", "review": "This has to be the single most beautifull game i have ever played", "timestamp_created": 1520669839, "timestamp_updated": 1520669839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40701295": {"recommendationid": "40701295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061571355", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 204, "last_played": 1520660057}, "language": "english", "review": "So I got this game nearly a year ago and I had been itching to find a spare moment in tme to play it.

Exposition dump, inivisible walls railroading into a single direction, pretty forest and lightning visuals.  Then you get the suit and ability to jump and run, and the game says \"No more invisible walls.  Go nuts.\"\n\nThe gameplay:\n  +/- Not very difficult as-is, but more of an experience.  The only times that the game will be challenging will be if you go off the beaten path, especially if you're trying to nail a shortcut.  That mentioned experience, however, is 30% amazing and 60% \"just plain good\".\n  +/-  Combat is not the main focus of the game.  The real star is the movement.  No traditional parkour stuff like wallrunning, but the concept of building up speed by running down slopes and using ramps to launch into the air is rather new to the genre.  The combat is sparse and mostly serves to break up the movement.\n  + The controls feel generally good.  Building up speed and launching into the air is a blast.\n  +/- Momentum is a tad... wonky?  Sometimes it feels more like a wind tunnel with a treadmill.  While not accurate to physics, it does allow tighter control.\n    : You can land a jump at a 90-degree angle and keep running at full speed.\n    : You can do circles and donuts while on the ground with zero impact to your forward momentum as long as you're still holding forward.\n    : You can stop nearly instantly.\n  +/-Jumping has the classic \"mid-air control\" mechanic.  It isn't too obvious, but it can throw you off if you are expecting hyper-realism.\n  - You can easily catch on a few rocks (and a couple of stairs) that interrupt the flow of your movement.\n  +/- The lakeside areas have a ton of optional side areas to just run through and most outdoor areas have a lot of room to move around, but the game has a very linear design.  Progressing to the next area usually requires you to do a specific thing at a specific spot, or go through a bottleneck location.\n  + The game allows you to go to previous areas with your current upgrades, which is fun to try to blitz through or help find secrets you'd missed.\n  + Most of the upgrades are boring, but functional.  The last upgrade is like getting the Speed Booster in Super Metroid, however, and feels just as amazing.\n  - Others have mentioned a lack of customizable controls.  You can only set them up when you start up and select the Configuration option.  There is no in-game option.  The good side is that the default controls will be comfortable to a majority of players.\n\nThe sound gets a solid thumbs-up.\n  - Turn down your volume before booting this up.  The menu is surpringly louder than the game itself.\n  + Sound effects are spot-on, and the sound of landing from a long drop feels like you probably should have broken some bones.  The noises of the dark creatures in particular stand out.\n  + Music is mostly solid and suitable.  But when you pick up a new upgrade and are in the area to put it to use, the music suddenly picks up the slack and helps the powerful feeling of tearing through the course set in front of you.\n  - I had a weird issue where footsteps on stone stairs were super-loud.\n\nGraphics are beautiful, with a caveat.\n  + Looks amazing.  Excellent lighting effects, in particular.\n  - Optimization seems to be an issue.  People with top-end PCs struggle to maintain smoother framerates, even with lowered settings.\n  + Area aesthetic is beautiful, even if I disagree with the layout of the architecture.  Underground areas and inside buildings are lit up with unusual blues and greens and oranges and reds.\n  +/- Some fish-eye effect when you get some speed.  Can be either immersive or distracting, depending on the player.\n\nStory:\n  + Plays out in three ways:  current events that you are playing through, audio logs of the past in the suit that play automatically, and notes of the past strewn about that add detail to the plot and setting and some character to the side characters.\n  +/- The present story is simple yet sufficient:  search for an ancient artifact, disturb a problem that threatens possibly the planet entire, and go stop it.  Most of the plot is the story of the past that already happened.\n  - The concept of the audio logs doesn't make sense.  They are played in convenient order for your progress, not choronological or reverse chronological order.  I also don't understand how your one suit has access to two different sets of logs, neither of which belonged to the suit's previous owner (if there was one) and one set that should be incredibly restricted in accessability.\n  - The villian is kinda clich\u00e9 and boring.\n\nPlay/replay value:\n  + Has a lot of little hidden things (I probably missed around 30%-40% on my first playthrough).\n  +/- Most folks will vary between 4-6 hours for their first playthrough.  Still has a better \"time to money spent\" ratio than a trip to the movie theatre.\n  + I would recommend folks play it at least two or three times.  First time cautiously, looking for secrets and goodies.  Kinda like playing a Mario game.  I'd make another run as a sweep for more secrets and Easter Eggs.  Final run: play it like a classic Sonic game and blitz the levels like a madman.\n  +/- After finding all of the secrets, there isn't anything the game has built-in for you other than running around the areas.  Sorry, no clear-time leaderboards.  But the game is about the movement, so going through old areas still feels good.\n  + As with any other movement-based game, speedruns of this are probably going to be amazing.\n\nSummary:\n  Recommended.\n  Most of my complaints are like dropping a toy:  they aren't actually ruining the overall enjoyment, but they are annoying and muck up your rhythm.\n\n  + If you enjoy games based heavily on movement, pick this up.  If you're interested but not sure, this is likely still a good buy when on sale.\n  - If you want a game like Doom (2016), this is not what you are looking for.", "timestamp_created": 1520572236, "timestamp_updated": 1520572236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40672437": {"recommendationid": "40672437", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970899974", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 416, "last_played": 1520802483}, "language": "english", "review": "After seeing all the positive reviews on Valley I decided to put it on my wish list and purchased it on one of Steam's sales.\n\nThis game has been AMAZING!\n\nIt is very linear in nature, but the gameplay was really fun, the story well plotted, and the sound very well integrated with the action.\n\nBeautiful areas to play in, and lots of surprises.

All the dynamic movements in this game make it feel like one big roller coaster.  The story is impactful and meaningful, the voice acting is phenomenal, and the world is astonishingly beautiful.  Graphics are vibrant and feel real to the point that I feel the wind in my ears, feel the ground shake beneath my feet as I land, and feel the adrenaline surge through me as I sprint full-speed.  I see the life drain out of the Valley.  Fantastical world - it feels like the western United States with a twist of fantasy and a shadow of mystery.\n\nThe idea behind the yin-yang, give-life-take-life balance was intriguing and impactful not only to the game's design and play, but also to the story and takeaway.  It's a good message - one that makes you think.\n\nThere was only one benign complaint I had.  Every now and then, I would get stuck on objects, but it was no difficult thing to free myself.  Also, in my first game save, a quest would not update, so I had to start over on a new save.  This could simply be user error, as I still have to flesh out what's really going on, and overall, these small issues did not interfere with my satisfaction with the game.\n\nIt's wonderful how a studio can take a period in actual history and shape a new, fictional history around it, all the while making it absolutely epic.  The soundtrack is something to be mentioned as well; I think what truly shapes a game's atmosphere and vibe is the music, and Valley's music is so unique.

Set in a secluded valley in the Rockies, the story unfolds with the quick discovery of a L.E.A.F. suit followed by audio logs and notes piecing together a failed effort to harness an incredible power for a secret military project during World War II.\n\nThe game gives you a well-developed sense of freedom to explore and some amazing high-quality visuals. And while it starts with lots of running and jumping, it quickly layers in new abilities, puzzles, and -- in the last half -- low-skill combat. The terrain you cover is huge despite the story being tight. And there are some exhilarating sequences that you'll probably want to repeat just because they are so much fun! Although there is nothing new here in terms of first-person platforming or parkour, the game anchors it's \"technology vibe\" so well to the suit that it feels completely natural to think you are strapped into the thing.  \n\nMinus a point here because the save system only works for items that go into your inventory. If you quit in the middle of a level, restarting will take you back to its start point although you won't have to re-acquire items that don't re-spawn. So it's always a good idea to wait until you get the scene transition to the next environment before you exit back the main menu.\n\nOverall a great game that should be getting its studio a lot more attention!\n\n[b]Rating: 9/10\nAn ambitious, top-notch indie gem!

Games like Arkham Knight or Just Cause 3 see the protagonist spending an absolutely huge amount of time flying around the map.  The effect is somewhat muted because of the point of view.\n\nValley actually EXPANDS on the locomotive possibilities from the aformentioned games and then presents the resulting masterpiece to the player in a lush First Person presentation.\n\nEvery so often a developer will make a game in unity that redeems it is a platform.  It shows that the game you create is a result of your own talent and work, not the medium.  As far as I know Valley is the only first person game I have ever played in unity, and it looks amazing.\n\nThe textures look fantastic and remain so despite the frenetic movement around a map that would otherwise be idyllic.  Every new area you walk to gives the impression of an intentionally crafted vista that would be equally at home in an artistic screenshot or landscape painting....  AND THEN, you get to dash through the scenery at a speed no sane person would attempt.\n\nThe player is presented with a few environmental obstacles in puzzles, timing and skill are all that's required to navigate.  \nThere are few hidden items, but nothing too difficult to seek out, most of the suit upgrades that you will need are part of the natural progression inside the levels. A good deal of the story is handled through the audio logs you encounter with your suit, but a large amount of detail is contained in notes presented throughout the environment. Exploration is a good idea as opposed to merely running through the objectives \"speedrun\" Style.\n\nI've decided to write this review without any plot points or spoilers, to leave those up to the player, who in my opinion would be well-served to check this title out.\n\nWithout being too descriptive at some point the player leaves the areas that are purely natural in appearance and ends up in an abandoned \"Industrial\" facility.\n\nThe overall appearance of the facility brought to mind the game \"Singularity\" or perhaps one of the \"Bioshock\" titles, not because of design choices, but overall atmosphere and appearance.  I suppose this was partly because those games were all first person and my uncreative mind can't help but go there.  Don't View this opinion as any indication of gameplay, this game does not share any similarity to the combat presented in the others.  With the exception of a single type of enemy that is easily dealt with, most of the perils that the player will face in Valley are Environmental.\n\nPerhaps one small drawback is the absence of a more effective save system, I needed to switch my system off because of real-life concerns, and when I was able to return to the game I noticed that it had placed me at a checkpoint I did way back from where I was when I turned off the title and there were no options to handle it any differently.  From what I've read though, the game has a fairly short length anyway, so I don't think that this is a real issue.\n\nI'll update the review after I finish the title, for now here is the takeaway.\n\nBeautiful setting.\nWell designed levels.\nGorgeous graphics.\nInteresting story.\nSpeed, speed, speed!\nWHOA....\nHidden indie gem.\nBuy it now.  \n(On sale? an absolute STEAL)\n", "timestamp_created": 1520002099, "timestamp_updated": 1520002099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40498205": {"recommendationid": "40498205", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024945776", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 445, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519947251}, "language": "german", "review": "Was dieses Spiel einem bietet ist unglaublich !\nSo viel Atmosph\u00e4re habe ich schon lange nicht mehr erlebt !\nEin auf und ab der Gef\u00fchle welches man erlebt haben muss!", "timestamp_created": 1519947457, "timestamp_updated": 1519947457, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40484403": {"recommendationid": "40484403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198415403890", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 540, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510933249}, "language": "finnish", "review": "it has okay graphics and the story is okay but its way too short and not worth 20 dollars", "timestamp_created": 1519903942, "timestamp_updated": 1519903942, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40474507": {"recommendationid": "40474507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042772807", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519959848}, "language": "english", "review": "Very neat . makes you do some problem solving as well as pretty good fights .Well worth the time and money for sure.", "timestamp_created": 1519863114, "timestamp_updated": 1519863114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40471729": {"recommendationid": "40471729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049160248", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 618, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1521741891}, "language": "czech", "review": "If you enjoyed game A Story About My Uncle, you should buy this too.\nGreat game.

Added it to my wishlist like every other game that looks semi-decent. Never heard of this game before then, realised it was by the same company behind the Slender games so decided to purchase it on sale for \u00a33. It is far from the best game i've played but I enjoyed it enough.\n\n[b] Pros\t[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Parkour - Best thing about this game, so fun, picking up momentum and skrting around the world.\n    [*] L.E.A.F suit upgrades - Variety of upgrades, makes sure that the parkour isn't always the same.\n    [*] Story - It's alright, got a couple of twists here and there.\n    [*] Price - On sale, great deal. Full price, would probably leave it, to be honest.\n    [*] Graphics - Forgot to mention the graphics for a second, I don't think I really need to though, just look at them.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons\t[/b]\n[list]\n    [*] Very short- Took me only 4.3 hours to complete my first, blind, unrushed playthrough of this game. Alright if you want to play this game to take a break from the norm.\n    [*] One of the abilites (Spoiler) [spoiler] One of the abilites allows you to climb magnetic walls, which is great. However the camera changes which can be a little confusing at time. Not really a big problem and is something you get used to I suppose.\t[/spoiler]\n    [*] The Games ability to run - My PC kills GTA and the Witcher 3. However, I struggled to get a consistent 60 fps on this game so at times it looked very choppy. This wasn't fixed, even when I put the settings on low.\n    [*] Configuation app is seperate to the game - Not the biggest problem, however this means to change your dimensions you have to do it before you open the game. You cannot do it in game. However, you can change other graphic settings.\n[/list]\n\nIf you can get this game on sale for \u00a33, it is worth 100%. If it is cheap on a key site, then why not? I don't think it is something you would want to refund.\n\nValley - 6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1519574680, "timestamp_updated": 1519574680, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40390648": {"recommendationid": "40390648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032901656", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519568900}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING GAME.

On the one hand, I like that it does things differently from other games. You get rewarded for giving life, not taking it. The most fun thing about it is the movement, which is not often the main focus of 3D games. So if you're looking for a new experience, I wouldn't advice against getting this game (up to you if a ~4h game is worth 20\u20ac, though).\nHowever, I found the story and graphics rather mediocre, but that didn't even bother me too much. What did bother me was that in 4h of gameplay I ran into two bugs that made quit and restart the game. And since you start at the beginning of the area after that I had to play through the whole area again. One time I fell through the floor and out of the map and just kept on falling until I quit after a couple of seconds. I also saw acorns falling through the floor, so there seems to be a clipping issue in some areas of the map. The other time was at the very end where the game disappeared from my screen but it kept on running. I could still hear the sound but it only showed my desktop when I was on the tab of the game.\n\nIn conclusion, while I would like to recommend the game for its novelty, I can't quite do so because I don't think a 4h game that costs 20\u20ac when bought for the regular price should have bugs that force you to restart.", "timestamp_created": 1519500915, "timestamp_updated": 1519500915, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509163", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40327476": {"recommendationid": "40327476", "author": {"steamid": "76561198350624317", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517330479}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc624\ud508 \uc6d4\ub4dc\ub77c\uae38\ub798 \ub2a5\uc120 \uc5b4\ub514\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc62c\ub77c\uac00\uc9c0\ub098 \uc5ec\ub7ec\uad70\ub370\uc11c \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud574\ubd24\ub294\ub370 \ubcbd\uc774 \ub6ab\ub824\uc11c \ub9f5 \ub108\uba38\uac00 \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uacf3\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0 \uc0b0\ub3c4 \uc5b4\ub290 \uc774\uc0c1 \uac00\uba74 \ubcbd\uc5d0 \ub9c9\ud600 \uc62c\ub77c\uac00\uc9c0\uc9c0\uac00 \uc54a\ub294 \uc810\uc774 \uc0b4\uc9dd \uc544\uc26c\uc6e0\uc74c.\n\n\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uc26c\uc6b4\ud3b8\uc784. \uc2a4\ud1a0\ub9ac\ub3c4 \ubcfc\ub9cc\ud558\uace0 \uacbd\uce58\ub3c4 \uc88b\uc544\uc11c \ud790\ub9c1\uc6a9\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uba74 \uc88b\uc744 \ub4ef.", "timestamp_created": 1519392431, "timestamp_updated": 1519392431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40321739": {"recommendationid": "40321739", "author": {"steamid": "76561198164453136", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519373239}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ub9e5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ub7ec\uac00 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \uc548 \uba39\ub124\uc694. \ubb50\uac00 \ubb38\uc820\uc9c0 \uacc4\uc18d \ud558\ub298\ub9cc \uccd0\ub2e4\ubcf4\uace0 \uc788\uc74c. \ud1a0\ub860 \uac00\ubcf4\uba74 \uace0\uce60 \uc758\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc5b4\ubcf4\uc774\uace0. \ud658\ubd88\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.", "timestamp_created": 1519373655, "timestamp_updated": 1519373655, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40317003": {"recommendationid": "40317003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151316252", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515979566}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game that was fun to play with beautiful graphics!", "timestamp_created": 1519354855, "timestamp_updated": 1519354855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40316332": {"recommendationid": "40316332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198310944083", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518751444}, "language": "english", "review": "But HOW ?

The music's good.\n\nThing is, what the \"tutorial\" makes seem like the main trick of the game, the power of life and death, doesn't really matter at all. You left-click to kill enemies and revive trees (necessary to get special acorns + restore the rez counter after a death). You right-click to refill your energy from batteries lying around. Sure, I guess you could also left-click to revive random dead animals but you'll hardly ever see them. You could also right-click to kill said random animals to harvest their energy, or even trees, but there's never a real reason to do so as free-floating energy orbs are plentiful.\n\nThere's also maybe 1 puzzle in the entire game. I was expecting some cool riddles like having to drain the life out of a bear, passing the area, and reviving it to fight an enemy for me or something - there's even an in-game note describing  almost exactly that scenario!

Notes on the floor revealing backstory, and collectibles, constantly stop the player from moving, which feels like padding to hide the games short length.\n\nUltimately, Valley can provide a good experience, but one that will most likely leave you wanting more.", "timestamp_created": 1519019918, "timestamp_updated": 1519019918, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40213595": {"recommendationid": "40213595", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973040435", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519014835}, "language": "english", "review": "Got my $5 worth, but no more.

That's a vast oversimplification, but on impressions that's what I got from Valley. You solve puzzles using tools you have, though in this case it's mostly about kinetic rather than object and space  manipulation - you run jump, swing etc to get from A to B. The game is lovely to look at and listen to: the plot is occasionally wobbly but generally engaging. The writing is good and the voice acting (bar the occasional moments of Saturday morning cartoon villainy) is of a high standard, certainly miles better than the aural rugburn of something like Conarium. You'll finish in about 8 hours, having enjoyed yourself and not felt your time was wasted.\n\nMy only sore point was some of the anachronisms. The non-ancient items you'll find are supposed to date back to WW2, but like quite a few games (including some that have the budget and staff to know better - I'm looking at you The Knife of Dunwall, despite my adoration of Dishonored) the passive worldbuilding suddenly jars by using what are obviously modern signs and/or fonts. The effect is dissonant and breaks the immersion: it's like playing Bioshock Infinite and finding all the posters written in Comic Sans and Impact. Texture artists: do your research. If an era had signs that were mostly hand-painted or stencilled, you can't cut corners by using clipart and not negatively affect your project. Also, check for historical accuracy: for example the 'Biohazard' trefoil was invented by Dow Chemical in 1966, SO WHY IS IT HERE? Very sloppy. Anyhoo, here endeth the lesson.\n\nIn short: a few hmmms, but otherwise it's good.

In Valley, you're on Mother Nature's side - one with the Valley. It's a symbiosis- help and be helped. Abuse and die out. \n\nFor those scrolling through: this is a well-crafted narrative as you effortlessly leap, soar and rush through breathtaking scenery. Combat is simple and isn't killing, but pacifying.\nThis game has all- collectibles, upgrades, notes with lore and truly incredible soundtrack. The music fits the aesthetic and pace so well that it will make every chapter memorable.\nWhat this game does not have, however, is manual saving. \n========================================\n\nRegarding that last sentence that has driven many away: the game saves your actions, but not position. The levels are fairly large, but thankfully, many have shortcuts. Collectibles found, doors opened and all is saved, but you'll have to start from what you first saw after a loading screen once you moved to another location. You can't save at will.\n\nCollecting is quite enjoyable in this game. Some locations are obivous, some are impressively well-hidden, but all to a reasonable extent. After you beat the main story, you will know how many things you've yet to collect in your location.\n\nValley is not combat-oriented. It's more of a platformer than a shooter, and pacifying feels as if you're restoring the Valley's peace.\n\nDespite having some Early Access vibes in design, the game is finished and relatively bug-free (even though I managed to skip a bit of the story because I reloaded the level). Devs are still actively monitoring discussions and respond to bug reports- a great sign.\n\nMuch unlike I thought, this isn't a hardcore game where you only have a limited amount of deaths after which the Valley just dies. There is a great mechanic to restore life you've taken to the Valley, so no worries. Even the achievements say that nearly all players have beaten the game without Valley dying.\n\nThe world of Valley is remarkably gorgeous wih memorable places and a captivating atmosphere. The music, leaping, scenery just all flows together in a seamless journey of exploration. I was impressed by sheer mood change as you progress through the game and the plot approaches its climax.\n\nAs for the plot... The game isn't too long, but neither does it really feel short. Personally, I wasn't too happy with how it all ended, but it still was a wonderful journey. The notes let you dive into others' experience, adding character and depth.\n\nAnother thing to note: as a person who struggles playing first-person games due to motion sickness, despite being a parkour-based game, this game was a breeze and I felt just fine after playing for a while. I did disable motion blur, however, because I lagged quite a bit on highest settings.\n\nIn short: if you're still wondering, give it a try. If you enjoy walking simulators and parkour, Valley will be an unusual and memorable experience. If it's on sale, grab it and leap on.\n", "timestamp_created": 1518823072, "timestamp_updated": 1518823072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40138460": {"recommendationid": "40138460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119754287", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518818409}, "language": "english", "review": "pretty fun like an 7.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1518818435, "timestamp_updated": 1518818435, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40138412": {"recommendationid": "40138412", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986406741", "num_games_owned": 1719, "num_reviews": 546, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518817925}, "language": "english", "review": "Uhm.. except some annoying platforming millimetric jumps (where i failed and died) this game was quite a trip !

This game has many compelling aspects to it. It has a beautifully designed world that ranges from picturesque vistas to decaying ruins to military industrial installations. The graphics are pretty amazing in my opinion and the sound work is phenomenal. The story is quite compelling even if the protagonist is either never actually named or perhaps I just missed it. The lore objects and voice acting even go as far as to make the player care about characters who have been dead for decades. The life and death mechanic is interesting and integrates pretty seamlessly, which does however lead me to my biggest complaint abou the game. Its combat mechanics are sorely under-utilized. There are only a small handful of enemy types and they don't really present much of a challenge. What this game really needed were humanoid enemies  and/or missions that required you to use the life/death mechanic in a more meaningful way to progress. This combined with its short length (I beat the story in just under 5 hours) left me wanting more. I would love to see a sequel or expansion that's a bit more fleshed out, but for the price, this game is still well worth a play through.", "timestamp_created": 1518724652, "timestamp_updated": 1518724652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40105783": {"recommendationid": "40105783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217213312", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518652887}, "language": "polish", "review": "Gra bardzo klimatyczna, dobry soundtrack, sterowanie rozbione bardzo dobrze.

Let me explain if I can, in a list of each aspect regarding the game.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nGraphics are substantial and convey the message well enough. It's not breaking records here nor is it trying to. Rather, the visuals are highly appealing despite some textures being pretty grimey. What really catches your eye here is the immense backdrops and vistas, and the skybox - in most cases - looks a treat with it's bright and vibrant display of sunrise/sunset. The rest of the colour palette leaves a little to be desired, but you're not going to be straining your eyes in this game. \n\nSOUND DESIGN:\n\nThe sound design is a bit iffy here. The L.E.A.F suit sounds heavy and robust with it's booming thumps as it sprints across the earth. Birds and wind rustle the leaves and fill the void that is the sky, and each different floor texture, be it soil, stone, or metal all sound genuine. Where the game fails is that the sound recognition for these basic actions is only active 1/2-3/4 of the time. The sound is patchy as the game struggles to keep up with the vast amount of different sounds playing all at once. No, instead the game truly shines in its soundtrack, featuring native flutes, some vocal orchestras and a good deal of drums and fiddles, and the good old piano. They did a wonderous job on it, and the soundtrack alone is worth its own weight and certainly worth a purchase, should it ever be standalone.\n\nGAMEPLAY: \n\nCharacter movement is agile, fast, and generally pretty responsive. Your control scheme is very simple and precise, heavily lending to a classic shooter. You'll have fun when you sprint down slopes at 100km/h speeds and launch yourself into the floaty air. There are a few tunnel run sections that make this stand out, and boy are they a treat! Only, you may find yourself wishing you could move ever so slightly faster, and perhaps landing a jump could be ever so slightly more precise, but all things considered, the gameplay is good enough. To explore the history of the Valley you will have to find notes scattered throughout the world, and collect acorns and medallions to explore side areas (Which there are very few of outside the linear path, and to be honest, they are not worth it at all unless aiming for 100%). To keep up with the demands of the game, you will also need to find energy supplements for your suit. There is some minor exploration involved in the way of secret searching, but don't be compelled to do this.\n\nCONTEXT/STORY:\n\nThe story is pretty much you finding a L.E.A.F Suit - a suit that controls both life and death through a GOD hand, and allows for greater feats of agility and endurance - and trying to discover the history of the Valley. Set around WW2 as some scientists try to create an ultimate human exo-suit to turn the tide of the war, and perhaps some other devious experiments. Your character is mute but on the contrary, dialogue is mostly derived from audio recordings from members inhabiting the Valley. The voice acting is decent with the exception of the war video narrator, who sounds exceptionally cheap and echoes someone trying too hard with unfortunately, just not the right voice for the context. There's a minor twist toward the end of the game but should come as no real surprise given the themes of 'life and death' through the use of the suit. The game features a unique system wherein upon your death the environment is drawn upon to preserve your life, this is slightly overplayed when the only thing affected are some animals and the trees. \n\nSTABILITY:\n\nThe game seems to be a bit heavy even on good systems. I averaged 45 fps on a gtx 980 and dipped down to 20 in some areas. The game seems to be poorly optimised, but is still reasonably playable. For a 5 hour experience, you won't have to put up with any real hassle's for any serious amount of time.\n\nMAP DESIGN:\n\nNow this is where my real issues with the game lie. The nature of the game involves high speed and agile movement mixed with floaty combat and puzzle solving and you traverse the game world. Despite being coined as 'Open World' you are in fact limited to specific zones with the exception of travelling back to older areas through an option in the menu's. This however only treats you as if you're restarting the mission, so to get to any point you prefer, be prepared to traverse the entire mission again. In conjunction with this, the map designs leave something to be desired. There are a few areas in the game - tunnel runs I call them - where the high speed and agility is fully realised and utilised. These areas are entirely fun to play and wholly thrilling to experience. The problem is that at least 1/2 of the game is spent plundering old rundown and abandoned facilities, which have been oddly designed that they don't seem entirely practical, but must be made to occomodate the increased movement and agility of the suit. These areas feel and look oddly designed, as they seem too large to be practical for science labs etc. With half of the game spent exploring these ruins, this leaves you with the desire to explored much more open areas, which is where you can fully utilise the high speed gameplay. Unfortunately, these ares are mostly barren and empty to emphasise the high speed movement. \n\nOVERALL VERDICT:\n\nI enjoyed the game, even if I was a bit disappointed with the overall flow of the campaign, but the soundtrack and occasional tunnel run make up for this, maybe not enough to warrant the game being $20 however. You're looking at a 4-6 hour experience with some cool concepts, but ultimately underplayed and underwhelming ones. Replayability is not very good all things considered, and the stale combat might be a turn off for some people. \n\nIf you're looking for something that minorly feels like Tribes Ascend in terms of movement, but has an OK story with decent music, you might be in for a treat. But at $20 you may feel slightly conned. Wait until the game is on sale is my best suggestion, otherwise, save your money. At full price, I don't recommend. \n\nPRO'S:\nFun controls\nGood music\nAt times, beautiful visuals\nDecent play time\nOK story\nCool concepts\nQuestionable ethics\n\nCONS:\nOdd map design\nUnrealised potential in campaign and overall map design\nDecent at best voice acting\nUninteresting characters\nStale and repetetive combat\nChoppy stability and sound\nUnderwhelming ending\n\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1518591449, "timestamp_updated": 1518591449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40059504": {"recommendationid": "40059504", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987437394", "num_games_owned": 306, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518576455}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game for 5 dollars.

The graphics are great and the movement of the leaf suit is by far the best part but the story is just ok and the combat is pretty bad. Don't get me wrong it's a great game but I just find the story not as engaging as it could have been (at this point I only played it once through. I understand there is post-game content and that might change my opinion). \nThat said the best part, as mentioned above, is by far the movement of the leaf suit. The way you can chain double jumps and grapple hooks into gaining momentum and the fluidity of the actions is purely mind blowing. If they could make a set of pureley parkour related challenges (sorta like the training camp but a bit more difficult with traces of the super fast rail racing sprinkled in for good measure) would totally make this game a lot better. [spoiler] instead of this we just get an underwhelming boss fight using the poor combat mechanics and a not so good final dash to safety. [/spoiler] . That is by far the best part of the game  and the main reason that kept me playing and is making me consider trying to get all the achievements for it. \nThe story was good but paled in comparisson to the movement and versatility of the leaf suit. I felt that it was mostly used as an excuse to push you into combat encounters and give a sense of progression. It stands on it's own feet but don't expect portal/bioshock levels of engaging material. It left me feeling quite meh...\nThe combat sucked. The concept is cool on paper but the fact that it really isn't that hard to exploit the enemies ai makes it more of a chore than an exciting rush of adrenaline.\nThe soundtrack is amazing (my favorite track is the one that plays right after getting the leaf suit). The best part of the story was the voice acting by far. \n\n8/10 --- It's a genuinly good game if you overlook the combat. The best part is definetly the movement of the leaf suit.

The gameplay is fun tho! Exploring in this game feels so good simply because you can jump reeaaallly far and go very fast. You feel like a movement god from the beginning and then you get fucking double jump and the game gets real fun. There is combat but its so easy, and you have 5 lives that you can get back pretty easily. The focus of the game for me became getting to all the weird high parts of the levels, which I enjoyed very much. In one of the indoor levels I was able to clip through a wall and jump on all the ceilings of the rooms and pathways, which was fun. The game is pretty short but worth the $5 I payed for it, I wouldn't pay any more for it tho.\n\nPros\n- Movement is so fun and powerful\n- a decent amount of collectables\n- Level design is varied and reminded me of HL2 in a way.\n- Modelling is AAA tier. Very impressive\n- Short and sweet\n\nCons\n- No map or any form of detecting/tracking collectibles, so you just have to brute force search the maps(which are very large). This really hurts post game backtracking for collectables\n- Story is Ferngully tier\n- Combat feels very tacked on and unnecessary, except for one decent fight near the end of the game\n", "timestamp_created": 1517772752, "timestamp_updated": 1517772752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39850693": {"recommendationid": "39850693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097416879", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 220, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517771751}, "language": "english", "review": "Short, sweet, fun little action/platformer.

Valley has also got the fast running for fun like in a Sonic game and ME and also has an ecological message like a book from Hans Jonas, which is transported very nicely and subtly. For example, if you die you can be reborn, but only if the serounding nature has enough life to give you, which you can give to it beforehand. So I think the message here is, that you need to protect nature for your own benefit and survival. If nature does ok, you do ok. And then of course the whole plot, where the military wants to build a weapon with the forces of nature and the idealistic anthroplogist is against it. That was a bit clich\u00e9.\n\nThe positive aspects of this game are:\n+it's very beautiful and it makes you want to go outside into nature\n+it has a nice storyline, nothing special, but pretty swell\n+The mechanics work well and are fun\n+The mechanics are also creative: for instance, your weaopn, your health and \"energy\" bar are all the same thing, so you hypothetically have to be economical about it.\n+the soundtrack is amazing\n\nThe negative aspects are:\n-It's very short. I wouldn't have bought it for 20 bucks, but for 5 it was an ok deal.\n-It's very easy. If you're not very bad at these ego-jump type games you it shouldn't be a challenge. (I only failed a couple of times and only was stuck on two scenarios) Also the enemies are very weak.\n\nAll in all, you could buy this if it is on sale.

I really want to see more games use mechanics like this!\n\nThings I wasn't so impressed by: collectables and the availability of movement mechanics. Every one of the suit's upgrades are neat and useful, but some of the best ones are given so late in the game that you're not given much chance to use them, and so often this has a direct impact on collectible-gathering. I would try so hard to reach places I thought I was supposed to go only to find that an upgrade I get later on lets me get there. The game doesn't really give you any hints that there's Metroidvania at play, and even if it did, that format doesn't make collectibles fun--it makes it a frustrating chore, especially when the last upgrade you get solves the worst headaches for \"explore everything as soon as I see it\" types.

You\u2019ll see lots of things in great detail. Though, look closely and you\u2019ll see parts where they\u2019ve skimped out. It\u2019s not nearly as noticeable at first glance which is why it gets a high score.\n\n[b]Storyline: 7/10[/b]\nIt starts off slow, but not in a tedious fashion like many would assume. The story is mostly told through Audio logs that would play automatically as you progress (A bit like in BioShock). Countless of notes can also be found around the place that mention smaller parts that contribute to the whole story. This was a decent way of telling the story, but it was limited in terms of content per log which left some gaps that the player had to assume to understand the full picture. \n\nIt was more of a [i]dig out the story for yourself[/i] instead of relying for the game to tell it to you directly which is especially true when finding notes to read. The story is linear with no choices.\n\n[b]Sound: 8/10[/b]\nStarting with the minor issues \u2013 The sound effects are loud, there is no separate volume adjuster for these. And speaking of volume adjustment; there are only 2: \u201cMaster\u201d and \u201cMusic\u201d\u2026nothing for sound effects or voices. There is also a bug in which the background music would turn off after adjusting the \u201cMusic\u201d to a higher or lower volume, a restart would be needed to get it to work again. \n\nOther than those, the game does actually have a great soundtrack to it.

I didn\u2019t encounter any lag, glitches or stutters throughout my entire gameplay.

You play as some guy in search of some legendary artifact, find yourself starting off in a crashed canoe in some cave. Shortly after viewing the scenery (get used to the color palette), you get the L.E.A.F. suit, which stands for \"Leap Effortlessly through Air Functionality,\" a silly enough acronym that feels so forced to spell out \"leaf.\" You're immediately given an instructional... slideshow (through what monitor?) that explains how the suit can run fast, jump high, and oh by the way it can control life and death itself.\n\nCome again? We're just gonna skim over that? I'm sure it's explained later, but even a tiny hint at this would be better than the not-exactly-laughable skimming over this hugely important element. \n\nWith that out of the way, the game is not exactly difficult. It's barely more difficult than a walking simulator. The color palette is bland. The running, jumping, and grappling is kinda fun, but has trouble keeping up with itself. In Sonic-esque fashion, the levels are designed to give you hints as to where to run by placing the little energy bubbles along the way that replenish your life-giving shooty-power, but is easily ruined. And when the action is slowed down, I could instantly feel myself wanting to play something else.\n\nLong story short, unique game with some interesting mechanics, a silly premise and a story you're hard-pressed to care about, sorta fun platforming and pretty graphics but overall bland and fails to keep my attention for very long.

I picked it up on sale mostly because it had a nice setting and graphics, but I didn't expect the gameplay to be as fun and the plot to be as great as they were.\n\nYou can see on the store page that the visuals are pretty nice, and they're accompanied by some gorgeous music.\n\nBoth the plot and some gameplay elements have strong themes of life, death and reincarnation. I won't mention anything about the plot itself to avoid even the slightest of spoilers since it relies on mysteries and incrementally being told to the player through audio logs and notes scattered throughout the game. There isn't any traditional and direct narration, but this system worked perfectly and only complimented the air of mystery about the game's setting and its history. I was interested in the plot all the way through and really enjoyed experiencing it.\n\nThe high point of the game to me was definitely the momentum-based parkour gameplay. Very early on you find an exoskeleton which allows you to jump higher and run faster than a human normally can. Running downhill can get you insane momentum which will carry you very far if you jump or ascend a small hill afterwards. As you progress you will find upgrades to your suit, allowing you to double jump, swing from crane hooks, walk along magnetic walls and even temporarily run across water. This was all very satisfying, and part of that is due to the great sound design as well. The sound of making a heavy impact makes you almost feel it, and you get an awesome sense of speed by hearing the wind as you soar through the air. These mechanics made exploring and generally progressing through the game a lot of fun.\n\nThe other main mechanic of the game is that to a certain extent, you can control life and death. Your exoskeleton allows you to give life to and take life from bigger organisms such as trees, deer and rabbits. You'll want the valley to be pretty alive, though, since when you die, it will revive you by taking life energy from the valley. This also returns a lot in the plot but like I said, no spoilers here.\n\nWhile I thoroughly enjoyed the game and have mostly good things to say about it, some stuff bothered me a bit. A very minor gripe is the \"energy low\" and \"out of energy\" flashing above your crosshair. You can always see your energy levels on the HUD and it's even obvious by your glove that you don't have energy, so the text constantly flashing is completely unnecessary and purely a nuisance.\n\nThere is a lot of room to explore in the levels, but a little too often did I not have anything to show for getting to some seemingly hidden or hard to reach area or platform as there was just nothing there. The exploring itself was fun, but there was a lot of empty space that could have at least had some little reward or something interesting to it, because in plenty of cases it almost felt like a waste of time. Exploring can make you find energy upgrades and acorns and medallions which are used to gain access through special doors into secret areas. It's very handy to find them and in terms of the energy, almost necessary since it serves as your health and to fuel some exoskeleton functions, but like I said, most of the time I found rather little so it didn't always feel worth it.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that there are no save points within a chapter. You'll respawn just fine if you fall off the map and die, but if you quit the game, you'll appear at the very start of that chapter rather than where you respawn after dying. It will have saved your quest progress and what you picked up, and in some cases you'll have unlocked a shortcut, but I had two instances where I've had to close the game after having been in a chapter for half an hour and had to retrace my steps afterwards.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed it, and that's saying something because I've lately been in a period where games either bore me or frustrate me too much and I don't get to enjoy them properly. I had picked it up for 4 Euro during a sale pretty much only because the visuals looked nice, but many aspects of the game ended up far exceeding the visuals.", "timestamp_created": 1517504323, "timestamp_updated": 1517505379, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39771223": {"recommendationid": "39771223", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995523996", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517503306}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought Valley on special for next to nothing.

It's not the best.. Sometimes feels unresponsive. Could be a keyboard/mouse thing but not sure.\n- Slow start. It takes a while for the game to pick up momentum.\n- Little to no replayability.

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes exporation games, the WW1 and 2 era, and taking in scenery while leaping across chasms you can't see the bottom of. \n\nThe controls are super easy with a controller. It almost feels like Titanfall 2 -- there's a lot of running and jumping, though it isn't near as smooth. I also wouldn't recommend the game to anyone who's afraid of heights. The valley is breathtaking and detailed, assuming your rig can run with it. The music is good, too, though I turned it down; I felt like it took away from the experience.\n\nMy only -- only -- problem with the game is in the concept itself. While I love the idea of taking and giving life in a game (who doesn't like playing God?), I don't think it fits too well. I mean... you get a suit that allows you to jump incredible heights, run as fast as a cheetah, and oh, by the way, it'll let you take the life from living things and restore the dead back to life. While undeniably awesome, it doesn't flow well. It's taking me some time to get past that. \n\nI like it, though. It's fun, real pretty, and has enough creepiness to it to make it more than an exploration game. I can't wait to finish it!

I found it to be just \"entertaining enough\" to keep me going to the end even though I knew where it was going pretty much from the beginning. The characters are the expected archetype for this type of story... The mad scientist, the rouge soldier, etc. But the voice acting was well done.\n\nThe shining point for this game is it's presentation, and the experience of it. The suit was fun to run with and the sense of speed was pretty well represented. On a few of the drops I made the classic mistake of looking down and actually felt my stomach drop! The music was great, especially in the tunnel runs, but the other sounds could have used a buff or their own imagining. It sounded like they were ripped straight from the Call of Duty suit things they had in that one game.\n\nAlthough I don't see myself booting it up again let alone running though the story again, for the price of a large coffee, the initial run through was worth the price of admission, and if there was to ever to be an expansion via DLC I would definitely give it a look.\n\n 8/10 (WHILE ON SALE!!!)\nI honestly couldn't recommend paying the full price for it, it's just not engrossing or replayable enough for a $20 title.", "timestamp_created": 1517286224, "timestamp_updated": 1517287245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39719316": {"recommendationid": "39719316", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280762473", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 561, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514199469}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ubaa8\ub4e0 \uac83\uc774 \uc88b\uc740\ub370 \uc800\ub294 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uae38\uce58\ub77c \uae38\ucc3e\uae30 \ub108\ubb34 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6e0\uc74c\n\ubb34\uc2a8 \ub098\ubb34\uc5d0 \uac78\ub824\uc788\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\uac19\uc740\uac70 \ud0c0\uace0 \uc808\ubcbd\uc5d0 \uc654\ub294\ub370 \uae38 \uc5c6\uc5b4\uc11c \ub3cc\uc544\ub2e4\ub2c8\ub2e4\uac00 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc7a1\uc544\uba39\uace0 (\uc6d0\ub798\ub294 \uc654\ub358\uae38\ub85c \ub418\ub3cc\uc544\uac00\uc57c\ud568)\n\uadf8\ub798\ub3c4 \uae38 \ubabb\ucc3e\uc544\uc11c \uc808\ubcbd \uc544\ub798\ub85c \ub6f0\uc5b4\uc62c\ub77c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ub545\uc5d0 \ucc29\ub959\ud588\ub294\ub370 \uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c0\ub098\uac14\ub358 \uc9c0\ud615\uc784 \uadf8\ub798\uc11c \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub098\ubb34\uc5d0 \uac78\ub824\uc788\ub294 \uae30\uacc4\uac19\uc740\uac70 \ud0c0\uace0 \ub2e4\uc2dc \uc624\ub294\ub370 \uc2dc\uac04 \uc7a1\uc544\uba39\uc74c \uc774 \uae00\uc744 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uae30 \ud798\ub4e4\uac70\uc784 \uadf8\ub7f0\ub370 \ub098\ub294 \uc815\ub9d0 \uae38\uc744 \ubabb\ucc3e\uc544\uc11c 3\uc2dc\uac04\uc740 \uc7a1\uc544\uba39\uc74c \uadf8\uac8c \ub108\ubb34 \uc2ac\ud37c\uc11c \ub9ac\ubdf0\uc5d0 \uae00\uc744 \uc801\uc74c\n\n\uadf8\uac70 \uc678\uc5d4 \ub2e4 \uc88b\uc74c \uc5b4\ub835\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc54a\uace0 \uc88b\uc74c \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9f5\uc774 \uc0dd\uacbc\uc73c\uba74 \uc88b\uaca0\uc74c", "timestamp_created": 1517283338, "timestamp_updated": 1517283338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39719239": {"recommendationid": "39719239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105553027", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517282835}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing game that will keep you interested with its plot.

The graphics are not very fancy but easily convey the atmosphere of the game.\n\nMusic: 9/10 - Similarly to the graphics, the music isn't exciting on its own and I wouldn't listen to the game's OST, but it very skillfully conveys the atmosphere of different parts of the game.\n\nSound: 7/10 - Sound other than music, was rather generic to my taste.\n\nStory: 4/10 - The player learns of the story line in a very generic way. The story it self, while intriguing at first, is uninteresting and soon enough I stopped caring about it.\n\nGameplay: 5/10 - The general control and acrobatic is fun, but the game becomes rather repetitive quickly, with the main challenge being trying to figure out where to go next.\n\nOverall:\nThe atmosphere and music were definitely the fun parts of the game, which later became feeling repetitive. Being as short as it is, with a poor storyline and not big on gameplay, I do not regret buying the game 75% off.

The gameplay is simple, sort of a mix of light parkour and puzzles.

Not amazingly well done, but still interesting and doesn't detract from the game at all.

The movement is fun and manages to convey speed much better than most games I've played. The LEAF Suit (Your power armour) keeps gaining new abilities all the way through the 3 or so hours of story and they're all a lot of fun to play with, even if you don't neccesarily get to do so properly more than once or twice.\n\nAlong with a range of movement powers the suit can also steal life energy from the world around you, or distirbute it to bring dead animals and plants back to life. This has a few practical applications and ties into the way death is handled in game. To put it as simply as possible-  as long as the Valley lives, so do you. Each time you die you suck energy out of the world to revive, if the valley gets too barren then you'll die for real, so it's a good idea to play Jesus from time to time and bring a few trees or deer back to life so they'll be there for when you inevitably misjudge a jump and need their souls to continue.\n\nThe landscapes you navigate are beautiful but not exactly unique, the retro-futuristic aesthetic you encounter in the  more recent human buildings is Fallout and Bioshock and Prey and every other game that's gone with that look in recent years. The open nautral spaces are fine but kind of basic. The game does best when it dumps you into caves or structures left behind by the original inhabitants of the Valley, where that culture's odd hybrid aesthetic that smushes together a couple of different ancient cultures does stand out as unusual.\n\nThe story is conveyed through scattered notes and audio logs - once again, hardly a new idea- the voice acting is fine and the story holds together well enough, especially at the start when you've got no idea where you are or why anything is the way it is.\n\nThe more you learn however, the less the story holds up. But that's a subjective issue that I suspect won't bother most people who buy into the \"Isn't nature awesome?\" vibe that the game goes in for in general. \n\nOverall I'd recommend this game, it's one of the more unusual gameplay experiences I've had in a while and, while it may seem like I'm damning with faint praise here I'd argue it's a good example of how to do a \"Walking Simulator\" in a way that's actually comeplling. This is still a game in which you move from place to place being told a story, but the mechanics of doing that are fun and immersive rather than dull or immersion breaking.\n\nIf you want to know my own personal issue with this game's story, see below...\n\n\nSPOILERS in \n\n3...\n\n2..\n\n1...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOkay.  So it turns out all the messing around with life energy that humans have been doing in the Valley is A Bad Thing and brought down the wrath of Gaia or something. The problem with this is that the things that ultimately wipe out the most recent set of human visitors are a peice of cake to deal with using the LEAF suit.\n\nWhy is this a problem?\n\nBecause this technology gives you control over life and death. It makes the user functionally immortal. Forget all the bullshit about superweapons the science team who went there before you and made such a fuckup of the whole enterprise were into, you just stumbled across the key to abolishing death.\n\nAnd yet you don't even consider that before you torch all the research and ditch your suit at the end.  The story apparently thinks you'll care so much about the harm done to a bunch of clearly non sapient energy blobs or the terrible threat posed by some slightly scarier energy blobs that really don't pose a threat if managed properly that you'd be cool with abandoning the single greatest discovery humanity has ever made.\n\nI can't overstate how much I hate this kind of lazy - \"Nature good, science bad\" writing. It's anti-human and stupidly reductive. It's especially annoying because the only character we really get to see who embodies the scientific approach to the Valley is a lunatic who even his own colleagues seem to recognize isn't really fit to be in charge. We're meant to take him as a stand in for humanity in general and conclude that we shouldn't be meddling with this stuff. Rather than the conclusion that I drew, which was \u2013 do not try and make a bomb out of souls. \n\nI was genuinely hoping the player would get a choice at the end of the game to either destroy everything or try to salvage some of it to bring back to humanity.  If that had been included, even if it had a big BAD ENDING sticker slapped onto it to keep the morality of the story consistent I'd not be writing this bit. However this left such a bad taste that I'd probably not have bothered  playing this game if I'd anticipated it. So here it is for anyone who's \u2013 oddly- decided to spoil a story driven game for themselves. If the above puts you off then, frankly, good. You have a healthy view of humanity, something the writers of this game clearly lack. \n--------------------------------------------------------", "timestamp_created": 1517275652, "timestamp_updated": 1517275652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39717654": {"recommendationid": "39717654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198420184445", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518939627}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uac8c\uc784\uc740 \uadf8\ub0e5 \ub2ec\ub9ac\uace0,\uc810\ud504\ud558\uace0,\ucc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0,\uac77\uace0 \ub4f1\ub4f1 \uc554\ud2bc \ub3d9\uc791 \ubaa8\ub4e0\uac8c \uc7ac\ubc0c\uc74c", "timestamp_created": 1517275024, "timestamp_updated": 1517275024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39716978": {"recommendationid": "39716978", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999165533", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517361825}, "language": "english", "review": "So far, its a fun game.

(Never liked MB). It sometimes doesn't look amazing right up close to objects but you arent going to notice it that much when you are flying through this open environment jumping and running throughout the game.\nControls:\nOn Keyboard the controls feel nice and they flow together extremely well, momentum is both your friend and your enemy. There isn't really much to say about controls as you really only need to know how to move and how the suit works. Honestly it is just learning how much momentum you need for a certain gap or how to get to it in another way is what makes the controls harder.\nGameplay:\nNow even though at this point in time I only have 2 hours playtime, The game follows a story and everything you do with Life and Death affects the Environment around you, in the game. Think of the Valleys health bar as your own when going through the game as you would, however there needs to be a balance as your Suit requires Energy Orbs and to get them you can take life from animals and nature to achieve this or a generator dotted around the area. You can also give life to anything that has died such as a tree withered with no leaves or an animal that is lay down or not moving with an aura around them.\nOverall:\nIf you get this game on the sale you wont regret it as it looks great, has a storyline to it (You learn whilst you go through the story reading notes) and the controls feel nice with everything intetlinking smoothly.\nGraphics - Beauty? 8/10 depending on what you like to look at in games.\nControls? 7.5/10.

Perfekt ist es nat\u00fcrlich nicht - aber schon ganz sch\u00f6n nah dran. \nHier eine kurze, spoilerfreie Einf\u00fchrung:\nMan spielt einen Charakter ( m/w ), der sich alleine auf eine Erkundungsreise begibt um ein verstecktes Tal ( Valley ) in den Rocky Mountains zu erforschen. Das Tal war w\u00e4hrend des zweiten Weltkrieges Ort eines geheimen Experimentes der US-Armee, welches das Ziel hatte die Geheimnise des Valleys zuentschl\u00fcsseln und f\u00fcr den Bau einer Waffe zu nutzen. Im Verlauf dieser Reise erf\u00e4hrt man mehr \u00fcber die untergegangene Zivilisation, die dieses Tal bev\u00f6lkerte als auch \u00fcber die Experimente der Armee. Das wichtigste Utensil dieser Erkundung ist ein L.E.A.F - Jumpsuit, der dem Spieler verschiedene F\u00e4higkeiten verleiht und im Verlaufe des Spieles allerlei Upgrades erf\u00e4hrt. Einige sind essentiel, andere optional. Die obligatorischen Sammelquests und Steam-Erfolge sind nat\u00fcrlich auch vorhanden.\n\nHier meine Pros und Kontras:\n\n+ sehr sch\u00f6ne, stimmige Grafik\n+ interessantes Weltdesign, sehr detailiert und stimmig\n+ toller Soundtrack\n+ harmonisches Gameplay, sehr saubere Steuerung\n+ kaum Bugs ( Ich habe einen entdeckt, aber eher unwichtig - ich WOLLTE wenigstens EINEN finden )\n+ lineares Gamedesign, aber mit uneingeschr\u00e4nkter Backtracking-Option \n\n- unzureichenes Speichersystem, es gibt nur einen Speicherpunkt am Anfang jeder Map, die teilweise recht gro\u00df sind\n- eines der Anzugupgrades ist in einigen Arealen pl\u00f6tzlich unwirksam geschaltet, ohne das dies f\u00fcr den Spieler nachvollziehbar ist, man stirbt also unter Umst\u00e4nden einige \u00fcberraschende Tode ohne Verschulden\n- der Ambientsound ist recht unstetig, es gibt teilweise etwas harte Br\u00fcche bei Arealwechseln\n- die Story funktioniert im wesentlichen \u00fcber das Erleben und Erforschen der Umwelt sowie \u00fcber Audio- und\nSchriftlogs, die sich leider nicht aufrufen lassen, das Storytelling ist v\u00f6llig ausreichend aber vielleicht etwas mager\n\nMeiner Meinung nach \u00fcberwiegen die Pros erheblich und ich kann das Spiel sehr empfehlen. Der Anspruch ist nicht\n\u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig hoch, es gibt keine Schwierigkeitsstufen und die Spielphysik ist sehr gn\u00e4dig ( Man kann im Sprung die Richtung wechseln, nicht logisch aber hilfreich! )\nDas Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis ist angemessen, auch wenn der Wiederspielwert sehr m\u00e4\u00dfig ist ( Der Begriff \"Speedrun\" bekommt in diesem Spiel allerdings eine neue Dimension.

While not exactly an open world, it feels \u201copen enough\u201d where you can spend lots of time exploring, getting lost, getting back on track and never getting bored or worse, frustrated, in the process.  The mechanics of leaping,  grabbling, swinging around, and sticking to walls will be familiar to most of you.   The challenges are all approachable and the combat, which is rare and not really combat, is quite easy.     The music is awesome, the controls simple, the scenery beautiful.  There\u2019s not a lot of options, just well spaced upgrades that are useful and give you the confidence to explore in more risky ways.   Awesome for the price, it\u2019s a fun time and feels priced right for the time I put in.  Story development is interesting enough to keep your attention.  Nothing really negative to say about this game.

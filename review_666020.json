Some more animation in the background and possibly a reworked bumper or two could benefit endgame in my opinion. I'm not sure how many other people might've commented on some of the things that I just did, as I didn't read the rest of the comments and reviews, but all I can say is that I'm definately going to be here for the long haul.

Well, the game doesn't take itself seriously, kinda like the game Crush Crush. There are afew references to pop culture (MEMES) here and there, as well as a few fourth wall breaks, which I will excuse due to the fact that the game doesn't take itself seriously. There are scenes in the game that are graphic, and by graphic, you see human-shark hybrid tits if you do well enough.\n\nAll and all, its pretty funny.\n\nThere are a few problems I have, and take this with a grain of salt due to the game being in early access, but it was funny enough that i wanted more, and there just isn't any more to the game. I beat the game in about 30-40 minutes, which consisted of 2 playthroughs until i got the best ending(?) in the game at the moment. I also get that it's supposed to be a challenge to get the best(?) ending in the game, but the minigame at the end that you have to play to get it is super restrictive, and not too much margin for error if you miss too many pegs on the board. Granted, I did get 42 balls by the end, and had enough for the ending when i had 20 left, but there was about 192 pegs on the board, and to get the best ending, you needed 180 pegs. Again, it wasn't a problem, and they made you want to work for it, but that margin of error is a bit too small for my liking. That's just a personal preference, but i could see why the difficulty is there in the first place.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Well, it has uncensored nipples, can be beaten in 20 minutes and only cost 1 USD, along with the chances of future updates adding more content, so of course I recommend this game.\n\nPS: If you're too much of a weenie to see the game through, all the images are in the game's data files.

It was released on September 22, 2017 for Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X, and later on October 6, 2017 for Steam. The story follows a male high school student who joins the school's literature club and interacts with its four female members. The game features a mostly linear story, with some alternate scenes and endings depending on the choices the player makes. While it appears at first glance to be a lighthearted game, it is in fact a psychological horror game that involves heavy use of breaking the fourth wall.\n\nThe game was developed in an estimated two-year period by a team led by Dan Salvato, known previously for his modding work for Super Smash Bros. Melee. According to Salvato, the inspiration for the game came from his mixed feelings toward anime, and a fascination for surreal and unsettling experiences. Upon its release, Doki Doki Literature Club! received critical praise for its metafictional and horror elements, with PC Gamer calling it \"one of the most surprising games of the year.\"\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club! is a visual novel, so the majority of the gameplay consists of the player reading the game's story. At certain points in the game the player is prompted to make decisions which may affect how the story progresses. The game also features a poetry writing mechanic as part of the literature club. The player is given a list of various words to select from that will make up their poem. Each girl in the literature club has different word preferences, and will react when the player picks a word that they like. Additional scenes can be unlocked for each girl if the player writes poems targeted at that girl's tastes, and choses the correct dialogue options. Which scenes the player has viewed during their playthrough will determine what ending the story has.\n\nIn Doki Doki Literature Club! the protagonist (whose name is provided by the player) is invited by his childhood friend Sayori to join their high school's literature club. There he meets the other members of the club: the snide but peppy Natsuki, the shy and timid Yuri, and the perfectionist club president Monika.[6] The protagonist starts to participate in the club's activities such as writing and sharing poetry, and starts getting to know the four girls more closely.\n\nWhile preparing for a festival to invite more classmates to join the literature club, Sayori admits that she suffers from depression. As the day of the festival approaches, Sayori's usually bittersweet poem is replaced with a dark and morbid note repeatedly telling someone to get out of her head. When Sayori doesn't answer calls, the protagonist rushes to Sayori's home, only to find that she's hanged herself. The game suddenly begins to glitch, and the player is forced to start from the beginning, only Sayori is absent and any remnants of her presence appear to make the game glitch and break down.\n\nOnce again the protagonist meets the literature club (minus Sayori) and gets to know Natsuki and Yuri more through sharing and reading poetry. However, more and more unsettling events occur, with normal dialogue being replaced by darker content. Multiple other glitches occur, such as the game rewinding after the protagonist finds Yuri cutting herself and the game refusing to accept conversation selections that don't favor Monika. Before the festival, Yuri presents the protagonist with a poem consisting of illegible writing and bloodstains; after confessing her love to the protagonist, Yuri stabs herself multiple times in the chest and dies. Upon discovering Yuri's body, Natsuki becomes ill and flees. Monika then apologizes and deletes the \"character files\" for Yuri and Natsuki, causing the game to restart once again.\n\nUpon starting a new game, the protagonist is placed in an ethereal room with Monika seated across from him. Monika explains that she's aware that she's trapped in a game and that she is able to manipulate the game's files to alter characters' personalities or erase them altogether. She confesses her love directly not to the protagonist, but to the person playing the game. This sequence continues indefinitely until the player manually enters the game's directory and deletes Monika's character file. Upon doing this, the game glitches once more and Monika panics as she's deleted from the game's world. However, she accepts that loving the player means letting them be happy, so she accepts them living happily without her.\n\nThe game starts over once again with Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki all alive and normal, playing out similarly to the initial playthrough (minus Monika). Shortly after meeting everyone, though, Sayori explains to the player that now that she's the president of the literature club, she knows everything about the game and what the player did.\n\nMonika suddenly intervenes once more, claiming she's changed her mind, and the game glitches again. Monika then speaks audibly to the player (the only spoken dialogue in the game) and sings a song she had been preparing, which plays over the credits (which display all of the scenes the player failed to witness). The game ends with a thank you note from Monika.\n\nIf the player had loaded previous saves or began new playthroughs to view every scene with Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki without witnessing Sayori's initial suicide, rather than Monika's intervention, Sayori thanks the player for trying to help all of the girls. After the credits the player is then presented with a thank you note from the game's developer.\n\nDan Salvato spent an estimated two years working on Doki Doki Literature Club in secret before releasing it as his first game. Prior to its release, Salvato was known for creating the FrankerFaceZ extension for Twitch.tv, his modding work in the Super Smash Bros scene, and for his custom Super Mario Maker levels.\n\nDoki Doki Literature Club! was first released on September 22, 2017 on itch.io, and was later also released on Steam. The game is available as freeware with an optional pay what you want model. Paying US$10 or more unlocks a bonus \"Fan Pack\" that includes desktop and mobile wallpapers, the game's official soundtrack, and a digital concept art booklet.\n\nSalvato cited his \"love-hate relationship\" with anime as inspiration for creating Doki Doki Literature Club. Discussing the horror elements of the game, Salvato explained that he was inspired by \"things that are scary because they make you uncomfortable, not because they shove scary-looking things in your face.\"\n\nAfter its release, Doki Doki Literature Club quickly gained a cult following.\n\nGita Jackson from Kotaku described Doki Doki Literature Club as \"a truly special game,\" adding \"if you like horror games, especially ones that really get under your skin, please check out Doki Doki Literature Club.\" GQ's Tom Philip called it \"one of the scariest games I have ever played.\" He went on to praise the game's writing saying it contained \"some of the most wickedly inventive narrative techniques I've ever seen,\" but commented that at times it felt like \"a slog, clicking through endless amounts of inane, flirty conversation about poetry.\"", "timestamp_created": 1510810118, "timestamp_updated": 1510810118, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480460", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "36520308": {"recommendationid": "36520308", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983890775", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 16740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7641, "last_played": 1516431344}, "language": "english", "review": "Disclaimer: I am being sponsored by Sharks\u2122, The Ocean\u2122, Sharks With Breasts\u2122 and Major (20,000) Leagues (Under the Sea) Gaming\u2122.\n\nShark Dating Simulator XL is likely to go down in history as one of the greatest visual novels to ever be created and released upon the Steam gaming platform.\nThis game, should you be so crude to label a masterpiece as simply a game, includes a multitude of characters with exceptional depth, realistic and very natural feeling storytelling, anatomically correct fish, choices that change the very nature of the story and high-intensity ball-dropping action.\n\nThe experience begins in the main menu itself, where you are given the revolutionary option to choose between a male and female gendered character.

It was not long before I could maintain my indifferent fa\u00e7ade no longer, and I asked - nay, demanded - that Nettelswipe take instruction from myself regarding the manner in which to proceed in this compelling pursuit of talking fish. \n\nTalking fish! Indeed! The very idea! Such a notion was quite bewildering to even a wordly fellow such as I, but I nonetheless perservered and was rewarded many times over for experiencing this unique thalassic romp. All thoughts of Team Fortress II pushed from my (admittedly vast) mind in much the same way as Nettelswipe dutifully pushes street urchins aside when I stride across the cobbles of my town, I played at this \"Shark Dating Simulator\" (version Forty) all through the night, gleefully swigging Shiraz and puffing my pipe in satisfaction with my many, many conquests while Nettelswipe operated the interface at my instruction.\n\nWhen it came to pass that the sun's rays indicated the arrival of the morningtime, it was a wiser version of myself who admitted that it was time to put away this magnificent game, something I could only do by accepting the reassurances of my butler (to whom I had undoubtedly grown closer during our shared experience that night) that it was most likely a game intended for mere commoners, due to its plebeian price tag. But I know that I will soon return to these wondrous shores at my leisure, to sample more of the many titillating adventures that lie within the choices that I might make along the way.\n\nGrVIII fap material, GOTY, V out of V.", "timestamp_created": 1502923799, "timestamp_updated": 1502924014, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458260", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34284995": {"recommendationid": "34284995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198102124208", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514825465}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased this game looking to date a shark, and so I did.

You go underwater and see this female shark that has actions as a tsundere girl. I know there many storylines in the game, but so far i only wanted to date the shark, i mean why else call it a shark dating simulator? As you progess in the game, you start to know more about the female shark and her story. While you're playing the game, if you choose the right dialogue you get some balls, and then you use them to play some sort of mini game.\n\nVerdict\nI only progess through one ending in the game so far, should i recommend this game? Um... YES. I kinda recommend this game, eventhough this an early access game i still recommend this game! They have some funny dialogue, the shark girl character is intresting, and most of all, it makes me want to see some shark porn now. Congradulations Conan McPhee!

Shark Dating Simulator XL at its current state, has a tiny story for you to play that last about 20 minutes. The story was interesting to read, and will probably have ALOT more to offer, hence why the big \"EARLY ACCESS\" title is below the game. The comedy was alright, not the \"highest quality top of the line funniest thing ever lmao rofl so funny\", but atleast something to smile at, wont fit everyones taste. The minigame to win Shark Chans heart was ok to play as well. As every early access game goes, there will be more in the future, grab it now at the price it's at if you want, dont expect a fully functional game and give it a negative review because there isnt much to do. The developer promised a lot of things and as long as he is keeping us updated and developing the game, I see nothing wrong with this right now.

Uninstalled and forgotten.\n\nComedy is a skill which very few people grasp and doesnt just mean being random and putting random things in for the sake of it.\n\nThe skeleton of the story and general direction of it I enjoy, the actual content is mostly cringey and forced humour which tends to be either very hit or miss. Talking of content, there really isnt a lot of content to the game which was quite unfortunate as the store page reads as though there would be a multitude of routes and options thus leaving my excitement and hype for SDSXL very short lived.\n\nUnfortunately, as with most Early Access games this has been released far too early. From all the delays and setbacks just for one part of the story which was twenty minutes, I'm very doubtful on the \"early 2018\" goal being hit. Hopefully with a few more updates this game will be set back on track and will be recommendable, but until then, I feel very short changed and let down. \n\nThat's quite surprising, considering SDSXL comes in at a very low price. Hopefully the initial wave of \"OMGBESTGAMEEVER\" and \"ILUVSHARKS\" will die down and SDSXL will get the valuable feedback it requires to be a good visual novel but until then, I can't quite possibly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1502752085, "timestamp_updated": 1502753005, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.597873", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34244492": {"recommendationid": "34244492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036777325", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 55, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502984432}, "language": "english", "review": "I mean... they weren't lying \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp-orfqzdYc&feature=youtu.be", "timestamp_created": 1502748539, "timestamp_updated": 1502748539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.392599", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34243891": {"recommendationid": "34243891", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964069457", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513184301}, "language": "english", "review": "So far i love the game alot, its an amazing game the art work of the chacters are really good, the writing is funny have plenty of jokes in the game is but its worth the 0.99 cents for this game will help make you smile and laugh, props to the dev team\n\nhere are the pros and cons in the game.\n\nPros :\nfunny jokea\ngood writing\ngood artwork\nthe story seems to have good potential from what is in the first chapter.\ngood music\nshark chans voice is adorable :3\n\nCons :\nshort chapter - was told they may make the future ones longer\nneeds more music - maybe one extra for each chapter?\nno save atm - but the dev said they most likly will impliment it in future update\n\nover all I really enjoyed the first chapter of the game i cannot wait to update this review based on the other chapters look foward to the story\n\n\n~BloodWolf", "timestamp_created": 1502746269, "timestamp_updated": 1502996264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585472", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34243886": {"recommendationid": "34243886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074490663", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502746166}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game I have ever played in my entire life.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1502746245, "timestamp_updated": 1502746245, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34243734": {"recommendationid": "34243734", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028722026", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502744877}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my most intense orgasms I've had in many years.

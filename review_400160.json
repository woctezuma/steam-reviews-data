The idea is extremely well executed and neatly balanced, the gameplay barely leaves things to be desired. It does what it's supposed to do and it does it very well.\n\nYou play a tile-based city planner, in which you and the AI place buildings in an alternating fashion. You're supposed to make a nice city and fend off evil industrials etc., meaning you need to counter-act opposing houses and other point gathering buildings by placing your industry buildings close to them and boost your own gatherers with parks and the like. Earning points ensures victory, but sometimes giving up lines to your opponent is worth the risk, as you advance in research by placing more industrial components to unlock more cards for your deck while the game is running.\nThere's a lot of back and forth thinking about your previous, current and future moves and whether or not things will pay off eventually, making this a very strategic and complex puzzle game at times.\nThe player is smoothed into the game very nicely with an exceptional tutorial or entry level and continuous progression throughout the different mechanics, all the while enjoying a light-hearted, child-friendly plot with great voice acting to go along.\n\nConcrete Jungle overall is a well polished, well designed strategy puzzler I can recommend to almost anybody for a bit of casual fun.", "timestamp_created": 1520160314, "timestamp_updated": 1520160314, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39900046": {"recommendationid": "39900046", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983850432", "num_games_owned": 1030, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517970461}, "language": "english", "review": "It's basically a more polished version of Mega Cities from iOS/Android.

And as it stands it isn't a bad game by any measure, I'd rate it as \"neutral with potential to be great.\" However, outside of a few bugs, typos, and UI issues, there are some major design decisions that simply are not well thought out and really hurt the game.\n\nFirst, is the sheer randomness and variance in the game. Having such a small hand size and being able to only play the first 2 cards is severely crippling. I would love +1 to hand size and able to play the first three cards. Definitely feel like that would dramatically reduce the huge early game variance which can cripple a player before the game even really starts. Additionally, the way you buy new cards for your deck is super random. I would have explored a larger selection than 4 random cards within your tech limit. Something like a common pool and a private pool, maybe with the ability to remove and replace one of them each time you go to purchase. Also, when you spend a purchase point it resets the 4 cards you can add, which means you have to constantly swap after leveling up and seeing what 4 new cards are shown.\n\nSecond, is the issues with versus mode. So much of the game focuses on versus and either has a weird or weaker effect or more commonly simply doesn't work in solo. Also, you can't see your opponent's hand or skill tree on your own turn. The whole versus mode, while interesting, could use a lot more polish in being balanced and interesting as a competitive engagement. Some effects are just really silly, like ineberiated (which should just have a 50% chance to place in a random spot within 1 or something instead of actually moving your mouse around).\n\nThird, is the lack of UI features. The game really could use a lot more in terms of UI information. Letting you search cards by name, keyword, or other features. Having districts be automatically outlined instead of when a building of that type of selected or hovered and showing the current / max without having to click on the zone. And removing the awful \"accidentally click and place when trying to go to the Deck Building Screen.\"\n\nFourth, the unlock cards feature is super slow. Leveling up takes forever and playing some levels over and over just to unlock one new card is silly. Wish the unlocking of cards was tied into completing levels so you wouldn't have to grind and could just focus on winning and moving on.\n\nUltimately, the concept of the game is awesome. It really has potential and feel like it could become a classic if it was only better designed and polished. If the game concept seems interesting to you and you don't mind a lot of swinginess and a few roughy design decisions, pick it up on sale when it is under $5.

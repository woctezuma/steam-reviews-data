weird, especially jumping mechanics.

This happened especially on holiday maps (Halloween, Valentine's Day and so on)\nAlso, the gameplay is repetitive, you go from place to place, kill the boss after few arenas, and so on.\nLevel designs are ok, but could be better.\nArtstyle and music are really nice. Voice acting is decent, I believe Markiplier did the best job.\nExtra note: I didn't play in Polish (I switched to English) but I can see why people are complaining about translation, looking only at achievements section.

Maybe you want a relaxing 2D platformer with the easy difficulty or whether you want to play the Dark Souls of 2D platformers with 1 life pug mode. \nThis games story is ok. It is nice to see the well known Youtubers all come together in one game and fight along-side each other. The references are fun. However, it suffers from something that I call \"Mario Story Disease\". Main Villian steals something, Main character goes to get it back, goes through endless hords of enemies by jumping on them or killing them in any way, fights a variety of mini-bosses to get to main one, kills main boss, the end. That sums up the story. Its witty, but lacks a unique factor other that \"duuh, my fav utober is there, duuh\". That isn't unique\nConclusion\nI would give this a game  a:\n8.5 / 10\n- It is really fun\n- Controlls well\n- Got lots of recognisable faces\n- Likeable characters and lots of development\n- With some really good character development.\nHowever:\n- The story is predictable\n- Lacks the character development which I was expecting\n- Co-op is local ( I think)\n- Repetative after a while.\n\nI have been BabyFace, and that is what I thought of Pewdiepie: Legend of the Brofist.", "timestamp_created": 1470581824, "timestamp_updated": 1470581824, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24755340": {"recommendationid": "24755340", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097105025", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 2077, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471268563}, "language": "english", "review": "stupidly fun", "timestamp_created": 1470555501, "timestamp_updated": 1470555501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484247", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24675345": {"recommendationid": "24675345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304596341", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 1141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507034385}, "language": "english", "review": "Whats My Opinion On This Game?No Words Can Describe...When I Saw Sean,I Said ''Im Done,Im Already In Love With This Game''\n\nIts Worth The Money!\n", "timestamp_created": 1470164204, "timestamp_updated": 1470164204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.445471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24638703": {"recommendationid": "24638703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170123474", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 221, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509485664}, "language": "german", "review": "Super Spiel f\u00fcr Bros\nMacht viel spa\u00df gutes Gameplay und die Dialoge sind auch sehr lustig gestaltet \n\nDaumen hoch und Lob an die Devs", "timestamp_created": 1469989674, "timestamp_updated": 1469989674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556731", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24605904": {"recommendationid": "24605904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089523340", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470343813}, "language": "english", "review": "I've been a 'bro' for many years now, so it makes me sad to do this review, but I just can't recommend this game, $8 is too much for what this game has to offer, I totally regret buying it...

You know, when I first bought this game, I went in with expectations of hating because it was pandering to fans of a big-name YouTuber looking to make a quick buck. Ten minutes in, I was surprised to find myself actually enjoying it.\n\nThe game itself is relatively simple, in both gameplay and plot. Pewdiepie's fans have been kidnapped by Barrels, and now he has to team up with his friends (Marzia, Markiplier, CinnamonToastKen, and so forth) to get them back. The game is mostly a platformer, jump on enemies to beat them, grab coins for upgrades, get special weapons and all that jazz. Sometimes, there are levels where you have to survive a horde of enemies until escape arrives, and a few shoot 'em up levels in the sky, so there's at least variety. The voice acting is pretty standard (I mean, it's not awful, but given the personalities behind said voices, it could be better), and the game itself is full of in-jokes fans of these YouTubers will greatly enjoy.\n\nI'm not praising this game as a god among titans, especially as an indie title, but it's a fun little game I used to pass the time. It has its moments, and can be genuinely entertaining at times. My final verdict is a 7/10, a game I would recommend to fans of these Let's Players and as a fun platformer for kicks.", "timestamp_created": 1468607429, "timestamp_updated": 1468607429, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480769", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24334146": {"recommendationid": "24334146", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306519743", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517949757}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "N\u00e3o Recomendado para Menores de 14 Anos.", "timestamp_created": 1468590025, "timestamp_updated": 1468590025, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.338054", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24327445": {"recommendationid": "24327445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988532693", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468555597}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Excelente juego de plataformas, la jugabildad es muy buena, sencilla e intuitiva, la verdad es que los niveles altos de dificultad son muy divertidos.

\"bro\", I can say I somewhat enjoy PewDiePie's video's to some extent, and when I heard a game was announced, I waited eagerly for more details. After playing the game for a while, I can safely say that PewDiePie: Legend of the Brofist is a fairly decent game. It has a very generic, Mega-Man esque look to it, but it has a few powerups that I have not seen before. However, I can say there are some parts that felt awfully forced. There are achievements and badges, two things I will always praise games for, as well as some other characters including, CutiePieMarzia, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, CinnamonToastKen, Cryaotic, and a duck(for whatever reason.) The plot is... strange to say the least.

do any mario games other than the rpgs need story? no and this one doesnt either the story's alright though completelly ridiculous. *spoilers* pewds has to rescue his fans and friends that have been captured by the EVIL barrels and the dreaded barrel king in order to get the legendary brofist this games mcguffin. going through and rescuing everyone will eventually bring you to the dreaded barrel king the journey as well as the final fight is hard enough in places to make it challenging. it took me a good few tries to get to it. killing things like t-rex's and illuminatis will get you achievements cause you have to either be extremelly good at jumping or have a good skill to use skills are unlocked as you go the final one being the brofist which is only used by pewds\ngoing through and completing this game will nab you steam achievements and yes i will recomend this game to someone that wants a nice throwback to hard games like megaman. while no jumpnshoot mechanic making more like mario it still has the style of a megaman game and the difficulty. the game does have problems im not going to say its perfect cause its not. the voice acting...isnt the best but then again these are the youtubers doing it and you can skip it! the difficulty can be a little bullshit at times and how hard enemies hit you varies sometimes. but its a good game and i recomend you at least play it more than an hour or two before you judge it dont look at it like its pewdiepie. cause you can skip pretty much everything that has to do with him. the game has a few cutscenes whcih can be skipped.\n\nso by all means play it dont complete it cause you will have a slog of things to do. it got kind of annoying gathering certain patches", "timestamp_created": 1459104552, "timestamp_updated": 1459104552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534762", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22076898": {"recommendationid": "22076898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091525002", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1279, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458781043}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "O jogo \u00e9 muito bom... pena que tem poucas fases.\nN\u00e3o sei se vale o pre\u00e7o de 16 reais.", "timestamp_created": 1459049536, "timestamp_updated": 1459049536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535833", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22058185": {"recommendationid": "22058185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093932461", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 5286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464150296}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is one of my favorite Steam games!

Well, to answer that, I don't know. I think PewDiePie for the most part is NOT a bad youtuber so I think that was a key point, but also because of the state of so many other youtuber games. You know, like: Smosh: Food Battle The Game or Tobuscus Adventures The Game. While I haven't played the Tobuscus one which anyways has faded into obscurity, I did play the Smosh one and it could barely be concieved as a game. However, Legend of The Brofist delivers a nostalgic Metroid-vania style game which while overrun with PewDiePie references that are cringe worthy at times, at least it delivers a fun and enjoyable game. It is really good! The attacks and defences are good, collecting the stamps are enjoyable and I got an insentive to beat this game 100% (which I am still working on). But, there are problems. The voice-acting is pretty bad, the references are out of control and pretty much the concept is interchangeable with any youtubers but for an enjoyable game to have fun with (especially if you like platformers) even if you aren't necessarily a PewDiePie fan. I do recommend this game. - 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1456241538, "timestamp_updated": 1456241686, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21402986": {"recommendationid": "21402986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100829681", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 145, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456223835}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e17\u0e34\u0e49\u0e07\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e35", "timestamp_created": 1456223880, "timestamp_updated": 1456223880, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.966887", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21382528": {"recommendationid": "21382528", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098409085", "num_games_owned": 843, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480959823}, "language": "english", "review": "[quote=]I've received a review key, however, this has not affected my review.[/quote]\n\n[h1] \"Woah, PewDiePie is even on Steam.. ?\" [/h1]\n\nYes, yes it is! A tribute to all the fans of PewDiePie and quite an excellent tribute, meant to satisfy the hunger of the fans. The game is solely for the fans, if you're not a fan of PewDiePie you'll not enjoy the content too much, honestly. I don't like the fact that there are so many haters at the reviews, they shouldn't be so harsh on this just because there's PewDiePie in it and it's not a solid release like they wanted or something. It's something for the fans, after all and should be treated as a fan tribute, not like garbage. It's not anyone's problem that you can't enjoy a game just because you have a certain hatred for one of the YouTubers included into this game. This little rant was just to highlight the bad part of the community. Anyway . . .\n\n[h1] First Sight [/h1]\n\nSome pixel game with PewDiePie and others, what could go wrong? \n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\n\nOnce you launch the game and get into the first level, you're greeted by the star, PewDiePie himself. Furthermore, get assaulted by barrels and then you question yourself. [b] \"Is this a prank of some sort?\" [/b] Not really, but its where the fun and slaughter itself begins. Wood planks fly everywhere as you try to rescue the stars in Pewds' fandom, the difficulty increasing as more versions of the barrels start to spawn. \n\nBasically, the whole house's walls are torn apart and you can see holes everywhere like World War III has unleashed upon PewDiePie's house. Once finished, get called by the barrel king and told to join the barrels or get rekt or something. Been confused about it. Furthermore, get chased down by the first boss and battle barrels while jumping from car to car too. Here comes the part where it hits the fan, the difficulty is even more complex and tougher for platformer newbies and pros alike, in my opinion. \n\n[b] I had absolutely no problems with the mechanics or any freezing whatsoever. [/b]\n\nBut, difficulty is just to make the game more fun and challenging to think of a really big reward as well, right, riiiight.. ?\nAnswer is, yes.\n\nUpon finishing most levels on the Bro difficulty and the nice amount of achievements really makes it feel satisfying on the rewarding part, which makes it absolutely sweet.\n\n[h1] Graphics [/h1]\n\nThe pixel environment is really vivid and the absolute eye candy, really, its worth playing the game for the pixel work as well in my opinion. Enjoyed it and gives off a nice charm.\n\n[h1] OST & SFX [/h1]\n\nThe chiptune tracks really blasted off into my ears with an amazing feeling, not only that but fits into every level. RUSHJET1 did a great job with the soundtrack, and the sound effects are well done as well. The voice acting isn't something to praise, but it does its job, the little bit atleast.\n\n[h1] Pros'n'Cons [/h1]\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n\n+Lots of achievements\n+Addicting\n+Challenging\n+Colorful, beautiful surroundings\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n\n-On my side, there's absolutely no cons. I'm no PewDiePie fanboy, but aside from the weak voice acting there is no con.\n\n[h1] Should you buy it? [/h1]\n\nI recommend to buy it when it's on sale and/or if you want to kill your time and add more achievements to your collection.\n\n[quote=]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation] Follow Original Curator Group [/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1456133243, "timestamp_updated": 1456133263, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.574573", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21378844": {"recommendationid": "21378844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217188444", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455684130}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game!

The game lets the player take the role of Pewdiepie, along with other Let\u2019s Players associated with him, to venture through tedious, platforming landscapes to rescue Pewds fans from the grasps of the relentless and evil Barrels. The game plays like a standard platformer adding other intriguing retro style elements similar to Gradius on the NES to make a bit of variety, which keeps the game interesting.\n\n What I liked:\n\nQuirky Opponents - While playing the game one sudden realization surfaced: this game is in no way meant to be taken seriously, not even the slightest. After all, the title pays homeage to Pewdiepie\u2019s quirky, online behaviour. The levels are littered with an assortment of random enemies, each one harboring their own unique way of harming you. Most enemies are a variation of barrel characters ranging from regular barrels, who just hop ever-so-closely in hopes of inflicting damage, to TNT barrels that simply explode when you come into close proximity to spray you with harmful debris. While you may think about the oddity of such opponents, things get more peculiar as you witness killer whales falling from the sky and mystical unicorns charging at you with their rainbow entrails. Like I said, the enemies get interesting and/or ridiculous, which is amusing a lot of the time.\n\nSkills or Just Difficult- Platforming is a skill that wasn\u2019t ever weaved into my DNA so it all depends on the player and their level of expertise that will determine the punishment of this game. For someone like myself (who lacks basic platforming skills) they might find the easy mode option appropriate for beating the game, while those who do require a challenge to fully prove themselves can do so. The players can choose between easy, medium and hard which are represented by icons referenced from Pewdiepie\u2019s videos. Depending on each difficulty, opponents can inflict more damage and spawn numerously while levels add environmental dangers to keep you on your toes. Although there was trouble with this, it was appreciated that each level of difficulty was  appropriately tedious. \n\n\nIt\u2019s the Personality and Attacks- When you start the game, players are given the option to select between Pewds and Marzia as their controllable protagonist. As you progress further into the game other YouTubers become available for purchase for a set fee. Upon unlocking them, you can then upgrade their health with in-game currency as well as acquire desirable attacks and defences, however, each character has a designated attack that is tailored to their individualistic attributes. It makes it intriguing but doesn\u2019t necessarily give the player the advantage as each character is limited to one attack and defence move at a time.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nStorytelling-  As stated earlier, this game honestly does not merit a serious reaction. The voice acting is respectively performed by the actual YouTubers themselves and unfortunately sounds more awkward than they probably initially planned. Each sentence was often read with such a dull, monotone rhythm and lacked any excitement, making the storytelling lackluster and forgettable. Then again, the story is overly simplistic since all you\u2019re doing is rescuing the viewers from evil Barrels.\n\nControls-  For most platformers, gameplay mechanics aren\u2019t usually in-depth and complicated. Playing each level should be smooth and with quick ease, however, the controls for this game, even though simple, feel deliberate and awkward at times.  In-game, you have the typical jump with an added bonus of an attack and defence ability. Although the title has these added attributes, controlling the character feels sluggish at times. It also doesn\u2019t help that there is only one default speed implemented in the game. It would have been better to have a sprint like in Mario games.\n\nOver Referenced- The game has a substantial amount of references that will be lost on those who aren't familiar with Pewdiepie\u2019s content. A lot of the images and story plot is ridiculously random just to fit in with the references.\n\nConclusion: Pewdiepie: The Legend of the Brofist is definitely a game for fans because they\u2019ll appreciate the many odd jokes referred in the game. The game had an interesting concept of adding attack and defence abilities but overall gameplay felt slow and sluggish. \n\nScore: Wait for a sale\n", "timestamp_created": 1455023284, "timestamp_updated": 1455023284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491472", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21066714": {"recommendationid": "21066714", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996598947", "num_games_owned": 433, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457404310}, "language": "english", "review": "Well this is a game I really didn't expect to be any good considering who it's based on and considering there there are no realy quality fangames for this particular LPer.\nBut I was pleasently surprised.\n\nThe game itself is pretty short, just under three hours if you play every level on easy mode.  However for those three hours you get a lot of content.  Multiple characters (of which I mainly used one when I unlocked him),  Different attack and defense abilities which I only used a couple because all the rest just didn't seem that useful.  And of course extra stages that unlock costumes.\n\nThe graphics are nice and mesh well together with the exception of the potrait shots during dialog sections,  they kinda look like crap.  The voice acting in most parts needs a bit of work and feels stilted but for some characters gets better as the game progresses, with the exception of Marzia's who I found annoying, but then again I didn't use her at all because outside of being the player two character for local-coop just didn't bring anything to the table except be annoying whenever she came up.\n\nThis game clearly had a lot of care put into it and there is a whole bunch small details such as the way certain items interact with the environment, character costumes are reflected in the cutscenes and loading screens with one costume for pewdiepie tying a certain scene together making it all the more hilarious as it goes on.\n\nBut I will admit I actually didn't play as the pewsdter as soon I was able to unlock and play as the lper I like more,  I totally skipped Marzia without even bothering to buy her.  The others I touched upon on my stream of the game just to show them off.\nAll said this was a neat little game and you get a whole lot for a mere six dollars.  and believe me I've played far worse games that had this price tag.

There's not much to fault it for other than being short and the over-the-top fan pandering which, as indifferent, I found to generally be off-putting or not make sense (a rock named Jennifer?), but at the same time I commend it for aiming to please and be memorable to its fans rather than something generic. Needless to say if you despise the guy then you'll despise this game.\n\nPros:\n-It has a nice high-res pixel art aesthetic, looking something like an HD GBA game.\n-The music is pretty great. It sounds like it's going for an NES style and comes off as authentic to me.\n-Fully voiced, though you may consider that a con as they're not voice actors by trade.\n-Collectibles and unlockables to give you stuff to do while/after beating the game. The collectibles are put into tricky-to-reach or hidden areas throughout the levels.\n-There are a number of small touches that make it feel like a polished game with care put into it. Picking up hearts when your health is full turns them into coins so they're not a waste. Changing your costume changes the character portrait in cutscenes. Replaying a level with an unlocked character changes things if that character normally appears in the level. There's a level where you get picked up in a helicopter to escape and [spoiler]if you try to enter it from the top or rear, jumping through its blades, you get chopped to bits as Mark screams \"Noooooo\". It caught me totally off guard and I couldn't even be mad because it was hilarious.[/spoiler]\n\nCons:\n-It's short. There are 27 levels total and if you just do a single playthrough and don't worry about collectibles/unlockables or the 7 optional levels then you'll only get a couple hours out of it.\n-Too easy on any difficulty less than \"Bro\", probably due in part to its mobile origins. Your upgraded HP tops out at 16 hearts and enemies do 1 heart of damage on \"Easy\" and 2 hearts of damage on \"Hard\", but the checkpoints in the levels fully replenish you. \"Bro\" doubles the damage to 4 hearts and removes the checkpoints, providing a good challenge, though I feel there could be a happy medium between \"Hard\" and \"Bro\" for those looking for a slight challenge.\n-When you replay a level the intro/outro cutscenes play again, forcing you to skip through dialogue. About half of the levels have some sort of intro/outro.\n-Of all four YouTuber cameos in the game only one of them is really worked into the plot. The others are forced in and only relevant for a single level.", "timestamp_created": 1453397444, "timestamp_updated": 1453397501, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540282", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20661299": {"recommendationid": "20661299", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198066433", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519566869}, "language": "turkish", "review": "telefon kald\u0131rm\u0131yordu pc versiyonu g\u00fczel olmu\u015f\n", "timestamp_created": 1453389038, "timestamp_updated": 1453389038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "4.995006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20656089": {"recommendationid": "20656089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042725953", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478433254}, "language": "english", "review": "Duck, pug, t-rex, ufo, illuminati.

Ni tanto enrealidad .-.\n\nCosas buenas: Suficientes niveles como para hacerte pasar un buen rato y recordando personajes del ya mensionado PewDiePie, El dise\u00f1o del ambiente es muy bueno, a\u00fan pienso que el co-op no deberia ser local, pero a\u00fan as\u00ed es divertido jugar con tu mejor o amigo y ver como fallan una y otra vez\n\nLo malo: Si no eres fan de PewDiePie, no le encontrar\u00e1s mucho sentido al juego y solo lo ver\u00e1s como un juego con dialogos locos (Al leer las rese\u00f1as de la gente me d\u00ed cuenta de eso), el juego no es tan dificil como pensaba incluso en BRO mode es f\u00e1cil, los super poderes un poco desbalanceados pero eso supongo que lo arreglarar\u00e1n, peleas contra jefes algo repetitivas no presentan mayor reto, en lo personal lo que m\u00e1s me dolio (Hablo enserio), es la poca variedad de personajes...

Therefor, this review is going to be mainly focused on why the negative reviews are wrong in my eyes.\n\nThere's people saying that the music was bad, the graphics were bad, etc.... Those reasons all utterly ridiculous. There's nothing wrong with the graphics or soundtrack.\n\nReally, there's only a few real reasons I could think of for hating the game:\n\n1. It's style of humor; It contains various memes and humor that you would probably expect on PewDiePie's channel in the first place. As I said, many people hate PewDiePie's channel AND the style of humor on it, and those people probably wouldn't like the game's humor as they are very similar. Either way, that's a small part of the game and shouldn't detract from the enjoyment you can get out of it.\n\n2. The story; It's extremely bland and boring. The evil barrels have captured all of PewDiePie's fans--yes, every single 40 million of them--and it's up to Pewds and his other YouTube friends to save them!!!!11!!1 Even though the YouTube friends are probably also technically 'fans' of Pewds and should also have been captured by the barrels but NEVER MIND THAT! While I think the story is bad, it's again, a small part of the game that can be easily overlooked.\n\n3. The voice acting; While I have to admit that the voice acting done by the YouTubers isn't the most 'professional', you have to remember that these people are YouTubers, not professional voice actors. It might not be perfect, but it does the job well enough not to be distracting from the actual game or 'story'. A casual gamer isn't really going to care, but like I said, if you go in WANTING to hate it, then you'll probably end up hating it.\n\n4. The length; For the type of game that it is, it is pretty short. You'll probably end up completing it in a couple hours at best.\n\nAll right, so my ending point is this:\n\nI hate to say it but it's not really special, it's just a pixel graphics platformer game with PewDiePie's name on it, and a couple PewDiePie references here and there.\n\nAlso, considering how short it is, I don't think the $7.99 that they make you pay for this game is really fair. I agree with the $4.99 that the iOS version costed much more, and I still really can't understand why they upped the price.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't deserve all the criticism it's getting. It's not supposed to be a particularly special game. It's just simple, good for a couple hours of entertainment. The gameplay is good, with level ideas constantly changing and keeping the game fresh and interesting.\n\nIf you're a fan of PewDiePie, you'll very likely enjoy this game. If you hate PewDiePie, you'll probably end up hating this game.

It's just meaningless hate towards PewDiePie which I don't even understand. I personally wouldn't call myself a PewDiePie fan, but I do watch his stuff ocassionally (his non-gaming stuff mostly) and heard about this and since [b]I freaking love retro platformers[/b] I decided to get this. I'm gonna be honest and judge the actual game. Kinda funny though how many complain about PDP's fanbase for immaturity and then buy the game just to give a negative feedback and refund. Because that totally makes you even more immature.\n\nFirst of all, if you think glorifies PDP's \"overreacting\" and screaming, you'll be disappointed because the game has none of that, in fact, it's far more tame than AVGN' Adventures which I loved but felt like it went over the top with swearing to the point of not being funny at all.\n\nThe game itself is a pretty standard NES-inspired new-retro platformer where you get to jump your way across levels, stomp on enemies, collect coins and use powerups. While it's nowhere near Shovel Knight's level, it's still really good, especially considering it was originally on mobile. Many levels have some twists to them instead of just being going from point A to point B. The graphics are a nice mix of 8 and 16-bit, look pretty nice and the levels are quite varied graphically. The music is amazing. It might be my favorite thing in this game. Kudos to the artist. The only real issue with the game is it's length. It's quite short, but at least it has some replay value and patches to collect for all your completionist needs. It's also pretty dang challenging on the highest and (especially) extra difficulty.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+ Nice presentation\n+ Level Variety\n+ Challenging\n+ Other YouTubers are playable\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Short\n- Some minor questionable level design bits\n\n[b]Classic Score[/b]\nGraphics: 8/10\nAudio: 10/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nContent: 6/10\nFun Factor: 8/10\n[b]OVERALL SCORE:[/b] 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1452381807, "timestamp_updated": 1452381965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.431644", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20429907": {"recommendationid": "20429907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198223565128", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482438887}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a cool idea for representing some of the most notorious events on the Pewdiepie channel, but the only people who ever gonna buy this are serious bros (like me) who are willing to support felix. All the reviews that I have seen are awful and saying the game shouldn't be bought. I kind of agree with them as it is an arcade game which costs quite a lot for what it is. Once you've completed the game, (which took me about 3 hours doing all the levels and redoing some to get coins) you are not gonna come back as there is not much else to it. I feel this game is a almost a troll and a way to joke about pewdiepie's habits in a video game.  However, I'm not gonna be too harsh about this as it is a decent game while it lasts. The controls feel really stocky though, so I went out and bought a logitech wireless controller but it still felt like the character movement was not fluid. (That was forty quid wasted). The gameplay in general was okay, though. But the game to me is just a joke and isn't worth playing unless you want to support Felix as a bro. Even I find it tiresome, so I would not recommend this even though it's a cheap price it still is too expensive for what it is. When you've gone through the entire game through its frustration, blood and tears, and smashing the controller on your face, thats the end. Better go out and buy a new one. If you want my opinion, don't buy this, go buy gmod or something else.

I had alot of fun playing this game. Just achieved all the Achievements just a few minutes ago. Pug Mode was insanely hard, i would recommend the developers to change it a little because it's just insanely hard but i got it eventually. There is one big issue the Developers should look into is the \"Soft lock\" at level \"Deep in the Mines\" When the eye shoots the Rock \"Jennifer\" the rock can be stuck and won't move. In order to fix this you have to 'Alt+F4' out of the game in able to play again. Hope they will look into this. This happends quite often and i have no idea what it triggers.

I mean, maybe there's some lovely tapestry of narrative in it, but if I have to go watch a youtube dude to figure it out, you haven't told a good story.

This game is a pretty open love letter to the 16-bit era slathered in a layer of surreality, and it actually plays damn well. Most levels basically spelled out their intent or were based on something I recalled from my younger days, and while I think one or two stages' gimmicks make their lack of checkpointing* irritating, only the rather-lengthy final boss really held me up for more than 15 minutes. It's also got a bunch of difficulty settings in case you find it too simple/challenging, and after you beat the endboss you can play anything you've beaten on Hard on a one-hit kill, no powerup mode, should you be masochistic enough.\n\nI really wish cutscenes were skippable, but aside from that, this was actually real fun to fiddle with for a few nights.\n\n* The game does feature checkpoints.

But I can't, I refunded the game and everything. I like Pewdiepie as a person (content is a different thing), so I wanted to give this game a good review, especially since a lot of people were just saying negative things on the forums because they just hate pewdiepie and because this game exists. Honestly, the toxic behavior wanted me to like the game more and hate pewdiepie less instead of hating the game and pewdiepie more. Although, I came into the game wanting it to be up to standards, it failed. The game is good if you're just a big pewdiepie fan, which is nothing wrong, people support their favorite content creator all the time. But if you're not a pewdiepie fan, or if you're a big 2D platformer fan, then the game will seem decent at best. The game felt boring as I played it, I felt if it had more \"pewdiepie\" humor, if the plot was mentioned more, or if the platformer game didn't seem so basic. If felt like a generic platformer with your favorite Youtubers in it for the most part. I can see that the Youtubers and the indie dev team actually tried their best, but I felt like it wasn't good enough to be a great plaformer game or even a pewdiegame. I mean it would've been slightly funny if he said something everytime he got hit by an enemy. Examples would've been \"Damn Barells\"  or \"Damn no-scope\". Something that would've shown signs of frustration on his journey to collect the legendary bro-fist. Which is only mentioned occasionally, the rest of the game is just bland level design for a platformer, with the exception of randomness on the screen. \n\nBut yeah, I feel I've been rambling a lot for a while, so how about I just end with a conclusion. You'll might enjoy this game if you're a big pewdiepie fan if you get all the references and have been wanting to play this game for a while. You'll be disappointed if you're a big platformer fan because this game is not very innovative or creative from a level design standpoint. Especially for a $7.99 video game. If you just despise Pewdiepie, stay away from this game, you're not gonna enjoy nor will you be doing a greater good by pissing off a bunch of 12 year pewdiepie fans because you think his work is \"poisioning the minds of the youth\" or because they got butthurt over someone that hates pewdiepie.

Aber selbst wenn man kein gro\u00dfer Fan von Pewdiepie ist (so wie ich) ist es sehr empfehlenswert. \nDie Retro-grafik weckt in mir Nostalgie. Die Steuerung ist mit Tastatur vielleicht nicht die geilste, aber immer noch deutlich besser als auf dem Handy und mit dem Controller perfekt. Die Schwierigkeitsgrade sind steigend immer herausfordernder und ver\u00e4ndern so viel an den einzelnen Leveln (Anzahl der Gegner, St\u00e4rke der Gegner, Anzahl von einzusammelden Gegenst\u00e4nden, verschwinden von Objekten,...). Die Level selbst sind vom Stil her auch sehr abwechslungsreich. Das Spiel steckt voller Eastereggs, also wird man vielleicht nicht alles erkennen, aber selbst ich hab einiges erkannt und musste in den meisten Momenten sehr stark lachen. Ich hatte es schon auf dem Handy und bereue nicht es nochmal gekauft und durchgespielt zu haben. Man kann es immer wieder spielen und es hat diesen typischen, endlosen \"ein Versuch noch\" Effekt. \nIch gebe ja eigentlich keine Punktzahlen ab, aber w\u00fcrde ich h\u00e4tte dieses Spiel in der Gesamtwertung 8/10.

For people who only use the keyboard, the controls are HORRIBLE. Controls are definitely the worst part of the game. Arrow keys and WASD are understandable, but ENTER to do stuff?! Yeah, no. You could have used Z for something like that. And having the up arrow bound to jump is just stupid, when you have a giant spacebar right in front of you. Changing the controls would help to have me recommend this game more, but the way the dogs die in slow motion by exploding into little pieces almost makes me sick. Everything else about it is... passable. The voice acting is kinda half-assed, but I can see effort going into it. Most of the graphics also look really good, except for a lot of the characters' busts when they talk. Overall, I'd give the game a 4.5/10.

"A simple fun platformer with a charming pixel art style. \nWhile I would say this game may be lost to those who aren't familiar with Pewdiepie (and Lore), but definitely a fun experience for those whom are.\n\nFeels a little short for the casual player, but has some replayable value for completionists (added characters/costumes, patches, achievements, ect) However the added Halloween and Christmas levels are a nice added touch.\n\nWhat really makes this game special is the humourous writing,voice acting and the inclusion of other 'Youtubers' such as Markiplier, CinnamonToastKen, JackSepticEye and Cryaotic.\nWhat's also nice is pacing of the game and the subtle nods to other 'pixel' games such as Megaman and Zelda.\n\nAll in all, it's very much at heart, a game for the fans of

weil ich dieses Spiel unbedingt spielen wollte. Nach denn ersten Levels hatte ich Spa\u00df und fand es sogar gut. Pewdiepie hat in einigen seiner Videos ja auch etwas von dem Spiel gezeigt. Ich dachte mir, dass die erste Schwierigkeitsstufe doch recht einfach ist und ich deswegen mal Medium austeste in bereits gespielten Leveln und muss sagen, dass ist echt krass schwer, wenn nicht sogar schon zu schwer. Es kommen so viele Barrels, dass du nicht mal mehr vern\u00fcftig gehen oder springen kannst bzw. wenn du eine t\u00f6ten willst, Schaden von anderen kriegst. Ebenfalls bist du nach dem Sammel (Kleidungshaufen) nicht mal 1-2 Sekunden immun, was ziemlich nervig sein kann, wenn dich in dem Moment der Cutscene eine Barrel angreift. Der Spawn selbst ist manchmal echt perfekt von deinen Gegner, wenn du ihnen auf den Kopf springst kriegst du sogar Schaden, weil du ihnen anscheinend doch nicht auf den Kopf gesprungen bist. Das Subway-Level hat mir letztsendlich den kompletten Nerv geraubt. Ich dachte mir, wie soll man sowas schaffen, wenn soviele Gegner auf einmal auf dich zu kommen. Das ist f\u00fcr Jump' Run Anf\u00e4nger einfach nur recht erschwerlich zu schaffen. Nach mehrmaligen probieren dieses Level habe ich den tiefsten Wunsch gehegt meinen Kontroller gegen die Wand zu schmei\u00dfen und rumzuschreinen, konnte dies aber innehalten da es lediglich nur ein Spiel ist. Ebenso mussten mein Freund & ich feststellen dass es kein Online-Koop gibt. Das finde ich, fehlt. Lokal-Koop ist m\u00f6glich, fein und gut, aber was ist mit Online? Ich bin ein gro\u00dfer Fan von Pewdiepie und bereue es nicht, dass Spiel gekauft zu haben, jedoch gibt es einige Dinge die verbesserungsw\u00fcrdig sind.\n\nIm groben und Ganzen ist ansich das Spiel zu empfehlen und leicht auf der ersten Schwiergkeitsstufe. Jedoch regt es Leute, die in Jump' Runs nicht ge\u00fcbt sind (oder generell Menschen, die sich leicht aufregen) auf und dann spielt man es erstmal eine Zeit lang nicht. Ich vermisse au\u00dferdem einen Online-Multiplayer. Ebenso ist noch zu sagen, dass Menschen, die Pewdiepie nicht intensiv gucken bzw. nicht kennen einige dieser Witze nicht verstehen werden und es somit f\u00fcr einige \"unlustig\" sein kann. Sonst ist das Spiel gut gestaltet, das Voiceacting ist ebenfalls gut und es ist ein gutes kleines Spiel f\u00fcr zwischendurch.", "timestamp_created": 1450644159, "timestamp_updated": 1450644303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19808257": {"recommendationid": "19808257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082572727", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450867285}, "language": "english", "review": "Where to start...

I will cherish the very first time i opened the game and the tears it brought me the first time i finished it.

Die Aufgabe ist es sich durch viele verschiedene Level zu spielen indem man wie bei alten klassikern (\"Super Mario\", Donkey Kong\" ... durch level springt, kleine Aufgaben erledigt und Gegner sowie Bosse besiegt.\n\nDas Spiel bietet dabei nicht nur das kleine 1 x 1 der Jump'n'run sondern auch ein paar Schwierigkeitsgrade, viele Freischaltbare CHaraktere, Angriffe, Verteidigungsf\u00e4higkeiten,Sammelobjekte und verschiedene Art wie ein level zu gespielt werden muss.\nSo l\u00e4uft man in einem Level nur zu Fu\u00df von einer Seite zur anderen und besiegt ein paar gegner und im n\u00e4chsten fliegt man mit einem kleinen Propellerflugzeug durch den Himmel und spielt Kampfpilot. Viele weitere kleine Dinge wie Gegenwind, R\u00fcckenwind, Autobahnspringeinlagen, Survival und \u00e4hnliches erwartn einen.\n\nPros: \n- Sehr gute Steuerung\n- Viel Abwechslung\n- viele verschiedene Gegner\n- teilweise sehr Lustige Anspielungen auf ander Spiele oder das genre selbst\n- S\u00fc\u00dfe und gute Pixelgrafik\n- Steam Achievements\n- Cloud Speicherung\n- Ein Wiederspielwert ist zum teil gegeben da in h\u00f6heren Schwierigkeitsgraden bei einigen Leveln nicht nur mehr Gegner sondern teils auch l\u00e4ngere Aufgaben auf einen zukommen.\n-....\n\nCon:\n- Leider nach ca 2h auf leicht bereits Durchgespielt\n- Videos liesen sich beim  2. spielen eines Levels nicht \u00fcberspringen und mussten immer wieder angeschaut werden.\n- Die Achievementsynchronisierung ist teils sehr verz\u00f6gert, so bekam ich manche erst nach 5 Minuten, andere erst nach beenden des SPieles und wieder andere sofort\n\n\nFazit:\nEin finde ich sehr guter Jump'n'Run Titel bei dem man sich aber vorher im klaren sein soll das er sich selbst, wie man beim Titel schon merken sollte, nicht direkt ernst nimmt. Voll gespickt mit witzen oder auch manchmal einfach doofen Aussagen und Texten . Der Preis von 7,99 ist recht hoch gestochen aber im Sale kann man als Fan dieses gnres gerne zugreifen und ein paar Stunden Spa\u00df haben.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=578825742\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=578825741", "timestamp_created": 1450526724, "timestamp_updated": 1450526928, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19779554": {"recommendationid": "19779554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135074576", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 144, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450875885}, "language": "german", "review": "KAUFEMPFEHLUNG\n\nDas Spiel macht ordentlich Spass, ist aber auch eine Herausforderung, da die Level teilweise ziemlich schwer sind.

Personally I would prefer something more than just collecting patches, like getting unlockable customisations for characters.\n\n\nThe creators have decided to take a selection of classic & iconic game features & merged them into this cute side scrolling adventure game.  It's nostalgic, it's a good time waster & for the money it's a great wee game to have in your library.\n\nIn saying that, there's still a lot more potential for the game to grow.  Although my review may seem harsh considering the team worked hard to create what they have & the game was released not too long ago.\nI'm hoping now that they can expand on the game adding extra features - like maybe a time trial, allowing players to earn extra items by competing against thousands of other bros worldwide for the best time.

Fortunately, as you progress through the levels, you unlock new abilities which add some variety. The characters usually only have 1 difference, (gameplay wise) and that's their abilities. Collecting all of the patches was an easy challenge except for a few, so the game is quite easy. (except on pug mode)\n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\nThe game's graphics are quite appealing and use pixel graphics, simple enough for the game to run well, and the art's good enough for you to distinguish between the characters. It's very colourful and only a few levels had boring designs. (such as the caves) \n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nThe game is quite enjoyable and runs well, with appealing graphics as well. However, the game is quite short with repetitive levels and only harder difficulty modes and co-op options for thosewho want to continue playing the game.

The voice acting is quite bad, despite that most of the people in the game have done skits or similar things before.\nThe game gets a [b]7/10[/b] but with price tag of \u00a35.60 and the story being as short as it is it is hard to recommend.\n\nBuy it when it's on a sale for about 50% less or more, and it's worth getting, just don't buy it if you don't like the guy because then it'll be the biggest cringe-fest on the internet.", "timestamp_created": 1450290881, "timestamp_updated": 1453306504, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 137, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724235", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19733424": {"recommendationid": "19733424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198260611057", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461390625}, "language": "english", "review": "So Good game!", "timestamp_created": 1450288936, "timestamp_updated": 1450288936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.407925", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19732248": {"recommendationid": "19732248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014687589", "num_games_owned": 476, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 500, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516802186}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e Q_Q", "timestamp_created": 1450284461, "timestamp_updated": 1450284461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477557", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19728812": {"recommendationid": "19728812", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149654546", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 200, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450866888}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4eba\u8a2d\u548c\u904a\u6232\u6027\u3001\u5fa9\u53e4\u76848bit\u914d\u6a02\uff0c\u7c21\u55ae\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u52dd\u904e\u73fe\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5f37\u8abf\u756b\u9762\u7684\u904a\u6232\n\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9", "timestamp_created": 1450270607, "timestamp_updated": 1450270607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19728426": {"recommendationid": "19728426", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010611180", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450338427}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good if you are a fan of Pewds and the other featured Youtubers.

He got confused until a barrel broke into his house and said about containing all his fans and going to contain him. Well you got the point. Pewdiepie is on an adventure to save his fans, and it wouldn't be an adventure without helper characters would it?

En plus de cela, chaque niveau est bourr\u00e9 de petits \"patchs\", des sortes de tableaux, \u00e0 trouver et qu'on pourra par la suite admirer dans la collection. \nChaque personnage poss\u00e8de une aptitude propre a lui m\u00eame, comme Ken qui peu se transformer en ours ou Pewdiepie avoir un brofist surpuissant. tout ces aptitudes sont achetables a l'aides des pi\u00e8ces r\u00e9colt\u00e9es dans le jeu, et on peu am\u00e9liorer la vie des differents youtubers. \nLa pr\u00e9sence du multijoueur (seulement en local) est aussi tr\u00e8s amusante, surtout une fois le \"pug mode\" d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9, o\u00f9 on ne poss\u00e8de plus qu'un coeur de vie.\n\nEn bref, un bon jeu de plateforme, tr\u00e8s fun, \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de vie rentabilis\u00e9e si vous y jouez avec un ami ou si vous tentez de finir les niveaux dans des difficult\u00e9s sup\u00e9rieures.", "timestamp_created": 1450193982, "timestamp_updated": 1450194114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19711763": {"recommendationid": "19711763", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115872248", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519403208}, "language": "english", "review": "nice game, ty pewds (y)", "timestamp_created": 1450188040, "timestamp_updated": 1450188040, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.415200", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19711668": {"recommendationid": "19711668", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203182616", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463814701}, "language": "english", "review": "good game i say one thing i witch you could put in the game is online for worldwide but i rate this game 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1450187603, "timestamp_updated": 1450187603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19711612": {"recommendationid": "19711612", "author": {"steamid": "76561198191575974", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490332754}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is heavily referenced so you might not get some things in this game\nex: Why the enemies are barrels\n\nI played 8 hours and i completed it and unlocked everything but only on easy mode\n[spoiler] I even unlocked the duck\t[/spoiler]\n\nReally fun game to play on local co-op\neasy to get cards...\nI already got an emoticon from this game for playing only 8 hours\n", "timestamp_created": 1450187341, "timestamp_updated": 1450187341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19709848": {"recommendationid": "19709848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213164755", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481211348}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Massa bicho,jogo viciante do chico", "timestamp_created": 1450178358, "timestamp_updated": 1450178358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19709341": {"recommendationid": "19709341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122531584", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450175655}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Man, this game is awsome!

Now, first thing, if you don't like PewDiePie, why are you even here? A lot of the dislike for the game seems to come from one of 3 things, 2 of which are reasonable. \n\n1. Bad experience with bugs and glitches. I have yet to encounter any myself, but a player should always be wary of such. \n\n2. Dislike of the quality. Completely understandable. The voice acting is not that great, and the platforming is rather simple. Don't expect Super Mario or Shovel Knight from this gam (not that the others were, or anything). This seems to be a rather simple game specially crafted for fans of Felix and his friends. \n\n3. This is the unreasonable one. Some people seem to have purchased this game with the intention of giving it a negative review because they don't like the man whose name is plastered on the title screen. They feel the need to insult their peers for enjoying PewDIePie's content, as it's not suited to them. If you're one of those people, there is NO NEED to temporarily spend your money, but instead just do it in a comment section or something for virtually free.\n\nThrough my small amount of gameplay so far, I'd say that only if you're a fan of Felix and co. then go right on ahead and buy. If not, maybe take a small dip and see if you'll enjoy it for the simple game that it is. Hey, maybe you'll find a new source of entertainment from the content creators included. Or the duck. You can always like ducks.  And if you hate him for whatever reason, I beg that you spend your time and money doing something more worthwhile, like charity or children. Please?\n\nPersonally, as an on and off fan, I'd recommend buying this during a sale. Thanks for taking the time to read this!

Being a pewdiepie fan myself since the beginning I understood a lot of the references, and I chuckled. I do agree that the voice acting isn't that great, and it is dissapointing. But, regardless, the gameplay is fun and reminds me of the old school SNES gameplay mixed with the new school. In terms of difficulty, it takes a bit to master the timing, but anyone who's played in my time of NES/SNES will remember the frustration of timed jumps, and being unable to get to the correct platform with stairs. TO be honest, it takes me back, and gives me a sense of nostalgia. I'd recommend picking it up and trying it for yourself. If you don't enjoy it, simply refund it back. I know I have only a few minutes of gameplay so far, but this is just my first impression.\n\nMy personal opinion:\n\nVoice Acting 2/10 - Not great, could use a lot of improvement\nGameplay 8/10 - Nostalgia factor for the 90's kids\nCustomization 5/10 - Pretty cool unlocks for picking up \"bro\" coins\nControl 5/10 - At times feels slippery, but again, reminds me of the NES/SNES era\n\nA worthy

The game is a standard platformer with a silly story following Pewdiepie and his other youtube friends. If you follow pewdiepie on youtube you'll get a kick out of it.

It's just like every other platformer out there, but they add more mechanics like standing on top of moving cars and flying planes. \nOverall: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1449934004, "timestamp_updated": 1449934004, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402298", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19653536": {"recommendationid": "19653536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117178544", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450018402}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e 10\\10 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u043a\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0439\u043c\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c, \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0448\u044c \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043f\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438 ,", "timestamp_created": 1449932999, "timestamp_updated": 1449932999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.419199", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19653535": {"recommendationid": "19653535", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154253443", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 391, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487678022}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 35 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e PewDiePie \u044f \u0445\u043e\u0447\u0443 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c!\u041e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0445\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430,\u0430\u044d\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u043c\u044f\u0433\u043a\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043e!\u042f \u0435\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043b\u0435\u0437 \u0438\u0437 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 170 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u044f \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443)!\u0421\u0430\u043c \u043d\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u043b \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0443.\u041f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c,\u043d\u043e \u0431\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u043e \u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0442\u044f\u0433\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0430!\u0412\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u043c \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0443\u044e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0442\u0435)))", "timestamp_created": 1449932997, "timestamp_updated": 1449932997, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19653004": {"recommendationid": "19653004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080237881", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473497450}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430. \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \"\u044f\u0431\u043b\u043e\u043a\u0435\" \"\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\" \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b, \u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0431\u0430\u0446 \u0438 \u0432 Steam \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0431\u044b \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u043f\u0438\u0442\u044c?

Most negative reviews are blind hate reviews and some say the game doesn't have much content. I can understand why people say that. Its because they completed all levels on one difficulty. I played all the levels on all types of difficulty and not completed them yet, it makes the game more challenging and almost extends the gameplay of the game.\n\nMy personal opinion:\nIts a classic 2D pixel game combined with some of my favourite youtubers, the co-op works great and the story is not bad if you know most of the the pewdiepie refrences in the game.\n\nI don't reccomend the game if you don't like pewdiepie or any of the other youtubers in the game.\nThe haters only got the game so that they can get thier ego boost by getting attention from thier review. So don't buy if you don't like any of the content. I also don't recommend it if you don't understand the refrences because you will probably get lost in the story and get very confused. Honestly it's just for people who watches these youtubers.\n\nAlso just one more thing to say:\nI recommend buying it on a sale at atleast 50% off because it is a bit overpriced for the content the game offers to you.", "timestamp_created": 1449924473, "timestamp_updated": 1506792512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.315344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19649683": {"recommendationid": "19649683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178593666", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450021669}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] HELP\t[/b]\nWhen i start the game it is normal for 10 seconds and then the screen is stuck!

Que ce soit au pole nord ou dans l'espace, tout est li\u00e9 a l'univers qu'a cr\u00e9e Pewds tout au long de son aventure sur Youtube.\n\nLe Gameplay : \nPutain que ca fait du bien d'avoir un pad / clavier en main contrairement au maniement sur Mobile que je trouvais juste catastrophique. Le personnage de pewds r\u00e9pond bien, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame trop bien ce qui retire la difficult\u00e9 que j'ai pu ressentir dans le maniement sur mobile. Il vous faudra r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer un maximum de pi\u00e8ces tout au long de l'aventure pour \"upgrader\" PewDiePie et ses amis que vous pourrez d\u00e9bloquer et jouer tout au long du jeu tout en d\u00e9bloquant de super pouvoir toujours li\u00e9 au c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Youtuber moyennant des petites pi\u00e8ces. Les d\u00e9cors se renouvellent bien, certains niveaux change le gameplay comme par exemple un magnifique passage en avion. Quand aux ennemis, cela se corse au fils de niveaux pour ne pas laisser le joueur dans trop de simpliciter. \n\nDur\u00e9e de vie : \nAu tarif propos\u00e9 ne vous attendez pas a une longue dur\u00e9e de vie (entre 2h et 3h grand maximum). Ce qui est toujours plus long que les DLC de Batman Arkham Knight !\n\nBande son : \nTr\u00e8s retro, on ressent le cot\u00e9 nostalgique d'une \u00e9poque r\u00e9volue depuis des ann\u00e9es et qui a berc\u00e9 l'enfance de nombreux d'entre nous. Elle colle bien au style du jeu. \n\nConclusion : \nAssez simple dans les faits, PewDiePie Legend Of The Brofist est un jeu qui fera surtout et avant tout plaisir aux fans du num\u00e9ro 1 de Youtube. Que se soit l'humour, les personnages, l'univers haut en couleur ou le sc\u00e9nario, tout lui est li\u00e9. Est-ce un mauvais jeu? Non clairement non.

Also, he has two dogs that I sacrifice for my own gain on a regular basis. \n\nPewDiePie: The legend of the kidney stones is a 2d side scrolling adventure that will take you around 3 hours to finish. The gameplay is as simple as moving forwards and then jumping with two buttons for powerups that aren't very good. At first, I thought the game was kind of fun, but the longer the game went on and the further I got, Felix's slidey and floaty jumping really got on my nerves. It feels unresponsive and clunky once there are more than three things to dodge on screen. \n\nNow, I will admit, I enjoyed myself [spoiler]for a total of twenty minutes.[/spoiler] before all of it got on my bad side. This game made me itchy if that made any sense. \n\nI did not finish PewDiePie: The legend of the wasted lunch money, and I have no intention of ever finishing it. I got to the last boss and that was it for me, I had no intention of finding out what happens at the end. I'd ask who this game is for but there are roughly 40 million people subscribed to the Youtube account so I guess that question is already answered for me. \n\nShould you play: PewDiepIe: The legend of the fuckthisgame? \n\nI honestly don't even know how to make this review entertaining, I'm pretty much just rambling and hoping all of this makes sense, I don't know it could be the huffed paint talking. \n\nDon't play this game unless Felix is your surrogate best friend, I got it as a gift from a friend and he is currently clawing at the inside of a coffin desperately gasping for air at the bottom of a lake. \n\nPewdiepie doesn't get a score, no, I'm not doing it, you can't make me. I'm sure this scathing review will hurt Felix plenty, he can cry himself to sleep on his bed made of money. \n\nYou get nothing out of nothing. \n\nI'm going to go stare at a wall and think about Robocop for a few hours. \n\nThe place where I talk about games I actually like: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation \n", "timestamp_created": 1449824037, "timestamp_updated": 1449824037, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2145, "votes_funny": 958, "weighted_vote_score": "0.739902", "comment_count": "106", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19626639": {"recommendationid": "19626639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198190880471", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 252, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468867003}, "language": "dutch", "review": "I LOVE IT", "timestamp_created": 1449819406, "timestamp_updated": 1449819406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19626602": {"recommendationid": "19626602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154380803", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455155878}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Buena m\u00fasica, buen dise\u00f1o de niveles y personajes, muchas cosas para desbloquear y bastante rejugable.

Que ce soit les graphismes, les musiques, le gameplay ou m\u00eame les nombreuses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 l'univers du youtuber su\u00e9dois tout est tr\u00e8s travaill\u00e9 et soign\u00e9 dans les moindres d\u00e9tails.\n\n\nComme pour le jeu AVGN il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'\u00eatre avant tout un fan ne serait-ce que pour comprendre certaines blagues ou les nombreuses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences mais au final qu'on soit fan ou non de Pewds le jeu est juste g\u00e9nial, tout est bon, le fun est imm\u00e9diat et la diversit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente dans les diff\u00e9rents niveaux mais aussi dans le bestiaire offre une aventure tr\u00e8s plaisante \u00e0 suivre mais \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s plaisante \u00e0 recommencer.

Yes the game was first released for mobile devices but did it really hurt the desktop version? After a playthrough I can hinestly say: Not at all. This doesn't feel like a port at all.\n\nGraphics: Just look at the pictures. Either u like 8 Bit graphics or u don't. \n\nstory: makes barely any sense but nobody who every watched anything of pewdiepie would ever expect anything else. gladly the dialoge is very short and doesnt matter at all to enjoy the game. If you dont like pewds just mute the game.\n\nGameplay: The probably biggest point of platformers. This game plays out perfectly. The controls are on spot and could hardly be any better. If you fail it for sure ain't the games fault.\n\nDifficulty: No, this is not an easier AVGN clone, this game itself is tough as nails. While easy is actually really easy, later levels are already quite difficult on \"hard\" difficulty. And beyond hard are still 2 difficultys of whom 1 needs to be unlocked first. \"bro\" difficulty really aint easy and might prove a challenge even to die hard platformer players. \"pug\" difficulty is supposed to be insane of what I heard yet.\n\nReplay value: multiple difficultys, lots of unlockables, multiple chars. nothing more to say.\n\ncritic: there are actually only 2 things I didnt like about the game. First is that you actually have to play markiplyer in almost every level at least once because some of the patches are ronly reachable by his double jump. \nsecond: the game could have more useful unlockables. While the patches are certainly better than nothing they dont add too much to the game while the abilitys lack variety and get old quite fast. They work technically but I wish there were more of them to unlock. I wish the game had more skins as well.\n\nOverall: If you like pewdiepie or not is totally up to you but this game is a very good platformer despite its origins. 9/10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1449800003, "timestamp_updated": 1449800003, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19623135": {"recommendationid": "19623135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153846947", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 44, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458774672}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would brofist again.", "timestamp_created": 1449799771, "timestamp_updated": 1449799771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.344486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19622580": {"recommendationid": "19622580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079374461", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469940908}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome platformer that can test your skill, depending on level you go on.

He seems like a nice guy, but his videos simply don't entertain me, so I'll be reviewing this strictly on how good it is as a game.\n\nThe game obviously has a lot of inside jokes that fans of PewDiePie will get more out of than I did. The weakest part of the game was the dialogue. Not to say that it's awful or anything, but it was nothing special, and not too funny.\nHowever, the animations, sprites and gameplay were funny, so it was fine. \n\nThe game is more fun with a friend in co-op, although doesn't make much of a difference. Most of the levels comprise of the basic platformer rules. Jump onto enemies to kill them, although there are some levels that shake things up a bit like a side scrolling plane shooter.\n\nThe gameplay stays fresh by allowing you to purchase new characters and powerups with the money you've earned throughout levels.\n\nOverall, the gameplay doesn't feel incredibly unique or anything. It's simple and mostly sticks to what has worked in most platformers, but it does it all well! It's a pretty fun game.\n\n(Review copy was provided by the devs, but it does not affect my opinion on the game)\nPlease rate the review up if it was useful.", "timestamp_created": 1449744743, "timestamp_updated": 1449766240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1178, "votes_funny": 72, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664218", "comment_count": "47", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19598129": {"recommendationid": "19598129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168045262", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 57, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451497075}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS AMAZING.

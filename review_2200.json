radicalisation pour Id Software. D'une part il fait le choix de ne plus supporter le rendu sofware et exige donc une carte 3D pour tourner et d'autre part se limite exclusivement \u00e0 du multijoueurs d'o\u00f9 le nom Arena. Si le premier aspect est largement compr\u00e9hensible suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratisation des cartes 3D \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de sa sortie, le choix du tout multijoueurs est plus os\u00e9. Un mode solo existe quand m\u00eame mais il s'agit d'une succession de matchs en free-for-all contre des bots. C'est donc extr\u00eamement simpliste mais cela permet d\u00e9j\u00e0 de go\u00fbter aux d\u00e9lices du gameplay.\nSorti fin 1999 et en concurrence frontale avec Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 est probablement rest\u00e9 dans les m\u00e9moires comme le plus grand des deux FPS comp\u00e9titifs. John Carmack y peaufine une fois de plus la technique et surtout le gameplay. Pr\u00e9cision et rapidit\u00e9 sont les ma\u00eetres-mots ici et le rythme du jeu est si \u00e9lev\u00e9 que Quake 3 ne donne plus la possibilit\u00e9 de jouer aux \"r\u00e9flexes\" mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l'\"instinct\". La vitesse, les d\u00e9placements, les effets des armes, tout est minutieusement travaill\u00e9 pour donner au final des sensations parfaites. Difficile de lutter face \u00e0 la satisfaction que procure le titre que ce soit lorsqu'on met la main sur un Quad Damage ou que l'on aligne un adversaire d'un tir impeccable de railgun.

It\u2019s a steal when on sale for 75% off but the collection is normally only $25 and totally worth the asking price in my opinion. I didn\u2019t want to review all 3 games and their expansion pack material separately, so I figured I\u2019d simply do a review for QUAKE III and do a brief breakdown for all titles.\n\nQUAKE: It\u2019s dark and creepy atmosphere takes a page from Lovecraftian lore and though its dated appearance and overly dark lighting (for some reason you can\u2019t seem to adjust the brightness at all, or at least I couldn\u2019t) may turn some off from playing this game, it still has a lot to offer whether you\u2019re a fan simply looking for a little bit of nostalgia from a beloved shooter series or a gamer merely looking to partake of some classic gaming and you\u2019ve heard the word \u2018QUAKE\u2019 thrown around for a number of years and figured it was about time you got around to checking it out. This game singlehandedly gave birth to speedrunning and rocket jumping in FPS games. Even if you don\u2019t want to give it a spin, or its 2 mission expansion packs (both just as good as the core game and they still maintain the Lovecraftian element but with some Egyptian elements as well), at least check out all of the crazy \u2018QUAKE done quick\u2019/\u2019QUAKE done quickest\u2019 videos and I think you\u2019ll agree that you can at least appreciate what QUAKE did for the FPS genre, if not the game itself.\n\nQUAKE II: A change in both tone and style (no more Lovecraft, total sci-fi setting now), this game will likely be much more enjoyable to play than its predecessor for most people. It is graphically much more impressive and the particle effects are real!! Seriously, they look great and the lighting in the environments is much better than the doom/gloom of QUAKE. Even without the inclusion of Lovecraftian lore/enemies, there are still some disturbing biomechanical abominations to go along with the sci-fi setting, so that\u2019s a good thing. Also, just like with QUAKE, there was sadly no music, at least for me, but the sound effects are good and it\u2019s still fun to play. Oh yeah, you can now look around with your mouse. Sure, that\u2019s nothing new per se but when coming from QUAKE and going directly into QUAKE II that\u2019s going to feel new and revolutionary all over again. Both expansion packs are just as good as the core game and combined, they at least rival its length if not surpass it.\n\nQUAKE III: Totally awesome! It\u2019s basically just Unreal Tournament Quake style w/ a crazy mix of characters/boss characters (essentially just regular characters but tougher) running around at a super high framerate, each trying to out-kill the next guy. This game makes me wish I would have been into the whole multiplayer deathmatch thing back when it first came out, but it also makes me glad that we now have QUAKE: Champions and there is still supposedly a reboot coming our way that would pull mostly from QUAKE and its Lovecraftian themes. I haven\u2019t tried QUAKE III: Team Arena yet but I figure it\u2019s mostly the same thing albeit with team deathmatch added into the mix.", "timestamp_created": 1504915458, "timestamp_updated": 1504915458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34767102": {"recommendationid": "34767102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099262890", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 18402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505283659}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Quake and it's an arena shooter.

Virtually nothing is known of these beings except that they savor the carnage and clamor of battle. As such, they have stocked the arena with the greatest warriors of all time - and you have just joined their ranks. \n\nAt least, that's what the wiki told me. \n\nQuake III arena was the first game in the series to focus heavily on multiplayer. While the games that preceded it had fluff to their stories, Quake III just kind of tells you to get in an arena and shoot at everything that isn't you. \n\nInstead of having stages where you go toe to toe with goofy looking goons, you instead just play a multiplayer map against bots, each set of maps has harder and harder bots until you reach the final map where you go one on one against Xaero. \n\nIt's not really fun, I mean, it is, but technically so is huffing gas. All of the fundamentals are there, but in the end you just have brain damage.\n\nOkay, enough about that, lets fellate ourselves about the multiplayer. \n\nQuake III is one of those games that stands the test of time, even to this day you can find people filling out servers. The game modes cover everything you need, Deathmatch where you shoot everyone, team deathmatch where you shoot everyone not wearing the same color as you, tournament that nobody plays, and capture the flag where you shoot at everyone not wearing the same colors as you but also have to steal their colors and bring them back to your side.\n\nI think I just described a gang war. \n\nThe maps take the show, while not all of them are perfect (There's a CTF map that's just two platforms separated by jump pads) most of them are well designed and thought out. The name of the game is knowing the layout of the map, where the pick ups are, and where most of the fighting will be. \n\nThis leads to a meta game that's all about map control. You need to know where the right weapons and items will spawn and get there before everyone else. And luckily you have plenty of movement options to do so. Bunny hopping, and rocket jumping being the obvious forms of transportation in this case. \n\nEvery weapon, while not unique in use, is at the very least unique in design. The machine gun looks more like a drill than a gun, the rocket launcher is basically a redesign of the first two, and the plasma gun is a Tupperware box with a hose sticking out of it. I love them. \n\nYou have a plethora of characters to choose from in Quake III, although they're all just for cosmetic. But it makes the game feel like a very violent version of Smash Bros. You have original characters such as Sarge, Major, Klesk, Visor, and Orbb. But you also get to choose from heroes from Id Games past like Doom Guy, Ranger, and Bitterman. \n\nAnd if none of those are to your fancy, you can always just find fan made models still lurking in the deepest darkest parts of the internet. Incase you ever wanted to play as Cloud with a rocket launcher. Fun story, the first time I ever saw a 40k Space Marine was in Quake III, I had no idea what it was from I thought it was a Quake 3 original character.\n\nYou should probably be warned though, if you're going in for the first time. Many people are playing Quake III, have been playing it for a long, long time. They basically know every single thing about the game inside and out. That being said, you can still find newcomers to the franchise playing to this day, although in smaller numbers.\n\nAnd these guys are vicious. They move like speed demons if speed demons figured out what actual speed is. Their accuracy is friggin pin point, and they'll have that weapon before you even know what it is. One guy even managed to stop me from grabbing a rocket launcher by using the back blast of his weapon to knock me away from it. That's crazy. \n\nOh yeah, I should probably cover the other ways you can play Quake III. Like I always do with these games. \n\nOutside of the obvious way to play, which is the PC version, you can also play this game on the PS2 with Quake Revolution as well as the port of Quake III on the Dreamcast. The Dreamcast port actually had online play and mouse/keyboard support. Apparently you can still find people playing the DC port to this day, but good luck with that because I don't know how. \n\nAlso, there is a Xbox Live Arcade port of Quake III, but there's no reason to even talk about it. It's about as pointless as my Doctorate in Medicine. \n\nI'm not going to pretend my rating system actually matters for this review, Quake III's legacy speaks for itself. It's still being played to this day and finding a game is no problem. \n\nArena's Engine, Id tech 3, also saw some action in a handful of other venerated shooters like Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, Star Trek: Voyager- Elite Force, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy, and even the original Call of Duty. I've even been told that the newer Call of Duty games just use a heavily modified version of the Quake III engine, though I don't know how true that is. \n\nYou should play Quake III, but you probably already did. But in case you didn't, consider this another recommendation. \n\nQuake III test negative on it's STD test. Which means it fails, but in a good way.\n\nQuake Revolution was published by EA.

One of the many 90's games that DEFINED the first person shooter, before the genre went down the first person \"Sh*tter\". The game has graphics which were ahead of the time, at the time, gets the job done, doesn't care about stupid skilltrees, loadouts, classes, or any other level of bullsh*t, and goes in favour of pure, unfiltered, fast-paced shooting that's still fun today. And for those of you who are worried that the game would no longer have anyone playing online because of how old it is, hoo boy, are you ever wrong. Usually the multiplayer server count clocks around 400 servers. Jeez. This game is great, and I highly reccomend getting it if you're sick of today's generic shooters, in which you run slow as balls, have a tiny clip, horrible accuracy, and a VERY small margin of error.\nQuake 3 FTW!\n\n-Story: Who gives a f*ck!? 4/5\n-Gameplay: WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 4/5\n-Music: Pretty grungy, but quiet enough to let you hear your opponents clearly. Shame none of the songs I hear in OST videos don't show up. Good to see this game carries THAT tradition from Quake 1 and 2... 4/5\n-Graphics: Hey, Crysis might look sexy, but at least this one has a steady framerate. Most of the time. 4/5\n-Mechanics: Simple, but it GETS. SH*T. DONE. 4/5\n\nOverall: 80%. *KILLTACULAR.*\nKilltacular indeed.", "timestamp_created": 1503876285, "timestamp_updated": 1503876285, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34519024": {"recommendationid": "34519024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988261312", "num_games_owned": 269, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503936550}, "language": "english", "review": "this is good", "timestamp_created": 1503800706, "timestamp_updated": 1503800706, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34518584": {"recommendationid": "34518584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198308342212", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512148815}, "language": "spanish", "review": "un classico increible. muchos servidores activos.\n\ndificultad bastante alta, y progresiva.\n\nse puede poner en 1080p si modificas ciertos archivos de texto.\n\nsi ya tenes el quake live. este esta bueno para seguir jugando con un motor grafico diferente. pero sino mejor anda por el QUAKE LIVE primero", "timestamp_created": 1503798802, "timestamp_updated": 1503798802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34505791": {"recommendationid": "34505791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271156111", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 11, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515532583}, "language": "russian", "review": "+", "timestamp_created": 1503756675, "timestamp_updated": 1503756675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34505745": {"recommendationid": "34505745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277543638", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 631, "last_played": 1516535078}, "language": "russian", "review": "Quake III, \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u043f\u044f\u0442\u044c \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430, \u043d\u043e \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044f\u0442)\n\u041b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0443\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0435\u0439\u0441\u044f CS:GO, Quake \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0443\u0440\u0430, \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e \u043e\u0442\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c 400 \u0440\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0439.

It isn't that it had the tried and true basic weapons from the first generation of first person shooters.  It isn't that it was the first real organic looking game, thanks to the curving in the level design (Quake 2 had better maps, even if they weren't as pretty).  It is because the game came out and competed with Unreal Tournament 1999.  You play either game, and you get tired of the Q3, very fast.  It's wonderfully paced, very fast...but that is it.  The weapons are old hat, the maps in vanilla are brown to red to black, and the single player botplay is very tiring...\nBuy this if you want to be punished, and punished you will be online.

It was widely utilized as an e-sports game, and is still used in smaller tournaments. Despite showing age graphically, its gameplay still holds up quite well.  Despite being over 15 years old, there are still plenty of servers and fans still playing to this day. To make this easy for me, I'm going to do a quick pros-cons list.\n\nPros:\n-servers still relatively active, not too hard to find other players\n-dozens of different player models to choose from\n-player models don't need to be unlocked\n-high skill ceiling, very competitive\n-simple gameplay with surprising death\n-almost a time capsule of old-school FPS design\n-classic Arena-style game mechanics/gameplay\n-controls crisp and responsive\n-huge amount of maps, nearly all of which are pretty darn good\n-cool announcer voice\n-badass, well-animated intro cinematic\n-exciting, fast-paced multiplayer action\n-solid singleplayer AI (as in they don't spaz out)\n\nCons:\n-dated visuals\n-occasionally very frustrating\n-can seem inaccessable\n-quite unlike most contemporary multiplayer FPS, not for COD fans (basically the opposite of COD)\n-no true single-player campaign \n-no plot, only really a premise\n-can't run modern resolutions/widescreen without tampering\n-framerate cap at 90 (for those who actually care)\n-spawns sometimes 'questionable'\n\nQuick rundown on basic gameplay:\n-only gamemode in the base game is FFA Deathmatch\n-everyone starts equal, with the same two weapons (melee and machinegun)\n-other, better weapons spawn around the map\n-no regenerating health, need items to replenish health and armor\n-items spawn around the map on a timer\n-items include weapon ammunition, power ups, and health and armor\n-the only objective is to kill (frag) other players\n-very frantic and fast-paced; to stand still is suicide (gotta go fast)\n\nThere are probably a few things I've missed pros and cons-wise, but they share most of my opinions on the game.

Started playing on LAN with my oldest brother when I was 3 years old. Now, I'm 19 with the Quake 3 symbol on my chest and will always love this game and remember how epic it is. I still play it as well as Quake Live when I can. I invested hours into this game growing up and wish I would have been more consistent playing it and practicing so I would have been better by now but I had fun and still do when I play it. I remember watching Fatal1ty and Own-age when I was growing up and thinking they were gods at the game (they were) and I was ecstatic to have the chance to play against Fatal1ty at Quakecon in 2012. My love for this game got me into FPS games and the experience that Quakecon brings and I couldn't be more thankful. I've been to 3 Quakecons so far and make it a point to play tons of Quake when I'm there. It just feels right.

La mayor\u00eda de servidores y partidas abiertas son bots contra bots, en otras hay alg\u00fan humano suelto... juegan tanto con los nombres de los bots que es muy dif\u00edcil saber si es bot o humano (solo al acabar cuando tienes que darle al bot\u00f3n \"ready\" para volver a comenzar se sabe seguro qui\u00e9n es humano). Seguro que hay alguna forma de saberlo, pero no lo he descubierto. Ojal\u00e1 se cerraran todas y quedaran solo las partidas con alg\u00fan humano dentro.\n\nNota: Por supuesto en el modo offline puedes crear tus propias partidas contra bots.\n\n-2- Muchas partidas no permiten tu entrada (la descarga tarda horas y nunca se completa). Es absurdo que no est\u00e9 explicado que pasa o donde ir para poder jugar. En otras la descarga funciona y el resto no descarga nada y va directamente (mapas originales).\n\n\nEs genial que exista una comunidad creando mapas y formas de jugar, pero ahora mismo con partidas sin humanos y mapas que nunca cargan es muy molesto.\n\n\nA pesar de estos problemas lo recomiendo. No hay juego de disparos tan intenso como este, donde no puedes ni parpadear.

Either way, that was because so far I never had the experience of playing anything online. Back in the day I had this friend who eventually convinced me to give it a try. After I started, it didn't take long for me to get hooked on it. Time passed by and someday Quake II was released. Then again, when I tried for the first time I felt kinda disappointed with the game and can't deny that I still feel somehow like that after all those years (I guess it's because I missed that \"medieval environment\" touch from the first one). Anyway, when I first heard of Quake III, I didn't quite know what I should expect. I just read about the premise that the game was developed to be focused on the multiplayer experience. The irony was that although this title had exactly that concept in mind, that was the only one that I never had the chance to play with other people. Hmm what is there to say? For me it felt like a polished version of Quake II's multiplayer and later it wasn't hard to compare it with Unreal Tournament (which I won't deny that I liked better). Besides that, back then there were some really interesting mods involving the game's engine, like for example \"Bid for Power\", which had some DBZ characters and levels to play on. Overall, it's not a bad game, you can even play it casually if you're not in the mood to go through a whole set of matches.", "timestamp_created": 1474755452, "timestamp_updated": 1474755452, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25676695": {"recommendationid": "25676695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104292909", "num_games_owned": 196, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 4346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512421233}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting good game, for which you can kill a lot of hours.

Honest to God: I love this game.\nI honestly think the era of arena shooters was too short for its own good. Although I have high hopes for the new Unreal Tournament, it might not bring the arena shooter back to the mainstream stage as many have hoped. I hope it does, but I understand it has a lot to live up to.\nThis game has spectactular gunplay that is expected of the Quake series, that fast paced, adrenaline rushing gameplay that made arena shooters fun.The map DM17, otherwise known as The Longest Yard has become one of the most iconic FPS maps, ranking alongside Unreal Tournament's Facing Worlds. There's just no words to describe that feeling of launching off of a boost pad and sniping your enemy in midair with the Railgun. \nThe music fits the game extremely nicely, as do the environments. The computer opponents give you some pretty amusing dialouge during the single player campaign. \nSo what are you waiting for?\nGet out there and make your enemies Quake in fear!\nDoom got a remake, Unreal Tournament is in the works, so all we need are Half Life 3 and Quake 5 and the 90's can be here once again!\nA good old dose of pure 90's fun.", "timestamp_created": 1471145756, "timestamp_updated": 1471145756, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24897639": {"recommendationid": "24897639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198275911567", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471125122}, "language": "russian", "review": "GOOD OLD DAYS - GOOD OLD MEMORIES, ALWAYS GOOD TO GO BACK AND ENJOY THESE TYPE OF GAMES AGAIN...", "timestamp_created": 1471128211, "timestamp_updated": 1471128211, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24773634": {"recommendationid": "24773634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087691978", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 121, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498410990}, "language": "spanish", "review": "What do I have to say, its Quake 3.", "timestamp_created": 1470645839, "timestamp_updated": 1470645839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24771383": {"recommendationid": "24771383", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970314107", "num_games_owned": 1166, "num_reviews": 421, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470632563}, "language": "english", "review": "If you weren't around for the release of Quake III, you might be shocked at the furor its announcement kicked up. In the wake of heavily story-driven FPSes like Half-life, Unreal, and even Quake II, the successor of one of the biggest franchises moving to multiplayer-only was seismic. Despite the doom-saying and gnashing of teeth among series fans, Quake III proved to be an instant classic for online FPSes and helped establish the multiplayer-only genre as legitimate. But how does an online-focused classic fare nearly 20 years after the fact?\n\nI want to make fun of Quake III's story, but it's honestly about as much of one as Quake I has. Some bunch of space assholes called the Vadrigar have been grabbing badasses from across the universe to mash together in their own little lethal playhouse. This means you can play as the venerable Doom Guy, grunting wonder Ranger from Quake I, luckiest space marine ever Bitterman from Quake II, and a bunch of cooler dudes like a neon skeleton and an eyeball on legs. There's upwards of 30 characters to choose from, but honestly after Party Skeleton they seem kinda superfluous.\n\nThey're put to good use though in the game's campaign mode. See, there actually IS a single-player mode in Quake III, but it pits you against bots across seven tiers of simulated deathmatches. Starting you out one-on-one against slow-moving opponents in small arenas, the game soon expands to fragfests with half a dozen foes across industrial complexes and eldritch hallways floating in the void. As predictable as they can become, the bots provide a solid challenge at each of their five difficulties so it's actually not a bad place for newcomers to learn the art or veterans to practice their technique.\n\nThe weapons are simple enough to come to grips with as well. I don't know why the Quake series is so content to have incredibly generic arsenals, but it makes it easy to keep track of here. You start with a standard low-damage machine gun and can locate shotguns, rocket launchers, railguns, and plasma guns around the map, each with its own color-coded ammunition. There are health and armor pickups as well, along with a few stand-by powerups like quad damage. This pickup system, common in the Quake era, makes matches more about map control than anything else and can be a welcome change from modern loadouts and class systems.\n\nThis isn't going to matter a whole lot if you can't find actual humans to play with, of course. All the games of the Quake series still have fanatics playing them but they are just that, fanatics, which means they are limited in number and absurd in skill. It's not reasonable to expect newbie-friendly servers or anything other than pros to spar with so be prepared for that if you are diving into the scene solo. On the other hand, there are few things more sublime than some classic deathmatch with your closest buddies so if you have others you can take the plunge with this is an easy sell.\n\nBarring any graphical weirdness (which for me was remedied with disabling the Steam overlay) Quake III remains a very clean and polished experience, from the sharp if simple graphics to the tinny, growling announcer. Your weapons feel thick and threatening, the gibs gush freely, and the low electric growl of quad damage taking hold never gets old. Without a story-based singleplayer to work through this one does threaten to wear out its welcome. However, a little courage and effort diving into the online community that persists will reveal a world of wonders you might have thought died long ago.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

After my first experience playing Quake II, which you can check that review for the experience, I had no idea what to expect from Quake III except greatness. It could have been a new single player, an enhanced multiplayer, really anything. But the word Arena was the next word I saw on the disk. I was a pretty smart kid, so I knew it was going to have a badass multiplayer. Little did I know that it was going to be ALL multiplayer.\n\nSo I booted up the game after installing it and started watching the intro. It showed some guy shooting down things and running out of ammo. The guy runs away and then decides to rush in. Immediately, I was a little unimpressed. After the Quake II intro, I was expecting awesomeness! Now it was just showing a cliche FPS sequence. Then, after diving towards the enemies, something unexpected happens. Time freezes as the guy is being teleported to some unknown place. This is where id Software did NOT disappoint! After being teleported, it then shows some gameplay of what I was going to be playing with random letters zooming out. I watched the gameplay and knew it had to be awesome. Then, the legendary words filled the CRT monitor.\n\n[b]QUAKE III ARENA[/b]\n\nI was hyped. I could not wait. So I went to the options to peek around and noticed there was a better Player Setup screen than Quake II. You could actually see who you were choosing before you picked them. MUCH better than having to scroll through the different models in Quake II to pick your character. And yes. Before you ask, the same customization of Quake II with being able to play as many different characters is avaliable here too. After picking this weird alien thing named Flisk, I immediately went into the game.\n\nThe graphics looked really nice. I was gazing upon the room I was in and noticed all the little details in the room. My eyes were like a kid in a candy store. The textures popped out like flowers in a field. The graphical detail was legend, and everything just seemed amazing. Then I noticed the mirror in the room. I gazed at my reflection and loved the little details on my character.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was the sudden announcer coming through my speakers. \"WELCOME TO QUAKE III ARENA!!\" I had never heard such a thing in a video game before. It was really mindblowing at the time. I then decided to test fire the guns I had collected. The machinegun sounded like a more powerful version of the one from Quake II, and the Shotgun sounded like it was the most devastating thing in the game. I decided to go outside the room and see what was going on around the map.\n\nI immediately ran into Crash, the first enemy opponent in the game. She's like Doomguy except she's a girl. I shot her down with my shotgun and noticed that she talked to me in text like she was a friend in real life. Wow! Talk about advanced! I never had a character talk to me in text like that. It was something really special at the time and it's something games just don't do anymore. It's kinda sad, but I can see why.\n\nAlright so the gameplay. Well, it's a shooter that is a heavily polished version of Quake II's multiplayer. Even the single player is just a bunch of fights with bots. Nothing really special, but it's good practice. The weapon balancing is something id wanted to do in this game and it really works well. Each weapon has its own use, just like the single player in Quake and Quake II. The Rocket Launcher is good for if your enemy is mid range, while guns like the Lightning Gun and Machinegun are great for long range attacks. The Shotgun is definitely used best at shorter ranges because of the more realistic spread this time around.\n\nThe gunplay isn't the only thing you'll want to learn in Quake III. Movement is definitely a really important skill to learn, especially if you plan on playing online. Since the original Quake engine had some bugs that made advanced moving techniques that are real useful in multiplayer possible, they decided to embrace those bugs and make them part of the physics of the game. Things like Bunnyhopping, circle jumping, and the infamous Rocket Jump are just a few examples of techniques that made Quake III very famous.\n\nOverall, I gotta say that Quake III Arena is to FPS games as Super Smash Bros. Melee is to fighting games. The really complex formulas and techniques that were present in the original Quake are improved and embraced in every way imaginable and the multiplayer community is still really strong. There was even a Dreamcast port of Quake III designed with Keyboard & Mouse controls in mind due to these special techniques that also has cross-platform capabilities with the PC version! Definitely get this game and enter the Arena!", "timestamp_created": 1450730898, "timestamp_updated": 1450731248, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.637225",

As a young pre-teen, I played my sports outside, did my homework and when I could, I'd jump on the PC to play this. If you have played Unreal tournament, it may ring a few familiar bells while playing this. If you can tolerate old graphics, you'll able to enjoy the gameplay.\n\nWhat is Quake 3 : Arena? It is a first person shooter (FPS) multi-player focused game with fast pace featuring players duking it out for in front of a race called the Vadrigar. All the player movements are normal (four directional + strafing) with the addition of jumping. Mouse button 3 will allow the player to zoom and C will let the player crouch. Throughout the map there are items available for pick-up in which the player can press enter to use them. The basic strategy back in the day was jumping up and down and strafing while shooting. Playing the game today after so many years seems players have really figured out this technique and it's almost near impossible for me to hit them. Most servers are decently friendly (for n00bs as well) but some servers have some very good players. Most FPS's will demand a lot of attention from the player but this FPS will keep you moving due to paranoia. Non-stop movement is recommended.\n\nThe AI within the game is actually a formidable opponent. Upon first playing the game, I had some serious trouble beating the first level. I got back on the horse eventually and was able to ride to the next tier. One player mode will have you square off against stronger and stronger opponents the more you progress. The weapons in the game are outlandish in design and style while having their strong and weak points. Some weapons will benefit the player from a long range while some will demand a shorter range. The BFG10K is a plasma based weapon that can fire rapidly. The gauntlet is a short ranged melee type weapon in which the announcer will announce \"humiliation\" if an opposing player is killed. The gauntlet does not require ammo. The lightning gun fires a beam of \"lightning\" and is useful for groups of opponents. The railgun fires a hot slug rounds at a high velocity. It would be better to use this gun from a distance. The plasma gun obviously fires burst of plasma but is slow regarding it's firing rate. There is also a rocket launcher (that is pretty self explanatory and is my favorite weapon as it can make players bounce or explode). The last two include a machine gun and a grenade launcher. All the guns are fun to use but players will find their own style which work for them.\n\nThere are items scattered throughout the level and respawn after a short amount of time. The first item includes a red armor icon which has the most defense out of all armors. The yellow armor is half as good as the red and armor shards (pieces) will increase your armor by increments of +5. Besides armor, there is health around the map available for pickup. The blue health orb will replenish your health to a maximum while an orange health orb will only do half of what the blue can do. The small gold and green health orbs are the smallest units of replenishment. Also included are power ups. Power ups include a blue icon which quadruples the damage you deal, a red regeneration icon in which when you receive damage your heath will regenerate, a yellow icon which doubles your speed you fire your weapons, a purple icon which allows you to jump at unbelievable heights, invisibility (which is self explanatory) and a battle suit that can protect you from literally anything from the environment (lava, water + splash damage from opponents). Additional items include a personal teleporter (which will transport you into a random spot when in trouble), a medkit which can be activated by the user, in-place teleporters which have a pre-determined destination, jump pads which will launch the player and acceleration pads that will launch the player in the direction they are facing. Don't face the wrong side or an edge when approaching such a pad!\n\nAs I've said, this game is big time multi-player focused even though it has some single player events. There are differing game-modes to keep the player engaged : Free for all (where everyone plays for themselves), team deathmatch where two teams compete for the highest \"frag\" (kill) score, tournament mode which is one versus one ending after a set time and lastly, capture the flag. Capture the flag is played on maps in which both opposing sides have the same map layout (to keep everything fair).\n\nThis is a good game for hardcore FPS fan's while the casual gamer may find the graphics and gameplay lacking due to the difficulty. I would consider this one of those games where you really have to take the time to perfect your skill to get the most joy out of it.

A pure deathmatch game at it's best. The controls are perfect, the vanilla graphics are still good today, and the gameplay... fucking awesome! One of my favorite features is the ability to play against bots with friends. Very fun if you just want to co-op in the game.\n\nI will say one thing. This game will test your skills and even help you improve your aim and reaction time as the combat is fast and fierce. After playing this game, I can say I am better at FPS games, especially ones with rocket launchers ;). This is one thing I cannot say you will get from most FPS games. This gives it another reason why this game kicks so much a$$! Not only are you having fun, but you are excersising your hand-to-eye coordination.\n\n[h1]Easy To Mod[/h1]\n\nThis game is also very easy to mod. All you need to do is open the .pk3 files in a program like WinZip or WinRar and you can replace the game's sound effects, graphics, and models with custom ones you either downloaded or made yourself.\n\nTalking about mods, I highly recommend downloading ioQuake3 ( http://ioquake3.org ). It replaces Quake 3's rendering engine to suit modern machines giving you better net code and the ability to match your computer's native resolution. You can also download other mods for ioQuake3 to improve the game. Some other mods I recommend is the high res texture pack ( http://ioquake3.org/extras/replacement_content ) and the Metal-Tech v2.0 mod that replaces the textures for the weapons with higher res ones ( http://www.moddb.com/mods/metal-tech-v20-revolutions ).\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nOn final note, this game is pure awesomeness and has a high replay value.

It actually throws off single-player portion fully and focuses on mutliplayer part, which was quite wise as of that time. Arena-styled Deathmatch was still hot and at the peak of interest, you see. It came out in 1999. It's notable that in same year Unreal pulled off same trick, coming out with Unreal Tournament.\nIt also had ports to Dreamcast and PS2. Dreamcast is awesome, supporting keyboard+mouse, 4-player split-screen, had online multiplayer and had new awesome music that PC doesn't have. PS2 version didn't had online part, but had improved single-player, with some story, from what I know. Didn't check out that one yet, but it has different final boss.\n\nAs you expect, it has usual technical problems nowdays.\nGame doesn't support widescreen by default. But you can look up Community Guide on Steam, one explains how to set it up easily.\nSteam Overlay is conflicting with this game as well. If you try to immeditly play at default setup, you will be horrified by all the graphical flickers and glitches. You have to go to game's system options and disable \"GL Extension\", after that it should be fine.\nThough, some computers will still experience crashes here and there. In this case you will have to disable whole Steam Community for this game. Bai bai overlay.\nI think that auto save from Team Arena expansion may erase Quake 3 Arena save. Goes both ways. So be careful with that one.\n\nAs for multiplayer community, it's somewhat alive. There are some servers with some players. Most often you will meet servers full of bots. Other times it will be pro players who will rip you apart.\n\nSo, what can I say. Q3 is a classic arena, where you spawn, you stock up, you encounter, you restock. Or respawn. While strafejumping and bunnyhopping like a chicken. Everybody starts the same, they spawn in random spot with no good weapons. After that you have to grab all the goodies on the map. Weapons, ammo, health, armor and powerups. Stocking and restocking is quite important, having more armor and health than opponent will put you into superior position. If you are good at shooting and maneuvering, that is. Health and armor over 100 slowly drop down, so you want to make use of it. You also want to be the first to grab the respawning powerup, which is announced by subtle sound. Pro players time it in mind. Remaining powerups drop from defeated players. \nAnd when it comes to duel, you should make sure that opponent will not get to timed powerups and big bonuses. It's called \"Arena Control\". It'a also wise to sometimes not to encounter the opponent.\n\nIt also has some physics exploits like bunnyhopping and harder to pull off strafejumping. Thankfully, bots don't use them.\n\nWeapons are designed to be balanced with each other and to be useful in each own situation. It's mostly a tried and classic combination weapon set, of rocket launchers, shotgungs, railguns and such, so people who wanted a gun that ricochets around walls and turns enemies into ice cream critized them heavily. They work really nicely though. Railgun requires at least two hits on a row for average opponent, which is always better than usual instakill of sniper rifles in other games. Shotgun is good even for medium distance and just gives off a nice hitscan punch. Rocket Launcher is universal, good for splash damage with huge direct hit damage. Good for rocketjumps too. Really, it's great to see that the game took more balanced weapon approach of Quake 2 and tried to combine it with faster pace of Quake 1.\n\nLevel design is great too, with nice astethic. It's either sci-fi base or more of gothic-hellish red style. Like Quake 1 style, but more careful and even more evil at times, it's great. Has enough verticality. Just nicely done, with all the curves and corners. It also has some interesting \"platforms in black space\" levels, though those are the worse bunch as far as balance goes. Too much open space, railfun users be happy. Gets even worse on the level which has many lift-platforms, making it all look quite messy. Otherwise, nice layouts with nice looks.\nSoundtrack is also nice too, being ambient-like at times and more actiony techno at others. Somewhat unique.\n\nIt has Free-For-All Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel and Capture the Flag modes. And bots are pretty bad at Capture the Flag for some reason. Expect to see them running with machine gun, failing to defend and failing to retrive the flag.\n\nNow, as far single-player, well, it's pretty much a bunch of bot matches with some progression. The in manual says that mysterious race Vadrigar teleported the greatest warrior of all time into arenas for their own amusement and they can't be fooled by Death, combatants just respawn. in the end you will beat current champion Xaero, who's spirits will leave the body and it will turn into statue. And errrr, I guess you will be still stuck in Arena. Yep, story is quite an excuse. You will not see any kind of story in game itself, just means that it has many different skins with no bio. Like Id All-Stars, including Doom, Grunt and Ranger. But hey, some skins are cool, check out huge eyeball on two hands.\n\nYou should play on Hardcore if you are a good player. Normal and lower ones handicap bots actually.\n\nAnd yea, it's just a bunch of Deathmatch matches with boss-like duel match for each Tier. In Deathmatch you will be hunting the weakest and spamming, in Duel you better be controlling spawn of bot's favourite weapon if you want to survive. Final boss really requires it, being Railgun auto-bot pro. This \"campaign\" will fly past quickly. Oh well, at least it has some feeling of progression, better than just leaving player with skirmish only.\nDid I tell you that bots actually have a bit of behavior personality and favourite weapons?\n\nAnd if you want to go online, then as said, it doesn't have as many players. More of bots. And it has really bad server browser that no one ever liked. Can't even categorize by amount of players.\n\nTo be honest, with Quake Live around, there is almost no reason to get Quake 3 for online, most of players went to Live. Quake 3 does have gibs, blood and it has Campaign of sorts, so maybe it's better for offliners who don't want to be beaten by pros.\nAnd yea, this is old game with classic DM rules. Most modern gamers will not dig it for long. No leveling or such, more duel-based than team-based. But at least it was nice at the time, even if didn't try to be as original as UT, instead giving players more of classic set.", "timestamp_created": 1439117205, "timestamp_updated": 1449060757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.796329", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17446259": {"recommendationid": "17446259", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990645962", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440813941}, "language": "english", "review": "Even if you're just playing against bots, this is some of the best deathmatch out there.

Where do i start on this game? Although it appears that I have low play time on this game I actually played a hell of a lot of this game before I was on steam. This game is nuts, but you know..... fun nuts. The maps in this game are fun with not too many camping spots (as if you would feel the need to anyway) and are mostly quite large. \n\nNow....... The guns. Ok, so first up is the Machine Gun which is only good if you are accurate and your enemy is very inaccurate so lets skip this one. Then there is the Shotgun. One hit kill at short range of course and good damage at medium range. The Rocket Launcher is deadly to both your enemy and yourself but can also tend to take a few hits to kills if not hit directly. The Plasma Gun is basically a super Machine Gun. It has a lot more damage and similar fire rate. the Grenade Launcher in my opinion is the hardest gun to use because you have to time as well as place the grenade well. the Railgun, my favourite weapon, is basically a sniper that you have to no scope with (except unlike no scoper's in COD it actually takes skill) and is either a one or two hit kill. The Lightning Gun shoots out a stream of lightning towards your enemy and does decent damage. It's kind of like a Super Soaker except instead of water coming out there's lightning. And finally there is the BFG10K. now this gun is a one hit kill and has a fast automatic fire rate so it kicks arse. \n\nNow in addition to these guns is the gauntlet, which is basically a glove with a spinning saw blade on it. Its usually a two or three hit kill but its always fun to kill someone with it. also there are several other items that can be placed on the maps such as +5, +25 and +50 health capsules, +5 armour shards, +50 and +100 armour vests, a mega health capsule, a quad damage power-up, as well as a regeneration power-up and a beast power-up. I won't take the time to explain these items (Most of which are pretty self explanatory anyway). The best piece of advice that I can give you is to aim well. You aim well and you win....\n\nAnyway I thoroughly reccomend this game to all and I hope this review helps.", "timestamp_created": 1426764846, "timestamp_updated": 1426764846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14701589": {"recommendationid": "14701589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051257632", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415547044}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing i used to play it when it was popular.

What is however, is the fact that you really need to learn how to do things in this game. Motion and control has several levels that can be learned, e.g., rocket jumping, circle jumping, strafe jumping, etc. and these are all important for your survival. There's of course all the weapons too. Knowing how to fire a railgun is an important skill.

Tight controls one expects from a PC fps are definetly put to use here, and if you wanted an example of PC over console, this is it. Story wise, this game is weeeaaak. It isnt told at all, and has unexplained cutscenes. You have to read the manual or look it up online to get what's going on, and I'm not going to tell you, as I feel it isnt to prominent in the game or this review. So that leaves the gameplay to decide how good of a game this is. the gameplay, is, amazing. As I said the controls are wonderful, and everything just works. Jumping to frag a guy and doing a 180 to frag another WHILE going dowhill onto another platform only to be propelled to a weapon of mass destruction is a great example of great gameplay, and fantastic level design. I would like to see how this game fairs on a console (Dreamcast version is all I know about unfortunately) but I cant imagine it being as good as the PC version. The soundtrack is a great metal and rock mix, full of the ambient sounds of screaming in some arenas gives off a darker mood, while the use of the metal can pump you up and ready you to blow up everyone in others. As far as characters go like I said the story is basically nill, but each has its own personality and little sayings in combat.

All the characters are very nicely voiced and the maps are, as expected from an id Software game, very very good.

From 1999 to the present, this game has been at the heart of Esports throughout.  After Challenge Pro Mode Arena (CPMA) was released the competitive community divided.  Since then, the game's popularity has seen a steady decline.  Currently, there is only a small crowd of hardcore fans that still enjoy this game.  \n\nAround 2007-2008 a new iteration of this game came along as a free-to-play web version named QuakeLive.  Download QLPrism (standalone browser made specifically to run QuakeLive) to fully enjoy.  As a pro-subscriber in Quakelive you can spawn servers to run all kinds of fun gameplay from simple duels to team based games and now Quakelive even includes Race mode (Quake3 DeFRaG Mod).  Quakelive is constantly updated with new content (gametypes, maps, custom options) making it the most comprehensive Quake ever.  \n\nQuake 3 is one of the most enduring games in all of FPS history.  The gameplay is dynamic, engaging and unique.  If you are a fan of fast-paced, deathmatch style gameplay, Quake3/Quakelive is the ONLY game for you.  Takes years to master, takes seconds to become addicted.\n\nCurrently, there is some debate over whom the G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) of QuakeLive is.  The greatest contenders for the title include the two finalists of Dreamhack Winter 2013, the Belarussian \"Cypher\" or the American \"Rapha.\"  Other names through the years include American \"Zero4\", the Swedish aim master \"Toxjq\", and the notorious Russian \"Cooller\".\n\nIn the end, I see the competition for this title always coming back to the two:  Cypher or Rapha!

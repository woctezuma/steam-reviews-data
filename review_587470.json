I enjoyed smashing particles together, whirling them around, attracting and then repelling them, particles are quite fun!\n\n[b]Lots of settings that make a difference[/b]\n\nAside from the few tools the game gives you, you can adjust settings which change the shape and nature of the particle, as well as change the physics of how they behave. You can add gravity, make their colour change based on speed or thermals or even collision. \n\nI saw some sound options in there as well, to make the particles react to different sounds, although I didn't get a chance to mess with that as my headphones weren't plugged in. \n\nEither way, I didn't really miss the sound as I was busy feasting on the delicious visuals. \n\nIf you own a Vive or an Oculus (not sure if this works on Oculus), this is a great title, and pretty fairly priced.\n\nThere are certainly worse ways to spend a few bucks, as well as an afternoon. \n\n[b]Pro Tip:[/b] Look at the world through the white pointers that float just beyond your Vive controllers.

the game, immediately got hooked for at least a week - pretty much spent all my free time on it until the physics got the better of me.\n\nPositive:\n\n1. Interesting and fun puzzles\n2. Beautiful design\n3. Hilarious jokes and entertaining tone of the game\n4. There are several puzzles that deserve a separate mention as they are not only fun to play, but also present a nice logical challenge (this applies to the puzzles marked with a skull and to pretty much all puzzles in the Ruins location). Those complex puzzles were the most unforgettable moments of the game.\n\nNegative:\n\n1. Physics frustration: some puzzles rely heavily on physics, and not in a good way: for example, you can spend 15 minutes trying over and over again to jump the correct way, in a puzzle that needs to be solves in 40 seconds. Another annoying part is the ice cubes and the puzzles where you constantly need to make sure they don't slide away because they are so extremely slippery. I think this takes away from the game, because one hand it irritates the player and on the other hand you don't really get that sense of achievement when you overcome this kind of difficulty (i.e. \"Yes! I finally managed to not let that ice cube slide away!\"does not exactly give you the same sense of pride as \"Yes! I finally solved this logical conundrum!\").\n\n2.

and generally sacrifice your previous characters (knights who have absurd titles and a growing array of hats and weapons) to get through the levels. \n\nComedy is apparent throughout the entire game, from the weaponry/apparel your knights equip to the victory screen where the massive VICTORY that appears is enclosed by a much smaller font, condemning how that victory was achieved. \n\nThe levels are innovative and novel, ranging from more basic can-find-it-in-every-puzzle-game layouts (which are mostly just near the beginning of the game while mechanics are still being introduced) to challenges that are wholly unique. Each level has a fuzzy monster (Jeff), and one of the challenges (the other two being time and killing as few knights as possible) is to feed one of your knights to Jeff. Sometimes, getting to Jeff can be harder than finishing the level (which is marked by getting to the cup found on each level). \n\nAfter finishing a level, you're able to see what the cup you achieved does (and it's all very inconsequential stuff, such as headache relief or something that harms rather than hurts, like a cup of strafe) The cups do nothing but to motivate the premise, which is the king of the knights is sending them to find the cup of life so that he may never die. They have to go through countless other cups first to find the cup of life. The [strike]plot[/strike] can easily be ignored while playing as it's really just there for context and atmosphere rather than having any impact on gameplay. \n\nThe graphics are surprisingly good, and each set of levels has a unique look to them (the first set is in some mines, and all the levels have a certain feel to them while another set takes place in the mountains.)

I've played quite a few.\n\nVery polished, good puzzle difficulty (that ramps well), good platforming, lots of levels, lots of interesting mechanics (added naturally as you progress). The visuals are good, the death sounds are great, the music is good but pretty generic and repetitive. Finally, the humor is great, very sarcastic, grim, ironic. They put a lot of attention into the jokes everywhere they could squeeze them, and they're pretty much all good.\n\nAs a bonus, it works well both for relaxing, easy play where you just throw lives at it, as well as more intense play, trying to perfect the number of lives and the amount of time spent on each level.\n\nMy only complaint, really, is that some of the later levels felt like they were a few levels mashed together and could have been split up. And they're still fun and interesting, just long. I guess it doesn't hurt to mention that I also encountered a couple very minor bugs (mostly to do with activating some of the achievements), but they didn't affect my ability to play through the levels.\n\nI would easily give it a 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1501648098, "timestamp_updated": 1501648098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33949785": {"recommendationid": "33949785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068294424", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 305, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504415025}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u76ee\u524d\u73a9\u4e864\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u53ea\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u3002\u6bcf\u5173\u6253\u901a\u4e4b\u540e\u90fd\u518d\u5237\u4e00\u4e24\u904d\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u5237\u5230\u6700\u597d\u3002\n\u6709\u4e00\u5173BOSS\u5173\u4e0d\u4f1a\u73a9\uff0c\u53ea\u597d\u5148\u8df3\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e86\u3002\n\u5f88\u503c\u5f97\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8010\u4eba\u5bfb\u5473\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1501596366, "timestamp_updated": 1501596366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33937509": {"recommendationid": "33937509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043277813", "num_games_owned": 434, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1341, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501540276}, "language": "german", "review": "Mein Fazit des Spiels gibt's unten, falls einem der ausf\u00fchrliche Text hier zu lang sein sollte, und man grob die St\u00e4rken und Schw\u00e4chen des Spiels aufgelistet haben m\u00f6chte.\n\n[h1]Handlung[/h1]\nDie Handlung von [i]Life Goes On: Done to Death[/i] ist, wie bei Puzzle-Platformern \u00fcblich, eher ein Mittel zum Zweck. Sie erz\u00e4hlt keine tiefe Geschichte, sondern gibt dem Spieler nur einen \"Grund\", all diese R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen.\nEin K\u00f6nig, der unsterblich sein will, sucht nach dem Kelch des Lebens. Das hei\u00dft, als K\u00f6nig macht er sich nat\u00fcrlich nicht selbst die H\u00e4nde schmutzig, sondern l\u00e4sst [strike]sein entbehrliches Schlachtvieh[/strike] seine treuen Ritter nach ihm suchen.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n[i]Life Goes On: Done to Death[/i] hat ein innovatives und interessantes Gameplay. Wie in einem Platformer steuert man seinen Ritter auf der Suche nach dem Kelch des Lebens. [strike]Falls[/strike] Wenn der Ritter dabei das Zeitliche segnet, bekommt man einfach einen neuen hinterhergeschickt. Der Clou: Die Kadaver der gefallenen Ritter bleiben erhalten und sind das einzige Werkzeug zum L\u00f6sen der R\u00e4tsel. Diese R\u00e4tsel sind sehr vielseitig, aber immer zu bew\u00e4ltigen. Richtig knackig wird's erst, wenn man versucht, nicht nur in jedem Level die Vorgabe zu erf\u00fcllen, sondern auch alle Platinmedaillen zu bekommen. Die gibt's, wenn man in einem Level deutlich weniger Ritter geopfert hat, als angedacht war, sowie wenn man den Kelch besonders schnell gefunden hat. Auf diese Weise bietet das Spiel sowohl etwas f\u00fcr Einsteiger als auch f\u00fcr Hartgesottene. Zus\u00e4tzlich gibt es in jedem Level ein pelziges Monster, was man f\u00fcttern kann, aber was meistens schwierig zu erreichen ist. So wird aus jedem Level das meiste herausgeholt.\n\nDie Steuerung funktioniert hier einwandfrei, was f\u00fcr diese Art von Spielen sehr wichtig ist. Die Befehle werden schnell umgesetzt und die Figuren steuern sich nicht tr\u00e4ge. Allerdings empfehle ich hier die Steuerung \u00fcber ein Gamepad, da die Steuerung \u00fcber die Tastatur meines Erachtens nach ein wenig \"kantig\" anf\u00fchlen k\u00f6nnte.\n\n[h1]Atmosph\u00e4re[/h1]\nOptisch zeigt sich das Spiel in einer knuddeligen und bunten 3D-Grafik, die eigentlich im krassen Kontrast zu den gewaltsamen Toden der Ritter steht. Aber sobald ein neuer Ritter das Feld mit einer albernen Kopfbedeckung und einem total absurden Gegenstand anstelle einer Waffe betreten hat, vergisst man schon den Namen des tapferen Ritters, dessen knuffigen Todesschrei man eben noch vernahm, als man ihn an einer Wand aufgespie\u00dft hat, damit der n\u00e4chste an ihm hochklettern kann.\nDie Namen sind auch ein humorvolles Detail. Auf einer Schriftrolle am unteren Bildrand steht immer der Name des Ritters, den man gerade spielt. Ist der Ritter verstorben, wird der Name einfach durchgestrichen und der des n\u00e4chsten Ritters darunter geschrieben. Dabei tragen sie sch\u00f6n mittelalterliche, teilweise schon total absurde Namen und Titel. (Ich sage nur \"[b]Der Inakzeptable Edelmann Alf Hauer der Vierte[/b]\").\n\nLeider blieb der akustische Teil der Atmosph\u00e4re ein wenig auf der Strecke. Es gibt f\u00fcr jeden der vier Hauptspielabschnitte ein Musikst\u00fcck, das dann auch in jedem Level des Abschnitts gespielt wird. Dabei wird man von der Musik eher berieselt, als dass sie einem auff\u00e4llt. Fast keins der St\u00fccke hat bei mir einen bleibenden Eindruck hinterlassen. Sie waren einfach da, aber ich k\u00f6nnte nach dem Spielen nicht sagen, welches Lied zu welchem Spielabschnitt geh\u00f6rt.\n\n[h1]Schw\u00e4chen[/h1]\nAu\u00dfer der eben erw\u00e4hnten Schw\u00e4che im akustischen Bereich sind mir keine nennenswerten Schw\u00e4chen aufgefallen.\n\n[h1][u]Fazit / TL;DR[/u][/h1]\n[i]Life Goes On: Done to Death[/i] ist ein innovativer Puzzle-Plattformer mit einem ziemlich schwarzem Humor, der mit der knuddeligen Optik des Spiels einen interessanten Kontrast bildet. Wer gerne R\u00e4tselspiele spielt und dem ein oder anderen skurrilen Element nicht abgeneigt ist, kann guten Gewissens einen Zehner investieren und daf\u00fcr f\u00fcr mehrere Stunden unterhalten

The majority of the story is told by subtle gestures and small details, while the levels are carefully designed to explain each new mechanic in an intuitive manner without ever having to resort to a narrator or tutorial telling you what to do.\n\nThe game keeps slowly adding more mechanics over the course of its levels, making the levels become slowly more complex as you progress, but because of the careful way in which the mechanics are introduced and taught, the puzzles are challenging but never feel unfair or frustrating.\n\nYou can often win levels by throwing knights at them until you find a crude solution, but each level also has (optional) goals of body counts and time limits to hit.  For more challenge, it can be fun trying to work out how to reach the exact minimum number of deaths you need to complete each level.\n\nI initially came across this game while browsing my discover queue during a Steam sale, and was immediately caught by the trailer video.  It perfectly expresses the style, character and design of the game.

that are just flat out frustrating. This game however beautifully gets the balance right of providing enough of a challenge for it to be very satisfying when you complete a level but not too difficult to ruin the fun. The core mechanic of throwing wave after wave of knights to their death to get to the end of level is excellent fun and even if you screw up you can still throw more knights at the problem and eventually solve it. The new puzzle elements are introduced in a way to easily show you how they work before they give you a more advanced challenge. There are also additional targets to beat on each level to give it replayability.

Not to mention I absolutely adore the core mechanic (I mean, who heard of a game where you HAVE to die?!?); truly unique stuff. The puzzles require some thought, and you have multiple metrics on which you are graded, significantly increasing the replayability. Additionally, the game maintains an light, humorus tone (which is particually important, because if you mishandle the aesthetics on a game about killing yourself then it takes a dark turn mighty fast).\n\nHonestly, I don't see much room for improvement. I rate at an 8.5 because I reserve anything higher than that for games which take my breath away/bring a tear to my eye/engage me for a long time, and by design this just isn't one of those games.

smile as much as it makes you think.\n\nA game that lives up to its wonderful trailer! (The music had me hooked)\n\nNot the biggest head-scratcher out there (though later puzzles can still take a good 10 minutes to suss)... but that's not the real joy of Life Goes On. This is a game that ultimately has a simple concept, but delivers big. You basically have to get to the chalice within the level, but the catch is that you have to sacrifice your knights in order to do so. Want to get across that long chasm? Freeze your comrade and use them as a skateboard to fly over it in style... you get the idea.\n\nThe real joy of the game is that it doesn't rely on a simple novel concept to prop it up. The game is [i]full[/i] of fun... whether it's the dry remarks on the victory screen, the funny weapon descriptions or the names of the chalices that are [i]not[/i] the cup of life. The music's gorgeous, the slapstick sound effects still make me chuckle and the graphics, though simple, are clean, quaint and fun.\n\nWhat's particularly nice is how the game operates at many levels to cater for casual to hardened puzzlers. Completing a level is one thing... but can do you it in good time with a limited number of deaths? How about the side-challenge each level has? These extra challenges unlock more goodies but are also \"good enough\" targets. For those who want more... there's a hidden level above this: A [i]perfect[/i] time or number of deaths (subtly indicated by a purple badge). It doesn't wave it in your face or tell you what score you need, so doesn't berate players who don't care for perfection... but is there if you want it! This subtlety creates a brilliant next step to the puzzles, as you're replaying and trying hard to find where you can make efficiencies and spare the odd knight here and there. But where you don't know how many you need to get... it, in itself, becomes a new puzzle!\n\nBut they're not mandatory. Players can freely skip these without missing out on any of the fun content, so the perfect challenges are only really there for those who [i]actually[/i] want to go for them (e.g. I don't bother with the perfect times). A very subtle, but clever, move by the developers.\n\nUltimately, when you die in most other platformers, you can hear the game taunting you as it hauls you back to the last checkpoint and makes you do it all over again... but here, it hands you a cookies and says \"ah that's ok... say, your dead friend looks like a great stepping stone!\" - It's playfully morbid and, even if you're doing terribly, you can't help but smile weakly as the piles of bodies just build up. It's playful, engaging and has delivered a hearty collection of fun puzzles.\n\nNot the flashiest title, but certainly one of the more charming.", "timestamp_created": 1493651868, "timestamp_updated": 1493652328, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31482740": {"recommendationid": "31482740", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004608152", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493414275}, "language": "czech", "review": "Hra je velmi kvalitn\u011b zpracovan\u00e1.

However, it's a dangerous journey and many will die along the way. Fortunately, each knight has a better chance than the one before; not only because you've learned from his sacrifice, but because his body is now a helpful platform on top of those spikes, or is completing an electrical circuit to open that door, or is just enough a stool to help you reach that ledge. Jump, push, and die your way through 4 worlds full of puzzle-filled levels, leaving a huge body count in your wake.\n\nIt's one of the most hilariously fun puzzle platformers I've ever played.

It's puzzles can be a bit on the easy side if you're a veteren at puzzle games, but the notion of having to die to progress adds a perspective of puzzle-solving not often seen in other games.\n\nAll in all, it's a blast.

I was surprised by how fun this game got with each new level and each new mechanic. The gameplay is very addictive and simple yet tons of fun and thoughtful.The pacing is great as each level offers carefully constructed puzzles that feel fresh rather then copied or repeated. As you get used to encountering a trap or puzzle mechanic the game adds new layers to keep you thinking!\n\nl*] The game is plain fun. Not a single complaint about it. The gameplay is solid and feels rewarding as you solve silly puzzles by sacrificing your oddly named loyal knights.\n\n[*] The audio is pleasant, no annoying soundtrack or repetitive horrible sound effects that drive you insane.\n\n[*] The visual style and graphics suit the game completely and are quite delightful. \n\n[*] Appeals to casual gamers as well as those looking for a challenge as each level can be replayed with several objectives to try and accomplish including finding secrets, beating a level with the fewest 'lives' sacrificed and speed running.

Qu'il s'agisse de franchir une fosse h\u00e9riss\u00e9e de pics, de peser avec votre cadavre sur un bouton (le jeu utilise beaucoup la physique), de servir de boulet de canon ou de servir de conducteur \u00e0 du 220 volts pour ouvrir une porte, vous devrez bien souvent vous sacrifier pour que le suivant puisse avancer dans le casse-t\u00eate, et ce avant qu'il ne doive lui-m\u00eame mourir \u00e0 son tour... Il n'y a pas de limite au massacre, si ce n'est l'envie d'\u00e9conomiser les vies pour faire un bon score, si possible en un minimum de temps.\n \nLe but du jeu est de conduire (et de sacrifier) de petits chevaliers jusqu'\u00e0 leur Graal. Le jeu est divis\u00e9 en quatre niveaux, eux m\u00eames divis\u00e9s en puzzles ind\u00e9pendants. Il y en a soixante-cinq en tout... et donc autant de Graal. On progresse sur une carte qui raconte un semblant d'histoire fa\u00e7on parchemin en d\u00e9bloquant les tableaux les uns apr\u00e8s les autres. Libre au joueur de recommencer un puzzle s'il en a envie pour am\u00e9liorer son score. Des bonus cosm\u00e9tiques (chapeaux et \u00e9p\u00e9es fantaisie) r\u00e9compensent la r\u00e9solution ou un bon score. On peut aussi essayer de \"nourrir\" avec un chevalier une petite boule de poils dissimul\u00e9e dans le d\u00e9cor pour se rajouter un challenge suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n \nLa difficult\u00e9 est bien foutue car elle est tr\u00e8s progressive. Si le d\u00e9but est tr\u00e8s facile, les puzzles du dernier niveau, celui de la cit\u00e9 dans les nuages, m'ont vraiment donn\u00e9 du fil \u00e0 retordre. Car les m\u00e9caniques s'accumulent. Si on commence avec de simples embrochages sur des panneaux ou des lits de pics, on en vient bient\u00f4t \u00e0 devoir g\u00e9rer des portails de r\u00e9apparition, des interrupteurs \u00e9lectriques, d'autres qui nous obligent \u00e0 rester en vie, des cubes de glaces contenant nos cadavres, des portails de t\u00e9l\u00e9portation, des canons, des modificateurs de gravit\u00e9 et m\u00eame des doubles zombifi\u00e9s. De quoi se creuser les m\u00e9ninges !\n \nMais \u00e7a n'en reste pas moins un jeu tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able qui dispense son humour noir de mani\u00e8re l\u00e9g\u00e8re et potache. On notera \u00e9galement un petite r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Portal dans un des puzzles.\nSi graphiquement on atteint pas des sommets, \u00e7a reste mignon et agr\u00e9able \u00e0 regarder, et puis les petits chevaliers sont sympas. La musique est pas mal du tout et accompagne bien le m\u00e9lange \u00e9pique et bon enfant de l'aventure.\nPersonnellement, j'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 y jouer et je le conseille \u00e0 toute personne qui aime les puzzles et les jeux de r\u00e9flexion.\n \nLes plus :\n \n- un principe (l'obligation de mourir) et des puzzles sympas\n- une bonne progression dans la difficult\u00e9\n- beaucoup d'humour... jusque dans les cr\u00e9dits de fin\n- une maniabilit\u00e9 au poil au clavier (pourtant j'ai deux mains gauches)\n- c'est mignon comme tout\n \nJe ne trouve pas de \"moins\" \u00e0 signaler et je ne vais pas en mettre pour en mettre.\nUn jeu aux ambitions modestes mais qui remplit parfaitement son cahier des charges.", "timestamp_created": 1465256269, "timestamp_updated": 1465256269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506450", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23370270": {"recommendationid": "23370270", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044388116", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 190, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504734364}, "language": "english", "review": "For about the price of a kebab & chips - where I live anyway - you can pick yourself up a brilliant little platformer.

The idea that you need to die to use your own corpse to get through a puzzle is really cool. Most of the puzzles force you plan a few steps ahead to strategically die in one spot to use that corpse later. The puzzles hit a sweet spot where they're not so tough that they leave you crying in frustration, but are hard enough that you'll need a few tries to see the solution, giving you a solid sense of satisfaction when you do solve it.\n\nThe game has a lot of charm and great sense of humour.

I laughed out loud a couple of times. \n\nMost players will finish the game in a single night, which is fair value for the price. I like games in which you can have a full experience in a single sitting. In that sense it reminds me of Thomas was Alone and similar indies. Each level has extras challenges and a target number of deaths needed to get to the end. I found myself replaying levels to try different tactics to avoid piling up bodies as a brute force solution to a puzzle. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that jumping feels a little loose at times. There's a particular sequence with ice blocks that I felt held me up because I had trouble sticking my jumps, not because I hadn't solved the puzzle. Beyond that, it also feels like the game shows you most of its ideas around 75% of the way through.

I knew it wasn\u2019t just the morbid nature of repurposing your corpses as puzzle solving tools, bizarre and unsettling as that is. And it wasn\u2019t that there was something wrong with the puzzle themselves, because even with this odd feeling swirling around inside of me I was having a grand time solving them.\n\nWhen I finally figured out what had been bugging me, it was both surprising and a little amusing. With how deeply the concept of death has been incorporated and mechanicalized in games, and then instilled in me through years of playing them, I realized Life Goes On felt off because it was doing precisely the opposite of what I\u2019d been trained to do above all else: stay alive. With how many countless grotesquely violent and gore fill games I\u2019ve played I\u2019ve become rather horrifyingly numb to using violence as a mechanic against others, but through all of those keeping myself alive was always the objective above all else.\n\nTo do otherwise in most games is to effectively stop playing. Death is simply failure by another name, often meaningless but nearly always present and in some cases even romanticized as one of a game\u2019s most notorious traits (Dark Souls being an obvious example). Life Goes On asked that I rethink the concept of death and in doing so it made it mean something again. Each time one of my knights died I felt an odd mixture of joy at being able to move forward, and distress at the very thought I was taking pleasure from leading my character to the slaughter.\n\nWhat\u2019s special about Life Goes On is that it doesn\u2019t treat death the way so many modern games do. It\u2019s not cynical, graphic, or intended to shock and appal you. It\u2019s more like a cartoon where someone gets an anvil dropped on their head. Its situations are so absurd and everything drawn in such a delightfully cheerful tone, that I couldn\u2019t take anything seriously because I wasn\u2019t supposed to. Life Goes On recognizes how ridiculous its concept is and mostly manages to come off as silly, maybe even hilarious to some, rather than disturbing.\n\nThe way this unorthodox view of death is then applied to puzzle designs helps make a tired genre feel fresh again. There are a lot of the usual devices at work here, be they buttons, blocks, or various hazards, but the way you interact with them with the help of your past failures makes them feel original and inspired. Spikes become walkways, freezing beams create pushable blocks, and sticking yourself in an outlet completes the circuit opening the door. With death being directly integrated into the game design, it also helps take a lot of the edge off of missing a jump or screwing up a sequence, which removes most of the frustration so typical of the genre and had me playing through the entire game in just a few extended sittings.\n\nI realize I\u2019ve sort of come full circle with this review, beginning with how Life Goes On made me remember that death isn\u2019t just a meaningless game of numbers, but then arriving back at how I enjoy its mechanical use here. Ultimately Life Goes On has its cake and eats it too, so any attempt to make it out to entirely subvert the usual violent video game trappings would be dubious at best. But that it made me consider all of this, with seemingly no intention and while delivering an excellent puzzle platformer, feels like at least a modest accomplishment. It got me thinking about things I never even recognize in most games, and though it didn\u2019t quite go all the way, it started a discussion and even managed to have a lot of fun in the process. Odd praise to be sure, but it\u2019s a rather odd game itself isn\u2019t it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzvrAZ7k61g&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\n[b]You can read more of my writing on [url=http://kritiqal.com/2015/05/18/life-goes-on-review/]Kritiqal[/url].[/b]\n", "timestamp_created": 1431966035, "timestamp_updated": 1431966035, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.776532", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15805445": {"recommendationid": "15805445", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991173471", "num_games_owned": 426, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 193, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431468962}, "language": "english", "review": "Nice \"simple\" and funny puzzle game where death is the only way to go foward", "timestamp_created": 1431469071, "timestamp_updated": 1431469071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15750023": {"recommendationid": "15750023", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065620261", "num_games_owned": 611, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482275412}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth every penny.

I quite like this puzzle game, and it brings something new to the table as far as newer games go - you can use the corpses of your soldiers to complete levels and rise to new heights! As morbid as that sounds, the game is odd in that you don't really feel like you're killing anyone or anything after the first few levels; there's a scroll at the bottom of the screen that tells you the name of the poor soul you're controlling, but I found myself ignoring it (you go through knights fast in this game) until I wanted to get an achievement that involved dealing with members of a certain family. \n\nThe music is solid, and the levels are challenging.

Who sits around a table and says, \"Let's make a game where you use corpses to progress?\" I mean, if you pitched it to me, I'd tell you it's a silly idea. But someone did it. And it works - quite well.\n\nI am really enjoying Life Goes On. So far, I've spent around 3 hours with it, and I've finished a third of the game. You will finish it quicker, but I am a completionist so I'm trying to get the fewest deaths and the fastest times, and man, let me tell you it's not easy! \n\nThe concept of the game is actually quite sound, and the execution is pretty good. In Life Goes On, you need the corpses of humorously, randomly named characters to succeed. It's not necessarily the corpses of your failures (although it certainly can AND WILL be...) - sometimes you need to strategically die to buzzsaws, spikes, and other such things to trigger traps and switches so you can open a door, turn off a flamethrower, get to a higher area, or just finish the level. \n\nThe game only has one button - jump. (and of course, directional pad) There's no attack, or anything else. This doesn't get too boring though, because the graphics & music are quite nice. Also, the levels and challenges are varied enough that you aren't focused on the fact that you are just hitting jump the whole time. \n\nSpeaking of levels and challenges, they are relatively easy to complete, but difficult to master. The levels are relatively short, most under a minute and a half, so you move through them pretty quickly, and they feel differing on the types of puzzles involved. There are three 'worlds' total. The game itself is pretty forgiving, because you have unlimited knights, but you can replay each level to try and get the best rating on both time, minimizing your deaths, and finding Jeff. \n\nJeff. What do I say about Jeff? You'll meet this adorable looking fuzzball, wander over to pet him, and he'll eat you. Yup. You heard me. In every level. And just when you think you're safe... HE'S IN THE CREDITS TOO. Sorry. You'll have to learn to love Jeff. \n\nDon't forget about Jim. Who's Jim? Well, each time you die, the knight that spawns is randomly named (the name shows up at the bottom of the screen). Jim is quite prolific and has at least 40 family members (some variant of Jim or James), that have a random chance to spawn when you get a new knight. There's even an achievement for wiping them all out. Trust me, I'm working on it. Eventually, you'll take care of the problem at the source. There's an achievement for that too. \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Life Goes On and think that if you like puzzle or platforming games, this is a must-buy, even at regular price (which I feel is quite reasonable). My only complaint with the game is that it is quite short, and I would have liked to see more out of it.

I think that may have been because of Braid, but I'm not sure. Now, I'm not going to say that this game is necessarily revolutionary in how it handles the puzzle-platformer setup, but it does at least do things a little more interesting than the average block pushing puzzle, even though there are some of those in here. You see, what this game does differently is that this game wants you to die. A lot. Yet, this game isn't anywhere near on the level of challenge as something like Super Meat Boy. How does all this work, you may ask? Through jolly cooperation! Also, the character kinda looks like Solaire, so that really does help matters.\n\nWhen you die, unless your corpse falls into a pit, it stays on the level. Ally corpses are the way to solve the puzzles in the game, as no puzzle (at least as far as I could tell) can be beaten with no deaths. Also, unlike a ton of other puzzle-platformers, this game strikes a perfect balance between puzzle and platformer (with the exception of one stage, Altered Trajectory which is both not a puzzle and the worst stage in the game IMO). Puzzles are fun to solve, and the platforming feels good. As for the controls, you run and jump. That's all you need, honestly.\n\nFor $12, this game does feel a bit short on content. Even going for 100% through the typical three-badge setup of these kinds of games (find hidden thing in level, beat it under par time, beat it with minimal deaths), this game only took me about four hours. Beyond that, I don't really see me playing this game all that much in the future. You can use your own price evaluations to determine how much this game is worth to you. A map editor would've been really nice,  but I think the same can be said for pretty much any puzzle-platformer. Apart from that, there really isn't much to talk about. It's a puzzle-platformer with some pretty nice level design that you can complete in one sitting pretty easily. Most of you will have gotten this from a Humble Bundle, as I did (the Humble Jumbo Bundle 2 IIRC?), so if you're looking for an opinion on this game, it's a good four or so hours. 9/10.\n\nStory: As far as the storyline goes, there really isn't anything to talk about. You are hunting for the Holy Grail, and there is quite a lot of corpses along the way for some reason. This game definitely has a good sense of humor; a very British sense of humor, in fact. If you like things like Red Dwarf and Monty Python, you'll feel right at home here. It's very silly, and the concept of killing yourself to win the game doesn't really stop getting silly. If the level design wouldn't keep me coming back, the humor would. 9/10.\n\nGraphics: A suprisingly good looking game for only being a ~200MB download. It's a very good blend of graphical fidelity and art style. Some of the levels do start to look a bit same-y, but considering that we're talking about the puzzle-platformer genre here, it's a considerable amount of praise to say that levels look a *bit* same-y. As for the technical aspects of this game, it fullscreens to your native resolution (a BIG plus in my books) on launch. Beyond that, there really isn't much else to tinker around with in the options menu as far as the graphical fidelity of the game goes. That's alright, though; the game never really phased my GTX 760, so I'd imagine most anyone with Intel HD Graphics at the very least would be able to run this game. Well optimized, it looks good, and it fullscreens to my native resolution. All the check boxes ticked for me. 5/5.\n\nSound: As always, there's two major things to talk about here: the soundtrack and the voice acting. The voice acting really only consist of death knells, which are as you would most likely infer by this point in reading this review, very silly. As for the soundtrack, some of the tracks are forgettable, but for the most part I'd say it's an above-average medieval-inspired orchestral soundtrack. It's fitting, but I'd probably never listen to it outside of the game. Just not my thing. There were a few strange audio glitches in which tracks would either layer over eachother in a really annoying way or just not play at all for a while. It didn't happen too often, though, so it's not too big of a worry. Anyways, the voice acting is silly, the OST is good but not too memorable, and the sound only bugs out once in a while. 4/5.\n\nOverall scores are: 9/9/5/4; cumulative score of 9.0/10. Again, your mileage may vary on the game's value. I'd personally wait for a sale before I would pick up this game, but if you're not strapped for cash or anything, $12 is a perfectly fine value. It's a better value than AAA games, that's for damn sure.", "timestamp_created": 1411917743, "timestamp_updated": 1411917743, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12079115": {"recommendationid": "12079115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074390389", "num_games_owned": 369, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410578145}, "language": "english", "review": "Once of the most original puzzle games I have seen in a long time.

Instead of trying to not die, you strategicly die to use the corpses of your fellow knights to make bridges, press buttons & trigger traps so that one knight may complete the mission. The gameplay is straight forward but doesn't lack it's complexity (especially later on in the mission list). Each mission has a time goal, life goal and a chester goal (finding a monster in the environment which will eat the knight and then sleep) which adds a lot of replayability as it isn't easy to hit all of these on the first attempt. The music & art makes for a humorous game which partnered with the gameplay is well worth the price. \n\nOne of the best mechanics is the \"name\" of the current knight which is usually pretty crazy (i.e. High Royal Knight Sir Edward The Grey) and gives each knight a bit of uniqueness and adds to the humor of these prestigious knights being used as sacrafices to trigger traps and make human bridges.

I quadri che dovremo affrontare utilizzeranno tutta una serie di classici clich\u00e9 (seppur ben mescolati) tra la fisica dei corpi, fiamme, spuntoni e catapulte per portare a casa la coppa finale. A rendere il tutto pi\u00f9 stuzzicante intervengono i \u201climiti\u201d (relativi \u2014 non vedrete mai la scritta di game over) di tempo e vite imposti dagli sviluppatori per migliorare la propria prestazione, oltre all\u2019amico Jeff da raggiungere come bonus nascosto (anche qui, poche volte \u00e8 realmente invisibile a una prima occhiata).

Anche la trovata di assegnare un nome casuale sempre diverso al protagonista (un cavaliere uomo o donna, con la simpatica trovata della dinastia Jim da eliminare) far\u00e0 sorridere per le prime volte, spingendovi a dimenticarvi del tutto della chicca dopo le prime morti. Insomma, un puzzle game basilare, semplice, ma che non riesce ad andare oltre alla sua prova tecnica, perdendo quasi subito interesse nella sua trovata che non \u00e8 stata ben sfruttata.\n\nVieni a leggere la recensione completa su TheShelterNetwork.com:\nhttp://theshelternetwork.com/life-goes-on/", "timestamp_created": 1399714701, "timestamp_updated": 1399714701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507026", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10060107": {"recommendationid": "10060107", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966527290", "num_games_owned": 2689, "num_reviews": 386, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403778491}, "language": "french", "review": "\"Life Goes On n'est pas un grand jeu, mais il est tout de m\u00eame excellent.

It has always been something that is best avoided in video games. Also real life would be the other main place. But as Life Goes On, an indie puzzle game by Infinite Monkeys shows, sometimes it can be used to solve environmental physics based puzzles.\n\nThe hook of this game is a little tricky to wrap your head around, but simple to understand once you see it in action. Basically you control an infinite number of little knights and want to get them to the golden chalice at the end of each level. To do so, you can respawn a knight whenever a death occurs and make use of the previous body to further your cause. For example, you might be faced with a spike pit which is too wide to jump over. In this case, simply jump a knight into the middle of it, respawn and use the lifeless body as a stepping stone to get to the other side (The game gives each character a name, but you'll never bother to read it).\n\nIt is a base mechanics that works extremely well. If you played the demo (and you should) you would quickly have got into the swing of using your minions to get a little bit further each life. It is clever and the initial levels make great use of the different possibilities the mechanic presents. Unfortunately, like a lot of clever ideas it runs out of steam far too quickly.\n\nLife Goes on just doesn't have enough good variety to maintain your attention. By the end of the first set of levels you will have had your fill of the different types of puzzles and so it is a let down that the next set is more or less repeating things all over again. The levels get longer and the challenges more difficult, but really the game is just chaining the same challenges you have already faced over and over again into growing chunks. Worse, whenever a new mechanic is introduced, it tends to lean more towards frustration rather than fun, especially when compared to the very solid base (trying to avoid activating respawn points is never a fun time).\n\nTo be fair, although the 3rd \"world\" on drags a lot, there are still a couple of memorable stages here and there. One in particular pays homage to a popular steam themed game and the \"final level\" in each group represents somewhat of a boss battle, that is much more fun to play through. If only these levels had been the norm, rather than the exception this review would be a lot more glowing. As it stands the game only shows glimpses of potential and innovation, perhaps a lesson for the developers next game (quality of puzzles over quantity please!).\n\nMixing it up is the set challenge of beating the clock and set number of deaths for each level. You will also have a \"fuzzy\" creature to find in each level which will eat one of your knights. While this promises diversity, the reality is it just means you are beating the level three times with a slightly different focus. Sadly there doesn't appear to be much scope for earning all three in one run consistently and there is seemingly no payoff for doing so anyway.\n\nThe rest of the package is well put together. The graphics are functional and the sound and music is nicely done. The menus work, but are a little uninspired (think ios style) and there is basically no story to drive you on. The environments are nice though and have a lot of good touches such as moving power cables. There isn't a lot of variety in the caverns, but later levels do at least provide a slightly different colour palette.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the knights themselves are perhaps a little inconsistent as platforms (you'll often try to jump on one and \"miss\") but this isn't something you can't adjust and plan for and there is a very low penalty for failure. The controls in general are tight and it is nice that the game automatically \"grabs\" you onto other knights so this is nowhere near as fiddly as it might have been.\n\nIs there enough content for the asking price? I'd still suggest that there is, at a push, but it is walking a very fine line (looking at 4-5 hours I would think). The base game here is so solid that I highly recommend everybody tries it, but the lack of ideas means even the demo might just be sufficient (or waiting for a deeper sale might be the best option).\n\nSo ultimately a bit of a disappointment despite still being a solid game.

Para lograr este objetivo iremos activando una serie de portales que nos servir\u00e1n de punto de Check Point.\n\nEsta ayuda postuma puede ser mediante bloquear ciertos obstaculos, como pinchos, o activar interruptores, que pueden abrir puertas, activar trampas etc. Los niveles m\u00e1s divertidos son los de final de fase, ya que tendremos que poner a prueba nuestra habilidad para poder superar unos niveles que podemos catalogar como \u201cFinal Bosses\u201d.\n\nEl objetivo en cada nivel ser\u00e1 completarlo en el menor tiempo posible, y perdiendo cuantos menos caballeros sea posible en el proceso. A partir de cierto punto se unir\u00e1 un reto extra, que ser\u00e1 alimentar a unos bichos peludos que encontraremos en puntos complicados del juego. Una gran pega que tiene la jugabilidad es la no existencia de un l\u00edmite de muertes, por lo que s\u00f3lo ser\u00e1 cuesti\u00f3n de tiempo y paciencia el acabarlo, sin que exista una posibilidad real de perder.\n\nGr\u00e1ficos\n\nAl decir que el juego se ve muy influenciado por Rayman no nos referiamos \u00fanicamente a la jugabilidad. Los personajes, que pese a tener nombres propios, lucen exactamente iguales tienen el mismo cuerpo que el personaje de Ubisoft: carecen de brazos o piernas, teniendo s\u00f3lo manos y pies.\n\nEn cuanto a los gr\u00e1ficos de los niveles, van variando, manteni\u00e9ndose siempre fieles a la ambientaci\u00f3n de cada una de las fases, pero puede llegar a hacerse mon\u00f3tono con el tiempo. Lo mismo ocurre con los elementos como los obst\u00e1culos y los interruptores, que no variaran de una fase a otra, siendo siempre los mismos.\n\nSonido\n\nNo se trata de un apartado muy desarrollado en el juego, ya que los personajes son mudos, y solo podremos oir sus expresiones. Los sonidos al impactar, ser devorados o morir son bastante divertidos y nada realistas, lo que ayuda a que no nos sintamos mal por la perdida de tantos buenos caballeros.\n\nEn cuanto a la m\u00fasica, tiene un esquema muy simple, pero ayuda a concentrarse, especialmente en los puzzles m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles. Sin embargo no goza de gran variedad, por lo que tras pasadas varias horas jugando, se nos queda grabada en la cabeza y no podemos olvidarla.\nConclusi\u00f3n\n\nSe trata de un juego realmente entretendo para pasar esos ratos que no sabes qu\u00e9 hacer. No revoluciona ning\u00fan g\u00e9nero, pero si le aporta una nueva visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s macabra, pero igual de divertida.", "timestamp_created": 1398368650, "timestamp_updated": 1398368650, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604486", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9917920": {"recommendationid": "9917920", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078013049", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499075583}, "language": "spanish", "review": "recomendado 100% lo mejor de lo mejor niveles para pensar un buen rato salta corre piensa lo tiene todo ya si se pudiesen crear niveles seria perfecto \n\nsobretodo lo recomiendo para ni\u00f1os, este tipo de juegos es bueno para su desarrollo de Reacci\u00f3n a la hora  de pensar algo  o como solucionas problemas \n", "timestamp_created": 1398340821, "timestamp_updated": 1398340821, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.457871", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9917628": {"recommendationid": "9917628", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979084213", "num_games_owned": 3565, "num_reviews": 921, "playtime_forever": 267, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403217474}, "language": "english", "review": "Life Goes On reminded me a bit of The Swapper but instead of creating clones you're creating dead clones. See the resemblance ? Well, they're clones, but not in a traditional way. Each knight is given a random name to make you think you're dealing with other persons here. But they don't fool me. It would've been nice if every now and then a knight would get different equipment. Then, and only then, will I get the illusion that I'm dealing with different persons here. But it's not important, so let's just drop it.\n\nAnyway, you have to use your dead clones to make it past the levels. See spikes but can't cross ? Just jump in the middle of it and you'll be able to jump on that guy's head with another knight. The game starts with basic puzzle platforming but halfway through becomes more difficult when it throws other puzzle elements your way. It never becomes frustratingly difficult, as long as you pay attention. I got stuck in a level or two and in hindsight they were actually very obvious. So it also depends on the person eventually. The game isn't very long and you should be able to finish it in 2-3 hours max, depending on if you want to earn all of the available medals.\n\nThe graphics aren't great, they are actually pretty simple but they get the job done. I personally thought it lacked a bit of personality. The voice acting is also very basic, with only a scream whenever a knight dies. The music on the other hand is better than expected and I enjoyed it very much.\n\nThe last 2 levels of the game (the true last level and the credits level) are the most impressive levels and it's unfortunate that the other levels are so static in comparison (even if some of the puzzles are harder). If there ever will be a sequel I sincerely hope they'll make use of more platforming, just like those last 2 levels. Or maybe a combination of both, who knows ?\n\nLife Goes On is an enjoyable puzzle game and if you liked The Swapper I'm pretty certain you'll have fun playing this one, too.\n\n[Rating: 75/100]", "timestamp_created": 1398338008, "timestamp_updated": 1401980658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9914817": {"recommendationid": "9914817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023548072", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407269479}, "language": "english", "review": "An excellent puzzle game!

See a deathtrap? Die on it, then respawn and walk on your corpse. Switch that has to be held down? Die so that your corpse falls on it, then respawn and walk past. Et cetera, et cetera.\n\nThe controls are a bit inaccurate at times, and will most likely leave you dying slightly more often than intended. Although since this game is all about sacrificing one knight to make a path for another, a few more corpses lying around aren't that much of a problem. (And if you're finding it difficult, a few more corpses aren't a problem at all.)\nThe puzzles are challenging but not frustrating, and make great use of switches, platforms, corpses, and checkpoints. The solution is always there, if you know where to look.\nThe music is unintrusive, yet amazing. It fits perfectly into the game. The sound design, too, is brilliant. Everything just works together really well.\nThere is tremendous replay value in this game, too. Times (and deaths) to beat, secrets to find, more knights to sacrifice... And if you want a quick game (or want to prune Jim's family tree further), there are no lengthy menus to keep you from killing knights. This is evident even in the demo. Ten minutes worth of content, and I had over an hour logged.\nThere's also a great (if morbid) sense of humour present. The knights' death cries are hilarious, the names are generally overblown (and if they're not, it's funnier), and the victory screens... well, \"VICTORY is failure rounded up!\" is just one of the possible messages to recieve upon finishing a level. And then there's the credits of the demo.\n\nIf you haven't played the demo yet, you should. Even if you know you want this game. The credits alone are worth it. Possibly the title screen as well. And if you're undecided, the demo is basically a slightly earlier version with less levels and slightly different graphics (mostly just checkpoints and the victory screen are different, really).", "timestamp_created": 1397792395, "timestamp_updated": 1397792395, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503767", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9856680": {"recommendationid": "9856680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050490949", "num_games_owned": 513, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403213530}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply amazing.

The game was developed by Infinite Monkeys Entertainment and was originally conceived at the 2012 Global Game Jam. The main aim of each level is to reach the golden cup, the holy grail so to speak. How do you do this with all the death traps you ask? Well its easy when your a king, with a portal and have an infinite number of knights to send to their deaths until you can accomplish your goal.\n\nIn Life Goes On, if you die that's not the end, instead you just send another knight through the spawn portal. This is not just a piece of gimmicky morbid comedy, it is in fact a core mechanic of the game. Sometimes having to sacrifice your minions is required to progress or solve a puzzle. An example of this is if the objective is across a floor of spikes, lay down the lives of your knights so one can climb across the hole ridden bodies to reach the grail.\n\nIn other platformers, you sole objective would be to avoid a deadly trap however in Life goes on, you may need to use that trap to accomplish your goal, perhaps you need to sacrifice a knight on a saw blade to strategically land the body on a button or build a mound of bodies to reach a ledge. What this means is that obstacles in Life Goes On are not just obstacles they become useful tools to use to progress.\n\nOverall Life Goes On is certainly a good platformer that provides a mix of enjoyment, comedy and challenge. The game provides a unique twist and this twist provides great synergy of the level design and mechanics. For anyone who loves the genre it will certainly cure that puzzler platformer itch.

Imagine the Cup of Life is hidden behind devious and very lethal traps that make acceptable losses not only inevitable, but necessary, as corpses are the only tool your knights have to beat those death courses. And finally, imagine that once an intrepid knight actually does make it to the end of the obstacle course and returns with the Cup of Life...you realize that it's not the Cup of Life at all, but only the Cup of Minor Weight Loss, or the Cup of Like. So, you need to send forth even more knights to find even more cups. And that is how you get Life Goes On: Done to Death.\n\nThe game has beautiful visuals, a lovely soundtrack, and tons upon tons of deviously crafted traps that will inevitably claim many lives of your white knights - they should be wearing red, now that I think of it. To navigate through those, you need to find a logical sequence of events that will bring you to that coveted Cup, and the knights themsevles are nothing short of adorable even as they meet their untimely ends at the hands of a knightsicle-maker, and other clever booby traps. \n\nAnother aspect in which the game shines is its attention to detail. At the bottom of the screen, you will see that each knight has a name, and often many (increasingly silly) titles. As you progress, you will unlock additional weapons and hats that do nothing to help the knights, but are a nice diversion nevertheless - and there's some sort of a \"Life Goes On-y\" logic behind them all, if you check the armory. And last but not least, the title screen will show the king getting more and more frustrated as more knights walk into the grinder.\n\nOne weak point I noticed is that the game tends to be slightly RNG with physics sometimes and a slightly skewed position of the corpses might mess you up - I mean that usually happens in normal play, but rarely, you did everything right, but Sir Knighty McKnightface still decided to have a seizure right before stumbling into the pit. Won't be a problem unless you're going for challenge runs, though.

(I for once would have put the skins as a reward for feeding Jeff)\n6: The game feels too slow paced - if you really want to involve quick eye to hand coordonation then make it more alert (better moving animations, faster running, death animations instead of that \"limp doll\" effect, grab action to pull or push cubes etc)", "timestamp_created": 1515442561, "timestamp_updated": 1515442561,

As if the game's concept wasn't funny enough (and it was), developers added several extra subtle levels of funny - from background story to funny knights' hats and weapons.\n[*]Replayability. There is a number of challenges in each puzzle, that will require replay it several times (if you so desire, of course). Solve the puzzle, get par time, get par deaths, feed Jeff (extra goal for each puzzle), get difficult par time, get absolute minimum deaths.\n[*]Puzzle design. Puzzles are logic based, rather than execution based (as all puzzles games should be). Most achievements, though, require high level of execution too.\n[*]Music: Surprisingly good.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list]\n[*]Some achievements are quite challenging + speedrun achievement seems to be buggy.

There is absolutely no story. The characters come and go, they get born, they die, you don't emphasize with them as they are literally for you to kill and abuse. Need a safe way over a floor of thorns? Let a knight die in it, and use him as a safe platform.\n\nThere are a lot of levels, I don't know how many because I didn't finish the game. There is level after level after level, it always gets a bit more complicated, more confusing, more frustrating, more not fun.\n\nOne would ask \"why did you buy this game, of course the riddles will be complicated, that IS the fun!\". Yes, I'm sorry. I thought I liked riddles, but apparently not in this game. I loved portal and portal 2, especially the multiplayer part. Maybe it's that I emphasize with the playable character more, maybe I need that. This game doesn't have it, and so I don't like it? Maybe?\n\nApart from that the worlds look pretty, the controls are nice and easy, the physics are absolutely fine, nothing wonky or stupid.\n\nSo if you like riddle games, like the challenge even though you can't really emphasize with the Knights you're going to kill, this game might be for you, not for me though.", "timestamp_created": 1517148606, "timestamp_updated": 1517148606, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494707", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39675321": {"recommendationid": "39675321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198405529936", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 257, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518474837}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucd94\ucc9c", "timestamp_created": 1517125241, "timestamp_updated": 1517125241, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39660822": {"recommendationid": "39660822", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052681533", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 321, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517426829}, "language": "polish", "review": "Life Goes On to prosta gra 2d nastawiona na my\u015blenie i logike.

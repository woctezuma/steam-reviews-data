La trama tiene un buen desarrollo y los personajes estan bien construidos.

The story was good enough to keep me entertained through out all the chapters. You play as Gabriel, an author who lives in New Orleans and owns St George's Bookstore. He is working on his new book 'Voodoo Murders'. This is why he needed to follow this case with his Detective friend Mosely. He will investigate a voodoo cult then discover something about his own family and people he cares about. The story is dark and may not be suitable for everyone, however I enjoyed it so much. All the characters are likable, the voice overs were well done, especially Gabriel's who made me giggle at some of the funny remarks he made. The dialogues between the characters are well done, this game require you to read and investigate a lot, not something you skip and expect to enjoy the game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1183588893\n\nBoth graphics and music were really good, I loved the soundtrack of this game. I assume whoever played the original should be happy to play this remaster.

Though it goes around the world for a bit, New Orleans is the star of the show. Many landmarks and architecture were beautifully researched and recreated, lots of history is retold and I wished Gabriel wouldn't sleep through a lecture I was really interested in. The ambiance is what makes this game, engaging with the characters and chatting along feels awesome, and the noir atmosphere coupled with the witty dialogue makes for a memorable experience. \nAnyone who likes point and click or a good story should download this.

In quasi tutti i casi per me la schermata originale restituisce una sensazione pi\u00f9 nostalgica, soprattutto i colori sono pi\u00f9 vibranti (vista la gamma cromatica limitata dell'epoca) anzich\u00e8 smorti e tutti tendenti a tonalit\u00e0 calde (per essere pi\u00f9 realistici...), e soprattutto modelli e animazioni sono pi\u00f9 belli da vedere anzich\u00e8 legnosi come nell'ibrido 2D/3D del restauro.\n\nSecondo NO \u00e8 la colonna sonora nuova, che in diversi temi non solo \u00e8 noiosa ma anche martellante e fuori luogo, tant'\u00e8 che nei primi minuti avevo pensato di escluderla del tutto.\n\nPer fare il confronto voi stessi comparate da un video su youtube del gioco originale, vi accorgerete come le musiche originali fossero come dire pi\u00f9 discrete e adeguate rispetto alla controparte nuova. Una su tutte quella della stazione di polizia, veramente odiosa, ma anche quella della biblioteca non scherza.\n\nMessi da parte i difetti soggettivi, che forse solo i pi\u00f9 nostalgici e \"vecchi\" come sapranno apprezzare come tali, resta un gioco dalla trama interessante e con qualche colpo di scena ben orchestrato, con enigmi generalmente ben fatti ed alcuni un po' ostici (tipo il famoso enigma dell'orologio nella soffitta della nonna) anche se in realt\u00e0 c'\u00e8 un sistema di aiuti progressivi basato su pi\u00f9 livelli di aiuto (suggerimento blando --> suggerimento pi\u00f9 specifico --> soluzione diretta dell'enigma) per cui bloccarsi e restare fermi a sbattere la testa \u00e8 solo un ricordo remoto degli anni '90 quando non c'era internet e google a disposizione per cercare la soluzione o, ancora meglio, il video su youtube. Bei tempi.\n\nLa longevit\u00e0, senza usare aiuti o soluzioni, all'incirca si aggira sulle 10 ore pi\u00f9 o meno a seconda della vostra abilit\u00e0 e ovviamente ascoltando i dialoghi senza andare dritti al punto ogni volta.\n\nConsiglio l'acquisto del gioco, per\u00f2 lascio a voi la scelta se prendere questa edizione restaurata o quella originale (su GOG).\n\nDi sicuro \u00e8 da comprare appena \u00e8 in offerta, ad esempio io l'ho pagato 5,99\u20ac ed \u00e8 un prezzo giusto.", "timestamp_created": 1514847637, "timestamp_updated": 1514847637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38937440": {"recommendationid": "38937440", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994748131", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 12, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514816338}, "language": "english", "review": "What bad things could I write about this game? \nIts my most favorite and beloved game of the 90\u00b4s.

La sagas King's Quest, Space Quest, Police Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Phantasmagoria, Shivers y -sobre todo- Gabriel Knight, son la columna vertebral de un g\u00e9nero que en su momento llev\u00f3 a los videojuegos a un lugar donde nunca hab\u00edan llegado. Siempre diferenci\u00e1ndose de su principal competidor por entregar historias m\u00e1s \"adultas\" con contenido muchas veces pol\u00e9mico, al l\u00edmite de la censura, sin tener tanto en cuenta el humor y m\u00e1s enfocado en lo narrativo. Mientras que LucasArts apostaba por lo colorido, las parodias y un tono m\u00e1s amigable para con el usuario, Sierra Entertainment siempre tuvo un tono mucho m\u00e1s disruptivo, complejo, con puzzles crueles y que forzaban una comprensi\u00f3n total de la trama y los entornos de cada uno de sus juegos. \n\nGabriel Knight no s\u00f3lo continu\u00f3 con la tradici\u00f3n de la compa\u00f1\u00eda creada por Ken y Roberta Williams, sino que fue la confirmaci\u00f3n de su apuesta. A pesar de ser un juego muy complejo, con varias capas narrativas que fuerzan a una lectura intensa del extenso material que se nos presenta, el primer juego de la saga logr\u00f3 una popularidad ins\u00f3lita incluso dentro de la era de oro de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas, a mediados de los '90. Otra particularidad del juego es que fue \u00edntegramente producido por una mujer, Jane Jensen, algo llamativo incluso hoy, donde el facto predominante masculino est\u00e1 presente a lo largo de toda la industria. \n\nEn cuanto a esta remasterizaci\u00f3n, el juego fue completamente restaurado y re-dise\u00f1ado por su creadora Jane Jensen, con voces nuevas que le aportan una nueva profundidad a la actuaci\u00f3n y l\u00f3gicamente tienen una mejor definici\u00f3n de sonido. La banda sonora original tambi\u00e9n fue renovada por completo, lo cual logra una conjunci\u00f3n sonora acorde a los juegos modernos. El re-dise\u00f1o y el arte son completamente acertados, apostando a una interfaz 2D o mejor dicho \"2.5D\" que hace honor al concepto original de 1993. Podemos decir que Gabriel Knight se ve mejor que nunca y se muestra como fue pensado originalmente. Como parte de los extras de esta edici\u00f3n especial por los 20 a\u00f1os del lanzamiento, se incluye una novela gr\u00e1fica con los hechos anteriores a los que transcurren en el juego, al igual que bocetos y una versi\u00f3n con comentarios de producci\u00f3n.\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 hace tan bueno a este juego? sus personajes, principalmente, su gran estilo narrativo, los giros sorpresivos en la trama, su jugabilidad, su constante desaf\u00edo, el gran contenido detectivesco, ya que fue uno de los primeros juegos en incorporar el trabajo policial \"real\" dentro de los puzzles cl\u00e1sicos de las aventuras gr\u00e1ficas. De cualquier forma que lo midamos, Gabriel Knight: Sins of The Fathers esta siempre dentro de las 5 mejores aventuras gr\u00e1ficas de todos los tiempos. Y -esta opini\u00f3n es personal- si sus dos secuelas no hubieran sufrido la fallida decisi\u00f3n de coquetear con otros formatos de interfaz (FMV, live action, 3D) y se hubieran mantenido en el confiable 2D, hoy ser\u00eda sin dudas el monarca, desterrando incluso al todopoderoso Monkey Island. S\u00f3lo podemos pedir al universo que Jane Jensen decida reeditar la trilog\u00eda completa con el mismo formato que esta remasterizaci\u00f3n.

It was an award winning game back then too and had high scoring reviews, which made my decision to purchase the game very easy! So here we are 20 years later and I was more than happy to give the 20th Anniversary edition a go. It does not disappoint.\n\nIf you're not someone who played the original, then honestly it's hard for me to know if you'll enjoy this. It is a game from a different era, dependent on writing, suspense, atmosphere, logical puzzle solving: basically, the kind of game you'd want to take notes as you're playing (although there are hints available in Gabriel Knight's journal - more on this later.) \n\nThe less you know about the game's plot, the more you'll enjoy it as you play, so I won't say much except for the inital setup. Gabriel Knight is the owner of St. George's Books, a bookshop located in the French Quarter of New Orleans. He is a failed author and his only companions at the start of the game are Grace Nakamura (who looks after the bookshop) and Mosely, an old friend who is a police detective (who Gabriel jokingly calls 'Mostly'). Gabriel is writing a book based on the Voodoo Murders, a series of killings which have recently taken place in various locations around New Orleans as the game begins.\n\nAnd so this brings me to the game's greatest strengths: it's characters and story. It was a joy to play it back then when Gabriel was performed by the legendary Tim Curry and Mosely by Mark Hamill. The 20th Anniversary Edition wisely sticks to the original script, narration, one-liners and humour of the first game with only a handful of minor edits. Unfortuantely the recordings of the original voice cast have been lost, so a new group of voice actors take centre stage for the 20th Anniversary. The results are... ok. Well, how do you follow Tim Curry? Others have complained about the voice cast, personally I found them to be variable: the exchanges of dialog between Gabriel, Grace and Mosely are the best performed because I think the actors are having fun with the material, but unfortunately the performances drop sharply in the game's more dramatic moments. \n\nFortunately this does not detract from the story of the game, which is well-researched, detailed, enjoyable, addictive and brings out the best in it's characters. Gabriel is a fantastic game character: a down-on-his-luck type but witty, resourceful and loved not by many but by a few, deeply. He is the classic white cotton t-shirt, jeans and leather jacket type (his bedroom wardrobe contains only MORE white t-shirts, which he jokes to the player about) and his typewriter gathers cobwebs while his waste paper basket is overflowing with failed novel-writing attempts - and just don't ask what's in his fridge! He has vivid and terrifying nightmares when he sleeps and heads straight for coffee when he wakes up, usually wearing the same clothes he wore the day before. He's a classic character in the sense that he is a guy who is lacking an identity/purpose and struggling to find it, reveling in disposable pleasures along the way (writing, women, his motorbike and lots of coffee) while he searches for meaning in his life. As he becomes entangled in the Voodoo Murders, he slowly discovers a sense of doing what is right which he didn't know he had.\n\nGabriel's relationships with Grace and Mosely are very important to the game too - the highlight of the game's opening interactions is the verbal sparring between Gabriel and Grace, which has exactly the right balance of genuine annoyance mixed with mutual enjoyment. But from the very beginning it is evident that they care deeply about each other - note that Grace continues to work in Gabriel's bookshop despite having been unpaid for three months. Their relationship is not overtly romantic or sexual (despite Gabriel's best efforts!) but more like Mulder and Scully: mutually beneficial personalities who come to realise their dependency on each other, but never speak about it! Gabriel and Mosely have a similar dependency but a more practical one: Mosely is in charge of the Voodoo Murders investigation and assists Gabriel wherever he can, while getting in as many insults as possible. There are many other character moments throughout the game's timespan, I hope I've given you a glimpse of how well it works.\n\nSo onto the gameplay and graphics. The game serves as a beautiful advert for the great city of New Orleans - vibrant, atmospheric and beautiful and with real locations such as Jackson Square and St. Louis Cemetery #1. It isn't just the locations, it's the way they are used: imaginatively. Sometimes the character's animations/movement seems to be very stiff and you wonder if some motion capture work would have helped, but it isn't a big issue. The interface is much improved from the original game, with a quick tutorial at the start which seems a little confusing at first but becomes second nature very quickly.\n\nThe gameplay is enjoyable for the most part, although some of the things that the game asks the player to do require very precise solutions - this is sometimes a big stumbling block to the game's enjoyment. The 20th Anniversary Edition acknowledges this with the addition of Gabriel's journal, which contains insights into his thoughts and hints on what to do next. The hints have levels: a Level 1 hint will give you a general idea, and a Level 2 hint a more detailed tip, and so on. It is a huge improvement over the original game in which all of Gabriel's interrogations were recorded on tapes. However, a few puzzles in the game can still frustrate and confuse, and it's easy to overlook something said by a character which seems irrelevant within all the dialogue yet becomes crucial later on. Another thing to mention is the game's cutscenes which are in the format of animated comic panels appearing one-by-one. They're really cool to watch, but unfortunately the voice acting doesn't always live up to the action, as mentioned before.\n\nSo how to sum up the Gabriel Knight: 20th Anniversary experience? \n\nIf you've played the original: this is an excellent remake and an essential purchase, preserving everything (except the original cast) and even adding to it with Gabriel's journal, bonus features and a few extra scenes, mechanics, puzzles and better pacing. Just don't get hung-up on the voices and you'll love it.\n\nIf you haven't played the original: they don't make 'em like this anymore - and you might be glad about that, but if you're chiefly interested in characters, relationships, storytelling, solving mysteries and leaving no stone unturned, I'm confident you'll enjoy your time in this classic adventure.\n\nWhat do you know about... voodoo?", "timestamp_created": 1512424506, "timestamp_updated": 1515427155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669571", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37898336": {"recommendationid": "37898336", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984416619", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511887026}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome remake.

So, since then I\u2019ve played it several times. It is like that pocket book you love so much that, even though you now know it by heart, you can\u2019t stop re-reading it and enjoy it as much as the first time.\n\nThe plot is set in New Orleans and the story revolves around some very strange murders and voodoo (\u266b\u2669You Do Something To Me \u266c\u266a). I always found that, for a 1993 game, the plot was unusual, and the story very well told as it goes along. I still do, for that matter.\n\nAs for the remake \u2013 because that\u2019s why I\u2019m writing this and NOT to reminisce the \u201cgood old days\u201d \u2013 there are some good things and some not so good.\n \nFor instance, because I own the game, I had the opportunity to play it by installing it directly on my PC and I had no technical issues with it. On Steam, or maybe my PC is faulty, Gabriel seems a little sticky \u2013 ex.: when opening the gate at the police station he stops, freezes, hiccups and THEN he opens the gate. \nThe other issue I\u2019ve noticed is when the narrator, or Gabriel, makes a comment on something and the game freezes for some seconds (I always expect to be kicked out to my desktop and I know very well what a seasoned point\u2019n\u2019clicker feels when something like this happens (I can feel it now ARGGHH)).\n\nPutting that aside and you have an exceptional game, wonderfully remastered.\n\nEverything is clearer (anti-pixel lovers this one is for you) and well defined; the characters are very well done (Gabriel looks more like the one described on the book (minus the curls) and YES I have the book \ud83d\ude0a); the voice-acting is very good and the resemblances to the original are uncanny, but I still prefer the original ones (call me daft if you want) - Tim Curry was exceptional.\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful. That piano sounds so nostalgic. I could feel it, even when I played it for the first time. \n\nFinally, for those who played the 1993 original game, there are some differences on how the story progresses: gramma appears much later in the game; new outdoor set at the police station and different solutions on 1 or 2 brain puzzlers\u2026\n\nOverall, I LIKED IT very much. So, I say, go for IT!\n\nPS: To this day, I\u2019m still waiting for GK4 :((\nPPS: I just realized that this review will not count for anything, viewing that the game was bought in Humble Bumdle and not from Steam.

This is when you can appreciate a remaster and this is how a remaster is supposed to be, not just a couple of texture and effects upgrade.\n\n[h1][i]INTRO. What is Gabriel Knight about?[/i][/h1]\nThis sweet remaster introduces Gabriel Knight, our nightmare hunted protagonist. As a famous writer in New Orleans always on the verge of being broke, Gabriel is following with strong interest a case called \"Voodoo Murders\" for his new book. The homicides seems to have some ritualistic traits that makes Gabriel think of some voodoo cult, but somehow the police and the press believe it's just a put-up job. Gabriel's investigation will reveal the exact opposite, together with many revelations and shocking plot twists.\n\n[h1][i]GRAPHIC. Engine And Artistic aspects.[/i][/h1]\nI can't hide my pleasure when I see this kind of remaster, especially considering the original pixellous version. Developed with Unity, it shows polished ambiences and 3d characters. You can't scream \"miracle\" of course, it's not a crytek product, but every ambient is very detailed and well drawn. \n\n[h1][i]SOUNDTRACK. Themes and Accompaniments.[/i][/h1]\nFaithful to the original, the soundtrack has been reworked. Most of it is made of accompaniment tracks, but there are various tracks that really are outstanding and memorable, such as the title track, St George's Library, Map and Final section. Simply loved them. Another special mention for voice acting, as I've appreciated all performances, but Gabriel's voice over all is what makes me laugh every time (in a good way, of course) because of his strong english accent and his dark yet mellow tone. Good choice even if it may sound a bit over the top.\n\n[h1][i]GAMEPLAY. How does it work?[/i][/h1]\nAs a remaster of a Point & click there's not much to explain: you point and click to do anything. And by anything I mean anything at all. The most usual aspects of this kind of game are all there, items to collect and use or analyze, combine, whatever. Check. Long rich, multiple choice dialogues. Check. Puzzles of all kind. Check. A special note goes for the cave section, where Gabriel goes full Indiana Jones action and you accomplish that always by pointing and clicking in the right place and time. Simply Great work.\n\n[h1][i]LAST NOTES. What doesn't work?[/i][/h1]\nNot much actually. Marvelous story, good remaster, great soundtrack and voice acting, classic point & click gameplay with good riddles and interesting sections.\nThe only thing I can think of is of a couple animation glitches, one when Gabriel sits on a chair and talk with a character, you end up a conversation subject thne he often gets up and sits down (in just a moment and unnaturally, of course). And another time, spoiler free, when Gabriel wakes up again in his bedroom after fainting his head starts rolling. And it's scary as hell as it keeps on rolling for the entire dialogue with Grace.\nYet this is the worst I can think of, so not much, actually.\n\n[h1][i]TL;DR. Pros And Cons[/i][/h1]\n[h1]+++PROs+++[/h1][list]\n[*][b] GABRIEL KNIGHT.[/b] A great adventure, with a good written story, full of conversations, lots of riddles and puzzles, some of them quite difficult.\n[*][b] GOOD REMASTER.[/b] A great and complete work under all aspects, graphic, soundtrack, voice acting.

years ago, playing the original game, and loving it, played it so much, and beat it as well, when I heard it was going to get overhauled into the 20th Anniversary Edition, I was excited, mainly because the original Gabriel Knight Sins of The Fathers is my favorite point and click adventure game, and this edition is just as good as that.\n\nI love how the music sounds, they touched the music up, but it still has the same overall feel of the original, and it helps that the same man that did the origina music, also did the music for this edition as well, his music is awesome.\n\nThe graphics are touched up and have a more 3d feel, but are still really good, I enjoyed the graphics for the game, but I did notice a couple of bugs that kinda took me away from the immersion slightly, there was one point in the game where Gabriel took his sketchbook out to sketch some markings at the crime scene, and when he put away the sketchbook after he was done, the sketchbook floated in the air for a few seconds, and noticed a few minor bugs pop up hear and there, but nothing that took away my immersion, but the second instance where i was taken out of the immersion and my mouth kinda dropped open in both shock and amusement, was there was one scene where Grace was walking Gabriel up, and they had a conversation after he woke up, and after the conversation was over and she was walking out of the room, Gabriel's head spun in circles a few times before finally stopping, these are the only real issues I really had in the game.\n\nNow, onto the voices, from what I've read, people have been complaining about the voices, because they prefer the original voices and still even now thing they should be added, but the problem is, from what the developer wrote in a notice is that the original voice recordings were lost and they tried to just strip them from the original game, which ended up with the quality being shoddy, and they couldn't get the original people back, because it's been 20 years, their voices have changed and it would probably cost a lot to get them at this point, with these actors being so busy now, so they went with a whole new cast, and honestly,  liked the new cast, they all did a really good job, or anyway that is what I think, people should give this game a break on the voice cast department, all you need to do is play a bit and get used to the voices, anyway, love the actors in this, they all did a great job.\n\nThey still do the graphic novel cut scenes which are really cool, and they have added some new stuff to the game that wasn't in the original, added new cut scenes, i think they also modified some of the areas that were in the original, not sure though, been a while since i played the original.\n\nOverall, the mechanics of the game have remained the same, you still talk, pick up, look, all of the normal stuff that point and click adventure games are known for, and they do it well, really enjoyed the controls, the only thing i do with is that when double clicking somewhere, Gabriel would run instead of teleporting, the teleporting kinda takes away from the immersion a bit, but it's not a huge deal or a game breaker, so i'm ok with it.\n\nAlso, if you like puzzles in Point and Click adventure games, then you'll be in heaven, this game has all of the old puzzles, and possibly a couple new ones, but not sure if any are new, possibly.\n\nOverall, this game has met and surpassed my expectations and in my opinion, it is as good, if not better than the original.\n\nThis has been my review of Gabriel Knight Sins of

The moody, detailed environments \u2013 one of the game's greatest strengths \u2013 truly shine in the re-release, enabling Jane Jensen's vision of the New Orleans locales to be fully realised. Robert Holmes' remastered soundtrack is more stirring than ever. Additionally, the rerecorded voices are strong and don't jar with my recollections of the characters \u2013 a concern when I discovered the excellent original voice cast (including Tim Curry, Leah Remini and Mark Hamill) wouldn't be returning. \n\nOtherwise, there have been slight refinements (such as a helpful new hint system) and additions (new puzzles and scenes), although nothing drastic. The game is, for the most part, faithful to the original, which can be seen as both a strength and a weakness.\n\nAlthough not groundbreaking, the intriguing and well-paced storyline still holds its own, and the in-depth conversations that can be held with characters \u2013 even those who appear only briefly \u2013 constitute a valuable world-building feature sadly lacking in most games today. \n\nA replay does, however, expose some of the more convoluted and unnatural puzzles (e.g.[spoiler]awkwardly luring a mime to a police officer to distract him while you use his radio[/spoiler]). Also, the fact that, while necessary, Grace's supporting role doesn't really develop beyond this has become more disappointingly apparent to me over the years. Particularly frustratingly, I experienced a few noticeable bugs, including a quite devastating one that affected the audio, resulting in dialogue overlapping and becoming barely comprehensible if I tried to skip text once I'd finished reading it (although this may have since been addressed).  \n\nNevertheless, the 20th Anniversary Edition is a more than welcome return to Jane Jensen's voodoo murder-mystery classic and hopefully not the last we've seen of Gabriel Knight.\n\n[i] For more video game reviews and posts, please check out my blog at [url] https://inkysquiggles.blogspot.com/[/url].

At the time the first game came out, it was pretty much an instant classic. Jane Jensen did an incredible amount of research to put together a very intriguing story using real locations. Not only that, but somehow Sierra was able to assemble an all-star voice-acting cast for the game. \n\nSo how does this remake compare to the original? I would suggest overall very favorably. The story and locations haven't changed at all... for those that played the original and remember, this remake is completely loyal in this regard. What has changed? Basically this game has gone through a graphics overhaul to bring it on par with current point-and-click adventures. In other words, cleaner and sharper graphics. Some very minor changes and additions have been made, but nothing that detracts from the story in any way. An example of this is the addition of an alley behind the police station. If anything, these changes help to improve the atmosphere of the game. \n\nThis of course brings about the big question about the voice acting. I suspect the main reason why the original work didn't carry over was due to licensing and royalty issues. Instead the developers recast the script with voice-actors from the gaming industry. From comments that I have seen, for many purists this has been an issue.

I used to make my parents rent this from the video store (back then you could rent PC games). Anyway, I really loved the original Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father.

I was super excited that it was going to be remade, and lo and behold, it was JUST like the original. I mean, everything played exactly the same. (Of course it's not completely the same without the big name voice actors the original had - but the new cast does a solid job for the limited budget this remade had.) I still recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good point and click adventure. The story is really good, and the characters grow on you in a big way. If you played the original - you might want to grab this just for a walk down memory lane - but there isn't really anything new story-wise. I got 100 percent completion 20 years later from memorizing the same exact game.

You play as Gabriel Knight, a sometimes successful, sometimes creepy, playboy and author.  You haven't sold a book in like, forever, but that doesn't stop you from owning a book shop in downtown New Orleans and employing Grace, your assistant who helps you with writing and managing your shop.  She also stays even though you can't pay her- and despite your *constant* creepy advances.  Currently you are working on a new book involving voodoo and it just so happens there has been a string of \"Voodoo Murders\" in the Crescent city.  You happen to be buds with one of the detectives on the case and ask him if you might look around....for the story, of course...  \n\nI'm not normally drawn to these kinds of game, the point and click genre, but between Alpha Polaris and Gabriel Knight, I'm hooked and looking for more.  Also you get to learn about voodoo.  Who do?  You do.  Do what?  Learn about the voodoo.\n\nPros: This game intrigued me and sat on my wishlist for nearly a year before I got it cheap on a sale.  At first the game seemed a little slow figuring out the interface and the controls, and the story seemed wanting in the beginning, but when the wheels start turning, they start turning good and fast.  The story hooked me and though the ending was a little \"meh\", I felt overall joyed by this game.  The art and visuals were appealing, and the voice acting was actually good, despite me initially hating Gabriel's accent - I've grown to like it now.  \n\n\nCons: Plotwise, I did have to check the internet every so often for clues on what to do next to keep the story progressing. And not innocent clues like \"the key you need to unlock the door is on the shelf next to it, you silly!\" but more of \"You need to pull the lever in the basement to open the secret panel on the wall in the dining room to access the hidden keypad where you dial 39A90 to open the garage door so you can get the rock to smash the kitchen window to scare the bird so it drops the key.  But you have to talk to Paul first so he can tell you the code, and if you don't talk to him the code won't work.\"  There were at least three instances of this where there was no indication as what to do next.

You need gabriel to go to on side of a room to get... a pair of scissors. he will crawl there, take the scissors, say something and then, there's a pause.\nIts a couple of seconds in which the character stays still, you cant control it, or order any actions and you just have to wait for it to pass.

The expectations for the remake were therefore big. Did it succeed in achieving glory this time too? In my opinion yes. :) \nGraphics don't make a game. We experienced gamers have had ample proof of that. So what is it, that this Gabriel Knight remake has which makes it so special? Charisma! And more importantly, a very good and well written story, that hasn\u2019t lost the magic even after 20 years!\n\nWhat did I like?\n+ The story \n+ The characters \n+ The world \n+ The point & click\n+ The humor\n+ The voice acting\n+ The puzzles\n\nWhat did I dislike?\n- The blood\n- The mutilated animals\n- The difficulty of some puzzles\n- The short length\n- The linear story\n\nIf you haven't played the original game, or any of the Gabriel Knight series (perhaps because you were too young...) you\u2019ll find in this modern version the right mix of adventure, action, plot, interesting characters, and pretty looking pictures that might just make you fall in love (again) with point & click games. Don\u2019t forget the horror, violence, blood, murder, snakes and mutilated bodies of people and animal alike.\nYes, Gabriel Knight is not for the kiddies, that much is sure. Please also keep in mind that the main subject of the game is voodoo. If this is a theme that makes you uncomfortable or that you simply don\u2019t like, look elsewhere for your adventure. ^^\n\nFirst thing that strikes me in the game, after the \u2018fiery\u2019 introduction, is the southern accent, yes you heard right. That drawl *giggles* NCIS New Orleans for the Win! :D\nApparently it is particularly effective on the ladies lol but I must say Gabriel\u2019s male charm leaves me quite unmoved. But I guess it\u2019s one of the reasons I like him, he makes me laugh :) that and his \u2018relationship\u2019 with Grace Nakimura! \n\nIf you ever wanted to know about New Orleans (insert the proper accent here) this is the game for you! I loved getting to know so much history and culture about it, even if only through a specific angle. :D For that alone this is an unique game. ^^ \n\nThe game focuses of course on the resolution of puzzles and a LOT of talking to NPCs. Both present their challenges. The puzzles can\u2019t be simple nor too easy and thankfully aren\u2019t, even if  the game is logical in how to get from A to B, however, it won\u2019t provide any help on how to do so, it makes certain tasks rather frustrating at times. \nThe game system will, however, give you hints on all pertinent things to do as well as force you to stay on the same day until you have accomplished them.  \n\nIf you are in the habit of playing mystery or detective games or even just RPG games you\u2019ll find that the story isn\u2019t exactly challenging, it\u2019s not full of twists and surprises, but the trip will still be worth it, at least it was in my book. :)\n\nI guess this game just touched a nostalgic chord in me, which accounts for my good opinion of it and made me want to play all Gabriel Knight games again. :P (which I shall hopefully be doing).\n\nAll things said, this game is worth trying or replaying! :) If only to help make possible other remakes of this successful series :D If Gabriel Knight can\u2019t charm you then you must be cold blooded like a snake. Get it? :P No? Play the game please. XD\n\nPlease keep in mind this is only my personal opinion.\n\nKind regards,\nKeiyan", "timestamp_created": 1482095727, "timestamp_updated": 1482096385, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28336081": {"recommendationid": "28336081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267474601", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481592356}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Obra maestra atemporal.", "timestamp_created": 1481592423, "timestamp_updated": 1481592423, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513333", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28229201": {"recommendationid": "28229201", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029457604", "num_games_owned": 494, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481651766}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a JEWEL.

Even the voice cast of some of the minor characters is worth mentioning (like Jim Cummings). The new voice cast is okay, but nowhere near the level of that of the original game.\n\n[b]The ugly[/b]\n- Many glitched animations. \nOn several occasions I've seen Gabriels upper torso or head spinning around in a way that reminded me of the Exorcist. At several occasions seated characters are suddenly (partly) standing up before continuing their conversation. The butler of Malia Gedde can be seen briefly standing before the door each time he has closed it. And at one time I was looking out of the window in Mosely's office and clicked on the door to leave the room. Only to see Gabriel standing up from an invisible chair (without sitting down first), moon-walking to the door and spinning once round his axis before leaving the room. It never interfered with the game but these glitches should've been removed before release.\n- Musicians in the park\nAnother thing that bothered me were the guys playing the banjo and electric guitar in the park. Neither of them is using a shoulder strap. I know from experience it's impossible to play either a classic guitar or a electric guitar while standing up without one and I think it's safe to assume that's also true for playing a banjo. Even worse the electric guitar IS NOT PLUGGED INTO AN AMPLIFIER!. An electric guitar that's not plugged in will make less noise than one of those cheap plastic kid guitars. Someone should have noticed this and replaced it with an acoustic guitar. \n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nIt's worth buying, especially when it's on sale. But it's got some issues that I think you should be aware of.

The Gabriel Knight series was one that I missed completely, which makes me doubly thankful for remake efforts such as this. Through a fresh layer of polish, it's very clear to see why Gabriel and his cohorts were so widely acclaimed in the genre. However, it's also clear that this remake might not be the best way to experience the series.\n\nGabriel Knight, if you've never met him, is a bookseller and aspiring novelist in the French Quarter of New Orleans. He's a listless Lothario, a fact that his charming assistant Grace and punchy police pal Mosely are not hesitant to harp on. Despite his appearances he soon becomes entangled in a murder investigation that leads into the darkest corners of New Orleans, where voodoo and ancient curses hold sway. There's an interesting mix of historical and kitschy voodoo to delve into, which helps give the game a more grounded feel even when things start getting crazy.\n\nUnraveling this mystery is done in the grand old tradition of classic point-and-click adventures. You can travel by map to a number of hotspots around the city, each with features to examine, items to pocket, and colorful characters to question. It's important to note, though, that this being a traditional adventure means there's some antiquated design to contend with. Puzzles are logical and items have real-world uses, for the most part, but identifying exactly where or when to do something isn't always clear. In fact there are more than a few points where you'll find yourself wandering aimlessly because you need to stumble across an unforeseen event to progress. The remake does try to punch up the gameplay past traditional pace, though. There's not a lot of clutter in these scenes so important elements are usually easy to pick out, and dialog options that move the plot forward are highlighted for uncultured knuckle-draggers who don't want to bask in the game's fully-voiced dialog.\n\nI'll be honest, I wasn't sold on the voice acting at first. It's a big deal for Gabriel Knight; even without playing any of the originals myself I was aware that the cast was remarkable. Whereas OG Gabriel was voiced by Tim Curry, remake Gabriel is someone I've never heard of, who effects a ridiculously thick Louisiana accent for every line. But it wasn't long before he and the rest of the cast grew on me, assisted by the excellent script. Grace gets some vicious burns on Gabe throughout the game, Mosely pals around like a dopey high-schooler, and even some of the minor characters like Hartridge get incredibly memorable lines.\n\nBetween the entertaining dialog and the gripping story that steadily builds in intensity, there's plenty of reason to work your way through the old-school puzzles. However, the remake is marred in a few ways that sometimes make it feel like a step even further back. The 3D models for characters are attractive but suffer from stiff animations, making them look more like Sims than people. You'll also spot a number of glaring (and sometimes hilarious) bugs like heads spinning like tops and torsos contorting wildly. In dialogue both parties get animated portraits that are detailed, but move like rigged portraits... the effect is a little creepy and reminds me of the Begun of Tigtone, if you've seen that. You can skip dialogue by clicking but sometimes it only drops the voices, and continues animating silently. And if all that wasn't enough, the thing has crashed on me a few times during long play sessions.\n\nThe bottom line is that Gabriel Knight - Sins of the Fathers is an excellent game that isn't particularly well-served by this remake. And it isn't in the ways you might expect, because the new voiceovers are great in their own way and the modern amenities really do help with the pacing. No, it's just a technically weak product, beset by rough animations, visual glitches galore, and general instability. You absolutely should experience the game for its story, its moments of horror, and its contributions to the adventure genre. But as long as you're not put off by pixel art and slower pacing, you might just be better off with the original.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

Se voc\u00ea j\u00e1 o fez e quer saber se vale a pena rever a experi\u00eancia nesta nova vers\u00e3o, as principais mudan\u00e7as envolvem tanto o visual repaginado quanto a mudan\u00e7a do voice casting, trilha sonora atualizada, acr\u00e9scimo de um sistema de dicas, checkpoints e um di\u00e1rio com informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o desenvolvimento do jogo. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m mudan\u00e7as menores em alguns di\u00e1logos e, segundo o que li, talvez de um puzzle ou outro. O resto est\u00e1 essencialmente fiel ao t\u00edtulo original, lan\u00e7ado em 1993.\n\nGabriel Knight, este personagem t\u00e3o importante, \u00e9 dono de uma modesta loja de livros raros, um metido a gostos\u00e3o de fala pegajosa e um escritor \u00e0 beira da fal\u00eancia. J\u00e1 tem uma semana desde que ele passou a ter o mesmo pesadelo de novo e de novo, envolvendo uma mulher condenada \u00e0 fogueira se transformando em leopardo, al\u00e9m de cobras mortais e um talism\u00e3. Paralelamente, Gabriel tem nutrido um fasc\u00ednio quase obsessivo por vodu e seus aspectos hist\u00f3ricos; tudo em nome de seu mais novo romance em andamento.\n\nA partir da\u00ed, \u00e9 com a ajuda de sua assistente Grace e do policial Mosely que come\u00e7a sua investiga\u00e7\u00e3o quase inocente de certos assassinatos em Nova Orleans \u2014 associados aos praticantes da religi\u00e3o \u2014 que ele se v\u00ea mergulhando, cada vez mais, em situa\u00e7\u00f5es bizarras\u2026 incluindo um punhado de mortes inexplic\u00e1veis e repentinas. H\u00e1 at\u00e9 mesmo desdobramentos sobre a hist\u00f3ria meio obscura de seus antepassados e como isso ecoa \u00e0 sua situa\u00e7\u00e3o atual, al\u00e9m de dar algumas explica\u00e7\u00f5es sobre seus insistentes pesadelos. Para ajudar mais ainda, o escritor mulherengo se v\u00ea absolutamente fascinado por Malia Gedde, uma rica socialite de vida discreta e tamb\u00e9m uma pe\u00e7a fundamental para o que h\u00e1 de ocorrer.\n\nUma das caracter\u00edsticas mais fortes do jogo \u00e9 o trabalho soberbo de Jane Jensen, escritora e game designer do t\u00edtulo original, especialmente no que tange \u00e0 densa pesquisa hist\u00f3rica e geogr\u00e1fica sobre o vodu; seja suas respectivas origens, seja a forma fascinante com que fora adaptado na principal cidade de Louisiana, a qual recebeu diversas influ\u00eancias religiosas diferentes. Soma-se a isso todo o qu\u00ea de mist\u00e9rio que permeia a maior parte do jogo, al\u00e9m de ocasionais momentos ligeiramente inquietantes. Destaque para seu brilhantismo ao dosar momentos s\u00e9rios com ocasi\u00f5es hil\u00e1rias; imagine Gabriel dando conselhos feito padre em um confession\u00e1rio\u2026\n\nSeguindo uma abordagem que n\u00e3o lembro de ter visto em outros adventures, nosso progresso \u00e9 dividido em dias, os quais cada um determina o que voc\u00ea pode e deve fazer para avan\u00e7ar no enredo. Todas as manh\u00e3s recebemos um jornal, que podemos ler ou n\u00e3o, amarrando os acontecimentos do dia anterior e dando algumas ideias sobre os objetivos seguintes \u2014 tal como a propaganda de um joalheiro ou a comemora\u00e7\u00e3o da V\u00e9spera de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o. E com direito a um hor\u00f3scopo, sempre prevendo o pior.\n\nAssim como na \u00e9poca do seu lan\u00e7amento original, o jogo se passa nos anos 90, fazendo com que as investiga\u00e7\u00f5es sempre sejam baseadas em livros e outros documentos de papel. A jogabilidade \u00e9 t\u00e3o tradicional quanto, envolvendo an\u00e1lise e combina\u00e7\u00e3o de itens e puzzles que, embora razoavelmente l\u00f3gicos, n\u00e3o raro podem se tornar frustrantes \u2014 seja pelo n\u00edvel de complexidade, seja por exigir que voc\u00ea lembre de informa\u00e7\u00f5es espec\u00edficas vindo de certas cutscenes. Existe um sistema de dicas em n\u00edveis, que \u00e0 princ\u00edpio te d\u00e1 uma s\u00e9rie de perguntas relacionadas ao que voc\u00ea deve resolver naquele dia, para s\u00f3 depois oferecer instru\u00e7\u00f5es mais espec\u00edficas \u2014 mais ou menos como em Stacking. Ainda assim, dependendo de sua experi\u00eancia com o g\u00eanero, ele n\u00e3o te isenta de uma poss\u00edvel vontade de olhar walkthrough :p.\n\nDe seus pontos fracos, a parte t\u00e9cnica \u00e9 uma das maiores. Apesar do remake j\u00e1 ter recebido uma penca de atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es, o que n\u00e3o falta s\u00e3o alguns bugs que raramente atrapalham no processo, mas podem ser meio chatinhos. Como nas vezes em que pulei algum di\u00e1logo e o personagem continuou mexendo a boca at\u00e9 o final, ou as anima\u00e7\u00f5es meio truncadas que d\u00e3o uma zoada quando algu\u00e9m vai se sentar. Ou ainda, num momento engra\u00e7ad\u00edssimo no qual Gabriel fica girando a cabe\u00e7a a 360 graus por alguns bons segundos.\n\nOutro ponto: as cutscenes. Assim como no original, temos eventuais cenas animadas que se apresentam como p\u00e1ginas de uma HQ, necess\u00e1rias para ilustrar momentos importantes \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria. Pena que elas \u00e0s vezes parecem mal pintadas, como se as tivessem feito \u00e0s pressas, mas d\u00e1 pra relevar. Por \u00faltimo, temos uma narradora, respons\u00e1vel por ler textos descritivos sempre que voc\u00ea interage com alguma coisa e quando l\u00ea algum texto. Trata-se de uma heran\u00e7a do jogo de 1993 com pouca justificativa pra ainda existir porque, dessa vez, h\u00e1 telas pr\u00f3prias para mostrar os detalhes do que estamos analisando (como a p\u00e1gina de capa do jornal). Felizmente, d\u00e1 pra desativar a voz dela, o que me veio bastante a calhar por n\u00e3o gostar do voice acting atual; achei mais agrad\u00e1vel ouvi-la em sua vers\u00e3o anterior.\n\nA despeito das falhas, recomendo muito jogar Gabriel Knight. Minha experi\u00eancia foi t\u00e3o gratificante que, ap\u00f3s zer\u00e1-lo pela primeira vez, continuei lembrando do jogo de tempos em tempos, o que me motivou a revisit\u00e1-lo e resenh\u00e1-lo por aqui. Se voc\u00ea aprecia uma fic\u00e7\u00e3o de qualidade com personagens memor\u00e1veis e cheios de personalidade em uma hist\u00f3ria adulta e religiosa, digna de um bom livro, d\u00ea uma chance.", "timestamp_created": 1476713644, "timestamp_updated": 1476713886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601449", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25989488": {"recommendationid": "25989488", "author": {"steamid": "76561198257309408", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458670669}, "language": "spanish", "review": "En su momento, este juego fue \"uno de esos juegos\".

Gabriel Knight: Sins of the fathers was the first adventure from Gabriel (the Shadowhunter) in 1993 and the first game created by Jane Jensen.\nAt the time it was a fantastic game, it was one of the first games to include a dark subject, not exactly suited for kids, not because of the violence or blood (that was something that other games always had) but also because of the dark, dramatic, almost ghotic nature of the main story and characters. Something different at the time (and still to this day) was the research that jane did for these games, mixing historical facts, real places,  with of course a good dose of fiction to create her own story, and not just an historical retelling. It was always fun (and amazing) to go looking for these places after finishing the game, and see how much of the real world was put into the story. For me the most amazing story of all that jane had created was the one for Gabriel Knight: the Beast within, the second game, about the legend of king Ludwig II and Richard Wagner.\n\nThis game, Sins of the fathers, was the first story of the series, and has all the great elements that were expanded in the later adventures of Gabriel. The 20th anniversary edition keeps this story , but at the same time tries to update the game engine, the graphics, sound and even some gameplay elements to make it more accesible to the current generation of gamers...\n\nThis is one review where i'm having a difficult time with the steam system for reviews...you can't always either recommend or don't recommend a game...there are gray areas...and to recommend a game is not the same as liking a game...\n\nIn this case, for Gabriel Knight, i will say that i like the game, meaning, i like the original game back when i played it 20 years ago and what it meant to me and to players at the time it camed out... That same game (the story) is still here in this 20th anniversary ed, and i'm glad i have a version compatible with current systems and accesible online (installing the old CD version is a pain...) \nBut...aside from that, to be honest this new version is... while it looks better than the original that camed out in 1993 (of course!)...the one from 1993 was more polished and had greater graphics and sound (for that time) and this version from 2014 actually has worst graphics (for a 2014 game). So the problem here is that, what the creators of the game tried to do was (i think) do a new version with updates that make it more appealing to \"current generation\" of gamers but at the same time not changing too much and keep enough things to still make it appealing to the \"old generation\" of gamers that played the game in 1993...and the result is one game that it's not really appealing to either one of them... \n\nThe graphics for this version are updated of course, they are better than 1993, but they are pretty bad for a 2014 game, and even though they are noticeable improved from the previous game of the company (Moebius) they still have several problems: the animation itself is low quality, badly animated and there are bugs like the spinning head problem (where a character in game starts spinning the head like a possesed doll) and it happens all the time, also the characters appears and dissappear when closing a door or leaving a room..the backgrounds for the game are nice...and just that, but they are far from scary or moody or anything, they simply are sterile.... The characters closeup portraits are fare better in comparison, but honestly the 2014 Gabriel version... (the most important character) seems more like a teens pop star than a shadow hunter. His hair still has that 1990s volume that was so common back in the day... but now by today standards it just seems wrong (and funny!)... that's precisely one of the things that has to be changed in 2014 if you want your character to be taken seriously...\nthe dialogues....and the voice actors...the dialogues are too much for a 2014 game....meaning too much lines of everything...yeah...for me it was interesting to have all (or most) of the original dialogues...as a collection curiosity...but for 2014 is overkill, (even if the important dialogues are being colored in yellow) the world has changed, people has shorter attention span, and also the way stories are presented today has changed...it's not worst, it's just different, you can still put a big story like the one from Gabriel Knight in 2014, you just have to make some changes to make the thing work...it's not about caring or not caring for the original game, it is about making something that has better flow of narrative, (and again, you are trying to make a new game that will appeal to current gamers) \n\nAbout the new voice casting, they are doing a fine job at that...but it's not at the level of the original cast of 1993 with Tim curry, Mark Hamill and Leah Remini. Of course it would be impossible to get the original actors for different reasons (too expensive!) and also the low quality recordings (as for using the original material) so it's no surprise there but that's one thing you have to consider if trying to redo the original game...\n\nThe only \"updated\" element that i think is actually better on this version, is the music, wich is done almost all over again by the original composer/producer of the game, Robert Holmes, and it is great, even if it just sticks to the original themes, it does show and advantage over the old version and it sounds great.\n\nSo my review for Gabriel Knight is that, [b]i like the game[/b], because of the original one that i played in the 90s, the story is still there, [b]but i don't recommend the game[/b] because i don't see this being interesting in 2014. \n\nThe problem is if you are going to do a new version of an old game...you have to make it attractive for 2014... and make all the necessary changes...yeah...the fans are gonna be mad...well, this is not for the fans, a new version is for the new players.\nAs it is, this version is only appealing to the original players of the series, like myself, but no so much to current generation. If you are doing it for the original players of the game only, then just make minimal changes, update only the things that can be updated without changing the core of the original, the things that make the game be what it is (like the Another World 20th anniversary ed wich is nice) and be clear that you are making a product that its more an historical piece of gaming than a \"new game\" wich it isn't.\n\nI know by now many people that love the game must hate me, but i will say that, there's no point in redoing and old game from another era if there's no possibility of doing it right... The translation from 1993 to 2014 in this case, and for different technical/artistic reasons had many elements lost in the process (or changed for worst), and i very much prefer to see a new game by jane jensen and a new story than a 20th anniversary edition....\nN/A", "timestamp_created": 1468542611, "timestamp_updated": 1480048028, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24319396": {"recommendationid": "24319396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068556208", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 797, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468436237}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041d\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0443, \u043f\u043e\u0436\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0439, \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u0412 \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430, \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0441 \u0447\u0435\u043c, \u043d\u043e \u043e\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u0442\u044c, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0435: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e, \u0437\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0434\u043a\u0438, \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0443 -

I sucked at both, and don't recall I ever completed either, or even got pass the first or second rooms! By the time I got my first PC I'd missed most of the golden age of point and click adventures and didn't really buy any until a few years back when GoG first got started. Since then I've bought and played quite a few, but this is the first \"remastered\" game I've played.\n\nGabriel Knight is a pretty ace game. I think I'll have to buy the originals from GoG so that I can check out the second and third games as they (currently) don't have a remastered version. It will also be interesting to see how the original voice cast works (Michael Dorn is always a favorite of mine). It will also be interesting to see the old graphics - the Anniversary Edition content doesn't really show much, bar some very very low res images of the different locations.\n\nAs for the remake. Well. At first I thought I was going to hate the game as I didn't like Gabriel's voice at all. Fortunately that passed and I got used to it. I thought the voice acting was well done, and the audio overall fit nicely.\n\nGraphically, the game is pleasing, often with photorealistic textures and subtle animations. But at the same time, the 3D feel of the game is decidely \"off\". Scenes look flat with 3D characters just plonked on top. Hard to describe but readily visible. Mind you, it didn't detract too much from the game, and the fact that the backgrounds were more subtly coloured than interactive objects meant that it was easier to see things to pick up etc, without the asinine \"glow\" effects that modern games have embraced. The comic book style cut scenes were nice too.\n\nThe story was pretty cool and kept me interested all the way through.\n\nThere were some minor bugs though, for example at once point my journal got updated with an entry. Fair enough you might think, the journal updates as you progress through the game. Unfortunately it updated with an entry which had nothing to do with the puzzle I'd just solved, but instead with a piece of information that was a bit of a spoiler for part of the game I'd yet to do. Slightly annoying, but nothing too serious. More humourous were the occasions where the characters perhaps thought they were Beetlejuice, and their heads would rapidly spin around. Happened a few times and got a good chuckle each time.\n\nSome of these adventure games are hit and miss with me, and are either incredibly easy, or so difficult I just end up following the script from a walkthrough. GK was inbetween this, I did have to revert to a walkthrough two or three times (although it has a built in hint system I never activated it), but on the whole the game was logical (albient occasionally bizzare in said logic) and not to taxing on the old noggin.\n\nFinal game score 360/362... dammit Jim!", "timestamp_created": 1467750430, "timestamp_updated": 1467750610, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24097352": {"recommendationid": "24097352", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975221620", "num_games_owned": 518, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467679683}, "language": "english", "review": "Too many hard and pointless puzzles.

I jak najbardziej zas\u0142ugiwa\u0142a na wsp\u00f3\u0142czesny remake.\n\nLucasArts pokaza\u0142 jak to si\u0119 powinno robi\u0107. Remaki pierwszych dw\u00f3ch Monkey Island, Grim Fandango (cho\u0107 to nieco inny przypadek) czy ostatnio wydane Day of the Tentacle to majstersztyki takiej roboty. Same gry zosta\u0142y nieruszone, grafik\u0119 narysowano na nowo, dzi\u0119ki czemu urzeka bogactwem barw i wysok\u0105 rozdzielczo\u015bci\u0105, a jak kto\u015b jest nostalgicznym freakiem, to jednym klawiszem mo\u017ce si\u0119 cofn\u0105\u0107 do rozpikselowanych koszmark\u00f3w. Gdyby Gabriel Knighta odnowi\u0107 w ten spos\u00f3b - nie mia\u0142bym uwag. Ale \u017ce postanowiono zrobi\u0107 go praktycznie od nowa...\n\nPierwsz\u0105 rzecz\u0105, kt\u00f3ra od pocz\u0105tku wzbudza\u0142a moje w\u0105tpliwo\u015bci, by\u0142a decyzja o przeniesieniu rozgrywki w - nazwjimy to - dwuip\u00f3\u0142-wymiar. O ile r\u0119cznie rysowane t\u0142a s\u0105 w wi\u0119kszo\u015bci bardzo \u0142adne, a nieraz nawet pi\u0119kne, tak postaci... No silnik Unity to nie jest mistrzostwo \u015bwiata. Szczeg\u00f3lnie podczas dialog\u00f3w zdarza si\u0119, \u017ce ich buziuchny wygl\u0105daj\u0105 sztucznie, nieraz te\u017c wyra\u017anie odbiegaj\u0105 od orygina\u0142\u00f3w. By\u0142oby to jeszcze do strawienia, gdyby nie decyzja o nagraniu nowych g\u0142os\u00f3w. I tutaj niestety przymkn\u0105\u0107 ucha nie mog\u0119 - szczeg\u00f3lnie nowy Gabriel kompletnie mnie nie przekonuje. Zawsze b\u0119d\u0119 go kojarzy\u0142 z Timem Currym, a nowy, g\u0142\u0119boki g\u0142os zmienia r\u00f3wnie\u017c nasz odbi\u00f3r tej postaci. Pod koniec gry by\u0142em ju\u017c przyzwyczajony, ale przez pierwsze chwile my\u015bla\u0142em, \u017ce tej zmiany nie wytrzymam.\n\nNiestety, technicznie te\u017c jest mocno tak sobie. Osobi\u015bcie mam na przyk\u0142ad brzydki nawyk przeklikiwania dialog\u00f3w we w\u0142asnym tempie, zanim aktor sko\u0144czy czyta\u0107 dan\u0105 kwesti\u0119. W remaku Gabriel Knighta mia\u0142em przez to non-stop problemy: a to znika\u0142y podpisy i d\u017awi\u0119k, ale posta\u0107 nadal \"kiwa\u0142a si\u0119\" a\u017c do ko\u0144ca swojej uci\u0119tej wypowiedzi, a to ca\u0142y dialog nagle przyspiesza\u0142 i omija\u0142 zamiast jednej linijki, nast\u0119pn\u0105 albo i wi\u0119cej. Postaci czasem maj\u0105 jakie\u015b problemy ze swoimi skryptami: kilka razy kto\u015b wstawa\u0142 tylko po to, by za chwil\u0119 zn\u00f3w usi\u0105\u015b\u0107 albo przechodzi\u0142 przez jakie\u015b tekstury. Niestety, sprawia to wra\u017cenie p\u00f3\u0142amatorszczyzny, a nie profesjonalnego odnowienia jednego z najwi\u0119kszych hit\u00f3w \u00f3wczesnego najwi\u0119kszego producenta gier komputerowych.\n\n\u017beby nie by\u0142o, \u017ce to jaka\u015b totalna kicha... Bardzo podoba\u0142a mi si\u0119 opcja dodatk\u00f3w umieszczanych w ka\u017cdej lokacji: w specjalnej zak\u0142adce mo\u017cna znale\u017a\u0107 zwi\u0105zane z ni\u0105 szkice, wspomnienia tw\u00f3rc\u00f3w i inne making ofy. Zawsze si\u0119 te\u017c znajdzie screenshot z pierwowzoru - ma\u0142a pociecha po braku prze\u0142\u0105czania mi\u0119dzy wersj\u0105 klasyczn\u0105 a odnowion\u0105. Rozumiem jednak, \u017ce w tym wypadku nie by\u0142o mowy o takim rozwi\u0105zaniu, bo jednak co nieco tutaj pozmieniano, na czele z dodatkowymi \u0142amig\u0142\u00f3wkami (bardzo sympatyczne) czy scen\u0105 w Afryce, kt\u00f3ra w nowym wydaniu... Powiedzmy, \u017ce zyska\u0142a zupe\u0142nie nowy wymiar. Nagrana na nowo \u015bcie\u017cka d\u017awi\u0119kowa Roberta Holmesa to r\u00f3wnie\u017c niew\u0105tpliwy atut.\n\nDla nowych graczy do absolutny mus: Gabriel Knight to obowi\u0105zkowa lektura wirtualnej rozrywki i ka\u017cda mo\u017cliwo\u015b\u0107, by j\u0105 komu\u015b przypomnie\u0107 b\u0105d\u017a przedstawi\u0107 po raz pierwszy zas\u0142uguje na pochwa\u0142\u0119. W takiej szacie graficznej (i z achievementami) p\u00f3jdzie to zdecydowanie pro\u015bciej, bo jednak klasyczna jedynka wi\u0119kszo\u015b\u0107 ludzi by dzi\u015b odrzuci\u0142a. Jako jej fanatyk, kt\u00f3r\u0105 wci\u0105\u017c doskonale pami\u0119tam, te\u017c ca\u0142kiem sympatycznie sp\u0119dzi\u0142em weekend w Nowym Orleanie. Pozostaje jednak niedosyt i wra\u017cenie, \u017ce mo\u017cna by\u0142o to zrobi\u0107 zdecydowanie lepiej...\n\nMam nadziej\u0119, \u017ce zamiast na si\u0142\u0119 odnawia\u0107 dw\u00f3jk\u0119 i tr\u00f3jk\u0119 (nawet nie wiem, jak by to mia\u0142o wygl\u0105da\u0107), Jane Jensen przedstawi nam jeszcze zupe\u0142nie now\u0105 przygod\u0119 Gabriela.

One of my favorite games of the 90s and definitely one of Sierra's best games. \n\nGabriel Knight is a novelist and owner of St. George's Rare Books in New Orleans. He's in the middle of writing a new book about the recent string of Voodoo related murders. The writer, Jane Jensen of Sierra fame, did a particularly good job of representing the city of New Orleans and it's vibrant history, and the story itself still holds up well after 20+ years.\n\nIt was a little disappointing that they couldn't get Tim Curry to reprise his role as the voice of Gabriel, but I'm sure he was a little too expensive for Pinkerton Road to even consider, let alone the likes of Mark Hamill and Michael Dorn. The actor they got to voice Gabriel in the remake did a commendable job and kept the original style of southern charmer and womanizer, and a few chuckles can be found by using the hand and eye icons on most of the female characters in the game. \n\nWhile the 3D rendering of the remake brings new life to the game(and it is beautiful), it's a little disappointing to an old school gamer like myself. See, back in the day, adventure games were much more complex and unforgiving. The high resolution textures take the challenge away of having to find a tiny object in the sea of 256 color pixelation of the original. \n\nThe puzzles are challenging and require that you pay attention to the information you're gathering from extensive conversations with the various characters in the game. You can't just fumble through this one. if you try, you'll likely be backtracking often or finding yourself using a walkthrough (anyone else remember old Sierra hint books?) in later parts of the game. Fortunately for me, I played through this game several times and actually remembered much of what was required to have the game move forward. \n\nIf you want to see where the great adventure games of today got their inspiration from, buy this game and support Jane Jensen's new operation. Then maybe one day the Sierra of old shall return. Nah...scratch that. Just stay small and independent and avoid those buyouts so you can continue to breath new life into the genre.\n\nNow Steam just needs to release Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within, but not a remake.

Dieses ist die Neuauflage des ersten Teils von einer davon - das Spiel, welches Jane Jensen ber\u00fchmt gemacht hat: Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers in der HD-Jubil\u00e4ums-Ausgabe \"20th Anniversary Edition\" aus dem Jahr 2014. Kann sie dem Original das Wasser reichen? Die Antwort versuche ich mit meiner m\u00f6glichst spoilerfreien Auflistung der positiven und auch der leider vorhandenen negativen Aspekte, insbsondere auch im Vergleich zum Original, des Spiels zu geben.  \n\n[b]Positiv:[/b][list]\n\n[*]Eine gut durchdachte mysteri\u00f6se Story rund um Voodoo, Mord und alte Familiengeheimnisse \n[*]Gut ausgearbeitete, glaubw\u00fcrdige Charaktere\n[*]Meist logische R\u00e4tsel ohne try and error (vergessen wir mal die Uhr auf dem Dachboden, wo die L\u00f6sung doch schon sehr weit hergeholt ist...)\n[*]sehr h\u00fcbsch gezeichnete, hochaufl\u00f6sende 2D-Hintergr\u00fcnde und zwar eher zweckm\u00e4\u00dfig animierte, aber gut aussehende 3D-Modelle\n[*]gute Musikuntermalung und nette Soundeffekte\n[*]moderne Hilfsmittel wie Autosaves, Hotspot-Anzeige und integrierte Hilfefunktion (welche allerdings manchmal ein wenig buggy ist und nur leere Seiten anzeigt oder auch gelegentlich eher verwirrt als hilft)\n[*]ein paar neue R\u00e4tsel und ein paar leicht erweiterte Dialoge im Vergleich zur Originalversion\n[*]integrierter Archivmodus, der zu jeder Szene, in der sich der Spieler befindet, Bilder der Originalversion, Konzeptzeichnungen, Kommentare und teilweise sogar Audio- oder Videobeitr\u00e4ge enth\u00e4lt. Nach dem Durchspielen kann man sich diese Hintergrundinfos auch jederzeit unabh\u00e4ngig vom Spielfortschritt ansehen.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Negativ:[/b][list]\n\n[*]unglaublich schlechte deutsche \u00dcbersetzung: Tippfehler, falsche Artikelwahl, willk\u00fcrliche Anrede, g\u00e4nzlich inhaltlich falsche \u00dcbersetzung und teilweise fehlende \u00dcbersetzung. Das wiegt umso schlimmer, weil diese Fehler auch die ein oder andere R\u00e4tselaufgabe beeinflussen\n[*]Entfernte Inhalte und \"Streamlining\": sehr viele der im Original enthaltenen, aber f\u00fcr den Spielfortschritt nicht relevanten anklickbaren/interaktiven Objekte, die in den Szenen verteilt wurden, um die Stimmung authentischer zu machen, weitere Hintergrundinformationen zu liefern oder auch einfach nur um Gabriel einen lustigen Kommentar abgeben zu lassen, wurden einfach ersatzlos gestrichen. Auch viele Dialoge - selbst bei wichtigen Charakteren - wurden deutlich zusammen gek\u00fcrzt, einige fr\u00fcher ansprechbare NPCs reden nun nicht mehr oder wurden sogar g\u00e4nzlich entfernt. Man kann im Prinzip sagen: dient es nicht direkt dem Spielfortschritt, flog es zu 90% aus dem Spiel. Dadurch verliert die Geschichte und insbesondere auch die Charaktere etwas an Tiefgang. Auch konnte man im Original die einzelnen Orte sehr viel freier besuchen - in dieser Neuauflage gilt meist: wo es an diesem Tag nichts zu erledigen gibt, da darf auch niemand hin.\n[*]\u00fcbliche Widescreen-Aufl\u00f6sungen wie 16:10 oder 16:9 werden nicht optimal unterst\u00fctzt. Das Spiel ist f\u00fcr exotischere 5:4 Aufl\u00f6sungen (1280x1024px u.s.w.) optimiert. Mit \u00fcblichen Widescreen-Aufl\u00f6sungen wird sowohl oben als auch unten ein gutes St\u00fcck des sichtbaren Bildes einfach abgeschnitten. Zwar passiert in diesem Bereich nichts spielrelevantes und vermutlich bekommt man das abgeschnittene Bild nicht einmal mit, solange man nicht wei\u00df, dass da etwas fehlt - aber eine optimale L\u00f6sung ist das keineswegs\n[*]Kleinere, seltene Bugs wie die manchmal leer bleibende Hilfeanzeige, das gelegentlich nach einer automatisch ablaufenden Animation oder Szene die Kontrolle nicht wieder an den Spieler \u00fcbergeben wird und der Mauszeiger verschwunden bleibt, Dialogzeilen, welche sich wiederholen oder abgeschnitten werden u.s.w.\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b][list]\n\n[*]Das Spiel wurde komplett neu vertont. Im Original sprachen Gr\u00f6\u00dfen wie Mark Hamill, Tim Curry oder die bezaubernde Leah Remini die Charaktere. An diese Stimmen kommen die neuen Sprecher einfach nicht heran, die allerdings trotzdem keineswegs schlechte Arbeit machen. Aufgrund des eingeschr\u00e4nkten Budgets (siehe auch \"entfernte Inhalte\") und des Alters, welches die Originalsprecher mittlerweile haben, war es letztlich aber nur logisch, die verloren gegangenen Originalsprachdateien von einer anderen Besetzung neu einsprechen zu lassen. Die neue Stimme des Hauptdarstellers Gabriel ist aber, zumindest am Anfang, auch unabh\u00e4ngig von Vergleichen mit dem alten Sprecher meiner Meinung nach etwas gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig\n[/list]\n\n\n[b]Fazit:[/b]\n\nIch w\u00fcnschte mir, f\u00fcr solche Neuauflagen w\u00fcrde immer ausreichend Budget zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Das Entwickler aus Kostengr\u00fcnden dazu gezwungen werden, \"Nebens\u00e4chlichkeiten\", die nicht unbedingt zum Spielfortschritt beitragen, zu entfernen, finde ich pers\u00f6nlich eine traurige Sache. Hier kommt noch dazu, dass einige Dinge, wie beispielsweise Teile von Graces Vergangenheit den Charaktern auch mehr Tiefe verleihen - die ihnen dann in einer solchen Neuauflage dann nat\u00fcrlich fehlt. Auf der anderen Seite ist nat\u00fcrlich zu sagen, dass das Originalspiel von 1993 leider wirklich optisch schlecht gealtert ist und das diese Neuauflage das eigentliche Spiel und dessen Geschichte erfolgreich in die Gegenwart bringt. Was ihr hier seht, ist immernoch ein Klassiker, der euch um die 10-12 Stunden unterhalten d\u00fcrfte, dem man allerdings abseits der Hauptgeschichte auch einen kleinen wenig die Substanz genommmen hat. Die wenigen neuen Inhalte (ein paar R\u00e4tsel, wenige Dialogzeilen) machen die verloren gegangenen Details meiner Meinung nach nicht wett. Das f\u00e4llt aber nur Spielern auf, die das Original gespielt haben - alle anderen erhalten hier ein ohne Einschr\u00e4nkung wirklich tolles, empfehlenswertes Adventure, bei der allerdings die Qualit\u00e4tskontrolle des Lokalisierungsteams v\u00f6llig geschlafen hat. Die alten Hasen m\u00fcssen hier leider ein wenig abw\u00e4gen, ob sie eine zeitgem\u00e4\u00dfere Optik und eine komfortablere Bedienung bevorzugen oder etwas mehr spielerische Optionen und bessere Sprachausgabe.", "timestamp_created": 1454956938, "timestamp_updated": 1454964356, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498550", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21020780": {"recommendationid": "21020780", "author": {"steamid": "76561198181067503", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 525, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488102692}, "language": "english", "review": "I own the original Gabriel Knight game, with the remake there is one thing that doesn't sit well with me.....the voice acting.\n\nThe original game sported an all star cast :\nMark Hamill (as Mosely) \nTim Curry (as Gabriel)\nVirginia Capers (as the narrator)\nLeah Remini (as Grace).\n\nThe new voice cast had much to live up to but while they did a good job it's still not there, especially the narrator.

Vorwegschicken muss ich, dass ich das Original nie gespielt habe. Ich kann daher keinen Vergleich zwischen den beiden Versionen aufzeigen und beziehe mich in diesem Review ausschlie\u00dflich auf das Remake.\n\nGabriel Knight f\u00fchrt einen kleinen Buchladen und versucht sich an der Schriftstellerei. Leider hat er derzeit eine Schreibblockade und wird au\u00dferdem von finsteren Tr\u00e4umen geplagt. Sein neues Werk soll die Thematik des Voodoo aufgreifen. Gabriel ist daher auch sofort sehr interessiert, als in der Stadt wiederholt Morde geschehen, welche mit Voodoo in Zusammenhang stehen sollen. Er beginnt mit eigenen Nachforschungen\u2026und ben\u00f6tigt hierf\u00fcr eure Hilfe!\n\nStory und Thematik in Gabriel Knight sind eher d\u00fcster gehalten. Allerdings musste ich h\u00e4ufig \u00fcber die zynischen und sarkastischen Kommentare von Gabriel \u2013 insbesondere jedoch die, der \u201eErz\u00e4hlerin\u201c \u2013 schmunzeln. Die englische Vertonung finde ich sehr gelungen, auch wenn ich irgendwo gelesen habe, dass sie im Original noch etwas besser gewesen sein soll. Besonders die \u201eErz\u00e4hlerin\u201c finde ich total klasse. Die Hintergrundmusik ist wohl auch noch vom Original, wurde aber neu eingespielt. Generell f\u00e4llt auf, dass sich sehr bem\u00fcht wurde, m\u00f6glichst dicht am Original zu bleiben. Auch die Darstellungen der Charaktere und Schaupl\u00e4tze wurden entsprechend genau \u00fcbernommen. Den Vergleich k\u00f6nnen wir uns im Spiel vor Augen f\u00fchren, indem wir an verschiedenen Orten Gabriels Tagebuch aufrufen und dort Bildmaterial von der Ur-Fassung finden. Das neue Grafikgewand steht dem Spiel sehr gut. Die Schaupl\u00e4tze wurden detailreich und liebevoll ausgestaltet. Lediglich die Animationen wirken etwas steif und altbacken.\n\nDie R\u00e4tsel waren meist logisch und nachvollziehbar. Einzelne Aufgaben waren auch etwas fieser, bzw. f\u00fcr mich nicht sofort zu durchschauen. Au\u00dferdem war mir manchmal nicht sofort klar, was nun als n\u00e4chstes zu tun ist. Hilfreich k\u00f6nnen dann die beiden Hilfefunktionen im Spiel sein. Einmal k\u00f6nnen wir uns hierdurch alle an diesem Schauplatz verf\u00fcgbaren Objekte anzeigen lassen, mit denen wir interagieren k\u00f6nnen. Weiterhin k\u00f6nnen wir in unserem Notizbuch eine Hilfestellung anfordern, welche Aufgaben noch zu erledigen sind. Neueinsteiger des Adventure-Genres werden diese Funktionen zu sch\u00e4tzen wissen, da es ansonsten hin und wieder zur \u00dcberforderung kommen kann.\n\nNegativ aufgefallen ist mir vor allem die schlechte \u00dcbersetzung der Untertitel. So werden bspw. \u201eSie\u201c und \u201eDu\u201c immer wieder vertauscht, bzw. falsch genutzt. Gabriels Assistentin spricht er mal mit \u201edu\u201c, mal mit \u201esie\u201c an. Eine fremde, alte Frau hingegen spricht er direkt mit \u201edu\u201c an. Dies mag nicht jeden st\u00f6ren, mir pers\u00f6nlich fiel es aber negativ auf. Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehler kommen manchmal vor; hin und wieder ist auch die \u00dcbersetzung an sich nicht ganz korrekt. Hier h\u00e4tte man sicher gr\u00fcndlicher arbeiten k\u00f6nnen.\nEin weiterer Kritik-Punkt ist, dass bei mir Gabriels Tagebuch nicht mehr funktioniert. In diesem werden alle Ereignisse und \u00dcberlegungen noch einmal zusammengefasst, was ab und an recht hilfreich sein kann. Seit Tag 3 ist das Tagebuch jedoch pl\u00f6tzlich leer \u2013 nur weise Seiten. Abgesehen hiervon sind mir aber keine gr\u00f6\u00dferen Bugs o. \u00e4. aufgefallen.\n\nZusammenfassend hat mich \"Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition\" f\u00fcr etwa 12 Stunden sehr gut unterhalten. Die Story war spannend und hat mich zum Weiterspielen motiviert. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad war f\u00fcr mich ausgewogen, fordernd aber nachvollziehbar. \u00dcbrigens reicht ein Spieldurchlauf aus, um alle Errungenschaften auf Steam zu erhalten. Wenn ihr einen Speicherstand kurz vor Ende des Spiels (bspw. Beginn Tag 10) habt, m\u00fcsst ihr diesen lediglich laden und die End-Alternativen erspielen. Au\u00dferdem solltet ihr zuvor im Spiel nat\u00fcrlich alles gr\u00fcndlich untersucht haben, um die maximale Punktzahl erreichen zu k\u00f6nnen.

Gabriel Knight 1 est l'un des meilleurs point & click de l'\u00e2ge d'or de ce style mais aussi de toute l'histoire du jeu vid\u00e9o. Ayant fini le jeu d'origine je vais vous faire une critique en cons\u00e9quence :\n\nLes +\n- L'histoire : Le point fort de ce jeu tiens surtout grace \u00e0 un tr\u00e8s bon sc\u00e9nario sign\u00e9 Jane Jensen, objectivement la dame n'est pas exempt de d\u00e9faut dans ses storytelling mais elle sait mettre en place une intrigue myst\u00e9rieuse et des personnages charmismatiques et attachants. Le th\u00e8me principal s'articule autour du voodoo et ne tombe pas dans les clich\u00e9s et sait attiser la curiosit\u00e9 au point o\u00f9 l'on en apprends m\u00eame beaucoup \u00e0 ce sujet. \n-La musique : La B.O. de Robert Holmes est magistrale car \u00e0 la fois coh\u00e9rente dans le jeu d'origine et \u00e9galement 20ans apr\u00e8s dans le remake. Une partition qui donne toute sa force aux cin\u00e9matiques mais aussi aux lieux du jeu dans lesquels on peut passer de longues minutes sans jamais ressentir une pesanteur de fond sonore.\n- Le gameplay est assez simple et les puzzles sont coh\u00e9rents et logique \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de point & click d\u00e9lirants comme les titres Lucas Art. Certaines parties sont plus ardues vers la fin mais l'ajout d'une fonction aide permet de d\u00e9bloquer rapidement pour se laisser balader par le sc\u00e9nario.\n- Le contenu bonus : les 3 nouveaux puzzles sont assez anecdotique mais le making off et les artwork raviront tout les fans de la 1\u00e8re heure.\n- Plusieurs fin diff\u00e9rentes\n\nLes -\n- L'animation des personnages est un peu foir\u00e9e et perds la force du pixel art original. Cependant les d\u00e9cors restent corrects et fid\u00e8les.\n- La voix des personnages est plut\u00f4t bien r\u00e9ussi hormis celle de Gabriel malheureusement. Difficile de passer apr\u00e8s les prestations du g\u00e9nial Tim Cury pour Gabriel Knight et le non moins c\u00e9l\u00e8bre Mark Hamill dans le r\u00f4le de Mosely. Cependant c'est un d\u00e9faut qui s'exprime surtout au d\u00e9but de l'aventure avant que le personnage n'\u00e9volue et devienne plus mature. Le doubleur \u00e9tant un fan du jeu original, il connaissait toute la chronologie des dialogues et \u00e0 quand m\u00eame r\u00e9ussi le pari d'adapter son ton \u00e0 l'\u00e9volution de Gabriel. Donc juste un risque d'\u00eatre d\u00e9\u00e7u au d\u00e9but en \u00e9coutant les premi\u00e8res r\u00e9pliques \"sensuello-machiste\".\n\nJe le conseillerait fortement \u00e0 tout joueur n'ayant jamais jou\u00e9 \u00e0 l'original.

Per i neofiti, basti sapere che si tratta del primo capitolo di una serie di avventure grafiche che, a mio parere, rappresentano il meglio che l'intero genere ha da offrire, in termini di scrittura, personaggi ed enigmi. Per questo motivo, pi\u00f9 che sulla pura analisi del gioco, \u00e8 bene soffermarci sulle qualit\u00e0 tecniche di questa [i]Remastered[/i].\n\nQuesta nuova edizione, realizzata in occasione del 20th anniversario della sua uscita, vede la collaborazione tra l'ideatrice della saga, Jane Jensen, e gli sviluppatori Phoenix Online Studios, che in precedenza ci hanno restituito risultati un po\u2019 altalenanti (il bello ma buggato Cognition e il deludente Moebius). Il progetto \u00e8 stato condotto cercando di unire rispetto filologico e adattamento all'era moderna. I risultati vanno dal notevole, in alcun aspetti, al deludente, in altri.\n\nDal punto di vista strutturale, il gioco \u00e8 rimasto bene o male quello del 1993: sono presenti giusto alcune modifiche riguardanti lo svolgersi degli eventi di alcune situazioni specifiche e non sono tutte riuscite allo stesso modo. In certi casi il lavoro svolto \u00e8 pregevole, con situazioni che non funzionavano benissimo nell'originale modificate in maniera intelligente o piccole aggiunte che approfondiscono aspetti secondari in maniera elegante. Nello stesso tempo, si percepiscono un po' di forzature, apparentemente inserite al solo scopo di rendere tutto pi\u00f9 lineare e semplice nello svolgimento: ad esempio, alcuni luoghi, originariamente accessibili sin da subito, sono ora da sbloccare in maniera un po' pretestuosa e soprattutto per nulla o quasi contestualizzata con modifiche sul piano narrativo. Inoltre, sono stati aggiunti nuovi enigmi in alcune situazioni particolari,  per aumentare la profondit\u00e0 del gioco, ma che in realt\u00e0 risultano leggermente fuori contesto e di fatto non aggiungono nulla allo svolgimento della storia.\n\nSul fronte tecnico, le schermate realizzate tramite la tecnologia mista 2d/3d funzionano decisamente bene, mentre la nuova realizzazione delle sequenze d'intermezzo, tramite fumetti animati, \u00e8 strepitosa. Quello che non funziona sono i modelli dei personaggi e le loro animazioni, impacciate e parecchio rozze, come da tradizione Phoenix. La colonna sonora \u00e8 di fatto quella ottima originale: \u00e8 stato fatto un gran bel lavoro di recupero e riarrangiamento dei temi grazie al lavoro del marito della Jensen, il compositore della serie. Purtroppo, per quanto riguarda il doppiaggio, non \u00e8 stato possibile recuperare il vecchio cast, tra cui figuravano i grandiosi Tim Curry e Mark Hamil: il risultato di questa versione \u00e8 pi\u00f9 che buono, intendiamoci, ma i nostalgici non potranno che storcere il naso.\n\nComplessivamente, Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father - 20th Anniversary Edition non \u00e8 il miglior remake possibile, a causa di alcune decisioni discutibili e magari anche di certe ristrettezze produttive. Tuttavia, il suo lavoro lo svolge pi\u00f9 che dignitosamente, riportando ai giorni nostri un Capolavoro degli anni novanta senza snaturarlo, aggiungendo infine una buona serie di contenuti \"dietro le quinte\", che permetteno di gustarsi, in ogni schermata, confronti grafici con il gioco originale e contenuti di vario tipo, fra bozzetti, interviste e altro.", "timestamp_created": 1451124857, "timestamp_updated": 1451144895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548872", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19944209": {"recommendationid": "19944209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058043953", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451051781}, "language": "english", "review": "Uptown girl fell in love at first sight with a downtown boy at a crime scene, who later impersonated a police officer just to talk to her, then slept with him a few days later at his place.

Dealing with the primary theme of Voodoo, it's easy to tell throughout the game that rather than a shallow Hollywood approach, extensive research was made to make its portrayal of the subject authentic. Whether it actually is or not I have no idea, but it at least feels that way through the 10 hours or so it'll take to play.\n\nIn the early 1990's this & similar titles such as Broken Sword pre-dated the rise in popularity of historical based thrillers from the likes of Dan Brown which arrived ten years later along with their subsequent movie adaptations. So fast forwarding to 2015, another ten years later,  new comers to this game might feel the original uniqueness of the premise a little played out.\n\nThis modern adapation of the original, has strayed away from the CGA style backgrounds and pixel art sprites of the original to a somewhat cheap looking 3D render engine with some backgrounds redrawn more painter-esque.\nI feel this kills the atmosphere & tension that was underlying the suspense & dread of the original, especially when it reguarly freezes up and characters perform odd actions (such as Gabriel lifting his telephone by what looks telekinesis).\n\nThe voice acting has also been redone, with Gabriel (originally by Tim Curry) now having a rather emotionless deep southern drawl. Initially grating, I did become accustomed towards it, but it's not a spot on the original voice. It's also missing (what was then) a star VA cast such as Mark Hamill, now replaced with unknowns. I presume the rights to the originals were too expensive to obtain but it suffers overall as a result. Audio cuts out before the dialogue lines are finished and the interface which could have actually done with an overhaul feels clunky and inefficient.\n\nThey've changed the character portraits and design of several characters. This may have been an attempt to make the game seem less dated, but as all the newspaper dates in game are still in 1994 I don't think Gabriel having his original era themed haircut is a problem that needed addressing.\n\nSome positives have been added such as developer commentary & a retry option for when you die, meaning that saving every 10 minutes isn't crucial (though you probably should anyway, this is a Sierra title after-all). The comic style cutscenes are also quite impressively done.\n\nWhile still one of the best point and click adventure games ever made, if you're not a newcomer to the genre & can appreciate the /feel/ that pixel art used to offer,  I'd recommend sticking with the original over this remake.

And the most important thing to say \u2013 if you like adventure games and haven\u2019t played this one, you really should.  If you have played this one, the remaster is well done and it is worth playing again.\n\nIt is fairly impossible to review this game without considering its source.  Certainly I missed Tim Curry as Gabriel, Leah Rimini as Grace, Mark Hamill as Mosley, Michael Dorn as Dr. John and Virginia Capers as the narrator.  But the new voice work is pretty good and everyone does a fine job.\n\nGraphically it certainly stands out from the original.  Not that it is top of the line, but many things that were difficult to distinguish are now clear and readily visible.   The music has been redone and of all the aspects of the game \u2013 this is my least favorite.  I loved the original themes and while they are there have at times been reworked and do not hit me the same way, but were never so far out of place that I found myself thinking them just plain wrong. The puzzles have been given a once-over in some ways.  Not everything takes place or at the same time in the original, and this doesn\u2019t hurt things.  If anything, most of the puzzles are too easy, but then that could be a lot of memory from previous playthroughs shining through.  There are plenty of hints through the story, dialog, journal and activities so that if you\u2019re paying attention it shouldn\u2019t be overly hard.\n\nIt is the story that still shines the most.  All the rest is the delivery of this tale which has been a favorite since Gabriel first walked out of his bedroom in St. George\u2019s Books. And while there are a few differences in how the story is told, it is still interesting if you will take the time to discover it.\n\nIn short, while not perfect, it makes many improvements that make for an enjoyable experience for someone who has played the game a few times over the last 20 years or someone who is being introduced to the world of Gabriel Knight.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1442326949, "timestamp_updated": 1442326949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18021728": {"recommendationid": "18021728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068458152", "num_games_owned": 2096, "num_reviews": 63, "playtime_forever": 754, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442702386}, "language": "german", "review": "Jane Jensens Meisterwerk wurde zum 20. Geburtstag \u00fcberarbeitet. Gleich geblieben ist eine spannende Mystery Story um den Buchh\u00e4ndler und erfolglosen Autoren Gabriel Knight, der bei der Recherche seines n\u00e4chsten Schundromans einem echten Voodoo Mord auf die Schliche kommt. Das Adventure begleitet ihn dabei, ist unterhaltsam, spannend und ab und an auch mal witzig.\n\nJensens Storytelling ist auch nach 20 Jahren zeitlos und das Game macht in dieser Hinsicht nach wie vor genauso viel Spa\u00df wie das angestaubte Original.  Das Interface wurde angepasst und das Spiel hat im Gegensatz zum Original ein eingebautes optionales Hilfesystem, falls man feststeckt. Immer noch ein Plus.\n\nVer\u00e4ndert wurde vor allem die Grafik, die Full HD und 2,5 D Figuren gewichen ist. Das sieht h\u00fcbsch aus, bleibt aber trotzdem vom Setting nahe am Original. Kurz: Es gef\u00e4llt. Auch hier ein fettes Plus.\n\nDie g\u00f6ttliche Musik von Jensens Ehemann Robert Holmes, die damals leider nur eine Midi Spur war, wurde neu eingespielt und erstrahlt nun ein einem unglaublich tollem Virtual Orchester Remake. Das Fest f\u00fcr die Ohren bekommt auch hier ein fettes Plus.\n\nGibt es \u00fcberhaupt etwas zu bem\u00e4ngeln? Kommt drauf an. Die Sprachausgabe des 20 Jahre alten Originals gl\u00e4nzte mit hochkar\u00e4tigen Schauspielern. Tim Curry sprach Gabriel Knight, Leah Remini vertonte Gabriels zynische Assistentin Grace,     Mark Hamill war als Mosely zu h\u00f6ren usw.\n\nDa die Soundqualit\u00e4t heutigen Standards nicht mehr entsprach, einige Schauspieler aus ihren Rollen gewachsen oder gar verstorben waren, lie\u00df sich nichts machen, als alles neu mit anderen Sprechern zu vertonen. Diese sind nicht ganz so hochkar\u00e4tig aber haben bereits Erfahrung aus anderen Videospiel Rollen. Qualitativ haben wir nur einen minimalen Unterschied. Ob hier ein Plus oder ein Minus zu verbuchen ist, bleibt jedem selbst \u00fcberlassen.\n\nAlles in Allem kann ich bedingungslos den Kauf empfehlen. Neukunden werden es lieben und auch Nostalgiker haben sicher ihren Spa\u00df. Wer dem Original hinterhertrauert kann es ja noch f\u00fcr 5 Euro bei GOG erwerben.

Created by the God Empress of adventue games Jane Jensen, whose basically made all the adventure games worth playing. I've waited 20 years to play this game, after my computer was unable to run this game when it originally game out.  Stupid computer, I had wanted to play it so bad!  I have to say I feel this version was probably better to hold out for.  The redone graphics and sound were definitely worth it.  So to get things out of the way this is definitely a must buy for adventure game fans.  It's not the best adventure game.  I'd still say the order of best adventure games of all time are: Laura Bow and the Dagger of Amon Ra in the coveted number one position, then Gray Matter, Kings Quest 5, Kings Quest 6, Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father, and Moneky Island (Laura Bow and the Colonel's Bequest was amazing when it came out, but now it's literally unplayable, hell it had a text interface for god sakes).  I'd say making the top 5 is pretty great and this game is indeed great!  However, it suffers from quite a few problems.\n\nPuzzles: First off I'd say for the most part the puzzle design is excellent.  Nothing too insanely hard.  The game did have some stand out truly awful puzzles.  One required you to walk around a 12 zone temple moving tablets in each room to open a door.  Now this puzzle was awful, not because it was confusing, but because it was ridiculously long.  The answer was super obvious, but walking through 12 rooms to change tablets took foreverrrrrrrrr.  Then even worse after you finish zombies come to life and can kill you if you don't move fast enough.  The game then resets this puzzle if you didn't save right before using the final tablet.  That's just unacceptable, why in god's name would you make a super long puzzle then have a fail state that's almost unavoidable right when you solve the puzzle, ARGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!  Also the voodoo code puzzle that is required to get to the ceremony is just plain stupid.  Again, not because it's super difficult to figure out the puzzle, but because I literally had no idea that this was what was required.  I walked around for a good hour trying to figure out  how to get to the voodoo ceremony, finally I gave up and looked up the answer.  Turns out I needed to scribble a voodoo code on a tomb door.  Figuring out the code was super easy, but I am just baffaled at how anyone would ever think that they needed to go to the tomb and change the code there in the first place.  You had already used this code to help convince the police to investigate the murderers, Nothing in the game made me think i might need to go back and rewrite the code. \n\nStory: So I'd say overall the story is quite well put together and a ton of fun.  However, it's not the story I wanted.  I prefer adventure games to be murder mysteries.  I believe the format of these games makes it perfect for such a story due to the ability to search for clues and heavy dialogue scenes between characters.  This game is tricky, because it makes you think that's what this game is.  It certainly starts off as a murder mystery as voodoo ritualistic killings plague New Orleans.  You are also certainly searching for clues and evidence to these murders...but there is no mystery here.  It's super obvious who the murderer is, they don't even try and hide it.  So that was very disappointing to me.  Also the last 2 hours turns more into an Indiana Jones adventure than the tone the rest of this game has.  I did not like this, I wanted to stay in creepy New Orelans, not fly across the globe to Germany and Africa hunting down magical weapons to fight a voodoo cult.  Sigh...this game could have easily been the #1 adventure game if it didn't take such a weird tonal shift. \n\nCharacters:  The game has very few characters...which is probably why it epicly failed in being any kind of murder mystery.  You have the protagonist of Gabriel Knight...who I actually hated.  He's a psychotic womanizer, to the extent that I was constantly worried he would start raping his secretary.  So...yea...not a good main character.  I guess things were different in the 90's?  The game starts with him sexually harassing his secretary and it seemed pretty clear she didn't enjoy it.  It got even more problematic when the games main love interest is introduced Malia Gedde.  Shes basically a classic femme fatale.  I really couldn't tell you much about her, which is certainly problematic.  She loves voodoo I guess?  My main concern with her  is that Gabriel literally starts stalking her...like crazy, he just starts chasing after her to have sex with her, even cornering her at her mothers grave asking her to have sex with him...and then she does.  It's baffaling to me how these two characters were written.  Gabriel is basically a sexual predator...but then Malia seems happy with it.  At the start I felt it was going to be a sweet reveal that she was just acting this way because she wanted to murder him...sigh, but no she super loves boning him.  I should note that I did love all the voice actors, it woudl have been better with the original cast but the reworked voice overs were great...although Gabriel still sounded even more like a stalker.  I also really enjoyed the music, it could have used more scores, but what it had was great.\n\nGraphics:  I loved the New Orelans setting of this game.  It really got across the theme of Gothic Horror.  The new upgraded art style was also quite nice.  I feel some night time scenes would have added greatly to the game though...not sure why they didn't have any.  I also really enjoyed the comic style cutscenes, they were super cheesy for the most part, but I still found myself enjoying them.  My one complain with the art direction was the final location the \"voodoo temple.\"  There is no way around it, it was reallllllllllly badly designed.  I looked up the original game, thinking this could not be what they originally had...but it was.  It's this terrible futuristic purple colored building with all electronic sliding doors and cold steel.  It literally felt like a different game.

Was ich damit meine?\nDie Remastered-/Remake-Welle rollt. Seit l\u00e4ngerem. Nimmt von Jahr zu Jahr zu. Und das (mehr oder weniger) erfolgreich, sei es auf Konsolen oder PC.  Bei genauerer Betrachtung \u00fcberwiegt die Zahl dezent aufgeh\u00fcbschter Klassiker mit minimalen Inhaltsanpassungen, wo haupts\u00e4chlich der Wille dahinter steckt aus noch nicht ganz vergessenen Alt-Hits nochmal etwas Gewinn rauszuschlagen, richtig grundrenovierte Neuauflagen sind eher die Ausnahme. \u201eGabriel Knight \u2013 Sins of the Fathers\u201c (=GK), eines der bekanntesten Adventure-Meisterst\u00fccke der goldenen 1990er Jahre des Hauses Sierra, z\u00e4hlt dabei zu den wenigen Lichtblicken wo wesentlich mehr gemacht wurde als nur die Ur-Aufl\u00f6sung auf HD-Niveau zu liften. \u00c4hnlich wie die Special Edition von \u201eMonkey Island\u201c macht auch Mister Schattenj\u00e4ger zu seinem 20. Geburtstag einen sehr frisch-modernen Eindruck und ist im Kern weitestgehend beim Original geblieben. Meiner einer, ein bekennender, gro\u00dfer Fan der altehrw\u00fcrdigen GK-Reihe, ist mehr als erfreut dar\u00fcber diesen Voodoo-Thriller erneut und in einem ganz neuen Glanz erleben zu d\u00fcrfen. Ein recht gelungenes Remake, das neben dem Original nicht schlecht dasteht. Und dieses trotzdem nicht komplett ersetzen kann.\n\nDie Story ist immer noch die Gleiche geblieben wie vor 20 Jahren, ungebrochen spannend und eine der besten Arbeiten die Spieldesignerin und -autorin Jane Jensen je herausgebracht hat: \nJuni 1993. Der frivole Charmeur und erfolglose Autor Gabriel Knight betreibt einen kleinen, mehr schlecht als recht laufenden Buchladen und wartet auf seinen schriftstellerischen Durchbruch. Die sich zuletzt ereigneten Voodoo-Morde, die seine Heimat New Orleans in Angst und Schrecken versetzen, sollen ihm dazu als Inspiration dienen. Mit Unterst\u00fctzung des befreundeten Polizei-Detective Mosely und seiner Angestellten Grace geht er diesen Bluttaten auf den Grund und bekommt es dabei nicht nur mit gef\u00e4hrlichen okkulten Kr\u00e4ften, sondern auch mit einem alten Fluch zu tun der viele Jahrhunderte \u00fcber dem Namen seiner Familie liegt\u2026\n\nTrotz kleiner \u00c4nderungen in der R\u00e4tselabfolge, neu hinzugef\u00fcgten Szenen und leicht verbessertem Bedienkomfort wird sich jeder Kenner des alten Spiels hier sofort heimisch f\u00fchlen. Die Schaupl\u00e4tze, die Charaktere, die Musik, allgemein die nostalgische Duftmarke des Originals ,\u2026 Alles noch genauso wie ich es damals in Erinnerung behalten habe, und das Meiste was einer sicht- wie h\u00f6rbaren Auffrischung unterzogen wurde gef\u00e4llt wirklich gut. Die fr\u00fcheren Pixel-Kulissen erstrahlen nun in scharf-sch\u00f6nen Details inklusive atmosph\u00e4rischer Beleuchtungseffekte und nicht-statischen Hintergr\u00fcnden, die in Gespr\u00e4chs-Close-In-K\u00e4stchen gezeigten Charaktere wurden ansehnlich gestaltet und die allgemeinen Animationen sehen auch ganz gut aus (und nur selten etwas ungelenk), daf\u00fcr sehe ich die Farbwahl etwas kritischer (mehr w\u00e4rmere Farbt\u00f6ne als im Original, was dem eigentlich sehr d\u00fcsterem Setting etwas an Wirkung wegnimmt). Der neu eingespielte Score h\u00f6rt sich vertraut, aber so klar und kraftvoll an wie noch nie, die allgemeinen Soundeffekte passen ebenfalls zu jeder Szenerie, und ganz drollig: Sogar das kleine Gl\u00f6ckchenspiel, das beim Wachsen des Punktez\u00e4hlers nach einer gel\u00f6sten Aufgabe ert\u00f6nt, wurde nicht vergessen.  \nAllgemeiner Wiedererkennungswert? Extrem hoch, nur f\u00fcr die volle 100% reicht es leider nicht. Mal ab von Gabriels arg ins Feminine umgestaltete Portrait (an das ich mich nur schwer gew\u00f6hnen konnte) verliert die Sprachausgabe des Remakes einige dicke Pluspunkte. Dabei ist es nicht unbedingt die eigentliche Qualit\u00e4t der Sprecher, an der kann man wenig ankreiden, nein, ich vermisse einfach die prominenten Hollywood-Stars hinterm Mikrofon. Tim Curry, Leah Remini, Michael Dorn und Mark Hamill. An deren Niveau kommen die Neuverpflichtungen einfach nicht heran, sei es in der Betonung oder im Charakter ihrer Stimmen. Besonders die Fu\u00dfstampfen Currys sind dem \u201eErsatz-Gabriel\u201c mindestens eine ganze Nummer zu gro\u00df, es kann einfach kein anderer dem Schattenj\u00e4ger sein freches Aufreisser-Image auf so unnachahmliche Art und Weise verpassen wie die gute alte \"From Transexual Transilvania\"-Transe Tim. Da bleib ich doch bei der alten Tonspur des Originals, so kratzig sie sich auch heute noch anh\u00f6rt.  \nDesweiteren fallen relativ viele Rechtschreibpatzer bei den deutschen Untertiteln und die eine oder andere nicht sinnkorrekte \u00dcbersetzung auf. Schwer nachvollziehbar, diese Lokalisationsschlampigkeit, man h\u00e4tte es sich doch so leicht machen und die Texte des alten \u201eSins of the Fathers\u201c als Vorlage nehmen k\u00f6nnen. Das Zeitersparnis w\u00e4re gr\u00f6\u00dfer, die Fehlerquote widerum wesentlich geringer ausgefallen.\n\nSonst muss sich die Wiedergeburt dieses Kult-Adventures nichts vorwerfen. Die Spieldauer ist - und das war mir nach so die vielen Jahren, seit ich GK das letzte von vielen Malen anger\u00fchrt hab, gar nicht mehr so bewusst - \u00fcberdurchschnittlich hoch. 15 Stunden kommen locker dabei rum, zum Teil wegen der sehr hohen Dialogdichte. Gabriel wie auch der Narrator kommentieren so ziemlich alles und jeden, da kommen unz\u00e4hlige humorvolle Kommentare zustande die von \u201eam\u00fcsant\u201c, \u201ezynisch\u201c bis \u201el\u00fcstern\u201c reichen, und seine Gespr\u00e4chspartner l\u00f6chert Gabriel solange bis sie wirklich NICHTS mehr zu sagen haben. Die komplett \u00fcberarbeitete Steuerung f\u00fchlt sich nun nicht mehr so krampfig und mit Hunderten aufgezwunger Klicks \u00fcberladen an wie fr\u00fcher, ins Inventar landet man jetzt auch viel flotter.\nDie integrierte, jederzeit (de)aktivierbare L\u00f6sungshilfe mit stufenweisen Tipps, interessante Original/Remake-Bildvergleiche innerhalb des Spiels (die sehr sch\u00f6n veranschaulichen wie dicht man sich gr\u00f6\u00dftenteils an das Ur-Design gehalten und wo man bewusste \u00c4nderungen vorgenommen hat) und der Vorgeschichts-Comic in E-Book-Form  bilden sehr sch\u00f6ne Extras.\n\nFazit:\nDie \u00e4u\u00dferen wie inneren Werte stimmen, und sofern die kleineren M\u00e4ngel in der \u00dcbersetzungssorgfalt kein K.O.-Punkt bedeuten, bekommen gerade Nichtkenner des Sierra-Klassikers hier einen sehr intensiven, nicht zu kurzen Adventure-Thriller dem man die 20 Jahre alte Story kaum anmerkt. Auch f\u00fcr Bereits-Besitzer des Ur-GK k\u00f6nnte es mit Sicherheit eine reizvolle Erfahrung sein das Schattenj\u00e4ger-Abenteuer in einem modernen Anstrich neu zu entdecken, es soll aber keinesfalls dazu veranlassen das Original zu entsorgen. Denn so positiv die Eindr\u00fccke die das Remake hinterl\u00e4sst auch sind und ich pers\u00f6nlich den Kauf keine Sekunde bereue, der Charme, der alte Voice-Cast, generell das Feeling des 1993er-Spiels  trotz (oder gerade wegen) der Beschr\u00e4nkungen der damaligen VGA-Technik, all das kann kein noch so modernes Remake schlagen.\nABER: \"GK - 20th Anniversary Edition\" erweckt die guten alten Erinnerungen an den Beginn meiner PC-Leidenschaft auf sehr angenehme Weise, und daf\u00fcr bin ich Jane Jensen dankbar.", "timestamp_created": 1437811194, "timestamp_updated": 1437940011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782060", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17192016": {"recommendationid": "17192016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151245927", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437681911}, "language": "english", "review": "If Jane Jensen happens to read these reviews I want her to know that I thoroughly enjoyed this and the other GK stories, and that is what they are, submersive, engaging, and interactive stories.

Being an adventure game fan, I've heard good things about it, and I was stoked.\n\nLet me start off by saying that the theme is really interesting, a welcomed change of pace.\nIt's rare to find games that feature voodoo, cajun, or New Orleans culture in a respectful manner.\n\nI think in the 90s, Gabriel Knight was hailed as a cutting-edge franchise because it was a modern noir murder mystery story set in New Orleans, featuring POC characters, and it was quite violent for a video game at the time - a point & click, no less.\n\nWith that chunk of history in mind, and the 17+ hours I've spent playing the game, it's safe to say that it is pretty good!\n\nBut, I do have a bone or two to pick, and I'll explain why in detail.\n\nTo be honest, it was really difficult for me to really connect with Gabriel and appreciate him as a character; but, over time, I grew to appreciate the game and other characters, instead, and then it became much more enjoyable.\n\nI feel that the characters, music, and atmosphere is what really made the game for me and it was what kept me from uninstalling the game because I was so frustrated with Gabriel being little more than a womanizing dream boat - who falls in love with a woman after only knowing her for three days! \n(And she explicitly told him she was uninterested, at first)\n\nStory-wise, I felt that Gabriel was a flop, in the beginning at least, and I thought the love-at-first-sight and playing hard to get aspects were uncomfortable and unnatural (but it was a popular theme in 90's story-telling, I'll admit). \nAlso, Gabriel had very little character development up until the peak of the plot, which was disappointing because it made him seem even more of a pretty boy cut-out instead of the formidable hero he was - literally - destined to be. \n\nBut, my personal gripe aside, it was a good adventure game; I had fun with the puzzles and I enjoyed interacting with the characters, too! (Mosely and Grace were wonderful, I just wish that they were a bit more involved.)\n\nThis was a good remake, and I hope that the other two games will be redone so that they may have a chance to reconnect with old fans, and inspire new fans, as well. \n", "timestamp_created": 1433319936, "timestamp_updated": 1433319936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502304", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16113124": {"recommendationid": "16113124", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985097012", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433149606}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is awesome.

These remakes of classics (Broken Sword Enhanced version, Monkey Island remake) sit well along with new games (Walking Dead, Broken Age) which have brought back adventure games.\n\nI just hope this provides the springboard for new Gabriel Knight adventures (I'm not interested in remakes of the second or third game!)", "timestamp_created": 1431770430, "timestamp_updated": 1431770430, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15805337": {"recommendationid": "15805337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076606506", "num_games_owned": 754, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 802, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431185621}, "language": "english", "review": "Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition\n\nOMG! Was that really 20 years ago? Seems like yesterday when it came out. Back in the days when I was starting out playing PC and videogames. I had so many fond memories that I actually  shied away for long weeks before playing the revamped version on Steam , not wanting to spoil my memories of the game by a bad new version. But here's my two cents.\n\n[b] Graphics [/b] 8 of 10\nThe graphics made a huge step forward from 1993, of course. I liked the improvement, from dust particles that can be seen when the sun shines through a window, to the sometime kind of 3D backgrounds and characters. Advertised it is as being HD, but well it's not all HD, the story is done e.g. told in comic style. Because truth be told, back in the 90ies the graphics were so ugly, that sometimes you were just clicking around with your mouse, just hoping you hit something that could be useful. Big Thumbs up for the improvement!\n\n[b] Gameplay/Story [/b] 8.5 of 10\nEven after all this time, the story still feels fresh .Gabriel Knight's humor and dialogues are still fun and feel fresh. The game is an Absolut classic. Voodoo Gods, the New Orleans Flair and the story of the Schattenj\u00e4gers. The riddles are tricky and sometimes a little farfetched, but the producers added a new hint system in your diary, which should help beginners of the genre. And even though I been playing the game before, it still took me around 14 hours. \n\n[b] Music & Voice [/b]    8.5 of 10\nThe 90ies music was replaced by a new mix by the original composer. Very fitting. Nothing against old-school, but 90ies PC music was not that good. I was surprised how fitting the voice actors were. Especially the voice of Gabriel Knight.\n\n[b] Final Verdict [/b]   \nDefinitely a must buy for nostalgic gamers (like me) , adventure gamers in general and probably the best game for starters of the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1431468362, "timestamp_updated": 1431469321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.711960", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15803826": {"recommendationid": "15803826", "author": {"steamid": "76561198215787476", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 623, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1430692361}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Cabrit sans cor\" is all I have to say. Figure out what that means and tell me you don't want to play this game... these words have haunted me for almost 20 years...not kidding. \n\nI fondly remember my days spent indoors, during incredibly hot summer days in Georgia, playing Sierra games. They were such amazing adventure games and something altogether different from my console titles (SNES at the time I think). But stumbling upon Gabriel Knight really has remained as my first discovery of a \"sleeper\" hit game. Knowing now that the main devs involved were partly responsible for King's Quest and Phantasmogoria makes total sense and a perfect way to describe this game: the gameplay of KQ mixed with the dark and sinister spector of Phantas.\n\nThe tale of Voodoo, murder and noir dectective skewed N'awlins style is a true classic. The author of the script really did a great job capturing the flavor of the south (sometimes moreso than the voice actors...), and as a southerner I can tell you that is not an easy thing to do. The dynamic of the characters is well crafted, and the tale is tense and masterful. Morover, I love the film \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" and this game certianly has a similar \"Southern Gothic\" feeling. The bizarre cast of characters, wrought iron fences, the sweet smell of magnolia and gardenia, the heavy wet air of New Orleans, the general ease that the old South did once proffer, and a glimpse into the darkest shadows surrounding some of the best kept secrets haunting the opulent manors and old money that flow in the veins of old surviving Southern towns and cities. \n\nIt has depth in both story and gameplay, but some may not really enjoy the point and click play. It can also get a little repetitive; having to travel around and explore places you've alreday been to just to try and find one thing or one detail about one thing you missed...it can bug you. Also, one of the classic faults (if you can call it that) of old Sierra games was the quality of the backgrounds sort of hiding, or at least obscuring, the paths the player needs to find. Also, some gamers may not understand the whole \"open the inventory to combine items to equip them all/get them to work\" sort of problem solving required to solve some puzzles, if they can find the puzzle to begin with- looking at you clock puzzle... Trust me, if you play this game you'll find it. Truthfully; that's what I love about the games, but I admit that it isn't eveyone's cup of tea- you have to spend time IN the game. Click on everything, explore every corner...and the new option to press a button to reveal all interactable objects is AWESOME... you used to have to click blindly until you got a GUI box to pop up. \n\nIt's a great game you 90's gamers may have missed and one newer gamers may never hear of again!

Troch\u0119 jak zbyt obfity makija\u017c na ca\u0142kiem \u0142adnej twarzy. Ale grafika to sprawa indywidualna.\n\nNatomiast ca\u0142kowity dramat to rozgrywka. Postacie s\u0105 topornie zanimowane, wszystko wydaje si\u0119 niezno\u015bnie powolne. Klikamy na przedmiot, Gabriel powoli rusza, majestatycznie przesuwa si\u0119 do przodu, dochodzi do przedmiotu, kuca, bierze, wstaje, czasami komentuje i dopiero wtedy mo\u017cemy zrobi\u0107 kolejny krok. Wszystko by\u0142oby ok, gdyby nie trwa\u0142o to tyle czasu! Odnios\u0142em wra\u017cenie, \u017ce starsza wersja gry by\u0142a dynamiczniejsza ni\u017c to. Inny przyk\u0142ad. Gabriel wchodzi do mieszkania babci. Najpierw s\u0142ycha\u0107 pukanie, babcia otwiera drzwi, wita si\u0119 z Gabrielem, oboje powoli ruszaj\u0105 w stron\u0119 kanapy, bardzo powoli na niej siadaja i dopiero jak przestaj\u0105 si\u0119 rusza\u0107 odblokowuje si\u0119 interfejs i mo\u017cemy zacz\u0105\u0107 gra\u0107. Sytuacja powtarza si\u0119 za ka\u017cdym razem, kiedy pjawiamy si\u0119 w domu babci. Ca\u0142a gra jest taka! Na pocz\u0105tku my\u015bla\u0142em, \u017ce mo\u017ce si\u0119 przyzwyczaj\u0119. Nic z tego. Gdyby nie to \u015blimaczne tempo, sko\u0144czy\u0142bym gr\u0119 w czasie 2 razy kr\u00f3tszym.\n\nToporno\u015b\u0107 zabija ten remake.\nA szkoda, bo historia Gabriela jest wci\u0105gaj\u0105ca. Przerywniki s\u0105 ca\u0142kiem sprawnie zrealizowane. Muzyka nie powala\u0142a, szczeg\u00f3lnie w po\u0142\u0105czeniu z t\u0105 grafik\u0105, ale uszy nie bola\u0142y. \n\nJe\u015bli kto\u015b jest fanem GK, pewnie ju\u017c w to gra\u0142. Je\u015bli kto\u015b nie gra\u0142, to chyba lepiej zagra\u0107 w pierwowz\u00f3r, bo niestety wersja wsp\u00f3\u0142czesna wygl\u0105da na zrobion\u0105 na kolanie i wydan\u0105 w po\u015bpiechu, przez co w \u017caden spos\u00f3b nie jest gr\u0105 lepsz\u0105 od orgina\u0142u. \n\nZ b\u00f3lem serca, ale niestety nie polecam.", "timestamp_created": 1427931545, "timestamp_updated": 1427931545, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15084431": {"recommendationid": "15084431", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971206154", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480195609}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Comprei logo que saiu!

New Orleans[/b]\n\nThe game opens with Gabriel emerging into his book shop, the Saint Georges book store,  following a restless nights sleep.\nHe's being plagued by nightmares which might have something to do with the fact that he is investigating a spate of \"Voodoo murders\" for a new book.\nFrom here, you'll begin your journey around New Orleans and then further afield as you research the Murders and uncover secrets about your own mysterious past.\n\n\n[b]Point & Quip[/b]\n\nThis is a point and click adventure in its purest form.\n\nThere are a multitude of items you can click on at each location, all of which will invoke some sort of response, either from Gabriel himself or from \"the narrator\" (Who I'm convinced is the Voodoo Lady from the  Monkey Island games that I mentioned earlier.)\n\nJust looking around, exploring the environment can be entertaining in its own right. Click on a book in Gabriels shop for instance  and  \"Mrs Monkey Island Voodoo Lady\" will comment \"The books have been chosen for their special  appeal.... in other words nothing written by Gabriel\"\n\nWhether these quips make you roll your eyes or chuckle out loud they definitely make exploring each scene fun and interesting.\n\n\n[b]Cajun Twang[/b]\n\nSins of the Fathers is a \"Full Talky\" and I'm happy to report that the voice work is competently done with more suitably colourful accents than you could shake a deep fried chicken on a stick at.\n\nAll this would mean nothing without snappily written dialogue and the writing here is sharper than the spines of a Mississippi cat fish.\n\n\n[b]It's not Vanity if it's True[/b]\n\nSins of the fathers graphics have also had a major overhaul. They're crisp and colourful and I'm sure Gabriel himself would tell you he's never looked so good.\nThe animations are smoother than the Bourbon at Mardi Gras and interface is clean and intuitive.\n\n\n[b]Stuck in the Bayou[/b]\n\nOf course underpinning all the prettiness is the same classic game we all loved back in the 90's.\n\nAs such it's a fairly long game when compared to todays standards, you'll have clocked up around  15 hours of game play by the time the end credits roll, so getting your monies worth out of this title isn't in question.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that Sins of the Fathers  puzzles don't pull any punches, you are going to get stuck from time to time, this is an adventure from a period when \"men were men, women were women and puzzles were hard\".\nMoving the story forward is always more than enough reward for the perseverance required.\n\nThe main story arc, the characters, the New Orleans setting, each element complements the other creating an absorbing and highly entertaining point and click adventure.\n\n\n[b]Voodoo Magic[/b]\n\nI've thoroughly enjoyed my time revisiting Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, it's left me with a hunger for more and I sincerely hope that \"GK2: The Beast Within\" and \"GK3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned\" get their much deserved HD makeovers too.\n\nIf you weren't lucky enough (or old enough) to play the original Sins of the Fathers  there's never been a better time to get to know Gabriel Knight in all his HD glory.\n\nIf you were around for the original and remember it fondly (as I do) then I'm happy to say that this is a re-master done the right way.\n\nSt George's book store is open...\nYou really can go home again.\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit [url]http://www.review-well.com/ [/url] )", "timestamp_created": 1426893825, "timestamp_updated": 1476524351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.612883", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14965747": {"recommendationid": "14965747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064044089", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492118392}, "language": "english", "review": "As amzing now as it was back in the day.", "timestamp_created": 1426805370, "timestamp_updated": 1426805370, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14909975": {"recommendationid": "14909975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044839188", "num_games_owned": 1784, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426453657}, "language": "polish", "review": "It was good to relive classic again.\n\nIf you don't know it, you should take Gabriel for a spin.", "timestamp_created": 1426453708, "timestamp_updated": 1426453708, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472637", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14908214": {"recommendationid": "14908214", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094432643", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 72, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426479127}, "language": "english", "review": "It's kind of annoying there isn't a \"meh\" option, because while I couldn't recommend this game as a MUST HAVE, I'm not going to go out of my way to say NEVER EVER EVER PLAY WASTE OF TIME.  Sadly, they couldn't get Tim Curry, Leah Remini, Mark Hamill, Michael Dorn, and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. to reprise their roles, and there are extended sequences that prevent simply reusing the original voice samples.\n\nIf you've never played a Gabriel Knight game, you will most likely enjoy the updated version.  If you're a fan of the original series, you might want to pass unless you get this on sale/as a gift, then why not because trading cards = free money.\n\nThings that are legitimately improved:\n- Gabe's design is more consistent with his look in the original 2nd and 3rd games\n- the cutscenes are a little more coherent\n- the \"point of no return\" in Day 10 has been changed so you can go back if needed\n\nThings that have tolerably changed:\n- Jason Victor does a pretty good version of Tim Curry's Gabriel Knight\n- Ned Clarke and Dave Fennoy also come pretty close to the original Mosely and Dr. John\n- a handful of bonus mini-game extended puzzles that make no sense but at least it's bonus material\n- exhausting dialogue choices (usually) removes them from the list of options vs. leaving them to clutter the screen\n- MOST of the artwork is pretty\n\nThings I really don't like:\n- Cissy Jones sounds more like Charity James (original GK3) than Leah Remini\n- Amy Ingersol's Malia sounds much less sultry than Leilani Jones\n- the \"bobble-head\" interview animations look incredibly unnatural\n- the character animations in general have that typical stiff, soulless puppet look, particularly with sequences that would need sudden movements (the tap-dancing kid, Magentia's \"don't be frightened by what you see\" snake dance that instead looks like \"I'm wearing a snake and slightly shaking in place\")\n- a bug where I put two \"snake tiles\" in place and was IMMEDIATELY ATTACKED (may or may not be reproducible, I haven't tried extensively)\n- also, what's with Grace's walk cycle--it looks like she's gonna fall over any second\n\nOverall, I guess it's okay, but don't go too far out of your way to get it.

Aber ich wollte wissen, wie alles begann und deshalb hab ich hier zugeschlagen.\n\nIm Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Klick&Point-Adventures geht es in GK im allgemein recht logisch zu. Man wird sich also selten bei erwischen, mal eben alle Items im Inventar zu testen, weil man mal nicht weiter kommt. Hat man erstmal das Grundproblem gescheckt, wei\u00df man in der Regel auch, was man nutzen muss. Schon mal ein gro\u00dfer Vorteil. \nTrotzdem sind manche R\u00e4tsel recht knackig und k\u00f6nnen auch schon mal Tage Zeit kosten. \n\nDie Grafik ist recht gut, da gibt es eigentlich nichts zu meckern. \n\nAber kommen wir zum entscheidenen. Was mich bei Gabriel Knight 3 so \u00fcberzeugt hat, war die Story. Verbindung von Wahres mit Fiction. Ich wei\u00df noch, als ich dort in einer Kirche war, sah das alles sehr \u00fcberzeugend aus. Irgendwie ein, zwei Jahre sp\u00e4ter sah ich genau diese Kirche bei einer Terra X Sendung. Sie war im gleichen Ort und sah genauso aus, wie im Spiel gezeigt. Innen, wie au\u00dfen. Das war schon klasse. Auch, wie das ganze eingebunden war im Spiel.\n\nDie Story in SotF ist genau so toll. Spiele mit mystischen Hintergrund liebe ich ja.

This means the loss of celebrity voice talent present in the original, but I think the improved audio fidelity makes up for it (feel free to look up the originals on youtube and hear for yourself). \nThe scenery, dialogue content, plot and puzzles are kept identical to the original. The game contains a journal in which you can view developer interviews, sketches, story-boards and screenshots for the original. I found myself looking in the journal to compare the old and new first thing at every location in the game. It's clearly a very nostalgic experience. Since the game features a higher resolution more details have been woven into the background in many areas, but the core gameplay is just as it is in the original. \nGabriel's appearance seems to change for every game he's in and the 20th Anniversary Edition is no different. I think his features have become slightly too androgynous though (my mental image of him is formed by the original), but whether it's better or not is entirely subjective. \n\nFor the newcomer to the series the 20th Anniversary edition is clearly preferable to the original, which is probably much too pixelated to be appreciated by eyes used to HD graphics. \nThis is an inventory based point-and-click adventure game: Gabriel moves between various areas in which he can observe, pick up items, manipulate items, combine items, use items upon objects and talk to people. You progress through the game by unlocking unique dialogue options uncovering important plot points and solving puzzles which usually involves the use of found items. You can use a highlight feature to show interactable objects on the screen, which is rather convenient at times reducing paranoia \"what if I missed something? Better search every pixel again!\"\nThe puzzles sometimes requires strange solutions but the game has a built in hint system, where you can unlock tiers of hints (increasing in details) to prevent frustration.\nThe game is deservedly loved for its story among fans, but you might not believe it from the first few hours of gameplay. The mystery plot takes a bit before it gets going. The games humor is mostly self-depreciating on Gabriel's behalf and tends to portray him as a shallow person, which might feel slightly off-putting initially. Same may apply for some of the accents used in the game, but after short habituation I found it rather refreshing and atmospheric. \n\n\nBottom line: Faithful recreation of the original game with updated assets. Slow paced but very worthwhile mystery plot with sometimes weird puzzles.

Not terrible. \n\nPositives:\n\nThere's a solid foundation here. The original is an extremely good game, and the remake (for the most part) doesn't mess it up, but rather improves it.\n\nThe more detailed art style does improve some things, such as the cinematic cutscenes and confrontations.\n\nSome of the locations are a bit more interesting.\n\nThe commentary is good.\n\nThe narrator doesn't take forever to finish each torturous sentence (you will still turn her off, naturally)\n\nGrace's voice is far superior to the original.\n\nNegatives:\n\nSome of the locations are quite sterile. A lot of minor animations and touches are omitted for the sake of economy. Fewer spots you can interact with, fewer unique reactions.\n\nMost of the new voices are adequate, but don't quite measure up to Worf / Joker.\n\nThe commentary is quite sparse. I'd actually prefer a proper artbook, where you can see the comparisons in detail and the designers would (hopefully) have things to say beyond the very obvious.\n\nThe new puzzles are terrible, awful, horrible, time wasting pointless shit.\n\nOverall:\n\nUnlike some other remakes or sequels to 20 year old games I played recently, I did not regret the time I spent playing this game. It wasn't bad. Just... not very good.  Remember that the original trilogy can be purchased on GOG, and... wait for a sale, maybe? \n\nDetailed impressions: http://xander77.livejournal.com/25366.html\n\nEdit - I've been told that this review is a bit biased towards people who played the original back in the 90's, and don't mind 90's graphics much.

Since adventure games are having something of a reinassance these last few years, I was hoping one of my old favorites would survive the remake transition.  This return to New Orleans is not without its charm and the gameplay system has welcome hint integration, but the overall execution is lacking.\n\nThe biggest issue stems from the new voice cast.  Since CD games were a fresh novelty in the early '90s some ringers from stage and cinema hopped onboard to see what the fuss was about.  This resulted in an interesting mix of seriocomic vocal perormances from the likes of Tim Curry and Mark Hamill.  The voices in the remake turn the cheese factor up considerably to the point where it detracts from the tension built into the dialogue.  The laughs from the original came from a welcome break in the tension, not because Gabriel's accent sounds like a awkward college student pretending to be someone else.\n\nThe character models are also a bit off.  Their movements are really stilted, coming across more as PSX-era Clock Tower quality animations.  They don't fare much better up close as each portrait looks like they've got a constant case of the jitters.  Yes, people don't stand perfectly still when they talk, but they also don't have minor convulsions like they all had the same strong espresso in the morning.  No one's eyes line up when they speak, heightening the disconnect from the characters and scenario.  One of the things I loved about the original was the way the conversation switched to the two characters having a dialogue straight into the player's eyeline from the monitor to engage them in conversation.\n\nJane Jensen's story still works great, and while Gabriel Knight is even more of a anachronistic character than he was when he debuted, is still charming enough to guide through the story.  Gameplay-wise, there are additions positive and negative to the core adventure system.  In the big positive corner is a hint book that runs alongside the game and disperses guidance as the player needs, providing more specific solutions depending on the scenario.  It's not perfect, and there are some notable glitches with what actions go where toward the end of the game, but it's a nice way to integrate appreciation for adventure gamer's of all skill levels.  Less effective is how the player can now hit Space Bar to put a text box over everything that can be interacted with on any given screen.  For pixel hunts it's a godsend, for screens where there is just a lot of flavor dialogue to peruse it's a nightmare.  It transforms the pleasing background environments into a text adventure and disrupts more of the careful flow.\n\nOverall it wasn't worth the price of admission.

I was a kickstarter backer & played some of the earlier builds of the game.  When I was playing those early builds I was concerned about the voice cast, but after playing through the whole game, I give a hearty thumbs up for an impressive job at filling some incredibly large shoes left by the original cast.  All of the voices are definitely based off the original, and even the worst of it doesn't detract much (if at all) from the game.  On major positive point is that the narrator speaks MUCH faster than Virgina Capers.\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying this game, get off that fence and just buy it!!!", "timestamp_created": 1416349652, "timestamp_updated": 1416349652, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12989130": {"recommendationid": "12989130", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963635900", "num_games_owned": 246, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 879, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416187435}, "language": "english", "review": "Great remake of a classic Sierra adventure game.

There are two levels of hints. The first level is a gentle one, and wont completely steal the satisfaction of solving the puzzle or days tasks. The second level hint, if you use it, is a much more detailed \"cheat\", that will state plainly whats required. There is a timer function that prevents you clicking the hints straight away.\n\nI really enjoyed replaying this game, partly out of pure nostalgia, and partly because it is a worthwhile modernisation of a fondly remembered game. I was especially satisfied by the art material and graphics from the original game being viewable within your in game diary also. That content gets unlocked as you progress.\n\nIf you have love for the original, and would simply enjoy replaying it with new clothes, buy this game (again).

The graphics are incredibly beautifull , the 3d models needed a little extra work but its not something that even remotely bothers, the locations are incredible the least i can say. The gameplay is totaly reworked adding minigames to enhance the gaming experience and to help the plot develop smoothier than the original. Only few can be said about the music which is a key element to the atmosphere of the GK and in my humble opinion Robert Holmes's score delivers. The passion and the colouring of the soundtrack is something that other adventure companies can take lessons from. \n\nOn the other hand a few bugs kinda spoil the whole experience (most of them are fixed now) but nothing can stop the remake of GK to mark a new benchmark on how an andventure should be made and yes it may be a wonderfull apetizer for a 4th installment of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1415571898, "timestamp_updated": 1415572089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.613809", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12861096": {"recommendationid": "12861096", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970776355", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414428874}, "language": "polish", "review": "Je\u015bli kto\u015b nie gra\u0142, lub nie s\u0142ysza\u0142 nigdy o Gabrielu, to teraz jest czas by nadrobi\u0107.

Play the demo first, it's a good representation.\n\nIf you, after completing the demo find the game interesting and, want to continue your experience I would suggest that you back up your saves, before the purchase, because Steam will just delete it all upon installation of the full game.\n\nI was a bit sceptical about the game at first, especially in regards to the new boy'ish look of Gabriel Knight and this silly southern voice that is being used, but also in regard to the changes of design. It took me awhile to get past that change and I was just barely ahead of it at the end of the demo. \n\nTruth be told I was never really a fan of the GK series even though I tried my hand with all them in their own time with a declining interest, that was completely gone after five minutes with GK3. I generally despised the Sierra Adventure games, because they were so dull, traditionally old-school and unforgiving somehow compared to the humorous and creative Lucasarts Adventure games I loved. \n\nI am glad to see that Pinkerton Studios have gotten a much better hold on the game engine that severely scarred the previous Mobius game. Gone are the wandering eyes and jittery animations.. There is still a few minor flaws, but much less than before. There is also lip-syncing and it works surprisingly well. \n\nI read quite a lot of reviews about the game, the good, bad and ugly, because I was a bit lukewarm about GK, but I was curious and played the demo first and even though this new version isn't quite the same high-caliber version as the original it's not a bad game, not a bad game at all, but it's clearly not a total remastery of the old game, since they've changed the voice actors. Even though I was quite resentful of the voice of Gabriel Knight in the beginning it kind of grew on me and the accent is also more downplayed as the game goes on. The rest of the voice cast is pretty decent. \n\nMy only real complaint about the game is the background Music - it's bloody horrible and totally out of place with the spirit of the game unlike the game music during cutscenes which is very well done. I was about ready to quit before the demo even got started, because of it, but I hit a key to skip the intro credits and turn off the music, which saved the day. \n\nThere is a new hint system in the game, but unfortunately it's neither very intelligent nor progress based. The few times I needed it I was way ahead of the hint system and had to wait for the hints to catch up to my point of progress, because of build-in timer, that I assume has been put in place to avoid that you spoil yourself too much and even then it was extremely rare that it was useful at all. At one point it was completely useless and I had to Google for a solution, because I got a bit ahead of myself and was unable to pick up on a vital clue on how to unlock an important puzzle. \n\nThere were times when I was a bit lost about my next move, because the game is a bit short of a narrative and there is a certain amount of things that you need to solve before the day ends, which isn't very clear, but the first hint of each day usually give you a list of to-do's of the day. I do not recommend using the hint system at all, because the game is actually quite short. \n\nI saw a reviewer complaining about the same animations being played every time you leave an area, but that's kind of a silly point, because you can use fast-travel everywhere. You don't have to leave any area by going to an exit point at all, because you can bring up the map at any point, which is really nice, but unfortunately Gabriel Knights current location isn't highlighted on the map at all.. Sometimes I went to places where I was already.. The same teleportation system in Mobius has transferred to GK1 as well, but there are times when you need someone to follow you that it backfires. \n\nThere is still a bit of the old ghost of Sierra's unforgiving gameplay present, but the good news is that there has been added a RETRY option for those special events. \n\nI finished the game in 15 hours and I am actually a bit surprised that I had a such a good time with it. Jane Jensen was a much better writer twenty years ago, but she also had a co-writer on GK1, and that part still stands. \n\nSettings:\n\nGameplay: \n Narrator Off, Hints On, Subtitles: On, Tutorials: Off, Language: English. \n\nAudio: \n Master: On, Music: Off, SFX: On, Voices: On. \n\nGraphics: \n Display: Beautiful - Resolution: 1920x1200 - Anti-aliasing: 4 - (+Morphological AA: On (AMD))", "timestamp_created": 1415302650, "timestamp_updated": 1415375410, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643386", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12811376": {"recommendationid": "12811376", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994957884", "num_games_owned": 798, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415243428}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Na minha opini\u00e3o, o melhor adventure point and click j\u00e1 feito.

This game combines being true to the original while making improvements and modernizing. And its visually stunning!\n\n+Amazing HD graphics! I love the way they kept the original composition as much as possible.\n+The new voice-over cast is a surprising success!\n+The new remastered music is wonderful!\n+Hints system and notes adds to the gameplay experience!\n\n-Some visual collision and sliding issues on animations, kind of jagged at times.\n-Had to reload a couple of times due to problems with continue function\n\nThe new voice-over cast was initially worrying. Not so strange being a hardcore fan of the old 1993 version, having played it close to 30 times. However after a couple of hours into it, I found it surprisingly refreshing and wonderful. Especially happy to see the essence of Gabriel's cocky New Orleans character being intact. I would also mention Grace, Dr John, Mosely and Frick as outstanding performances.\n\nVisually its a balanced mix of photo and painted textures, blended with pre-rendered backgrounds and real-time props & characters. A nice touch is the ambient atmospheric particles & lighting effects.\n\nThe original music is remastered by composer Robert Holmes. This is a huge improvement from the early 90s midi tracks.\n\nThe bonus option to view old concept art from the different locations, combined with info and audio interviews with the original developers is a nice addition for fans of the old game.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for adventure fans, looking for a story driven game.

I, for one, don't enjoy something like being able to show all hotspots by just pressing the space bar, The small number of additional puzzles were unnecessary but that didn't really bother me. The pronounciation of the New Orleans French was overdone. And I rather disliked the \"Scoring System\".\nIt just distracts from playing this for story-progression and replaces it with an achievement-hunter vibe. The Hints-system was an addition I chose to ignore but I understand why it's been added, Gaming has become a HUGE deal and gamers aren't as patient with their games as they used to be (especially when it's not an action-packed game) so without some small hints, some players might not bother completing the game, I don't want to complain about the hints system, It's just present, If you don't like it you can just let it sit idle (Nobody forces you to use it). My biggest issue in this game was the rather unresponsive controlling of Gabriel, especially in the Wheel-within-a-wheel mound in Africa, (Y'all know what sequence i mean, I don't want to spoil) But all these minor \"Issues' just don't add up to the sheer amazingness of the story, or the game as a whole!

At its core, a rich, engaging story involving voodoo, occult & sacrifice in New Orleans. Uncovering old family secrets & discovering your destiny. A cast of interesting, reoccuring characters full of personality. Mystery, murder, horror, star-crossed lovers & challenging puzzles. And off course, that black trenchcoat & that awkward southern accent! It's all been faithfully reproduced.\n\nThe [b]20th Anniversary edition[/b], could be likened to a \"Director's Cut\". The full story is still there, nothing missed, but some things are remixed appearing at different days or points in the story. There is also a few new things added. This all up, adds some freshness for those familiar with the original '93 release. It plays well and the changes made seem logical, balancing out the gameplay & story arcs.\n\nCutscenes deserve a special commendation. They're done in a comic style [i](frame-by-frame)[/i], beautifully done, almost popping out the screen at times. These added a lot of emotional impact to the story.\n\nAlthough [b]Gabriel Knight[/b] is a fairly logical [i](by point-n-click adventure game standards)[/i], its still an old school design, so there is some strange logic at times, ultimately adding to the difficulty & forcing you to think creatively. There are clues throughout the dialog though [i](& your Journal)[/i], so its important to always pay attention, even if it seems to be irrelevant at the time. It's a deep, detailed story to explore. Finding the clues, and figuring it all out is well-paced & generally an enjoyable experience. Makes you want to explore everything just to make sure you don't miss anything!\n\nThere is great [i](fully voiced)[/i] dialog along with some funny adult humor & sexual tension between Gabe & Grace/Malia to spice up some of the conversations too. Although the voice acting is top notch, Gabriel's voice did grind at me [i](along with Gabriel's unlikable persona)[/i] for the first 2-3 days [i](in-game episodes)[/i]. I got used to the voice eventually, and persona-wise this does change over the course of the 10 day episodes the game is split into. I though the creole narrator was particulary good, although if you don't like it you can turn her off.\n\nWhen you add the combination of the excellent remastered soundtrack [i](changes per location)[/i], along with the gorgeous highly detailed painted artwork, to the top voice acting, it creates an immersive experience with a unique ambience to every scene. I found myself just sitting back sometimes, taking it all in before progressing in the story. \n\nMost of the scripted animations were well done, although I found the animations for Gabriel a bit stiff at times when moving around a scene. It wasn't terrible, but it was noticable. You can also see clipping issues from time to time or the odd glitch.\n\nInterface was clear & functional and there is a limited hint system. It was nice to be able to double click to 'teleport' to a point. Click the exit to the scene just gently fades out was a smooth touch too. There is also a lot of content to sink you teeth into, for me it too around 25hrs to figure everything out to complete the 10 days & all achievements [i](although I am sure you can do it much faster!)[/i]. \n\nFeels like a lot of care was taken to get this right. This is a quality, story-rich supernatural point-n-click adventure, honoring the spirit of the original. It reintroduces [b]Gabriel Knight[/b] to a whole new generation of gamers, while bringing back fond memories for many older gamers.\n\nI really enjoyed the entire experience. Highly recommended!\n\n[i](PS - Hope this leads to the sequels getting the same 'Anniversary' treatment sometime in the future!)[/i]\n\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TrueBlueReviews#curation]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]", "timestamp_created": 1414325544, "timestamp_updated": 1453688135, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.807493", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12635162": {"recommendationid": "12635162", "author": {"steamid": "76561197981953151", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 558, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414280361}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is still Gabriel knight, so thats pretty sweet.

Let's face it, 20 years on they probably wouldn't have sounded the same, though the first time I heard Gabes voice I tried not to think of Tim Curry and it was a bit jarring at first but either I quickly got used to it or his voice settled down.  Whoever replaced Charity James as Grace Nakimura did an admirable job though she doesn't quite have the snark.\n\nA nice touch is that in every scene you can look at an 'archive', like a production section and there are things like a comparison shot of the old version of the game with the new section, concept drawings, a few video interviews.\n\nThe game interface is a little less clumsy than the original Sierra interface and overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.  When talking to a character the close up portraits are nice, though I think Magentia Moonbean looks a bit younger than the game suggests.\n\nIt's not perfection, there are certain characters you could visit freely before like Grandma that are only accessible after a certain day and a couple of silly little puzzles, but if you're an adventure fan I recommend this.\n\nI only hope now that they do a remake of Gabriel Knight 2.", "timestamp_created": 1414186638, "timestamp_updated": 1511649803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12614564": {"recommendationid": "12614564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013788189", "num_games_owned": 818, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 700, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505718686}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite the obviously change in the graphics this Sins of the Fathers is identical to its '93 counterpart,  having the same exciting and brilliant narrative full of memorable characters born from the mind of Jane Jensen along with what is perhaps one of the most beautiful soundtrack in the history of videogames; \nMust buy for both old and new gamers.", "timestamp_created": 1414178344, "timestamp_updated": 1414178344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514037", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12610594": {"recommendationid": "12610594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025813262", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 630, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440130466}, "language": "english", "review": "It has been more than 15 years since I played this game so big thanks for the game developers for doing the anniversary edition.

This was the very first PC game I ever had, actually bought 2 months before we actually had a PC. I still remember seeing the box art, that hanging figure and being strangely drawn to it. It was also one of the hardest games I ever tried to run on our first PC. Figuring out that I needed to create a boot disk and what that disk needed to contain was as hard a puzzle as any I had to solve in the game! And considering this was before the Internet gave us all the answers, still a proud moment for me. Most of my DOS/Command Line skills were learned trying to run this game, skills that I still use to this day. And if ever I actually write a horror story, this game will have had it's hand in this as well.\n\nThe 20th Anniversary Edition comes with glossy modern graphics, new voice acting and the story we all loved 20 years ago. It also comes with the same point-and-click gameplay it originally had. Whereas some would qualify it as classic, others would call this style of gameplay archaic. The action is slow with you clicking on something and waiting for the animation to bring the character there before doing whatever you were asking. Puzzles, which make up the bulk of the challenges, are a mixed bag. Though you'll find many to work intuitively, some are obtuse, and a few are horribly frustrating. Luckily, a new hint system was imbedded in the menu structure to give a helping hand when you need it without having to resort to the net (or a certain guide...). Unfortunately, the worst offenders require trial and error and a good bit of luck to solve, even if you know the answer. These bog down the game and will lead some to never finish the title. Which would be quite a shame. On a plus side, they modernized the interface. Though we lost the nice, atmospheric icons of the original, changing it from having them all grouped up at the top of the screen to a direct contextual ring upon selection is definitely a move that needed to be made.\n\nAs I stated, the graphics were changed. Gone is the pixel art of the original. In it's stead we have new 3D High Res graphics to play with. Overall, the new graphics are rather pretty and well made, with generally smooth animation in the movements and interactions. However, I do miss the original and wish a \u201cclassic\u201d mode had been included (though I'm not sure if they could have done this legally). Your millage may vary but players used to modern day graphics should appreciate the update. Each locale you visit is interesting, distinct and memorable and the art team did a great job of updating these. New Orleans really comes to life, from the French quarter to the bayou. Note that I did notice a few, very minor, graphical issues in my play-through. The game also features a few cutscenes. These, part graphic novel and part animation, are truly stunning works to behold. \n\nOne update that I'm very happy with is the music. Re-orchestrated and re-mastered by the original composer, Robert Holmes, it is one of the highlights of this experience. I liked the music back when it was played through a not-Sound Blaster, so you can imagine how much I love the updated tracks. Luckily, I per-ordered the game and received the original sound track as a bonus. Each location you visit has a distinct musical track associated with it, giving as much to the games atmosphere as the visuals. It's so that you could almost play the game with you're eyes closed. I wish more games today would go the extra mile and bring the aural part of their games on par with the visuals like this one. \n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the voice acting is something I have trouble with. Now, this isn't to question the change in cast members. The game originally featured such talent as Tim Curry, Mark Hamil and Michael Dorn. With a low budget and 20 year old recordings, they had to get some new actors. For the most part, I felt the players were fine. Unfortunately, the two main voices you'll hear in the game, Gabriel and the narrator, are points of contention. I originally played the game on floppy disks, so I had no voice acting. So all I had was my imagination as to what our protagonist sounded like. What you hear in game is about a thousand leagues away from that. I don't feel it fits the character all that well but I did get used to it. Of course, upon looking up what the original sounded like, I can't say I Tim Curry was any closer to my imagination either. The narrator is another situation as well. They kept the same idea as the original, a New Orleans accented lady to add to the atmosphere. But yeah, no, I can't say it was that great of an idea on either case. At times, the narrator sounds tired or bored and the rest of the time the accent just gets grating, especially when you can't find the solution to a puzzle. Of course, you can always mute the narrator if you'd like. Still, as stated, the rest of the voice acting was fine.\n \nFor me, the highest of the high points in this game is the story and characters. The story is fully enjoyable, blending elements of magic and occultism from the old world and the new in a fashion that's still pretty unique. The things you do and the places you visit and why all form a very interesting arc between good and evil, past and present, and love and duty. The main characters are likewise well developed and realized, showing more than one trope or dimension. I played through this more than once when I was young and still enjoyed the story and characters this time around. \n\nUltimately, this version of the game suffers from the same problems and issues that it has always suffered from. And I'm not sure how authentic it would have been if they had been removed. I can say that if you're a fan of old school point-and-click adventure games and their unique sense of logic, or if you were a fan of the original but can't play it anymore cause one of the disk died on you (still sad about it), you should check this out.

Et je me suis fais un plaisir d'aller retrouver le plus possible de lieu du jeu pour voir comment ils \u00e9taient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9.\nVous vous en foutez probablement, mais je ne raconte pas \u00e7a pour rien ! J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s impressionn\u00e9, plus de 20 ans plus tard, par le travail de recherche effectu\u00e9 par Jane Jensen, tant dans les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences historiques que dans la restitution des lieux embl\u00e9matiques de la ville. C'est rarement tr\u00e8s fid\u00e8le, mais l'ambiance est toujours suffisament bien restitu\u00e9e pour qu'on reconnaisse.\n\nEncore aujourd'hui, j'aurais recommand\u00e9 la version de 93 si elle \u00e9tait toujours \u00e9dit\u00e9e.\n\nEt voil\u00e0 que d\u00e9barque ce remake HD ! Quel bonheur.\n\nRevisiter tous ces lieux avec des graphismes remis au go\u00fbt du jour a \u00e9t\u00e9 un vrai r\u00e9gal. Le jeu n'a rien perdu de son int\u00e9r\u00eat. En fait, il a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 am\u00e9lior\u00e9 quelque peu. Certains passages pas tr\u00e8s logique ont \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement remani\u00e9s.\nPar exemple (attention l\u00e9ger spoil) : un professeur se fait tuer car il a r\u00e9colt\u00e9 des informations sensibles. Dans la version d'origine, les notes sont \u00e9parpill\u00e9es sur le bureau. C'est contestable, si ces infos avaient conduit \u00e0 tuer, elles auraient d\u00fb disparaitre ! La nouvelle version corrige ce point. Ca n'est qu'un petit exemple. Plusieurs changements de ce genre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 op\u00e9r\u00e9s. Certains lieux ne sont plus accessibles sans qu'on aie une r\u00e9elle raison d'y aller. Certains objets sont un peu moins faciles \u00e0 se procurer. Quelques nouvelles \u00e9nigmes se sont gliss\u00e9es de ci de l\u00e0. Quelques nouvelles sc\u00e8nes aussi (celle du comissariat jour 7, classe !)\nDu coup, m\u00eame en connaissant la version de 93 par coeur, on red\u00e9couvre des choses avec plaisir.\n\nLe jeu me semble refait en utilisant le moteur de Gray Matter (le dernier jeu de Jane Jensen). Ses points forts : des jolies sc\u00e8nes de coupe effet 2D fa\u00e7on BD, une animation tr\u00e8s correcte, de tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s jolis d\u00e9cors, de chouettes visages anim\u00e9s lors des dialogues (sauf celui de Gabriel, qui est chelou). Ses points faibles : une UI pas super moderne et un l\u00e9ger lag dans les contr\u00f4les, pas vraiment g\u00e9nant, mais parfois un peu aga\u00e7ant.\n\nPetite d\u00e9ception, les musiques sont de qualit\u00e9 in\u00e9gales. Le th\u00e8me principale est puissant, et souvent efficacement d\u00e9clin\u00e9, fait bien son office... mais parfois, une piste d\u00e9gueu ou une musique peu appropri\u00e9e gache un peu l'ambiance.\nC'est d'autant plus regrettable que la musique fait vraiment partie de la culture de la nouvelle Orl\u00e9ans et qu'il y avait beaucoup \u00e0 lui emprunter pour ce jeu. Rien de dramatique toutefois. J'aurais juste esp\u00e9r\u00e9 le m\u00eame effort sur la musique que sur les graphismes.\n\nAutre am\u00e9lioration : la traduction fran\u00e7aise. Elle n'est pas parfaite, il y'a plein de fautes grossi\u00e8res (messieurs les traducteurs, il va falloir arreter de m\u00e9langer infinitif et participes pass\u00e9, c'est niveau CE1). Mais au moins elle est compr\u00e9hensible, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas toujours le cas de la version de 93.\nCeux qui y ont jou\u00e9 se rappelleront par exemple de l'option \"compl\u00e8te la\" lors du dialogue avec la Grand M\u00e8re de Gabriel (au lieu de \"complimente l\u00e0\")...\n\nBref : il n'est pas parfait, mais c'est un des meilleurs Point&Click qui a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, et ce remake est parfait qu'il s'agisse de red\u00e9couvrir ce jeu l\u00e9gendaire, ou pour plonger pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans l'ambiance mystique de NOLA.\n\nVoil\u00e0, maintenant j'ai encore plus envie d'y retourner...", "timestamp_created": 1414093577, "timestamp_updated": 1414093577, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.757093", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12600195": {"recommendationid": "12600195", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999864964", "num_games_owned": 1302, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1396, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1415596623}, "language": "english", "review": "Despite being a huge Sierra On-Line fan, I'll admit that I didn't know about the Gabriel Knight series until Jane Jensen's Kickstarter in 2012.

Granted, Tim Curry playing a good ol' Cajun gent with the body of a 12-year old boy (in-game reference) was a little off-putting, but I've always been a fan of the 'So-bad-it's-good' school of doing things. The story was darker than most Sierra titles at the time, and I was immediately hooked. Sadly, the older that game got, the harder it was to run on progressively newer machines. \n\nBut then, there were two. This new version is appropriately advanced in form and function. There are a few new puzzles, and entirely new voice cast. Rather than reinvent the wheel, the new cast attempts with differing levels of success, to emulate the original cast. I actually found Malia's VO to be fairly weak, and the Dragon soundd kinda 'eh', but all in all, it was a splendid auditory experience. The updates make sense, and I love what Jane and Co have done to give the game a richer, more vibrant NOLA feel. Robert Holmes' remastered soundtrack is awesome as ever, though I do miss the original St. George's theme. Except for a few weird bugs, my time playing the game (two consecutive playthroughs thusfar) has been largely very enjoyable. \n\nFor fans of Sierra's old school adventure games, and/or fans of occult/horror adventure games, whether or not they are Sierra fans, this title should be a no-brainer. The puzzles are logic-based, but fairly simple, and the game will probably leave a lasting impression. It did for me.

I wasn't wrong.\n\nThe remake is competent enough.  Many of the visuals - which is the key thing the remake has been sold on - are very pretty and the cutscenes in particular are excellent (though I would have liked a way to disable the speech balloons).  The voice acting is solid and, once I got used to the new voices, very much enjoyed them,  The story and characters still hold up while - for the most part - the puzzles are not too obtuse.  There are some animation issues and the quality of the backgrounds is not always consistent (I really don't like Jackson Square at all) but I didn't find these things too problematic.  So if you enjoy adventure games and have never played the original, then I suspect you will find the game worth the price of entry.\n\nBut if you *have* played the original game I'd suggest caution, for at least in my case the remake does not improve upon it and, in fact, is inferior in several ways.  Critical here are the visuals.  While the original game managed to produce a mood perfect for the story through its dark backgrounds and strong use of contrast, the brightness and colour of the backgrounds in the remake fail to do the same.  An exception here must be made for the cutscenes which, in contrast, do an excellent job capturing the mood of the story.  Yet, ironically, this only serves to highlight the absence of atmosphere in the rest of the game.  This is most clearly demonstrated in the final scene (no spilers) which slips between cutscenes and regular gameplay.  Here, the cutscenes do all of the work while each shift back to regular gameplay spoils the tension that has been produced by them.\n\nIn addition to this, changes in the pacing of the game also disrupt its mood.  Access to areas of the game is more staggered than in the original, which helps spread out the content of the game more evenly but also - for me anyway - takes away from the world-building at the outset of the game.  Moreover, minor additions to the game's content (a few small puzzles and scenes) are often out of place and stand out as obvious bolt-ons with little or no necessity (the very minor scene at the Wright family tomb, for example, left me astounded by its pointlessness).  I also found the music disappointing compared with the original (though perhaps this is simply because I grew up in the '90s and have acquired an unreasonable fondness for midi tracks!).\n\nHow to conclude, then?  If you like adventure games and have never played the original, you should buy this.  If you have played the original and are interested (like me) in seeing first hand how the game was reworked, or if you would like to play Gabriel Knight again but find its old interface or graphics a deal-breaker, then you should buy the game.  But if you are wanting this game to recapture the spirit and character of the original, then I do not recommend it.

You can argue that it looks better, sounds better because of the original Hollywood cast, and maybe even plays better.\n\nBut all that said, the 20th anniversary edition of the game is a perfectly fine version to play if you want something that is a bit more modern.  Built in hints, some light commentary on each screen of the game, and some UI overhauls make the game a bit more accessible than the original.  As a remake, it's well done.\n\nBut regardless of which version you pick up, Gabriel Knight is unequivocally one of the best adventure games in the genre.  You play as the eponymous Gabriel Knight, a novelist who gets involved with a series of murders in New Orleans.  As Gabriel learns more about the case, he also learns more about his own mysterious past, including the madness that claimed his father's life.  It's a compelling combination of a crime procedural with the supernatural world of Voodoo and Gabriel's dark and mysterious past.  It really is a great story to watch/read through, and it's the reason why Jane Jensen and this game in particular is celebrated among adventure game fans.\n\nThe adventure game part of it is fun as well, with some clever puzzles and interesting solutions.  There's nothing as frustrating as the infamous Gabriel Knight 3 mustache puzzle, so you don't have to worry about getting stuck.  And even if you do get stuck, the hint system in the game will get you moving on to the next great story beat if you just want to move on and experience the story.\n\nThis game is a classic and definitely worth playing if you have any interest in the genre.

So I was hesitant to try this remake, especially after the disappointing Moebius.\n\nHowever, I greatly enjoyed this. I prefer the original, but this remake has its merits.\n\nIn short? I recommend the original game, which you can get on Good Old Games. It's a good remake, but not worth full price. It's worth getting on a sale, though.\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic graphics and art design. The character and location remodels are drop-dead gorgeous. They're a massive improvement to the original game. Where the game especially shines is in the panelled, graphic novel style cutscenes that made the original game so memorable. All are recreated with gusto and there are many more new ones that turn previous in-game cutscenes into the graphic novel style. The updated graphics and art style alone are worth the price of admission.\n-The voice work is quite good. I was worried, since Phoenix Online couldn't use the original voice work, but the new cast does a fine job. For the most part. I'll get to that.\n-A small handful of puzzles have been reworked. About half a dozen. Two, in particular, are very nice changes: where Gabriel needs to change his looks, and somewhere he needs to break into.The latter is incredibly creepy.\n\nCons:\n-Some animations are awkward. Sometimes, the characters stifly spin on the spot like \"tank controls\" of older 3D third person games. They're rare, fortunately. There are other moments where the 3D animation is choppy or awkward, but it's still a massive improvement from Moebius.\n-While most of the voice acting is good, there are times it feels very stiff and unnatural compared to the original game. Little, intricate details in line delivery is lost at times. I loved Tim Curry's delivery of a German poem, but this voice actor's delivery is very deadpan. Some of Mark Hamil's little ways of spicing up Mosely's characters are lost, which hurts the character's presentation. I'm biased, though, given my love for the original.\n-As I said, about half a dozen puzzles have been redone. Some, unfortunately, have absolutely infuriating, immersion-breaking logic puzzles like something out of Myst. One puzzle gives little indication of what to do (a tiny, barely readable guide in a the bottom corner of the screen).

The things that stand out as most noticably changed are solidly changed for the better.  The new castle design is a huge improvement over the cartoony original and links to GK2 fantastically.  The brief but powerful story edits at the police station are wonderful.  The only change I do have mixed feelings about is the much more rigorous pacing control seen in this version.  The original version generally resulted in a painfully difficult and long Day 1, but then rocketed up the tension and pace in later days.

I have all the original ones both on CD and on digital versions from gog.com, and I was thrilled when Phoenix Online were going to remake the game.\n\nOverall it's a very good remake, though there are some things that I had to get used to. For one, the voice actors are all good, but I do miss Tim Curry as Gabriel Knight. The characters look good, though the dialogue graphics can be a bit weird. The heads are very wobbly and it does look a bit weird. Autosave is a good thing that helps since the game froze up for me once, and there is a hint system for those who have trouble.\n\nOne of the good things are some new puzzles added, though they aren't that hard, and one of them is tedious with no real reason at best.\nSchloss Ritter has been changed to resemble the one you see in the sequel, and that was kind of nice.\n\nIf you like adventure games, then this is a game for you.

T\u00e4ll\u00e4 osa-alueella muutokset ovat kumminkin omalla tavallaan v\u00e4h\u00e4isi\u00e4. Vanhat midi-pohjaiset musiikit on tuotu uudelle vuosituhannelle nauhoittamalla ne uudelleen oikeilla soittimilla. Musiikki tukee edelleen erinomaisesti peli\u00e4, mutta itsell\u00e4ni takaraivossa koko ajan tuntui silt\u00e4 kuin musiikki olisi nopeutunut temmoltaan huomattavasti.\n\n\nGraafinen uudistus varmasti pist\u00e4\u00e4 ensimm\u00e4isen\u00e4 pelaajan silm\u00e4\u00e4n. Maalatut taustat eiv\u00e4t ole staattisia, vaan taustoissa on pieni\u00e4 liikkuvia nyansseja, kuten tuulessa liikkuvat lehdet tai suolla nouseva sumu. Taustojen tarkkuuden kasvun my\u00f6t\u00e4 etsitt\u00e4v\u00e4t esineet tulevat my\u00f6s paremmin esille.

T\u00e4m\u00e4 novelli valoitta hieman historian tapahtumia sek\u00e4 sit\u00e4, mit\u00e4 tekemist\u00e4 voodoolla ja Schattenj\u00e4gereill\u00e4 on toistensa kanssa. Uusi versio uskaltaa olla erilainen, silti s\u00e4ilytt\u00e4en kaiken hyv\u00e4n alkuper\u00e4isest\u00e4 versioista. Nostalgiassa rypev\u00e4lle uudistukset saattavat olla kauhistuksia ja h\u00e4v\u00e4istyksi\u00e4, mutta sarjaan ensimm\u00e4ist\u00e4 kertaa tutustuva p\u00e4\u00e4see uusioversion my\u00f6t\u00e4 nauttimaan nykystandardien mukaisesta pelikokemuksesta. Itse suurena sarjan fanina olen tyytyv\u00e4inen uudistuksiin. Pienet tekniset ongelmat haittasivat jotain ihmisi\u00e4 pelin ilmestyess\u00e4, mutta POS hoitaa asiaa varmasti p\u00e4ivitt\u00e4m\u00e4ll\u00e4 peli\u00e4 ajan my\u00f6t\u00e4.

The fade in and out scenes were part of the original game, and the added feature to just go to the map from the menu bar is a nice little feature. The added puzzles and how some events and items are re-arranged gives veteran players of the series a bit more of a challenge.\n\nThe character portraits while speaking with characters was a feature of the original game. They could have been done a little better, but I am not going to go off on a tirade and say they are god awful. The voice acting, I can see what they were going for. They were trying to be as faithful to the original version of the game as possible. I appreciate the effort of the new voice actors, as they had to live up to high expectations.\n\nI have encountered a bug where I will pick up the envelope from the police station, and its contents disappear, along with anything else I picked up earlier (the hair-gel and the black shirt). I had to go back and re-play picking up all of these items and keep my fingers crossed that they stay in my inventory or show up on the day that they will be needed for.\n\nAside from the bug and minor 3D problems (sometimes Gabriel's foot will go through the counter at St. George's Books, a minor irk) , the game is incredibly faithful to the original. The new puzzles are a welcome addition, and the cut-scenes appearing like a graphic novel are just beautiful. I recommend this game to those who play the original, or those who would like a trip back to 1993, when Adventure games were in their glory.\n", "timestamp_created": 1413478753, "timestamp_updated": 1413478753, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523211", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12511492": {"recommendationid": "12511492", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023024672", "num_games_owned": 1270, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414650466}, "language": "english", "review": "As great as the original release was, the 20th anniversary edition blows it out of the water.

S\u00e3o ra\u00edzes profundas do g\u00eanero e h\u00e1 muito esquecidas, caracter\u00edsticas que desapareceram repentinamente com o surgimento de [url=http://www.gameblast.com.br/2014/09/the-secret-of-monkey-island-pc.html]The Secret of Monkey Island[/url] (PC) e outros cl\u00e1ssicos da LucasArts. N\u00e3o \u00e9 de se espantar, considerando que o jogo foi feito originalmente pela Sierra Entertainment, infame por seus adventures extremamente dif\u00edceis.\n\nH\u00e1, por exemplo, um sistema de pontua\u00e7\u00e3o, algo que n\u00e3o via em aventuras gr\u00e1ficas desde Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (PC). Cada opera\u00e7\u00e3o efetuada lhe concede pontos, sendo necess\u00e1rio executar v\u00e1rias a\u00e7\u00f5es opcionais e secretas para atingir o placar m\u00e1ximo. Existem eventos que terminam em morte, acabando prematuramente com a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Gabriel a n\u00e3o ser que se execute as a\u00e7\u00f5es certas na hora certa. E, claro, h\u00e1 quebra-cabe\u00e7as quase imposs\u00edveis de se resolver, que lhe far\u00e3o arrancar os cabelos procurando a solu\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nMas essas conven\u00e7\u00f5es antigas do g\u00eanero n\u00e3o deixam o jogo com aspecto arcaico. Elas s\u00e3o usadas com parcim\u00f4nia, comedidas com decis\u00f5es de design modernas. Os quebra-cabe\u00e7as s\u00e3o bem integrados com o mundo, trama e situa\u00e7\u00f5es e mesmo os desafios mais dif\u00edceis n\u00e3o s\u00e3o desumanos.\n\nElogios em especial devem ser dados ao est\u00fadio Pinkerton Road, que criou uma interface simples, f\u00e1cil de usar e que permite executar as a\u00e7\u00f5es com o menor n\u00famero de cliques poss\u00edvel. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m um bot\u00e3o que revela todos os objetos interativos do cen\u00e1rio, acabando a \u201cca\u00e7a aos p\u00edxels\u201d t\u00e3o comuns em point-and-clicks antigos.\n\n[b]Como um bom livro[/b]\n\nOutra caracter\u00edstica \u00fanica das aventuras gr\u00e1ficas antigas era a grande aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o com a literatura. Provavelmente devido \u00e0 import\u00e2ncia fundamental da hist\u00f3ria nesses tipos de jogos, eles sempre foram fortemente influenciados pelas artes liter\u00e1rias, usando muitos de seus clich\u00eas e artif\u00edcios \u2014 pelo menos at\u00e9 o lan\u00e7amento de The Dig para PCs, em 1995, escrito por Steven Spielberg, que aproximou o g\u00eanero da cinematografia.\n\nEsta rela\u00e7\u00e3o fica muito evidente em Gabriel Knight pela presen\u00e7a \u00fanica de uma narradora, que descreve objetos, cen\u00e1rios, situa\u00e7\u00f5es e a\u00e7\u00f5es e pensamentos de Gabriel. Ela acaba sendo uma personagem por si s\u00f3, com personalidade pr\u00f3pria, cheia de ironias e sarcasmos pontuais e perfeitos para cada situa\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nAssim como todos os outros personagens, ela \u00e9 forte e bem escrita. Jane Jensen, a roteirista e game designer do jogo, realmente abusa de seus dotes liter\u00e1rios e os constr\u00f3i muito bem atrav\u00e9s dos di\u00e1logos. N\u00e3o apenas Gabriel, o protagonista, mas todos que aparecem no decorrer da hist\u00f3ria t\u00eam personalidade e carisma.\nFalando em hist\u00f3ria, ela \u00e9 fant\u00e1stica. A trama pertence a um g\u00eanero raro hoje em dia: terror.\n\nH\u00e1 muitos jogos modernos (e livros e filmes tamb\u00e9m) de horror, contando com situa\u00e7\u00f5es macabras das quais o jogador precisa fugir ou sobreviver. Mas terror, o medo de que algo horr\u00edvel possa acontecer e a luta desesperada para evitar isto a todo custo, tornou-se uma raridade. Gabriel Knight pertence a este seleto grupo, criando um clima de mist\u00e9rio e preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o genu\u00ednos desde o in\u00edcio, com a primeira cutscene do game. Em alguns momentos a trama at\u00e9 flerta com o horror, exibindo situa\u00e7\u00f5es com viol\u00eancia mais gr\u00e1ficas (principalmente perto do final), mas sem perder a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o de suspense que permeia a aventura.\n\nO visual fant\u00e1stico intensifica ainda mais este clima. Os cen\u00e1rios em HD, desenhados \u00e0 m\u00e3o e cheios de detalhes, s\u00e3o um deleite para os olhos \u2014 mesmo os mais macabros, cheios de elementos m\u00f3rbidos, impressionam pela excel\u00eancia da dire\u00e7\u00e3o de arte. Destaque especial deve ser dado \u00e0s anima\u00e7\u00f5es das cutscenes. Seguindo um estilo de hist\u00f3ria em quadrinhos, aparecem nos momentos de cl\u00edmax da trama e s\u00e3o muito bem feitas.\n\nAcompanhando a excel\u00eancia musical, temos a trilha sonora. Um texto inteiro poderia ser feito para analis\u00e1-la. H\u00e1 uma faixa para cada ambiente e todas elas ficam grudadas na cabe\u00e7a. Robert Holmes tornou-se automaticamente um dos meus compositores de m\u00fasica de videogame favoritos.\n\n[b]Ca\u00e7ando sombras[/b]\n\nClaro, Gabriel Knight possui seus defeitos. Os modelos poligonais dos personagens, por exemplo, em certos momentos entram em conflito com os cen\u00e1rios desenhados \u00e0 m\u00e3o e frequentemente atravessam o vale da estranheza. A anima\u00e7\u00e3o deles \u00e9 prec\u00e1ria e suas express\u00f5es faciais, bizarras. O trabalho de voz, apesar de competente na maior parte do tempo, conta com alguns momentos constrangedores \u2014 principalmente nas cenas mais dram\u00e1ticas. E alguns quebra-cabe\u00e7as\u2026 Bem, apenas digamos que a inclus\u00e3o de um sistema de dicas foi muito bem-vinda.\n\nApesar de seus erros, as qualidades se sobressaem. Gabriel Knight n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma aventura gr\u00e1fica perfeita, mas com certeza \u00e9 um dos melhores t\u00edtulos do g\u00eanero.\n\n[b]Pr\u00f3s[/b]\n[list][*]Lindos cen\u00e1rios desenhados \u00e0 m\u00e3o;\n[*]Hist\u00f3ria intrigante e bem escrita;\n[*]Personagens carism\u00e1ticos;\n[*]Excelente jogabilidade point-and-click;\n[*]Trilha sonora fenomenal.[/list]\n\n[b]Contras[/b]\n[list][*]Atua\u00e7\u00e3o de voz fraca em algumas cenas;\n[*]Conflito entre os modelos poligonais dos personagens e cen\u00e1rios desenhados \u00e0 m\u00e3o;[/list]\n\n[b][u]Nota: 9,0[/u][/b]", "timestamp_created": 1413421983, "timestamp_updated": 1413422019, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12505072": {"recommendationid": "12505072", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123188375", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1037, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479133078}, "language": "german", "review": "Gabriel Knight - f\u00fcr Geschichtenliebhaber, Nostalgiker und Knobelfans ein wunderbares Spielerlebnis\n\nDie Spiele der Neunziger waren einfach klasse! Urban Runner, Monkey Island, Zork Nemesis, ... - die ersten Computerspiele meiner Eltern. Nat\u00fcrlich war auch Gabriel Knight dabei: The Beast Within sorgte f\u00fcr den ein oder anderen Albtraum in meiner Kindheit. Es dauerte n\u00e4mlich nicht lange, da fielen die CDs in meine H\u00e4nde, und so sollten diese Spiele auch meine ersten Tage mit dem Computer pr\u00e4gen. Click and Point Adventure nennt man diese Spiele heute, oder? Damals, ich bin mir ziemlich sicher, waren es einfach normale Computerspiele...\n\nDurch einen dummen Zufall bin ich nun auf Sins of the Fathers gesto\u00dfen, was mir Anlass genug ist, meine erste Bewertung \u00fcberhaupt zu schreiben:\n\nIn SotF spielt man Gabriel Knight, den mehr oder weniger erfolgreichen Schriftsteller und Buchh\u00e4ndler, der sich in die Vodoo Morde von New Orleans einklinkt, um f\u00fcr sein n\u00e4chstes Werk zu recherchieren. Jedoch bleibt er nicht lange unbeteiligt, denn die immer selbigen Albtr\u00e4ume suchen ihn Nacht f\u00fcr Nacht heim. Da bei diesem Spiel die Geschichte im Vordergrund steht, verzichte ich hier auf alle weiteren Vorwegnahmen, die \u00fcber den \u00fcblichen Klappentext hinaus gehen. \n\nDas Spielerlebnis ist unangefochten und fesselt ein jeden Geschichtenliebhaber. Der Spieler muss kombinieren, Informationen sammeln, Zeugen verh\u00f6ren, R\u00e4tsel l\u00f6sen... Ich kann mich noch erinnern - damals konnte es mehrere Tage dauern, bis man ein R\u00e4stel gel\u00f6st hat; wenn man nicht gerade das L\u00f6sungsbuch auf dem Schreibtisch liegen hatte, musste man eben weiterdenken. Im Internet schnell mal den entscheidenden Tipp holen oder ein sogenanntes \"Walkthrough\" anschauen, gab es einfach nicht. Hier ist Gabriel Knight anders geworden. Kommt man nicht weiter, kann man sich bequem einen Tipp holen. Vielleicht gar nicht so verkehrt und von den Entwicklern weitergedacht. Die hartgesottenen Nostalgiker und Knight-Reihen-Fans, k\u00f6nnen auch weiterhin \u00fcber Tage hinweg \u00fcber dem ein und selben R\u00e4tsel br\u00fcten.\n\nWas hat sich zu fr\u00fcher noch ver\u00e4ndert? Die Grafik ist wesentlich h\u00fcbscher geworden! Nat\u00fcrlich hatte der damalige Pixelbrei seinen Charme und zog den Spieler in den Bann. SotF ist komplett in eine 3D-Grafik umgewandelt worden und sieht einfach besser aus. Auch akkustisch unters\u00fctzt die immer passende Musik die Szenerie bzw. Orte und versetzt den Spieler noch weiter in die Stimmung der Geschichte. Die Sprachausgabe erfolgt auf Englisch, was eigentlich kein Problem ist. Untertitel k\u00f6nnen zur Not auch eingestellt werden. Aber das war nicht alles:\n\nAuch die Entwickler hatten ihren Spa\u00df an diesem Spiel. Und das merkt man. Warum sonst, sollte man diesen Titel nochmals aus dem Archiv holen? An jedem Ort kann man durch einen Button die Extras aufrufen. Dann werden Skizzen, Interviews und alte Szenen von der Originalausgabe gezeigt sowie damalige Entwickler vorgestellt. Es scheint wahrhaftig ein Herzensprojekt gewesen zu sein. Fast jedes Objekt kann an den Orten ausgew\u00e4hlt werden. Es gibt die altbewehrten Aktionen \"ansehen\", \"manipulieren/untersuchen\", \"nehmen\" und \"kombinieren\". Zu jedem Objekt gibt die mir sehr sympathische Erz\u00e4hlerin einen Kommentar ab, teilweise urkomisch! M\u00f6chte man beispielsweise den dicken Polizisten am Empfang des Reviers \"nehmen\", fragt Knight den Spieler nach einem Gabelstabler. Oder die Erz\u00e4hlerin erkl\u00e4rt, weshalb Knight seinen Schreibtisch vom Sperrm\u00fcll hat.\nAuch die Gespr\u00e4che mit den Personen sind nicht stur oder d\u00fcnn. Wenn man Lust und Laune hat, kann man sich gut (gef\u00fchlte) zehn bis zwanzig Minuten mit den Charakteren unterhalten - muss man aber nicht. Ebenso wird ein E-Comic mitgeliefert, das ich mir jedoch noch nicht angesehen habe, da eine \"Spoilerwarnung\" vom Spiel ausgesprochen wurde.\n\nDas Spiel erz\u00e4hlt eine Geschichte. Das ist seine Aufgabe. Und die erf\u00fcllt es. \n\nDie Entwickler haben ein lebendiges New Orleans erschaffen, indem es immer wieder etwas zu entdecken gibt. Dieses Remake ist in liebevollster Kleinarbeit entstanden und bietet jedem, der sich auf dieses Spiel einl\u00e4sst, ein paar wundersch\u00f6ne Spielstunden. Ein bisschen \"Fr\u00fcher\" eben. Und doch, so zeigt dieses Spiel, war damals nicht alles besser. \n\nVon mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung.

set in new orleans circles around theme of voodoo - is still as engaging as it ever was. and this should do as an overall summary - it is still the sins of the fathers that we know and love, only it looks better and works better with modern systems.\n\nit's very nice in the art department, both being faithful to the original and enhancing on the original with added details - a lot of which seem to be from original designs but not implemented in original (mostly for technical reasons like art and display resolution).\n\nsoundtrack matches closely to what's been done to the art. it is the same yet improved. and it is really good.\n\nvoice acting quality tends to vary. occasionally it is really good, occasionally it is not good and most of the time it lingers somewhere around good. at times actors seem to be trying too hard to emulate the mannerisms of the dialogs in original game. not a bad thing in itself but a bit too obvious. acknowledging that it is very very difficult to top the voice acting of main characters from the original gabriel knight I cannot really blame the remake to fall a little short in this area. what we have in the game is still a respectable result.\n\ntechnically, it's not bad. unfortunately, it does have the downsides.\n\nlarge resolutions are supported and it works at 1080p (and higher) without problems. not related to resolutions but aspect ratio - some images look out of place with widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio - both studio's and game's logos in the beginning looked just a little bit off.\n\nanimation is stiff and feels unpolished. wooden gabriel walking around is not too bad but in the first day introduction seeing grace walking into the stairs and then slowly rising above it (while she was the only moving thing on the screen, grabbing attention) left a strong impression of game needing just a bit more polish.\n\ntutorials are quick and simple but great and do give a small overview both to new and old players of how the ui works.\n\nadding labels to the actionable items on screen when pressing onscreen button or space is a great idea and a good way to remove pixelhunting (especially as this never was the point of gabriel knight games).\n\nunfortunately, there are issues with the ui as well. at times, after action or listening to a description, the game waits for a few seconds before allowing the next action. when skipping an action (not too uncommon with some items giving multiple descriptions on repeated views/actions) it gets more common. this also seems to depend on the area/screen, in the very beginning of the game, inside of the cabinet was a bad offender. an additional related problem - having clicked on a hotspot, the only way to continue is to select an action, there does not seem to be a way to cancel.\n\nclicking to skip/fast forward lines is unreliable, often skipping multiple lines of dialogue. it seems that due to the way skipping is implemented cursor basically jumps around on the screen (to the skip button and back to where it was before, sometimes missing the target on the latter) and quick clicking is thus discouraged.\n\nas a bonus, especially for fans of the original, there is extra material for each scene - concept art, artwork, comparisons of the remake and the original, interviews etc.\n\nfor an adventure fan, this is a definite recommendation. for everyone else - give it a shot and you might be pleasantly surprised.", "timestamp_created": 1413395543, "timestamp_updated": 1413398750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607283", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12501911": {"recommendationid": "12501911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023221061", "num_games_owned": 479, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487630272}, "language": "english", "review": "I agree with main character voice acting problem, this one slightly annoying, the first one was so much better.

Gabriel might be too much of a playboy at first, but he got better towards the end. And the other characters are insteresting enough and offer voice acting that I can't complain about. I really didn't like the narrator, though. Her voice can be turned off, however.\n\nThe story is also interesting from beginning to end, although I found Gabriels relationship to Malia highly unrealistic.\nAnd for an adventure game, it offers a whole lot of puzzles, all of  which are logical enough to be solved without having to endlessly wreck your brain. I hated the pantomine, however. And deciphering some of the codes towards the end took me a while.\n\nBut if you're ever stuck, the game offers a hint-system with multiple levels. It doesn't offer solutions on a silver platter, but gets you far enough to proceed. Except for day 4, where I found myself wandering around aimlessly as I had no idea how to solve a specific puzzle until I decided to look at a certain book again.\n\nThese comfort-features do have a downside, though. Their implementation is lacking.\n\nShow all hotspots - plasters terms all over the screen instead of showing subtle hints\nSkip through dialogue - speeds up the game, which is very noticeable at times. Also can lead to skipping multiple lines of text\nRun to a specific spot - run? Gabriel doesn't run. He teleports!\nContinue - does not continue from your last save but from an autosave at the last map you visited\n\nIt does have a few good features, however. If you click on an exit, the screen fades out almost instantly. And you can get to the worldmap from almost any screen. Important dialogue is also marked. And the journal contains extra-features for every map, like interviews, artworks etc...\n\nI'm sure I could mention more, but I've already written a whole review in German :D\n\nIf you've never played Gabriel Knight, I don't see a reason not to buy this version.

It was full of adult humor and powered by a dark mystery surrounding voodoo. HD Remakes are now the nature of the game, and Gabriel Knight is next to get its upgrade. It does away with the 2D visuals of the first game and takes its steps into a fully realized 3D world.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t know about the story of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, it follows a charismatic novelist who gets involved in a murder case. He\u2019s been having terrible dreams that depict him dying a specific death, and soon he\u2019ll discover that they lead to even more problems. Gabriel will travel across the city investigating the \"Voodoo Murders\" for his book. He will find love and intrigue as he tries to discover the secret behind the murders in New Orleans.\n\nThe Anniversary Edition makes some major changes from the original. The visual bump from 2D to 3D is the obvious change, with many of the key areas and characters re-imagined for higher resolutions. Even the comic book scenes have been changed to include better art and speech baloons. It definitely looks much better than the classic version, but it loses all of the nostalgia factor for those that have already played it. Despite a few odd animations when moving around the title is a beautiful recreation of the classic.\n\nInteracting with objects and moving around the city is easier than ever. Simply double tapping an area will teleport Gabriel to a certain point in the room. A new icon now allows players to quickly leave an area and head to the world map at any time. No more waiting through long animations to wait for in a game with tons of backtracking.\n\nThat's a staple of classic adventure games but this HD remake makes some changes to how the story unravels. Certain aspects of the story and puzzles are shifted around among the various days. For example, in the original game Gabriel would visit his grandmother on the first day. In the new version he doesn't visit her until the week is nearly over. It's subtle little changes like this that adds a welcome freshness to a familiar story.\n\nFans of the classic will notice that the voices have changed for many of their favorite characters. Anyone that has played the original would be familiar with the popping and static in the original game. Sadly, Tim Curry, Mark Hamil, and many others were not able to re-record their voices. Instead, they have been replaced by a whole new cast who try to replicate the voices as much as they can. They do a fairly great job at sounding like the original characters, and some voices actually sound better than the original. The only change I miss is Leah Remini's fiesty run as Grace Nakamura.\n\nThe upgraded animations are the best improvements to the title. You can actually tell what everyone is actually doing on-screen. It comes at a small sacrifice however, as there are zones where the world feels less alive because of ambience removal. The crime scene was hectic when Gabriel reaches the location in the first game, but it seems much calmer in the upgraded version. Also, the police station doesn\u2019t have that lively hustle and bustle about it anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s good that the upgraded puzzle design outweighs a few removed animations. No more randomly clicking on pixels to find a snake scale in the sand. U.I. upgrades and of course cleaner graphics improve the experience from the original. The puzzles in Gabriel Knight have always been well thought-out (besides that awful clock puzzle.) Now Gabriel has a journal to keep up with current events for the day, and if all else fails a new hint system is in place to help players push through the story.\n\nMy only real complaints come from the puzzles that allow players to clear manual input. Some of them have incredibly long strings, but the player will only be able to clear all the text instead of deleting a single character. Another problem I have is the strange speech baloons during the comic book cutscenes. Maybe it is the extensions that block the visuals on screen, but I just think it looks out of place and unnecessary.\n\nDo any of these changes make the Anniversary Edition better than the original? That\u2019s going to be subjective to anyone that\u2019s played the first game. There are always going to be games that we mesh more with and don\u2019t want touched (Chrono Trigger, I\u2019m looking at you) but for people who don\u2019t mind seeing games upgraded, you can\u2019t go wrong with this remake. It's a fantastic recreation of a classic title, and it even features some behind the scenes content from the original game for the nostalgic. Geek Citadel gives Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers 20th Anniversary Edition 4 stars out of 5.

Gabe, Grace adn Mos have new voices now. There are okay not as good as the voices in the original (from great actors like Tim Curry, Mark Hamill & Michael Dorn). Some puzzles have been changed in this version. But it's still a great point'n click adventure game and a well-done remake of an adventure classic from Sierra.

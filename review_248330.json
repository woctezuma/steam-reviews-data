It's everything I remember and more.\n\nGameplay is very simple. You're a dino, and you're trying to avoid the impending apocalypse, all the while collecting eggs and munching critters. By collecting the eggs and critters, you get upgrade points (DNA) to make your dino faster and stronger. It's a very simple system, although it can take quite a while to get all the DNA you want for the last few upgrades.\n\nThere's also two main gamemodes, the campaign and speedruns. The campaign has you move through several levels with limited lives. The speedruns have some gimmick attached, and you get one try or you're forced to restart. This version has more than the original browser game, and removed some that were somewhat unfair/boring.\n\nThe multiplayer works relatively well, and can be done with traditional gameplay or can be treated as a sandbox to mess around in. I haven't done too much of it but it works.\n\nControls are tight. You can run, jump, and crouch. You also have a activatable speed boost. The boost can upgrade depending on how much DNA you get, allowing the player to make some harder jumps or get up a hill faster. The difficulty is well balanced in all but a few speedruns on Intense difficulty and Intense Campaign, but if you're a good player and playing with a maxed out dino, it's managable with either a good seed or game knowledge.\n\nThere's plenty of achievements if that's your cup of tea, and the really catchy soundtrack can be unlocked by collecting a secondary currency called \"Bones\" (that also unlocks the speedruns).\n\nThe only complaints I have is that the game doesn't make the boost apparent to you unless you read the instructions (silly I know, but some people just skip by it assuming the game to be simple). Additionally, the physics engine can be a bit wonky. Sometimes some jumps get gimped because the slope is slightly angled, and there are a few spots in a few select seeds and levels where a rock or an enemy dino can push you through the floor (don't worry though, if you do, the game will let you fall for a while and you'll teleport to the top of the world). \n\nAll in all, this game is a great runner. With great gameplay, great music, functioning multiplayer, and lots of vanity options, it brought me back to my childhood playing it on the web.

This game...[i] this game [/i]\nI desperately wanted to like this game, I really did... It's not a [i] bad [/i] game, but it's just so mediocre. I mean everything about it is just mediocre. For the sake of ease and for my own sanity, I'll try and explain what's wrong with this game by breaking it down into sections.\n\n[h1] Differences between browser version and Deluxe version [/h1]\nThe differences from the free version of this game are:\n[list]\n[*]Some minor UI changes\n[*]Additional costumes\n[*]Additional achievements and Super Eggs\n[*]Halloween content (five, admittedly fun, additional stages)\n[*]Ability to play in full screen\n[/list]\nPersonally, I don't think this constitutes tacking on the moniker \"DX\" to Dino Run. There simply isn't enough here that differs from the orignal to justify marketing it as the delux version of the game. At least not at it's current price tag, but I'll get to that later...\n\n[h1] Movement [/h1]\nThis game's controls are unresponsive at best and fighting the player at worse. The floaty movement of your dino combined with the wonky physics make for a thoroughly frustrating experience. Perhaps this was an intentional choice on the part of the developer, as it is highly reminiscent of the flash version. Maybe it's just me, but giving the player poor controls feels like a poor substitution for difficulty. It's one thing if that's one of the main selling points of the game (Titles like [i] I am Bread [/i] for instance) but this never struck me as one of the definable characteristics of Dino Run. \n\n[h1] Options and toggling [/h1]\nWhat you can do: \n[list]\n[*]Toggle going into full screen \n[*]Resize the window if you're not in full screen\n[*]Choose your game mode (challenge or speed run)\n[*]Toggle the difficulty\n[*]Customize your avatar\n[*]Turn on or off various cheats and mods\n[/list]\nWhat you can't do:\n[list]\n[*]Customize the controls\n[*]Adjust the framerate\n[*]Adjust brightness or other visual elements\n[/list]\nTo be perfectly honest, the lack of ability to toggle video options or framerate does not bother me. This isn't a particularly processor-heavy game. That being said, neglecting to include a key mapping option irks me. Your movement choices are WASD or the arrow keys. Spacebar/escape is pause. Shift to occasionally speed up. What if I want my speed boost to be the \"E\" key? What if I want to move with the \"r\" \"j\" \"q\" and \"b\" keys for some silly reason? This may seem nitpicky, but neglecting to include this one little bit of agency for the player reeks of laziness.\n\n[h1] User Interface [/h1]\nI want to stress that in listing the differences between the Deluxe and flash versions of this game I stated that there were UI changes [i] not [/i] UI improvements. The most noticeable change is in character customization. Rather than having to cycle through different hat choices and colors via clickable arrows, there are now 6 pages of icons to cycle through; it's not perfect but it's significantly more user friendly than it was. My favorite option of this customization menu is the auto-match feature; this matches the hat you select to a specific matching color combination for your dino. This is what was done right. \n\nNow for what was done wrong:\nNone of the outfits have names listed, as such you can't search for anything by keyword. Apparently I've unlocked the [spoiler] Speed Racer [/spoiler] and [spoiler] Small Pumpkin [/spoiler] hats. Which ones are they? I have some guesses, but I couldn't definitively tell you. So apparently the hats have names, the player just can't see what they are. \n\nThe list of hats can be organized into three possible categories: Classic, Indie, or Halloween. These options serve to sort the entire collection of hats in a different order depending on your category of choice. Where does one category end and another start? I couldn't say, as there are no descriptions. Also, I hope you like the hats, because once you pick one, you're wearing a hat. You can no longer go hatless. Maybe my dino's scalp is especially susceptable to sunburn or something.\n\n[h1] Multiplayer [/h1]\nIt's a ghost town. Multiplayer essentially doesn't exist.\n\n[h1] Single Player [/h1]\nIt's short and quickly gets boring. Yeah there are other worlds but the Halloween world is short (albeit a fun 7 minute romp through crazy) and Planet D is unplayable without having full stats.\n\n[h1] Game modes [/h1]\nChallenge or speedrun are your choices. Challenge follows the harrowing journey the harrowing journey that your Dino must undergo to reach shelter facing the end of the world. Speed run lets you choose between a selection of 24 levels with different weird twists to run through. Does one game mode sound more robust than the other? That's because it is. Speed run is a fun gimmick for maybe 20 minutes. Challenge mode has a life span of a few hours at most. While neither is packed to the brim with content, the challenge mode brings a bit more to the table. \n\n[h1] Improving your dino [/h1]\nYou can choose to upgrade speed, jump, acceleration, and strength. This is identical to the flash version. There was so much potential here. The developer could have expanded this upgrade tree and allow the player to go for different builds.  Maybe there would be more of a multiplayer community if the ability customization was a third as robust as the appearance customization options. Right now, its just a battle of numbers (assumming stats factor in, when playing multiplayer; I don't know since I can't find an opponent). Also, there is nothing to indicate what these different attributes do. I have a pretty good grasp of the first three (speed, acceleration, and jump), but strength? I think Boulders knock me around less or something? Like the other area of customization, the options lack explanation and make the players choices lack meaning\n\n[h1] Rewards and incentives for playing [/h1]\nDNA and bones. DNA lets you improve your stats and bones are currency...I guess. Bones allow you to purchase the levels in speedrun mode, so that you can actually play in speedrun mode. To be blunt it feels like forced content, but that's kind of how I feel about Speed Run mode as a whole. DNA is slow to come and a grind to get. There are a few achievements [called milestones] that award the player with DNA, but the big boons for DNA are finding the various Super-eggs strewn across the levels. Even with collecting these milestones and collectables, the player is still required to run the same levels over and over to try and improve their dino before they can even think about playing on higher difficulties. This gets old quickly. Even though things are \"Procedurally generated\" some two runs certainly feel the same, despite what the game claims. Different screens may be strewn together to create levels, but the choices feel limited and tend to blend together, regardless of which portions of a level spawn and regardless of sequence. I have a sneaking suspicion that \"Speedrun\" may be a glorified level select with some added wonky game features.\n\n[h1] Final words [/h1]\nI have more that I could say. A lot more, but character limitations prevent that. The worst part is, I'm a fan of Pixeljam! I've had a lot of fun with Gamma Bros, Rat mazes 1 and 2, and the browser version of Dino Run. I just was expecting more from a title with a $5.99 price tag. Six bucks may not sound like a lot, but I don't necessarily [i] have [/i] a lot to throw around. If this game were $1.99, I'd be more forgiving. I made this purchase because I wanted to support Pixeljam and I had high hopes for how they may have improved this game. Unfortunately, I'll have to file this one under \"regret.\" I'll return to it and play it some more, but it's sad to see my Dino exist in a perpetual state of mediocrity.", "timestamp_created": 1499643423, "timestamp_updated": 1499643727, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33403439": {"recommendationid": "33403439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081813746", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 102, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498039635}, "language": "english", "review": "GG EZ, Great game to kill time, the lack of multiplayer is unfortunate but still a game that you should try.", "timestamp_created": 1499605104, "timestamp_updated": 1499605104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33397185": {"recommendationid": "33397185", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999585381", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516410564}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun little arcade game where all you have to do is go from left to right.

I'm glad to see that Dino Run has aged well.[/b]\n\n[h1]What's this game about?[/h1]\nDino Run DX is a two-dimensional 'racing' game created by Pixeljam. You control a raptor that must escape a giant pyroclastic wall of doom (thanks to the giant meteor) by navigating through all sorts of randomly generated obstacles and landscapes in order to reach safe shelter.\n\nOriginally released in 2008, Dino Run was given a new coat of paint in Dino Run SE (Slightly Evolved) released in 2011 and given another in Dino Run DX (no clue what it stands for) released in 2015.\n\nDino Run is a very simple side-scroller that provides an atmospheric and enjoyable experience with a lot of replay value.\n\n[h1]The game itself[/h1]\nControls are very simple, involving only the wasd/arrow keys to control all aspects of movement and shift to activate a temporary boost. The mouse is not used during gameplay.\n\nThere are two modes: Challenge and Speedrun. Challenge is the 'campaign' mode where there are set levels and failed attempts can be reverted with a limited number of 'time shifts'. Speedrun is a simple run of a single level which may have unique modifiers applied to it.\n\nEach level starts off with the dino to the left of the level and the wall of doom following not too far behind. The dino runs into a variety of obstacles, environments, critters, other dinos of different species, dino eggs and powerups. Some dinos are helpful and some get in the way. How the level is laid out can either be randomly generated or created from a unique code that guarantees the same layout when used in the same run.\n\nGame modifiers can be used to further enhance gameplay. Try changing the sky into a nightly setting.\n\nThrough experience, the dino can be upgraded with DNA, which is earned via saving eggs, eating critters and obtaining milestones.\n\nThe dino can be customised with skin colours and patterns and hats. Some hats are unlocked via completing runs at higher difficulties.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer so I cannot comment on that feature.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nThis game is an absolute blast. The bright and vibrant colours, great soundtrack and very simple gameplay form a very enjoyable and replayable game. I highly recommend this game to all sorts of gamers. If you don't want to buy this game but would want to try it out, play their original version on their website [url=https://www.pixeljam.com/dinorun/index2.html]here[/url].\n\n[h1]Personal comments[/h1]\nI've always loved the simple soundtracks this game offered. I never turned the sound off. I really wanted Dino Run 2 to get successfully funded, but now I hope the best for Pixaljam and their future projects (including and hopefully Dino Run 2).\n\nThanks for reading\n[i]Kevin[/i]\n\nEdits:\nRenamed some sections and added some info.", "timestamp_created": 1488108097, "timestamp_updated": 1488108665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509038", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30130897": {"recommendationid": "30130897", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059330591", "num_games_owned": 1398, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487897905}, "language": "english", "review": "Cool little runner.

I used to play it a lot when I was younger, I remember seeing these lobbies full of people from across the globe. I may like this game from nostalgia, but when I take a deeper look at it I think that this game really is a good party game if you will, one to play with friends. This game is also still available in the browser even if it has less functions. As of now the browser version seems to have a bug that doesn't allow new users or guests to join the lobby, but hopefully it won't be that long before it's fixed. If you paid for this game on steam you will get some extra features aswell as being able to play it offline obviously. In online mode there are two lobbies, one for those who bought DX on steam and one lobby where browser users and DX users can play together! Sadly this game's multiplayer isn't very active at all and you'll be lucky if you find a random person to play with, it's really best to play this with friends. The gameplay is fun, chaotic and intense. You are some sort of bipedal raptor like dino that you can dress up in different hats. Your goal is to escape the ever closing wall of doom that heads toward the same goal as you. While you try and get away from your extinction things such as meteors or herds of triceratops will be in your way. You will also learn as you play what the best way to accelerate is and how to maintain your speed. If you eat critters and collect eggs your speed will increase slightly as long as you keep it up, you can also gather power up flowers that give you abilities such as an extended jump, increased speed+/acceleration or one that allows you to destroy large obstacles in your path for a short while. In singleplayer you can also upgrade your dino as you gather points. I don't think I recommend this game for full price, wait until the slightest sale is taking place.\n\nTl;Dr\n\nVery fun with friends, can be partially f2p, has a semi dead multiplayer.

Passei um bom tempo jogando esse joguinho todos dias e um tempo depois descobri que o jogo tinha uma vers\u00e3o multiplayer (Dino Run SE), que hoje acho que n\u00e3o existe mais e joguei bastante essa vers\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m. Agora anos depois me deparo com esse jogo de novo e n\u00e3o tive como n\u00e3o comprar porque tenho um certo valor sentimental nele e nunca havia completado todo o conte\u00fado do jogo antes.\n\nAgora, deixando toda essa nostalgia um pouco de lado, vamos fazer uma breve an\u00e1lise:\n\nO jogo apesar de j\u00e1 existir h\u00e1 um certo tempo, pode trazer boas horas de divers\u00e3o e um bom desafio tamb\u00e9m, permitindo que o jogador jogue com a dificuldade que lhe parecer mais apropriada e , mesmo que seja um jogo com uma apar\u00eancia mais retr\u00f4, ele ainda apresenta um bom conte\u00fado, com diversos finais, conquistas e at\u00e9 customiza\u00e7\u00e3o do seu personagem.

Se na versao SE (que possu\u00eda multiplayer e era um download gratuito) j\u00e1 n\u00e3o tinhamos uma quantidade t\u00e3o grande de jogadores, em Dino Run DX essa quantidade \u00e9 completamente nula.\n\nIndo as considera\u00e7\u00f5es finais, Dino Run \u00e9 um jogo bem divertido, que pode ser jogado apenas para se escapar do t\u00e9dio, ter um certo desafio tentando complet\u00e1-lo 100% ou at\u00e9 mesmo para sentir uma certa nostalgia, como \u00e9 o meu caso, mas ao considerar que a sua vers\u00e3o single player pode ser jogada em qualquer browser de forma gratuita e que o multiplayer, que seria um dos principais diferenciais da vers\u00e3o DX ao ser comparada a vers\u00e3o \"de gratis\" n\u00e3o tem basicamente mais ningu\u00e9m jogando, recomendo que compre o jogo apenas se gostar bastante dele e fizer quest\u00e3o de t\u00ea-lo salvo em seu pc sem precisar de internet.\n\n9.5/10 would escape extinction again.", "timestamp_created": 1482765181, "timestamp_updated": 1482765229, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28625332": {"recommendationid": "28625332", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119121300", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482739750}, "language": "english", "review": "For a game that is supposed to be the successor to the Flash game, Dino Run, this game sure doesn't offer much over the original.

Gameplay is very, very simple and it didn't get me addicted at all.

Surely that was the case in C64 era but today, I won't let it slide easily. 15 minutes of gameplay and you have pretty much seen it all. Will I ever return to play this? Maybe, because at least it loads fast and runs in windowed mode as default. It's quick to start and quick to close.

The player controls a customizable velociraptor using the arrow keys or WASD (along with other keys for other various functions) to run away from a Doom wall following behind, all while gathering the eggs, bones, and little critters that you encounter to gain DNA points to later boost your stats.\n\n     The dino can be customized with many different skins and hats, with a large surplus of options available immediately.  Want an entirely pink velociraptor with Boba Fett's helmet?  That's 100% possible.  Ever fantazise about being a pixelated Optimus Prime dinosaur?  Wait no longer!  Or, how about a blue dino with a dot on its back wearing a top hat?  Perfectly acceptable.  With over 38,000 different combinations of hats and skins from the get-go, you CAN'T go wrong!\n\n     Besides the given Challenge mode, there are a few other game modes to choose from, as well as a multiplayer mode, each with a unique style of gameplay and insanity that is survival of the apocalypse.  ([spoiler]Due to my lack of experience regarding these modes, I will not comment on them just yet, but I may edit this review at a later date once I do[/spoiler])\n\n     Overall, even without a gripping story, Dino Run DX is a very enjoyable game with simple yet compelling gameplay, yet filled to the brim with intense challenges, wacky achievements, hidden gems, and secret areas that will have you coming back for more.  Its 8-bit graphics and retro-style music give the impression of a classic- a title Dino Run DX fits into quite well.\n\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Category[/th]\n        [th]Score[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]7/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Music[/td]\n        [td]7/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]2/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Content[/td]\n        [td]9/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Controls[/td]\n        [td]8/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]8/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Final Grade[/td]\n        [td]7/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1480025709, "timestamp_updated": 1480025850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27304589": {"recommendationid": "27304589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025742589", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 216, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482551708}, "language": "english", "review": "Pixeljam game that has stood the test of time.

The mechanics are simple: run from one end of a chaotic obstacle course to the other, avoiding the wall of imminent death chasing you down. Along the way there are secrets to find (if you have the time and the skill), pickups and little critters to devour to improve your dino (and for achievements), and challenges and speedruns to complete on several different difficulties (for kicks). And before I go any further, there are hats. If you play Team Fortress 2, Dino Run DX is right up your alley.\n\nThe speedruns aren't that bad on higher difficulties (except for Nobody Likes You). For the most part, they're just [i]longer[/i]. If you can pick up the gameplay fast enough there's no reason to do the lower-difficulty runs if you're after the achievements, since completing on Hard or Insane will also count as a completion on Medium.\n\nSpeaking of achievements, Dino Run DX has some bugs related to the them and to the leaderboards. Like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/248330/discussions/0/350533172692349981/]others[/url] I was unable to get the Bronzed and Silverado achievements unlocked until I got all the gold trophies for the Goldie achievement. I was also able to get the Easter Bunny achievement without finding all the large eggs just by grabbing the Bronto Egg in [spoiler]Beyond Apocalypse[/spoiler]. Lastly, I had a similar problem to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/248330/discussions/0/490124466452820334/#c451852118779780352]this user[/url] during one run, and an instance where I fell through the world and was able to make an insane time on another. Between these two buggy runs I was able to boost myself to #20 on the overall leaderboard, which I don't actually deserve.\n\nThere were a few times when I managed to glitch my way into walls and couldn't escape, destroying an otherwise perfect run, but with the exception of weird world geometry there are very few problems with the gameplay.

If you get destroyed from the wall of doom you lose a life sending you back to the beginning of the level, you have 3 in total. When you lose them all, you become extinct forcing you to restart from the start. There are different levels of dificulty to chose from and the game lets you customise your little dino with different hats and choices of skin colour.

I suppose it depends on how much you played the original.  Dino Run DX, for all that \"Deluxe\" implies, feels like an exact port of the old flash game.  Glitches, visual bugs and all.  These are things we were happy to put up with when it was free, but to pay money for an edition that doesn't really improve on it at all is disappointing.  More notable is the failure of multiplayer- indeed, it's essentially dead now, and all the \"players\" you'll see there appear to be kids using it as a chatroom.  When I say dead, I mean DEAD, by the way.  I haven't played a single online game yet, and doubt I will.\n\nAnother negative thing about the game is the bizarre controls.  For some reason, your little dino doesn't control very predictably.  Jump height varies seemingly randomly, and goes off in strange directions, so leaping for tantalizingly placed eggs can be an exercise in frustration.  The result is that simply moving around isn't as fun as it should be.  To be fair, this is a problem with the original game as well, but it's a surprisingly big issue, as it cuts down on the replay value immensely for me.\n\nWhat can I say that's positive?  Well, it's cute, it's charming, it's lovely to look at.  It sounds pretty good, to boot.  The pixel art is a blend of the old and new - the pixelation and limited colors we might associate with old Atari games, but without any of the limitations, like those on sprite count or scrolling.  Dino Run is, well, a modern game in a cute pixel style, but it is important to note that as a 2007 release this game (and the studio that made it, Pixeljam) actually pioneered the style before most other indie titles.  There's a ton of hats to collect, eggs and special eggs to find, and it can be fun.  But it's hard to overlook its shortcomings when you're paying for it.\n\nLook, I'm a longtime fan of Pixeljam.  I love their art, music, and their games.  I'd like to see their games come to other platforms (Gamma Bros. on 3DS would be sweet - just sayin').

The cost... well it is a browser game so play it on the Xgen website and then make up your mind whether you want to get the Steam version. \n\nOn a deeper level, I was only half-joking about my first paragraph. While I doubt that was the intended effect, the game does feel rather dark and pessimistic at times for those that care about the ambience, pessimistic in a way that reflects reality. A sense of one's very survival being so fleeting that there is no time to live, only time to fear doom. Such is adult life, and such it has been since the beginning of mankind.

In that time the game has been played over one hundred million times making it one of the most successful flash games ever developed.\n\nThe original is still widely available\u2026 for FREE!: Although Pixeljam promises that DX has made significant improvements over the original it\u2019s a hard argument to justify purchasing this over playing the original flash games. There\u2019s additional game play options, more levels and more hats in the DX version of the game. Of course, Pixeljam have taken complete advantage of what Steam can provide for players \u2013 achievements, full screen mode, Steamworks integration,\n\nBut what exactly is it? Dino Run bills itself as one of the first ever runner games. It\u2019s certainly the first ever prehistoric runner game. The objective is to take your dino to the end of each level before the dreaded doomsday beats you to it. Once completely engulfed by doom your round is over. However, if you beat it to the end you get to continue. Of course, there are bonuses and traps along the way that will either aide you in your journey or hinder you. At the latter levels these traps can become immediately deadly. In the earlier levels they can still be deadly but you are given a little more leeway than you are later on. One of the best things about the game is that the levels are randomly generated. This avoids the pitfall that games can feel repetitive.\n\nMultiplayer: One of the major selling points for Dino Run DX is the addition of multiplayer and the level sharing feature. The latter, especially, gives the game a much needed shot in the arm and extends the potential of the game almost limitlessly. Of course, when you have a daily peak of just 8 players and an all-time peak of 74 you really need to increase that for the title to see the best that it can be.\n\nIt really boils down to the value proposition: Are you a fan of Dino Run? Then this is a no brainer for you. You\u2019ve likely already got the game or you didn\u2019t know that it was on Steam \u2013 in which case hopefully I\u2019ve brought it to your attention. If you haven\u2019t played it before then I suggest you give the free flash version a try and if you like it by all means jump into the game and purchase it off of Steam. The value is there for fans of the game.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/", "timestamp_created": 1453458301, "timestamp_updated": 1453458301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.591439", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20631333": {"recommendationid": "20631333", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067515023", "num_games_owned": 690, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454564527}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite internet browser games from years ago remade and brought to steam.

A long time player and it rarely gets old. Has enough modes and difficulty levels to give you a good thrashing when you're running from your demise. Achievements, trophies, and the like are also a great feature, they can be very hard but rewarding in the end. Speed runs are a good way to occupy yourself when you've completed campaign, and do get challenging! Unlike other games, the top level achievemments and hardest difficulty 'insane' are truly difficult. The controls are very simplistic but there's a learning curve to jumping about to keep your speed up. Customization with hats and colours help you trick out your dino. Be a spacedino! A fancy top-hatted one! Up to you! The only issue one may find is multiplayer, while great in its implementation you'll find it a bit deserted.

Same engine, same experience, new stuff to play with.\n\nAlthough the \"upgrading\" of the internal Flash Player (ye it's FL-based) has caused automatic anti-alliasing and problems on certain machines, but I blame Adobe for that shit. Hopefully they can iron out every last one of Adobe's \"features\" to bring back the old experience with new stuff. Sadly it's also the same fate as a lot of classic Flash games and vids. As relentless as PixelJam is, it's doubtful that these issues will remain indefinitely.\n\n\"Wait, where's your actual review?\"\nIf you haven't played this game I don't know what you're doing with your life. You can play the old free versions on their site, MiniClip, Kongregate, NG, etc. It [i]is[/i] Flash-based after all.\n...\nFine. A short rundown: It's a fun game despite its somewhat unrealistic physics (but it makes for hilarious results if you can wurk it). The skills you need to beat the insane classic challenge run will make the whole of the game quite enjoable if you dig these kinds of games. It's not casual, but it's not hardcore either, which is pretty refreshing and gives it a lot of replay value, kind of like [i]Ori and the Blind Forest[/i]. Yes, I went there.\n\nThe game's soundtrack has a subtle and proper blend of DnB, Doom Metal guitars, and Tribal elements. Not a lot to hear, but it's a small game. I hope to see it expanded in the future. Apparently the Halloween Hellrun comes with it's very-own soundtrack.

and as a small rapter you do the only thing you know how to, run!\n* You start by picking your color and a spiffy hat, then it's off to run, duck, & jump for your life.\n* The sky is falling so run, though other dino's, falling debris, lava, run, run RUN!!\n* Don't forget to prey on the weak and grab any lesser lizards, birds, worms & eggs.\n* You can also ride some of the bigger bipedal lizards or get carried by pterodactyls.\n* Eggs will let you increase your states and the bones will let you buy unlocks.\n* You win by finding a safe haven from the falling sky.\n\n~MY OPINION~\nIts a really

Dino Run DX is the latest game in the franchise. \n\nIn Dino Run DX you play as a dinosaur that is trying to avoid extinction. You must keep running in order to avoid the killer cloud of dust that is approaching quickly. Gameplay mostly involves continuing to run right and jump over obstacles in your way. While running you want to collect eggs and eat less fortunate creatures that are also trying to escape. These eggs and creatures are used to unlock additional content for the game. \n\nI had some fun with Dino Run DX. At first I found the game to be kind of boring but it started to grow on me. Dino Run DX will mostly appeal to people that enjoy runner games. Dino Run DX is not the type of game that I would play for long stretches of time. Despite having procedurally generated levels, the variety in gameplay rarely changes so you pretty much just keep doing the same things in different environments. \n\nIf you really enjoy runner games I think you should enjoy Dino Run DX and should consider picking it up. Otherwise I would maybe wait for a sale on the game.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer.\n\n[url=http://www.geekyhobbies.com/this-weeks-steam-releases-and-reviews-october-2nd-2015/#DinoRunDX] Read My Full Review [/url]", "timestamp_created": 1443986689, "timestamp_updated": 1443986689, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555230", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18329495": {"recommendationid": "18329495", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974793790", "num_games_owned": 1168, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449423601}, "language": "english", "review": "I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought it, but it's surprisingly entertaining.

You can find secrets and achieve goals to earn DNA (exp), and at the end of a level you can increase your raptor's stats.  Those stats persist between runs, so you can keep strengthening your dino's acceleration, top speed, jumping height, and strength (to move things around) to better succeed at the levels.  You can also collect bones which count as a sort of currency, letting you buy a neat handful of unlocks such as wallpapers and the game's soundtrack.\n\nMultiplayer pits you in a race to safety against other raptors.  It plays similarly to single player, but without the stats upgrading.  Instead, you have points you can gain, levels you can increase, which let you host higher-level races which give more points.  You can also unlock hats as you go!\n\nI played this game way back in 2008 when it first came out as a humble flash game, and happily bought up the special edition when it came out in 2011.

Even better, I handed the devs a receipt of my old SE purchase and I got a free key! So if you bought SE back in the day there's no reason not to email the devs and ask for a key. :3\n\nAs of this writing the game doesn't seem too different from its old SE release, but I understand that it's getting crowdfunded right now and early in the cycle. The first goal of DX was just to get it onto Steam; we'll be seeing new features and things added in in the comic months from the looks of it! I'd call it a worthy investment - and even as it is now, basically similar to the SE version, it's still as much fun now as it was back then.\n\nI've also created a Skype group for furs and furry-friendly people who want to play this game together - the multiplayer mode being quite fun, when you have people to play with! If you've got the game and are furry-friendly, then just drop me a Friend request and/or comment on Steam here asking to join. :3", "timestamp_created": 1443771787, "timestamp_updated": 1443771787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18285213": {"recommendationid": "18285213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091409806", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 1225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504651708}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game on my browser when I was much younger.

Good ol' childhood nostalgia. I've been played this for a long time before the SE verison was around. So what's Dino Run DX? It a 2D racing game that you run thoughout the entire game. The game itself is quite fun. If you like racing or pixels, then you might like this product. Let's explain some things about Dino Run DX:\n\n[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]\nYou must run to the left from start to finish in order to avoid getting swallowed by the doomwall. Walking into the end of the game screen will advance the player to the next stage. At some point, a DNA stonebox will pop up. By spenting the DNA, it will upgrade the dino's speed, accel, jump, or strength of your choice. DNA can be gained by gathering up eggs (collecting enough will give you an extra life), super eggs, bones, accomplishing milestones, or by the player's score. Once the final stage is completed on normal, hard, or insane difficulty, you'll receive a milestone (or a trophy). If you want to know how to achieve milestones, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527294269]click here[/url]. Not only that, but you earn hats as you make progress to 100% completion.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]\nThe exciting aspect of Dino Run DX, in my opinion. In this mode, you can race each other. First, you can log in with the Xgen account or by steam auto-login. Next, it take you in a chatroom. The community there is legit, which is the primary reason why I won't stop playing this game. Unfortunately, the popularity has went down for some reason, meaning that you may encounter a empty chatroom. If you wanna see a packed server, look out for PixelJam's updates/announcements. Anyways, the other thing is that you can create your own race. By finishing the stage, you'll receive points. Get enough points to level up. Highest level is 20.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a good game.

Gurumin, nonostante alcuni limiti tecnici, fa da eccezione. Originariamente lasciato su PSP e Windows nel 2006, portato poi pi\u00f9 recentemente su 3Ds \u00e8 stato poi rilasciato su Steam con un ottimo porting. La trama, molto semplice, si basa sulla struttura del viaggio dell'eroe di Christopher Vogler; l'eroe, una piccola ragazzina a cui potremmo dare noi il nome, si ritrover\u00e0 in un mondo straordinario in cui affronter\u00e0 diverse prove per accrescere i suoi poteri fino a superare la prova finale per poi tornare nel mondo ordinario. Nonostante certi elementi del gameplay action-rpg sentano ormai il peso degli anni ed il fatto che fossero sviluppati per console portatile non di certo aiuta, il piccolo titolo risulta estremamente divertente da giocare e da scoprire. Per completare il gioco al 100% servono un paio di run da circa 14/15 ore l'una. Considerato il poco tempo che mi rimane ormai per giocare ho deciso di portare a termine una sola delle 2 run completando il pi\u00f9 possibile. Adotta come molti titoli studiati per le portatili lo stile grafico \"Chibi\" con personaggi caricaturali che, integrati in un mondo incredibilmente colorato che, nonostante gli evidenti limiti tecnici risultano piacevoli da esplorare ricordando i tempi andati. Nonostante questi limiti tecnici passabili ne \u00e8 presente uno che non posso astenermi dal considerare che \u00e8 la telecamera che, in pi\u00f9 di una situazione si trova mal posizionata rispetto all'ambiente circostante. In pillole \u00e8 una piccola e divertente perla neanche tanto breve che \u00e8 assolutamente consigliata per chi vuole intraprendere una semplice e neanche tanto breve ma divertente avventura dal sapore fiabesco.\n\nN.B. \u00e8 assolutamente consigliato giocare il titolo con un Joypad.", "timestamp_created": 1516466237, "timestamp_updated": 1516466237, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39370933": {"recommendationid": "39370933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043855168", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 714, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 115, "last_played": 1516041314}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is not worth the full price, ever.

But for this game, I'd like to tell about the game and help spread word of it.\n\nGurumin is a light-hearted and colorful adventure that was first released on the Christmas of 2004.\nIn this adventure, you play as Parin. The setting is Teise Town, where you move here to live with your grandfather while your  parents travel abroad for excavations. You get acquanted with the people in the town and then meet a girl who introduces herself and her brother as Pino and Puku, respectively. They then show you the way to the fabled Monster Village, where your adventure beings!\n\nAs you explore the world, you fight the villainous group of people known as the Phantoms and their minions. In order to do so, you've been granted with the legendary drill. The drill has a variety of moves and powers that you can learn/collect during the course of the game, so combat never gets dull. You've also got a few movement options, including dashing that makes you invulnerable for a moment and being able to hone in on enemies in the air and dash at them.\n\nParin controls very well... if you have a gamepad that is. I am aware that the keyboard + mouse is from what I hear not well laid out. This can be a slight issue when you need to do some tight jumps.  I'd reccomend being able to play with a gamepad if you can, though this goes for basically any 3D platforming game.\n\nThe drill has techniques that you can purchase later in the game. They are varied and you can use them in numerous situations. Also avaiable to unlock throughout the game are elemental parts. They can be used in puzzles to solve and each element has their own uses for taking out the bad guys.\n\nPhantoms: they are the bad guys, and come in all shapes and sizes. When you start out, they may seem simple, but later on throughout the game, they mix up their tactics and become very crafty. Adapting to their various weapons and such is important to be able to defeat them. It also adds a lot of variety to combat, as well.\n\nThere is a bunch of colorful worlds in Gurumin to explore. Potato Ruins; a tan labyrinth where there's always a hidden treasure. Radish Woods; a serene place with running rivers. Spinach Caverns; a cool underground maze that's hosting it's own surprises. Pimento Mountain; Beautiful snowtops that accompany narrow footing and walkways. And more...\n\nAlong the game, you can purchase/collect hats that give numerous benefits, too. Examples such as more damage dealt, more money earned, and increased defense. Most of the hats look great, even if some didn't rub me the right way. [spoiler]Though I am no fashion desinger...[/spoiler]\n\nI love this game's soundtrack a lot; the tracks are varied in their tone and mood, and it also compliments the world's setting. They just bend together to form an atmosphere that's not really like any game I've played before.  Seriously, you will not find another game that has this kind of art direction anywhere else.\n\nThe story is something that I didn't want to talk about beyond the introduction part of the game. Despite the exterior of this game would lead you to believe, it has a very well written story for a platformer.

Your new mission is to remove the rest of the evil phantoms and find the monster villagers and fix up the buildings, sounds simple right?

You're a young girl and are attempting to help your monster friends save their home. And reclaim lost furniture.\n\nWhat carries this game is its charm; there's something likable about the characters and setting. It feels \"Studio Ghibli-ish\"; those that know the studio and have watched a few of their movies know exactly what I mean. There's a child-like whimsical nature encapsulated in the experience which the character designs, music, art style, and the totality of the visual helps convey. It makes for an entertaining experience everytime you boot it up; but that just might be me since I believe unique visual flairs to titles add to the experience and make them uniquely their own. This is one of those titles that people would place in that, \"I would enjoy a cartoon series or short episodes of this being made\" because what's here is fantastic.\n\nThe game itself is no slouch: whilst clearly targetted at children its still quality. It's on the easier side, but you'll still see the game over screen a few times and get damaged plenty, especially when you're attempting to get used to the game during the initial stages. The title is a mixture of platformers, light puzzle game, but is mostly a 1 button fighter with a few special moves and a drill that can be charged in battle. The charge is required against most enemies as they have armor, and the armor needs to be obliterated through a charged attack. You have an attack button, a dodge button, and a jump button. Simple.\n\nMy only complaint is the inclusion of the critical system in the game. At the top of the screen there is a bar and musical notes coming from the left and right side of the bar meeting in the middle. If you attack anything when the musical notes meet in the middle of the bar, you get a critical hit. Critical hits build up your drill's power and inflict more damage. The mechanic is interesting, but you will never realistically be stopping your attacks to time hits better. As it stands, criticals are incidental more than anything, as no one stops in the middle of striking opponents to get the timing down properly. It's like telling you you can juggle during matrix fights-its impractical. It's a superfluous mechanic.\n\nAlso worth noting is the weak sauce that is some of the \"worlds\" having levels that are just mirror versions of previous levels. Feels like padding and lazy as hell. It's not a lot of levels, and some are interesting, but still worth noting.\n\nI'd place this game in the same categories as some of the Kirby Titles and Starfy: games that look to have a certain target market but bely an experience that can be enjoyed by all. Although the comparison is a little unfair, as the aforementioned franchises tend to have titles that usually lack any semblance of a challenge. This game may be targetted at younger audiences but it will still trip you up here and there. Additionally, the plot has depth that you otherwise wouldn't expect.\n\nAll in all, recommended. The game isn't particularly *amazing* or anything PHENOMENAL, but it has so much charm and the totality of the package makes for an enjoyable experience. The ending was bitter sweet for me as I wanted to see more of these characters and wished for it to continue. You get a solid game with characterization reminiscent of a child's movie that adults can enjoy even moreso than children due to its innocence that is lost on those that lack the ability to place nostalgic value on it.", "timestamp_created": 1501915602, "timestamp_updated": 1501977850, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656737", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33893576": {"recommendationid": "33893576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049622973", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 70, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501005899}, "language": "italian", "review": "La prima cosa che coglie l'attenzione del giocatore (in senso negativo, purtroppo) \u00e8 la grafica.. abbastanza datata (ricorda molto Ape Escape). Per\u00f2 ci sta, il gioco \u00e8 alquanto vecchiotto, c'era da immaginarselo.\nIn secondo luogo, lo stile di movimento : \u00e8 la prima volta che ho a che fare con una simile tipologia di comandi, e mi ci ritrovo maledettamente male. Sar\u00e0 che sono ancora un incapace e non ho preso la mano, per\u00f2, sheesh, \u00e8 laidamente scomodo muovere e controllare il personaggio in questa maniera.\nUn ultimo punto negativo del titolo sono i doppiaggi inglesi : personalmente, trovo che non rendano al 100%. Ci sono un paio di doppiatori buoni, ma il resto del cast, a mio dire, non rende altrettanto bene. Fortunatamente, esistono i file per i doppiaggi originali giapponesi, rovistando un po' tra le Discussioni di Steam si riescono a trovare.\n\nDetto questo, passiamo ai lati positivi : anzitutto lo stile di potenziamento dell'arma. Decisamente molto innovativo nel suo genere, e funziona bene. Mi piace l'idea che la musica di sottofondo sia parte integrante delle battaglie.\nIn secondo luogo, le mosse speciali, la loro acquisizione e la loro attivazione. Anche questo punto \u00e8 molto innovativo nel suo genere e rende bene. Non c'\u00e8 uno stereotipico \"Skill Tree\" da cui ottenere le abilit\u00e0. Qui ottieni nuovi pezzi che ti permettono di sbloccare tali mosse, e dovrai attivarle destrandoti tra movimenti ed attacchi in simultanea.\n\nIn definitiva : Gurumin implementa innovazioni nello stereotipico modo di giocare ai RPG sotto molti aspetti. A mio dire \u00e8 diverso da tutti gli altri e vale la pena di provarlo per tutti gli amanti degli RPG (giapponesi e non), vale tutto il suo prezzo (se in sconto, ancora meglio).", "timestamp_created": 1501375198, "timestamp_updated": 1501376056, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33837185": {"recommendationid": "33837185", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064433548", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 581, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501521198}, "language": "english", "review": "This game reminds me of all the great action adventure games in the Playstation/Gamecube-Era.

Certainly I was not the only one that felt the same way after reading some of the reviews on this game. After choosing to buy it, there was no regrets to be felt as the game progressed.\n\nThe beginning can throw off gamers from seeing the true colors of this game. It almost felt like watching a cartoon with the 'odd' opening cutscene, full of characters you won't be introduced fully to until later, playing right after the setting is introduced. It is unskippable so prepare to watch it and its entirety. Afterwards, feeling skeptical about the game is totally natural. Eventually, this notion is more than compensated with the game's solid gameplay and attention to detail, specifically how the main character, Parin, reacts to people and the environment. As this game is a port from the PSP well over a decade ago, the developers certainly took the time to add in small details that made the game more enjoyable.\n\nThe game ramps up difficulty fairly quickly and is proven to be a challenge, especially those who are unprepared. The combat seems to be on point with the game being somewhat forgiving when being damaged, also adding in how invincibility frames plays a role in survivability. However, bare in mind that the controls for some moves are quite sensitive and may activate undesired attacks. Overall, it isn't a terribly difficult game unless you are trying to attempt triple S rank on every stage or playing on Crazy mode, the highest difficulty possible, or perhaps both.\n\nThe story is very lighthearted and in many cases child-friendly, but that alone is a big part of the reason why this hidden gem of a game stands out. It is rare to find a good game in the market that isn't even remotely close to having any adultlike values. The voice acting, as amazing as the cast is, can be slightly better though as sometimes there are scenes where the voices of some characters do not match their body language or the current mood of the cutscene.\n\nI recommend playing through this ARPG at least once if you are a fan of RPG-like genres.

At leats they should, it would be shame if they don't. One of most interesting Playstation Portable games (even tho original released on PC in Japan) are avaible on Steam. Is it worth to get it?\n\nIn very short: yes. Why? Because it's very fun. Maybe the story, game style, characters and almost everything feels like a game made for younger gamers. Is Gurumin for kids then? Probably yes, since it's really cute and doesn't include any \"bad\" elements. That doesn't mean \"adults\" should avoid it at any costs. It's one of games that makes you feel really relaxed while playing, exploring every levels (and secrets!), trying to reach best possible score and learning more about monster village residents. Gurumin is really well made games and will keep you for many, many hours. I remember playing it for the first time on PSP and I had really much fun unlocking everything and playing on higher difficulty levels. Now I'm doing the same here, on PC. This game strongly reminds me for platformers and such from Playstation 1 era games. Maybe i'm a sucker for cute looking games too.\n\nPeople sometimes compare Gurumin to Ys or Zelda games. I'm not sure if it's on the same level, but I know one thing - Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure have its own magical 'something' that's worth playing for.

It tries very hard but feels like it lacked a good quality assurance cycle or clear leadership from the creative team and the result is a haphazard mix of good and terrible gameplay. But unfortunately it is more of the latter which makes it not worth purchasing.\n\nAnd now the full review:\n\nGurumin wants to be Legend of Zelda so badly that it hurts, but fails to engage the player in all the ways that Nintendo understands. Would it be fair to call it a bad game? Unfortunately since you have to front cash for it, yes it really isn't worth the money and here is why.\n\nThe developers have really done a great job on the art-style of the game although the background music varies from great to ear-bleeding, however I will admit that initially it started off very strong. But after about 4 hours of gameplay you suddenly realize how you start to lack any motivation to keep playing. The game is extremely linear although you can choose in which order you want to tackle batches of levels that are unlocked. There is a progression system of a kind with various headgear you unlock and upgrade but in all honesty the only two which you will ever use are the Vampire Disguise hat and the Nightcap since these have the most practical bonuses and overshadow all of the others. You gain new moves but they are just more powerful versions of the same early abilities and there was an attempt to introduce elemental weaknesses with fire/elec/ice but it really causes the combat to become anything but fluid as you pause the game, select the different drillbit and then unpause again. The devs could have simply added hotkeys and it would have really made the game feel much better. There is an unforgivable attempt to extend how long the game is by mirroring levels with some different enemies thrown in. But this also adds to the tedium as you retread the same areas you just completed but in reverse. The 'keep the beat' method of getting critical hits is original but totally unworkable as your attention is focussed on the phantom blob creatures themselves so I don't know why they kept it in the game.\n\nThe game quickly runs out of steam and you can tell the developers noticed this as they try to mix things up with platforming sections. Now... 3D platformers are fine but they require some great camera work to ensure that players are able to judge distances and the main character needs to have decent air-control or jumping distance - Gurumin doesn't do any of this and therefore you will often miss landings or plummet to insta-death. Gurumin also does the unforgivable mistake of giving you an ice/snow themed level with precision jumps, sloping edge platforms that Marin will skid off if you don't stay in the middle and slippery surfaces. The level is an exercise in patience as you creep around everywhere and spend much of your time finding the perfect angle for the camera to make that critical jump over insta-death canyons.\n\nThere is a plot here.. somewhere... but it really would only appeal to young children (5-7yr olds). However the difficulty of some parts of the game would make the game inaccessible to them. What should be a central driving force to keep the player pushing forwards becomes yet another missing ingredient for a good game. Characters are also 1-dimensional and the developers idea of creating a 'mystery' means they just don't explain why anything is happening or they drizzle out trivial details. That isn't mystery, that's compensating for a shallow story.\n\nSorry folks but when I reach the point where I want to turn the game off to go do housework because the game is so tedious, you know that there is a problem with it's design.", "timestamp_created": 1481584053, "timestamp_updated": 1481584139, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.377047",

It has an interesting mechanic for critical hits and it's pretty cool that the weapon the main character uses is unique. I really enjoyed playing this game. That being said, some of the stages aren't linear with the story, I was able to fight the final boss before completeing like 5 levels. Also if you look up any walkthough and it tells you the item you're supposed to find in each level it can be WRONG becuase the hats you find are randomized every game. Some of the mechanics aren't the best, mainly the camera but it is worth it to pull though it because the game is just so fun and has an interesting but not complex story. I love to play video games but I don't really like hard games (bc I know what I'm about) so it was difficult at times but not unbeatable.

How was I to know right? After all, a game being remade for the 3DS and gaining quite the amount of attention should be good right? RIGHT? RIGHT?

Not to mention the sparse enemy types, wonky hitboxes, poor controls and the dreadful 'BOING' (you all will know what I mean). Just take my word for it when I say that this game is  super generic, and even the different stages are basically reskins of the ones before with changed room placements. \n\nEquipping the drill with different elements to nothing besides providing a bit more damage against specific enemy kinds without modifying stats or providing skills or abilities. That's quite sad given that the main catch of the game is the drill, and the methods you are supposed to 'improve' your drill basically does not do anything different. Yes, you can buy drill skills, but most of the time you will still end up spamming your normal attack.\n\nControls are slippery, swimming is horrendous (you have to be at the surface of the water in order to jump out from it and sometimes I was just literally a few pixels away from the surface and wondering why my jump button didn't work) while the fact that the act of swimming itself drains your hitpoints adds to the frustration. Certain areas that requires precision platforming was simply terrible.

The platforming is average but it does have interesting ways to reach certain targets (like the homming attack that you do when you jump).\n\nControls\nThe controls offer different ways to play the game, either only mouse, keyboard and mouse or controller. But I recommend using the controller since it's the intended way of playing it and because you won't get used to the other 2 ways for a while.\nThe buttons are very responsibe and there's no delay.\n\nStory\nThe story is extremely simple and easy to follow, you discover a village of monsters and decide to spend some time playing with them, but one day the bad guys from another place start to spread fog in the world and destroy the village, thus your objective is to recontruct the village by getting the objects back to their respective monsters.\n\nCharacters\nThey're childish, but they're enjoyable and there's a good amount of friendly humor in the game.\n\nSoundtrack\nAs expected from falcom, they deliver in that department and the songs are ones that I would listen from time to time. Not all of them are memorable, but they do offer a good ambientation to the stage.\n\nOverrall\nIt's a solid game that you'll probably play once (or more if you're a completionist).

Fast forward a few months when I'm starting up my LP channel on Youtube, and this game's title stuck out to me like a sore thumb. I had no idea what it was going in.\n\nThe main character of this game is Parin, a young girl sent to live with her grandfather after her parents go out on an expedition. Tiese Town has no children to speak of and Parin has no one to be friends with.\n\nA few days later, Parin hears a scream and sees a weird little girl cornered by her neighbor's dog. Parin kicks the dog (poor puppy!) and saves the girl. Parin finds out that the girl, Pino, is a monster, and can only be seen by children. Parin is taken to Monster Village by Pino and quickly makes friends with all its inhabitants. The game then goes into a jazzy intro sequence with some awesome music!\n\nGAMEPLAY is very similar in style to the Legend of Zelda: the protagonist moves through dungeons filled with monsters to reach a prize at the end.  I would say it's most similar in style to Ocarina of Time, except all the \"waiting\" to fight enemies is taken out. The game has a ranking system based on how many monsters you killed in the dungeon, how many treasure chests you opened/how many pots you broke, and how long it took you to complete the dungeon. You unlock new areas by getting furniture from the ends of dungeon and giving it to the inhabitants of Monster Village.\n\nThe STORY is also very intriguing; things don't really come to a head until Eggplant Caverns is reached. A lot of things mentioned in passing come together, tying up loose strings that you thought didn't matter.\n\nThe GRAPHICS are kind of cartoony, which gives it a unique and charming look; this game was originally released in 2004, and brought to Steam in 2015. The graphics held up really well!\n\nThe MUSIC for this game is super jazzy, in a good way! All of the tracks are pleasant to listen to, and very memorable. I would say that it's almost on the same level of Jet Set Radio's soundtrack. (here's a link to my favorite song from the Gurumin OST:) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGmoyZNfnlQ\n\nAll in all, Gurumin is a very charming game and definitely one that should be part of your library. If you want to get an idea of what gameplay is like, I've linked the first episode of my LP at the top of this review. :)", "timestamp_created": 1461940440, "timestamp_updated": 1461940440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513514", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22623233": {"recommendationid": "22623233", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972351208", "num_games_owned": 623, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461552182}, "language": "english", "review": "Basically, it's low rent Ys: Oath in Felghana/origin with a more lighthearted story.  There's a lot of love put into this game and there's much to like, but conversely this was likely a B-team or frugal project.\n\nThe soundtrack as expected of a falcom game from the era is great (with the exception of one minigame track).  Visuals and story are pretty basic but serviceable.\n\nAlthough combat and the main mechanics/item management are additive and fun, in general the loose design, mediocre platforming control/camera and recycled levels are the game's main weakness.  You won't see much of it if you simply race to the end, but if you shoot to do all the levels pretty much everything's used twice- there's really more music than there are unique stages.  Still, the game's got decent replay value given how tricky it is to get everything.  It also has some nice little puzzles and minigames thrown into the mix to vary things up a smidge.\n\nIn summation, the game's value is decent for its cost, but unless the setting really appeals to you or you want something a little easier I'd play the Ys games that are on Steam first.", "timestamp_created": 1461553303, "timestamp_updated": 1461553303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527027", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22562125": {"recommendationid": "22562125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010287383", "num_games_owned": 2399, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 1071, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461478976}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is absolutely sweet.

S\u00f3 no ano passado que o jogo chegou pra PC totalmente dublado e traduzido pra ingl\u00eas, em uma dublagem decente mas que poderia ser melhor. \nNesse jogo voc\u00ea acompanha a vida de uma menina chamada Parin que acabou de se mudar pra Tiese Town(para morar com o av\u00f4, pelos pais estarem viajando), uma cidade mineradora. Assim que ela chega l\u00e1 encontra uma garota sendo atacada por um cachorro, ela a salva e ela descobre que s\u00f3 ela pode v\u00ea-la. Essa garota \u00e9 um monstro que apenas crian\u00e7as podem ver. A garota monstro a leva ao seu vilarejo, e l\u00e1 Parin ao melhor estilo rei arthur puxa uma broca de uma pedra e descobre ser a escolhida que ir\u00e1 salvar o mundo dos monstros e dos humanos de Tokaron, um drag\u00e3o bolad\u00e3o que est\u00e1 aprisionado e ir\u00e1 destruir o mundo se escapar.\nRemetendo os gr\u00e1ficos de um jogo de dreamcast e com uma estrutura que lembra um jogo de ps1 ou nintendo 64, voc\u00ea j\u00e1 percebe que ele \u00e9 um jogo lan\u00e7ado fora de sua \u00e9poca. Se ele tivesse sido lan\u00e7ado pra ps1 na \u00e9poca(com os gr\u00e1ficos piorados claro) seria um dos meus jogos favoritos.\nO jogo tem um mapa mundi ao estilo de Super Mario World aonde voc\u00ea pode acessar as fases.O replay \u00e9 gigantesco apesar do jogo ter apenas entre 15 e 40 horas, porque \u00e9 poss\u00edvel gastar horas tentando conseguir ranks altos nas fases ou mesmo ca\u00e7ando os colecion\u00e1veis, farmando lixo ou dinheiro, explorando os minigames, conversando com os npcs, melhorando os in\u00fameros chap\u00e9us(que v\u00e3o do level 1 ao 5) ele \u00e9 muito completo. O jogo tem um problema t\u00e9cnico um pouco chato porque se voc\u00ea ativar o v sync o jogo fica com a imagem normal mas tem um delay tem meio segundo entre o pressionar do bot\u00e3o e a a\u00e7\u00e3o da personagem, o que atrapalha principalmente nas fases da montanha que tem muita plataforma pequena, e nos minigames dos carrinhos de mineiro. A solu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 desligar o v sync, que resolve o problema do controle mas a\u00ed o jogo fica com screen tearing nos gr\u00e1ficos, um problema conhecido pros jogadores de pc. \nO jogo peca porque ele n\u00e3o tem op\u00e7\u00e3o pra dublagem em japon\u00eas, alguns poucos textos no jogo(cerca de 3) est\u00e3o em japon\u00eas; essa vers\u00e3o parece ser um update da vers\u00e3o em hd do Gurumin original e n\u00e3o da vers\u00e3o de 2007 de psp que tinha a op\u00e7\u00e3o de dublagem em japon\u00eas e algumas roupas extras, mas que pra compensar, tinha os gr\u00e1ficos piorados.\n\nO mundo \u00e9 dividido em 5 areas basicamente: montanhas, floresta, ruinas, cavernas e a \u00faltima caverna que \u00e9 a \u00faltima area do jogo, al\u00e9m de uma area secreta com um chefe extra.  Cada uma dessas areas tem cerca de 3 a 6 fases, al\u00e9m de algumas terem areas neutras que servem pra conversar com npcs do jogo, bosses que voc\u00ea derrotou, procurar items escondidos ou fazer minigames que s\u00e3o: futebol, um jogo pra bater em marmotas, um jogo de destruir pedras entre outros. Ao terminar as fases voc\u00ea pega, no final da mesma, um m\u00f3vel ou objeto que pertence a um monstro(da vila dos montros), e isso o deixa mais feliz, e faz liberar uma fase nova, j\u00e1 que todas as fases est\u00e3o bloqueadas porque os monstros est\u00e3o tristes pela sua casa estar destruida e por terem perdido todos os seus objetos... \u00e9 meio idiota, mas \u00e9 assim que funciona. Em dado um momento existem quests extras com os monstros, que fazem liberar pap\u00e9is de paredes que voc\u00ea ativa na mesa do quarto de parin. Ao mudar o papel de parede dentro do jogo, o seu desktop realmente fica com outro papel de parede, algo no m\u00ednimo curioso.\nApesar da tem\u00e1tica infantil, tem alguma coisa que me prendeu nesse jogo, o combate \u00e9 excelente, a trilha \u00e9 boa, os personagens s\u00e3o simp\u00e1ticos, mesmo j\u00e1 sabendo desde o come\u00e7o o grande plot twist do jogo, isso n\u00e3o me incomodou, e continuei achando ele um jogo muito gostoso de jogar. Ele virou pra mim durante o tempo que estava farmando lixo pra melhorar os chap\u00e9us, um jogo excelente de se jogar ouvindo podcasts. \nAs armas tem 3 elementais nela: fogo, gelo e eletricidade, cada um com uma finalidade e os chap\u00e9us tem cada um, uma fun\u00e7\u00e3o diferente: o chap\u00e9u do vampiro por exemplo recupera a vida ao acertar golpes cr\u00edticos nos inimigos, o \u00f3culos serve pra nadar, a mascara de g\u00e1s pra se proteger de veneno e por a\u00ed vai. Esses chap\u00e9us podem ser upados em 5 n\u00edveis, que pra serem upados precisam de 10, 50, 250 e 999 peda\u00e7os de lixo pra serem upados, mas tem um segredo muito bom que \u00e9 usar uma coroa de rainha e upa-la at\u00e9 o level 5 pra conseguir descontos de at\u00e9 50% nas lojas. \nO jogo tem um problema bem grave com a camera dele j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel move-la pra cima e pra baixo, infelizmente, o que atrapalha em fases que dependem de plataforma, al\u00e9m de ela ser lenta pra virar, com o tempo eu acabei me acostumando.\nO final(o jogo tem 2 finais, eu peguei o bom) dele me decepcionou um pouco, entra em contraste com o resto do jogo, e criou um clima ruim que n\u00e3o precisava ter existido na minha opini\u00e3o, apesar dele ter sido coerente. \nSe voc\u00ea gosta de jogos com gr\u00e1ficos em cell-shading, com estilo retr\u00f4, e \u00e9 f\u00e3 dos jogos antigos estilo megaman legends, Brave Fencer Mushashi ou mesmo um zelda, vale a pena dar uma conferida.

Vorallem die Bossgegner, die bei Bedarf wiederholt werden k\u00f6nnen, finde ich insgesammt wirklich gut umgesetzt. \n\nIm Verlauf des Spiels findet man unterschiedlichste Items, die man f\u00fcr den Kampf oder allgemein um in den levels weiter zu kommen nutzen kann wie zum Beipsiel eine Taucherbrille, die einen davor bewahrt im Wasser Schaden zu nehmen.\nOder einem Hut, der offensive wie deffensive F\u00e4higkeiten der Protagonistin st\u00e4rkt und alle kann man verst\u00e4rken, deswegen vermutlich der RPG-Tag, denn au\u00dfer einer tempor\u00e4ren Steigerung der Kraft der eigenen Waffe durch krittische Treffer (die man nur durch gutes Timing erzielt) gibt es an dem Spiel insgesammt nix gro\u00df RPG-m\u00e4\u00dfiges.\n\nInsgesammt erinnert das Gameplay von Gurumin eher an ein Actionadventure mit Plattformeranleihen als an ein RPG, weshalb ich es f\u00fcr fraglich halte, ob es legitim ist, das als RPG zu bezeichnen. Ein Plattformer-Tag halte ich da f\u00fcr sinnvoller.\n\n[b]Soundtrack[/b]\nDer Soundtrack ist meiner Meinung nach durchgehend gut umgesetzt und jeder Boss hat ein eigenes Bosstheme (das was im Hintergrund gespielt wird, w\u00e4hrend man den Boss bek\u00e4mpft)\n\n[b]Steuerung[/b]\nIch habe das Spiel mit Maus und Tastatur gespielt, weil das Spiel meinen Controler nicht erkannt hat, weshalb ich es sch\u00e4tze ich ein wenig schwerer hatte, allerdings war es insgesammt ganz g\u00e4ngig, au\u00dfer dass ich manche Spezialattacken, die f\u00fcr eine effektive Anwendung genaues Handling erfordern, nicht wirklich sinnbringend in K\u00e4mpfen nutzen konnte.\n\n[b]Zusammenfassung[/b]\nPro\n[list]\n    [*]abwechslungsreiches Gameplay\n    [*]vorallem f\u00fcr Archivementhunter interessant, da man f\u00fcr Levels unterschiedlich bewertet wird\n    [*]guter Soundtrack\n    [*]relativ frustfrei gestaltet und daher f\u00fcr j\u00fcngere und \u00e4ltere interessant\n    [*]Humor (Geschmackssache)\n[/list]\nContra\n[list]\n    [*]Steuerung f\u00fcr Maus und Tastatur nur bedingt editierbar\n    [*]Eher f\u00fcr Controler ausgelegt und mit Maus und Tastatur mitunter etwas problematisch\n[/list]\n\n[b]Fazit[/b]\nGurumin ist ein Geheimtipp f\u00fcr Actionadventurefreunde, die auch Plattformer m\u00f6gen", "timestamp_created": 1459182380, "timestamp_updated": 1459183167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504460", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22102475": {"recommendationid": "22102475", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103916275", "num_games_owned": 1114, "num_reviews": 104, "playtime_forever": 1191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1453933645}, "language": "german", "review": "Ganz nett, h\u00e4lt aber keinen Vergleich zu alten Klassikern stand\n\nWenn ein Spiel mit Titeln wie Ys und Zelda gleichgesetzt wird, sch\u00fcrt das freilich Erwartungen, die dann in den meisten F\u00e4llen nicht erf\u00fcllt werden. So auch in Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure, welches mit seiner mittelm\u00e4\u00dfigen, kunterbunten Grafik und kitschigen Pr\u00e4sentation ohnehin eher auf Kinder zurechtgeschnitten wurde. Dementsprechend fallen auch einige Gameplay-Inhalte oberfl\u00e4chlicher aus, als sie sein sollten. Zumindest die R\u00e4tsel und das Leveldesign der strunzlinearen Dungeons sorgen f\u00fcr gepflegte Langeweile und haben abgesehen von einer gewissen Grundbasis nicht viel mit Zelda gemein. Den K\u00e4mpfen fehlt hingegen die herrliche Simplizit\u00e4t und Schnelligkeit eines Ys-Titels.\n\u00c4ltere Semester werden sich mit Gurumin also eher langweilen, was jetzt nicht bedeutet, dass das Spiel schlecht w\u00e4re. Gurumin wird zwar niemanden zu Jubelrufen hinrei\u00dfen, verbreitet aber durchaus einen gewissen Charme der einem zumindest f\u00fcr den Gro\u00dfteil des ersten Spieldurchlaufs bei der Stange h\u00e4lt. Bevor ich nun zum Ende komme noch mal die klare Ansage, dass ein Controller bei diesem Spiel absolute Pflicht ist!

Who thought destroying jars was a central mechanic?  Finding secrets, sure, something to entice exploration, but I'll be damned if I'm going to stop to poke every jar with my drill.\n\nThat's just a game killer right there, and that's not even mentioning the fact that the PC controls are abysmal.  I tried to get a gamepad set up, a DS4, that I use for everything using DS4 Windows.  It's never failed me yet, and I love it.  With this game, however, it repeatedly sets to Button 2 every time I go to set the bindings.  Only this one.  This forces me to use a clunky movement style that makes jumps nearly impossible.  Don't forget, you don't jump until you RELEASE the jump button, and the jumping sound will spam repeatedly until you do.\n\nIt's also a bore to start up.  Takes a long while to even start playing, and you're just forced to watch cutscenes with terrible voice acting, a Saturday morning cartoon intro with a bunch of crap you don't actually understand, and some stupid song that rivals Street Fighter 4's vanilla theme (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYK_4zut03U) in how awful it is.\n\nSkip it/10", "timestamp_created": 1458810273, "timestamp_updated": 1458810273, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476364", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22019120": {"recommendationid": "22019120", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012315414", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 2952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433057244}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u603b\u7b97\u8fd8\u4e86\u5f53\u5e74\u73a9\u76d7\u7248\u7684\u503a\u3002\n\u522b\u770b\u50cf\u4f11\u95f2\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u662f\u76f8\u5f53\u8650\u5f85\u4eba\u7684\uff0c\u5f3a\u884c\u8981\u4f60\u65e0\u4f24\u901a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1458809762, "timestamp_updated": 1458809762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22004643": {"recommendationid": "22004643", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976645268", "num_games_owned": 249, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458743926}, "language": "english", "review": "I really wanted to love this game but the only redeeming quality is the n64 like gameplay (3d platforming and combat).

The reason why I leave this game a negative review is because the description on the game's page is misleading. The game advertises itself as have 35+ hours of gameplay; however, this is incorrect. On average, it takes maybe 11 hours to beat the game. I looked up the game on the HowLongtoBeat website and it is listed as 9-11 hours and 17 hours for completionists, meaning that even for people who want to experience all of the content in the game, it only takes them 17 hours on average, which is half the amount of time that the game makers advertise. One of the reasons I originally purchased this game was because I believed I'd be getting a decent game length out of it, and I didn't. I don't have anything against shorter games, but it was a game I had been expecting to put more time into because of this advertisement. \n\nI will go over the game's pros and cons now.\n\nPros:\n-Decent platforming game with unique levels\n-Good for people who like to collect items or beat their own high scores/times\n-Cute character designs\n-Catchy music\n-Wearing items changes the costume on the character\n-Runs well even on non-gaming pcs and laptops\n\nCons:\n-Game can be beaten in 9-17 hours on average (not as advertised 35+)\n-Characters are not fleshed out enough\n-Unlocking areas or progressing the story is sometimes extremely obscure without a guide\n-There is an adult character that tries to go on dates with the little girls in the game and it is passed off like a silly joke. This part particularly irked me because the game is otherwise appropriate for kids to play and yet it normalizes a grown adult trying to pursue romantic relationships with prepubescent girls.

Gurumin looks, feels, and sounds like a PS2 era platformer ( it might even smell and taste like one too!). Now if you're looking for some nostalgia, this is a game for you. While the graphics are not top of the line, the cel shaded style more than makes up for it. There are quite a few low res textures, but it's easy to ignore. The gameplay itself is pretty fun. You go around crawling through several levels beating up enemies on the way. It's similar to many of the PS2 era platforming games like Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Jak and Dexter, etc. \n\nBut there are some things to take not of. First of all, the first 20 minutes or so are confusing. The intro is pretty horrendous, in that it feels as if it cut out a large part of the story (you'll see what I mean). Speaking of story, it's definitely no tell tale games. It's pretty generic, but it does the job. \nThe voice acting is... extremely underwhelming. The character (Parin) will often be seen flailing her arms, yet the voice actor is merely mumbling. Also, the game is capped at 30 fps for some reason.

The combat is enjoyable, easy to pick up, and has a couple interesting mechanics; like the critical hit timing bar. The enemies also seem balanced and combat is not drawn out to the point that I don't want to play. *cough X-Blades cough*\n\nAll the characters are voiced, although not all the text is voiced. I... am of mixed opinions on the voice acting. Some of it is good, but a good chunk of it seems like the voice does not fit the character (main character for example has the voice that does not match the little kid she is supposed to be) or has no emotion (one character talking about how his village got destroyed but is said in the exact same tone as when he's asking you to come to his village). The big thing is that all the characters have their own personality and none are just cut and paste throw away characters. Bonus points for the main characters grandpa as he actually does seem senile. \n\nMusic is not bad, it matches what you are doing, and the critical hit timing bar being tied to the music is an interesting, and unique touch. I honestly can not remember any that I've heard off the top of my head, but that just means it was neither cringe worthy bad or super memoriable. \n\nThe controls feel clunky if you use the default ones. I manually inverted the horizontal camera movement and moved around all the controls to my liking. But it DOES allow you to change them! Far too many games make it so you can't remap the controls, so if they suck you are out of luck. It took me all of 5 minutes to get them to my liking and didn't have a single issue with them afterwards. My only complaint is the spot to remap them is on the config screen before the game actually starts up and not in game itself, so you have to exit, change, then restart to see if they're to your liking. But... you can change them, so I'll let that slide.\n\nOh, game does not auto-save. But you can save whenever you want. So save fairly often.\n\nOverall, this is a run and enjoyable game that I am looking forward to playing more of.

Gurumin gets better a couple of hours in, and is very nostalgic of N64 and PS1 era games, so a great one for sitting on the couch and devoting a weekend or more to!\n\n[b]NOTE:[/b] If you don't like the English voices there's a zip of the Japanese voices here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/322290/discussions/0/611701999538422445/  The English main character is probably better than the Japanese, but both suffer from lack of enthusiasm compared to the animation.\n\n[b]REVIEW:[/b]\nThis game does not present itself well in the beginning. The intro music is certainly an interesting choice in much the same way the unskippable movie it accompanies is - it reminds me of a Saturday morning cartoon's attempt to appeal to \"the youth\", so it's just a bit cheesy. That sets the tone for the first little while of the game really, you just can't help but treat it with a skeptical:[i]\"am I actually going to enjoy this...?\"[/i] after the intro. It's as though Gurumin saved all of its A-Game material for later, then realised it still had to actually [i][b]start[/b][/i] somehow, so just threw in a montage of characters you don't know, to music that you weren't prepared for, then pretended it couldn't hear you when you told it to stop.\n\nThat feeling dissipated over the next hour or so though as the game began to remember that it actually isn't bad [i](or maybe my hangover just eased...)[/i]. The music gradually gets better throughout the game, comprising hints of RPGs from bygone eras intermingled with... well, bits of everything really! In fact some of the tracks are downright awesome despite being anything but the norm for this genre! The writing style begins to feel more familiar as it goes on, and for the most part delivers on the \"sensible chuckle\" humour; Though I do take issue with the more liberal translations, like adding [i]\"You stink!\"[/i] where the original Japanese character just noisily pratfalled.\n\nThe combat is a mixed bag of genuine challenge [i](read: oh-god-where-did-my-health-go)[/i] as well as confusion [i](like hitting fish underwater)[/i]. To keep it quick; it gets better as it goes on, and you get used to the lack of feedback compared to more mordern games. This could have been better handled, but it's easily forgiveable considering this was a [strike]PSP[/strike] [i][b](it was in fact released on PC in 2004 as noted by Genki in the comments. Thanks!)[/b][/i] title originally released in 2004, and it plays well enough to be mastered if you're bothered enough to pay attention to the timing. You gain more abilities, weapon elements and upgrades as you go, all of which are up to you, so there's a decent feeling of agency here. There's even a special \"Beginner Mode\" which in addition to reduced damage and penalities, also stops ice from being slippery, which is just a really thoughtful feature! Gurumin could be great for all ages and player skills as a result, though younger kids might still need some help with the puzzles.\n\nThere's also keyboard and mouse support which can be remapped before playing, and adding that to the high resolution capability makes this an example of a port done right!\n\n[b]The big of the smalls is this:[/b] Despite initial apprehension and a couple of hours of admitted \"hrm...\", something kept calling me back to the game and I actually had a lot of fun! Maybe it's just that it reminds me of games from the Nintendo 64 or original Playstion, like Croc or Mario 64 or even Ocarina of Time, but I just HAD to play this game sitting on my couch in front of my TV.

(PLUS headgear can be further upgraded, gaining new perks and even strengthening its current attributes!)\n\n-LOTS of collectibles and extras, perfect for the gamers who like to collect everything and for completionists!\n\n-This game may have linear progression, but 100% of the time it encourages players to explore the areas (hidden areas, breakable walls) and are rewarded for their curiosity for going out of the beaten path.\n\n-A unique lineup of enemies that have the players think of which strategies and/or weaknesses to use on them.\n\n-Formidable boss battles that have patterns players must adapt to (it's more fun to experiment methods of defeating the bosses everytime in newer, faster, and more efficient ways!)\n\n-5 Difficulty levels to challenge the player (it's okay for newcomers to choose the Beginner difficulty, but once they get the hang of the game, they are free to tackle the higher difficulties and are awarded new items for clearing them, there's even a hidden playable character when special conditions are met!)\n\nAnd that should cover all the details about this game and if you should get it (I mean need I say more?).

It quickly becomes apparent that there isn't much to do in the mining town where he lives, but Parin is soon sucked into an adventure to rescue a group of friendly monsters. The game is fairly light plotwise but its enough to drive things forward and the dialogue is often funny.\n\nThe games real draw is the action packed game play that requires good use of your drill and special moves to beat the crap out of a variety of foes. It features an interesting critical hit system that is linked to the games music, get the timing right and you will do extra damage. There are also some light platforming and puzzle solving elements. This is an update of an older game and it shows in the textures which are sometimes muddy and lack detail, overall though the art design is very good and Parin herself is well animated with a variety of expressions and idle animations that bring her to life.\n\n Bear with the slightly rough start and you will be rewarded with a game that is deeper than it first appears.\n\nPros:\nCharm in spades\nAmusing dialogue\nFun action RPG-lite gameplay\nSome good music\nGood art design\n\nCons: \nDated textures\nCamera can be touchy in confined spaces\n\n7.5 out of 10 and well worth the $10 entry fee.", "timestamp_created": 1443165200, "timestamp_updated": 1506352133, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499179", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18181257": {"recommendationid": "18181257", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043902806", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443298343}, "language": "english", "review": "Cute spunky girl protagonist with sick smokin' combat style.

As Parin you will make many monster friends while being tasked with helping them fix their world by tracking down items in all sorts of interesting environments.  The story is heartwarming in a childlike way as both your monster friends and bad guys all have interesting personalities and the well written script and professional voice acting really helps bring them to life.  Along the way you will bash evil monsters with an array of combat moves that you can unlock with money you find in each level area.  The combat is a combination of joystick twirling and timed button pressing, nothing revolutionary but it works well.  There are also platforming elements that you will use to navigate the terrain and search for hidden treasure, healing items and head pieces (hats, ribbons, etc) that you can equip to power Parin up in different ways.    Graphically Gurumin is somewhat blocky and basic, but it\u2019s very colorful and each area you explore is filled with interesting inhabitants that evolve as you explore further, helping to reduce the repetition that often accompanies action RPG\u2019s.  Playing thru Gurumin is like exploring a new park as a child who has a vivid  imagination; discovering monsters, avoiding the lava and having a grand old time in an adventure that is light and fun with enough of a gaming challenge to feel satisfying.

Not enough games have victory dances. I miss that about Final Fantasy\n\nThe combat control is excellent. I can't tell if the 3D platforming is good or not due to the nature of 3D platforming. That part is frustrating. You don't feel like you have as much control of the character as you do in combat. Still, there's more combat than platforming, and the game is very lenient on screw-ups when you do platforming\n\nAs a budget game, I give this game a definite yes. I even say that it's worth above the budget level, but people may not buy it at more than $20. This feels like a Playstation-era game, and plays like one of the good ones.\n\nThere's also something Charlie Brown-esque about the voices that I kind-of like. It's nicely different than dubbed anime characters almost always having either that WWE or Wonder Woman voice, especially children. The awkward voicing kind-of works in this game, even though they could have acted some lines better when the lead character makes certain facial expressions\n\nI also find the replay value of this game to be high. I hardly want to replay games, but I'm going another round at the hard difficulty.

Gurumin really holds true to some older traditions in games.\n\nMy favorite things about this game are the very easy learning curve, the replay value, the light-hearted atmosphere, and the characters. Anyone, regardless of age, can pick up and learn how to play very easily. There are still parts that challenge you to master, such as the critical hit system going with the beat of the music. Even without beating the game, there are areas and secrets you constantly find by replaying older stages with new equipment, such as being immune to water damage and being able to find a tunnel underwater. Then on top of that, the game has a bunch of endings and difficulties to unlock, all the while your stats per level are recorded, giving you the chance to compete with yourself. From the main character to the supporting ones, every character adds to this easy-going world. Even though there's this bad person running around and things look grim in the land, you don't feel that sense of urgency. It's just nice and calm, letting you take it on at your own pace.\n\nIf I had to summon up any negative things to say about this game, I might say that the beginning cutscenes can be a little lengthy. You can't skip them, but they are important in understanding the story. Sometimes, you'll notice that the lip-sync is not correct, and the characters often move their mouths longer than they actually talk. Then again, that goes to show you how hard I have to look to find things to complain about in this game. \n\nOverall, my only regret about this game is not playing it sooner.

Aesthetically, it's an adorable adventure game that resembles games like Blinx the Time Sweeper, 40 Winks, Ape Escape or just about any simple platformer with action elements from the fifth generation that you can think of. \n\nLayout-wise, it's exactly what you'd think. There's about 25 levels, each 5-15 minutes long, several different minigames, a secret boss and more than enough regular bosses to keep you satiated. The plot is simple, charming, and ends on as sickening a saccharine note as you could possibly want, though not before a satisfying one-on-one beatdown to decide the world's fate. The game goes out of its way to avoid surprising you - it's a comforting, easing experience first and foremost, with enough enthusiasm and charisma for its own existence to keep you playing and wanting more.\n\nThere are other benefits from refusing to evolve into a world of DLC and microtransactions. From the secret unlockables (which I won't spoil, else they wouldn't be secrets) to the plethora of regular unlockables, to the surprising (and punishing!) extra difficulty modes - this is a game from before the era of DLC nickel and diming you on extra content that used to be a joy to unlock.\n\nCombat was designed by the creators behind the legendary Ys series (pronounced \"Ees\"). It's relatively simple compared to hack n slash giants like DMC or Ninja Gaiden, and the moveset discourages playing stylishly so much as playing efficiently, but it's far from boring - which doesn't do a great job of selling it, but there's enough possibilities, from specials to being able to launch an enemy and juggle them until they explode, to keep you interested indefinitely given the burst nature of the level design. And on higher difficulty modes you'll be finding yourself playing with it in ways you wouldn't have thought to.\n\nGurumin is a game that lives up to its legacy, a legacy of games that existed to entertain you, not to pillage your pockets. It's a static pocket of quality and quantity content to be content with you. \n\nIt's not perfect. There are some odd glitches - notably, that you need to avoid S-Ranking every single level in order to get the \"S-Rank every single level\" achievement. Which is odd. For a PC-original game, the control scheme is alien, and frightening. Not to say it's unplayable with the defaults, but I do heavily recommend using a gamepad. \n\nAnd then there's Hoccer. Hoccer is a minigame I needn't say much about. Hoccer is a minigame you will discover for yourself. Hoccer will destroy you, as it destroyed me, and legions of other players before us. Accept your defeat and move on. Let Motoro have his win, it's not worth it. The Horror of Hoccer.\n\nThere's also some content missing that the PSP version has - some costume unlockables and such. Keep that in mind. It's nothing major.\n\nGurumin is well worth your time and money, and doesn't pray on your nostalgia. It shows you why you had nostalgia for what it represented in the first place. \n\nAll it takes is a drill, and you're off on a monstrous adventure.", "timestamp_created": 1431846146, "timestamp_updated": 1431846146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15805127": {"recommendationid": "15805127", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069252628", "num_games_owned": 290, "num_reviews": 53, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443422271}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the crap out of this back on PSP.

From my point of view, everything about this game is great, with just a few minor complaints I have, which I will get to in this review.\n\nGraphics: 9/10 - The graphics remind me of early playstation games such as Brave Fencer Musashi.  They get the job done, vibrant, and great use of color.  You can also tell it makes great use of cell-shading, but the characters do tend to look a little too simplistic.  Overall, however, this game looks great.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10 - The game plays very well, and that's as much as I can say about it right now as I've only just started playing this game.  I will definitely update when the time comes, but one minor complaint: so far, I haven't really run into any boss fights. EDIT: Just ran into my first boss fight, and lemmie tell ya, they can really drill it to ya -pause again for laughs or groans-.  They're challenging, but fair.  It at least gives you time to use healing items and not have them clobber you as you do so.  Overall, the boss fights are great and vibrant.\n\nControls: 8/10 - Here's where I have to make a few complaints about controls here.  Some of the moves aren't very clear on what to do, especially if you're using a gamepad (or xbox 360/XBOne controller) for control.  The instructions are strictly PC oriented with no mention of what to do with the gamepad.  I would complain about it more, if it weren't for the fact that you learn pretty quickly what buttons do what move, so it's no big issue and the controls can be customized*.  \nHowever, the controls do the job well, either way.  The jump controls are interesting, but can get a little frustrating, especially having to make platform jumps.  Fortunately, the shadow effects will help you, and you can angle the camera any way you please (right stick for xbox 360 controllers).  The inclusion of timed hits to the beat of the music with the beat bar displayed on screen is a wonderful addition.  If you've mastered Crypt of the Necrodancer, you'll definitely find that getting critical hits via the beat of the music to be very easy and fun.\n\nSound: 9/10 - The music, even though you can tell it's synthesizer, is VERY well done.  The english voice acting is a bit cheesy, but works anyways.  The music is upbeat and well composed, in my opinion.  You'll need to get that tempo down if you want to do critical hit damage, but the timing of each beat is precise and works very well.\n\nOverall: 9.25/10 - This game is definitely a title for platform gamers to really dig into -pause for groans or laughter-.  Hopefully, we'll see some patches released to fix some of the issues, but overall, I recommend this game for anyone who loves a good platform game.\n\n\n*At least the options to do that are up, but I've seen some forum posts about the game not running because options got changed.  Hopefully, this gets patched soon, as I did suffer the same thing when I tried to change around a few options.  Should you find your game not starting up, just hit the restore defaults button on the windows menu screen that comes up and it'll start normally again.

[/h1] \n\nFor those who do not know, this game originally came to the PC in 2004, but was a Japanese exclusive. Later around 2006~2007, there was a PSP port which was the first time the game was found outside of Japan. Fortunately, [i]this is a port of the original PC version with redone voicework[/i].\n\nIn Gurumin, you play as little Parin who came by an old mining town to live with her grandpa for a while. Walking around, she quickly realizes she's inside a town with no kids around her age to play with. She eventually makes contact with monsters, whom only can be seen by children. She is then invited to their village where they hang out.The plot starts as [b]all of Parin's monster friends are kidnapped by Phantoms, and she must go and rescue them because the bad guy said so[/b].\n\nGurumin can be played with gamepad or keyboard + mouse and as an experienced player, [b]I recommend playing with a controller[/b]. [i]Due to how the keyboard and mouse controls are built, it is pretty difficult to make precision jumps in this game; a must for platforming segments.[/i]\n\nCombat is pretty simple. You bash a single button to attack and create small combos. There's a dodge button, and there's also a critical hit mechanic that lets [i]you deal extra damage if you time your attack with the rhythm of the music.[/i]\n\nGurumin's special weapon (the drill you see in pretty much all of those pictures) does essentially what you'd expect: [b]You drill things[/b]. Cracked walls, trees, various props in stages, special switches, and even armored enemies to remove the obstacles in your way.\n\nOptimizaiton wise, [b]they really haven't done anything to enhance the game since the original 2004 release, except add support for 16:9 resolutions[/b]. The game runs pretty easily on almost any hardware (I'm pretty confident even Intel HD GPUs could handle this). The 16:9 resolution support however doesn't feel neat, as the UI does appear like it was just stretched from the largest original supported resolution (1280 x 1024).\n\nI'll complain that [i]the default difficulty is a little too easy, but you can unlock harder difficulties later on[/i]. Unlocking harder difficulties requires completing the game on a previous difficulty.

At $10 it's really hard not to; there are many games released nowadays without half the charm and without much of the same level content for a far higher price. Gurumin is not without its flaws, but I don't think the flaws are significant enough to outweigh the positives.\n\nWhile the game is classified here as an Action RPG, I would argue against the RPG part of that. Is an RPG a game where your choices as your character define the world and set you on different story paths? This game doesn't do that (there are two endings available, but it's based on percentage of completion and not any choices made throughout the story, because there are none). Is it being able to assign points to various attributes like Strength, Charisma, etc.? This game doesn't do that; in fact, the only direct statistical upgrades for your character are health point increases after bosses, similar to what you would find in a Legend of Zelda title. What the game DOES have is an impressive array of hats that alter various aspects of your character (more damaging attacks, less damage taken, show treasure chests on the minimap, etc.), but Team Fortress 2 has that and I wouldn't classify that as an RPG either. I can't see ANY mention of the musical side of this game ANYWHERE on the Steam page which is very strange; I'd classify this game as a Musical Action game, if that's even a genre that exists.\n\nThe game places a fairly high priority in platforming, especially later in the game, and that is I think Gurumin's greatest weakness. Parin's jumps are a little hard to control, and her shadow is often not pronounced enough to tell exactly where she is located over sometimes excessively small platforms. The spastic camera, which refuses to stay put and constantly tries to center itself behind Parin, certainly doesn't help matters. Why am I given a button to immediately center the camera behind Parin if the game does this automatically every time I start to move? If I move the camera, I want it in that position until I say otherwise; several of the game's tricky jumps would be made vastly more simple if only I could set the camera at Parin's side and leave it there until after the platforming section, but if this option is available then I never found it. In the end I usually resigned myself to platforming relying entirely on the minimap; at least with the minimap there was no ambiguity as to whether I was over a platform or not.\n\nCombat, however, is enjoyable, even if it is a bit easy (note that I have only beaten the game on Normal, and that higher difficulties might actually be...difficult). The next few sections are going to be talking about combat since it has some nuances. Parin has a standard neutral attack string and a variation if you hold in a direction while attacking, but you probably won't often be using those. Parin's dodge is extremely long and forgiving, and she gets three of them in a row; I never timed it but it has to be at least 3 full seconds of invincibility which is pretty insane in a game like this. Beyond that, one of the first special attacks you get is an attack after the dodge, and you're ALSO invincible during that attack animation, which at higher ranks adds another second and a half or so. There's little reason not to simply spam this one special technique over and over until everything in the room is dead considering that the attack itself is extremely damaging and reaches over a very wide area. Certain enemies have shields or armor on and are impervious to attack, so the armor needs to be removed by utilizing Parin's charged drill attack (this seems to be its only purpose, as the damage the charged drill attack does is pathetic even compared to normal attacks), but after that you're free to attack in whatever way you wish. The game does add in elemental effects (fire, lightning, and ice) that can be changed at a whim. Fire burns enemies and causes damage (a fairly small amount) over time, lightning slows and paralyzes enemies, and ice freezes them in place. There is also a system in place where certain enemies take more or less damage from certain elements, but at least on Normal mode this is easily ignored and the damage reduction for using the wrong element is fairly insignificant. Elemental attacks are also used in several of the game's puzzles. The only non-special attack that I used often is her homing jump attack, which is not only very useful for attacking flying enemies but is also extremely accurate (fittingly enough) and does fairly high damage. It is also, coincidentally, absolutely vital for some minigames.\n\nOne thing to note is that all special attacks in this game are performed the exact same way; rotate the character either clockwise or counterclockwise and then attack.  Doing it without dodging/jumping performs a 360 spin, doing it during a dodge performs a projectile attack (this is the room cleaner I mentioned above), and doing it during a jump performs a slam. I used a PS2-type controller, and the game is very forgiving with its detection of turns. It is, in fact, TOO forgiving, and I can't count the number of times I was jumping during platforming to attack an enemy and found myself plummeting straight into an abyss.\n\nThe last thing I have to talk about concerning combat is the drill meter. Parin uses a drill as her weapon. The drill has 4 levels (the game only counts 3 but I'll explain why I say it has 4). The higher the level of the drill, the more damage it does (some special attacks also change animations depending on its level). When the bar is filled to max you get a projectile attack every time you swing the drill; the game counts this as part of the 3rd drill level but since it's only actually available with a FILLED 3rd level and not just IN the 3rd level I count it as its own level. Now, how do you increase the drill level? The standard way is to get critical hits, and this is where the music minigame comes into play. It's actually so important a consideration in the game that I'm surprised Gurumin isn't called a Music Action game. At the top of the screen is a bar that acts as a metronome for the current music; if you time your strikes with the metronome you get critical hits, and every 100 critical hits gives you a drill level. There are also items and certain areas within stages you can use to increase your drill level, but both of these are fairly rare and for the most part you'll be relying on critical hits. This is why I say its strange the musical side of the game is so underplayed on the Steam store page.\n\nAs for music and sound...music is good. I can't think of a single song I disliked and there were several I would actually nod my head to as they played. As fits the game most of them are fast-paced and quite a few are cheery (sometimes a little overly cheery) but they didn't grate on my nerves. The sound effects are fairly simplistic, but it isn't as though this is a complicated, deep game or story so it fits the tone well. What I WILL complain about is the voice acting. It's sub-par to downright awful all across the board. I'm running out of space but suffice it to say that I didn't like anyone.\n\nThe story is cookie-cutter and saccharine (it involves giving monsters furniture to make them happy so that their happiness drives away the darkness. No, I am not oversimplifying it), and though I rolled my eyes during much of it I never hated it. Characterization is rather sparse, but then I don't think anyone came into this game expecting Catcher in the Rye.\n\nI spent a fair amount of time complaining during this review, but the main thing to take away from this is that while the combat was simple I enjoyed it. The VAST majority of the game focuses on the combat. I didn't like the platforming but in the end the platforming is little more than how you get from one combat arena to the other. Overall I really enjoyed the game, and I heartily recommend it.

Because of that, I can't complain too much, especially being that this is a very old title and therefore is bound to have issues here and there. \n\nThat being said, the framerate is rather choppy, and the game seems to crash in strange ways for me. For instance: Talking to the NPC in the starting town that gives you the goggles caused my video driver to crash (using AMD 7970HD GPU). Holding the spacebar caused my character to jump in place, or rather, cause the jumping animation to loop and the jumping sound effect to play rapidly without the character actually leaving the ground. I do wish there was a way to bring the game upto 60FPS proper; Applications such as fraps will report 60 FPS, but this doesn't seem to actually be the case (menus run at that framerate, but in-game animations do not, according to what I've read).  \n\nSeems theres still a few bugs to work out. If you have the game already, there's generally no reason to be pessimistic; Its visually charming, and playthroughs seem to imply that its a rather fun time. But unfortunately, I wouldn't know as I can't get the goggles, as explained earlier in this post.\n\nTL;DR: If you have it already, great. If you're contemplating a purchase, dont; at least, not yet.

It has a very straightforward story that engages you with plot twists--sometimes unnecessary--that let you keep going. The leveling and gear system here also works well, not to mention customization options with all the different costumes. Gear levels carry over to NG+ given that they need to be reacquired. The characters are memorable and all play a role in the game. One particularly elusive cat, will definitely pique most players interest. The enemies are given so much variety throughout the game that merit a different approach everytime a new foe is encountered. Some can even get a tiny bit frustrating(-ly fun).\n\nFor the PC port, I think they only really need to adjust their config menu. Add support to the d-pad and R analog stick, for example. (I prefer using d-pads for platmormers like this because I feel more in control of direction. hehe) Video options also show little difference to me, noted that I'm not too keen on major graphic settings other than fps, res and vsync. I think that this game is aged and simple enough that the settings they give do not entirely make the game too noticably different on medium settings or ultra. The PC port, specifically, feels odd with the PSP type camera system, but perhaps it is more a complex fix than I give it credit for.\n\nThe games negatives aren't exactly negatives, per se. Nothing that holds back from enjoying the game entirely, but clearly show how this game was really built for more simpler control inputs.

And friends forgive each other.[/i]\n\n[b]Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure[/b] is an action platformer for PC released on 2004 by Nihon Falcom Corporation, of Ys and Trails in the Sky fame. Following the adventures of Parin, a small girl who moves to a mining town with her grandpa due to her parents being away for work, she finds out that there are no children to play with in the small town. That is until she finds a portal to a different world where monsters, whom only children can see, live.\n\nThe game is very reminiscent of old PSX era 3D platformers. You'll jump to platforms, kill baddies, break things to find goodies and all that good stuff. The combat in Gurumin, as expected from seasoned developer Falcom is pretty fun and fast. Parin can attack with her drill, roll, divekick into enemies and soon enough unlock special abilities performed by doing motions on the controller. The RPG branding in this game is pretty misled, the only customization you'll be able to do on Parin is equip her with different (silly) hats to add passive effects and unlocking new moves. Each hat can be upgraded with \"Junk\" that falls from armored enemies and can be upgraded up to three times. Your drill levels up as you connect Critical Hits (landed by hitting in sync with the music's rhythm) or dig in patches of dirt and levels down when you are damaged, similar to Cave Story. Eventually you'll gain access to elemental parts that can be imbued into your drill and as expected some enemies will be resistant or weak to certain elements.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, Gurumin never offers much of a challenge save for some bosses here and there that require a bit more strategy. The game is pretty straightforward but offers plenty of things as unlockables to add replayability. You are evaluated after every stage based on your performance on time, enemies defeated, jars broken and chests found and these award you medals. Notably, Gold and Platinum Medals are used to unlock special items, so some practice might be needed for those stages. There are also some items that when given to monsters, not only allows you to watch some hilarious exchange of dialogue but also unlocks wallpapers. After beating the game in any difficulty, a new one is unlocked as well as an outfit for Parin. Difficulties range from mind-numbingly easy to sadistically hard.\n\nGraphically, Gurumin looks pretty well despite the dated 2004 graphics. Using a cute cel-shading that reminds one of [i]Mega Man Legends[/i] and a colorful palette that manages to not be a complete eyesore, the game oozes charm. However, this being one of Falcom's first full 3D games there are places where the quality isn't high, most notably in character animations during cutscenes which (even in current Falcom games) look robotic and unnatural. Musically the game delivers, it's not Falcom Sound Team jdk's finest work but it has a nice slew of catchy tunes, stepping into awesome territory as the game progresses into its final moments. Mastiff has only offered us the English dub for voices which is pretty mediocre to be honest, however as a player of the original japanese version I didn't find this to be much of an issue as the original voice acting was pretty amateurish itself.\n\nThe worst part of Gurumin, however lies in the technical aspects. Not much has been changed from the original 2004 release in terms of configuration, so we're offered a tight handful of graphical and controller options. The keyboard control options in particular is pretty restrictive offering only a handful of keys enabled for use, while it is doable to play the game with a keyboard a controller is highly recommended. The game is also hard locked at 30 FPS, same as the original japanese version with currently no workaround to make it work at a higher framerate, only a handful of (apparently not working) antialiasing and texture filtering options and only a small number of screen resolutions. Those used to XSEED's improvements in other Falcom PC games might be disappointed here.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the game is reminiscent of early 3D platformers... even the bad parts. The camera has a habit of moving itself into awkward positions, the physics engine works kinda iffy sometimes making you miss some easy jumps, there is no lock-on for enemies, even though you can adjust the camera to focus the enemy it doesn't work as expected sometimes. Controller inputs are also somewhat loose, as I found myself executing a Downward Lunge accidentally even though I never input the full circle motion required for it.\n\nIn spite of its shortcomings, Gurumin is still a charming and lovely experience that is just plain fun to play, and a rather lengthy one for a platformer clocking at around 8-12 hours of gameplay, not including the optional dungeon and finding some hidden knick-knacks. If you don't mind the limited configuration options, Gurumin is worthy to be picked up during a sale at least and guaranteed to satisfy any platformer fan.\n\nEDIT: Unlocks appear not to be working.

You get a bunch of different headgear to serve as equipment, with some shared and some unique benefits, like the gas mask protects from poison gas, goggles from water damage, etc.  Headgear can be leveled up to improve their effects and add new ones like damage reduction and damage multipliers. You only have a drill as a weapon, with three exchangeable elemental parts but they all play the mostly the same aside from some enemies being weak to different elements.  There's a bunch of special moves you unlock through buying parts for your drill and they're all easy enough to perform.\n\nThe gameplay is separated into short dungeon crawls, with no area being any longer than twenty minutes or so.  Each area has two regular stages, then a boss, then two more \"secret\" stages that can be unlocked by solving some type of riddle.  There's enough stages to give the game a solid length and it ends before becoming tedious.\n\nBeing a 3D action/platformer, the camera control can be a bit finicky, especially since the game doesn't an option to map the right analog stick on the controller as camera control, instead defaulting to the shoulder bumpers.  You get used to it after a while though, and it's never too big of a problem.  The first platforming section with water is probably the worst in the game for various reasons, so don't fear if you flub it up a bunch.  There's not a ton of precise platforming here.  Otherwise, the game controls well.  Parin moves fast and attacks fast.  If you've played previous Falcom games, you already know they know how to do fast-paced action really well.  The music and sound effects are good, too, as you'd expect from a Falcom game.\n\nAs for the story/voice acting stuff, it's bleh and generic for the most part, but the lead character has a good dub and the game has a ton of little charming touches that overshadow the problems.  NPC dialogue is pretty fun and you can examine a bunch of stuff in-game and Parin will comment on it.  The game's artstlye has aged really well, so even though it's technically unimpressive, the game never really looks bad due to a strong stylistic foundation.\n\nFor those that like to replay/master rank games, there's a ton here, like multiple unlockable difficulties and extra headgear/costumes to find and even a secret playable character.  It you don't care about that kind of thing, it can be safely ignored without hurting your experience. \n\nAs for the port, it's a bit of a mixed bag at this point.  I'd played it 1080p, and there was a constant white line along the top of the screen, only really noticeable during the letterboxed cinematics but it's there.  There's also appears to be issues with new game+ stuff unlocking incorrectly, as I had one of the extras upon starting up a new game+, but it seemed to have disappeared forever after quitting the game and reloading.  I imagine these types of bugs will be fixed in the near future.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a fast-paced, light-hearted 3D action game, Gurumin is what you're looking for, especially considering how few likeminded games like this there are available on PC.", "timestamp_created": 1428182490, "timestamp_updated": 1428182829, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572693", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15203865": {"recommendationid": "15203865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045090118", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 256, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499405817}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7231parin\u771f\u662f\u592a\u68d2\u4e86@@", "timestamp_created": 1428161146, "timestamp_updated": 1428161146, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15201328": {"recommendationid": "15201328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140203899", "num_games_owned": 838, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449618518}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is actually really cool. If you aren't super into rpg's, don't be discouraged to buy this game. A game that this plays very similar to would be (to a very small extent) Kingdom Hearts. But comparing this game to another doesn't do it justice. Some might complain that this is just a flatout port of the psp game. They would be right. But here's the thing. There was nothing wrong with the psp game to begin with, so what do you really need to change? Imagine this like a PS2 launch game that wasn't. It gives me the same vibe I got playing Ratchet and Clank or the aforementioned Kingdom Hearts. If you grew up with the PS2 (which sounds crazy to guys in their mid 20's), then I totally think you'll feel the same. Now this game is not neccesarily polished. There are some (kind of hilarious) graphical hiccups such as what looks like parkouring ever corner you see when not grabbing on a ledge. But this game has some wicked cool things about it. For example, you have a seperate currency system for upgrading equipment that you get from battling monsters. The game rewards you for searching around for money by giving you medals depending on how many jars and chests you get. You can even spend those medals on items that will help you out later on. There's also a pretty cool combat system. Although the controls can be a bit wonkey with my Xbox 360 controller, for the most part you can get the job done pretty well. The fact that your drill levels up instead of you kind of makes this game feel less and less like a traditional RPG (which I normally don't like). The voice acting is good. That is except the main character. You can obviously tell she's new and some points makes you want to cringe with her acting. She's not terrible though, just below average. The music is good but kind of repetitive. It didn't get on my nerves though, but if you showed me a song from the game and didn't say it was from the game I'd probably just think it was from some random rpg. Overall, I say get this game if you are a fan of non-traditional rpgs and games like Kingdom Hearts. Either way though, I'm not complaining.

The game's environments and BGM are quite relaxing, as you wander about the town, helping characters solve their problems. The voice dub is competent, if goofy in a way, and the characters are very well-drawn and animated. The art is very well done. Almost all of the various headgear and costumes you acquire along the way fit Parin rather nicely.\n\nThere is a lot of attention to detail in this game. Stand Parin the protagonist next to a character dancing to his boombox and she will join right in. Characters go about their lives in town and might wander in and out of different buildings if you are looking for them. Parin in particular is full of personality, from the way she acts and how she responds to other characters.\n\nGameplay-wise, combat is smooth, and the invincibility frames you get are very generous. It's not nearly as difficult as Ys, but some opponents are notably tougher than the rest though, otherwise this is a very child-friendly game. There are plenty of secrets to find and things to unlock. Truly mastering a stage would mean getting S triple + rank, so there is plenty to do.\n\nCriticisms incude: keyboard key-binding options are not the best and camera control with a controller is non-existent. The option for Japanese audio would have been nice, but Mastiff (the localization company) is looking into both of these at time of writing. The higher difficulty levels also need to be unlocked first.\n\nGames with unadulterated charm are rare these days, so give it a whirl if you like the genre.", "timestamp_created": 1427952930, "timestamp_updated": 1469093265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684917", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15163628": {"recommendationid": "15163628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019768116", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1691, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440035397}, "language": "english", "review": "It feels like I'm back on my Dreamcast or Playstation 1 and I love it!", "timestamp_created": 1427941516, "timestamp_updated": 1427942959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626718", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15162834": {"recommendationid": "15162834", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000318945", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 73, "playtime_forever": 712, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1432904617}, "language": "english", "review": "Gurumin is an action platformer developed by Falcom in 2003.   The project was helmed by the same group who made Zwei but is about a girl who uses a drill to defeat enemies and dig through structures instead of using a partner to shoot magic and relies on eating to boost stats.   This title was also made when Nihon Falcom was sorta in a rut and didn't find financial success to run on until Sora no Kiseki Second Chapter.  This really shows now adays as Gurumin looks no better than a N64 game with improved textures to dabble with. \n\nThe game's still fun, albeit very very simple.   The music is kinda boring, the enemies are slow and easy, the map design is kinda rudamentary.  All and all this seems like a simple game whipped up by a studio and dev team to just clear some technical checkpoints.  This is a Banjo Kazooie/Mario 64/Ape Escape/Crash Bandicoot clone that while fun is just lacking in so many areas. \n\nIt's charming, cheap, and worth a try.

Just during cutscenes the lips don't sync up with the character's lips. I know this is a translation of the Japanese version of the game, but I found it kinda distracting sometimes.

From its adorable artstyle to quick vicious combat, Gurumin feels comfortable and approachable. The combat is based off rhythm, landing critical blows in a timed fashion. While dodging enemy attacks and traps. This makes the combat and combos dynamic and quick paced. The over all artstyle is extremely anime and cute. This may or may not throw some people off. At heart, Gurumin is a light-hearted game and never really takes itself seriously. That doesn't mean that the game is a casual experience. With five difficulties, mini-games and plenty of secrets to discover, there is plenty to satisfy those looking for a more deeper experience. With great voice acting, fantastic soundtrack.

Having played it before on the PSP, I thought it really deserved a second chance to reach the masses.\n\nAs long as you don't expect too much from this game, you won't be disappointed. There's no real gimmick here like you'd see in most indie titles nowadays, keep in mind this did come out about a decade ago. It's very much a straight forward action-rpg, so what makes it worth picking up? The charm.\n\nYou might want to skip this one if you despise cutesy anime guff, unless your backlog of action titles is running dry. Everything, even the voice acting seems like it's straight out of a Saturday morning anime. Stylistaclly it reminds me of Mega Man Legends, or the Evolution series on Dreamcast and Gamecube. Graphically it also looks like a Dreamcast or Gamecube title, maybe an early PS2 game.\n\nIt seems like I'm bashing the gameplay itself but it's actually pretty solid, just don't expect anything you haven't seen before. There's a pretty basic (and therefore repetetive) combo system, but it's still pretty satisfying.

I wanted to try this game out because I was tired of playing super serious games, and many reviews for the PSP version likened it to Zelda games. I'm interested in those, so I had a good outlook on this before it came out. \n\nFirst and foremost, this game is NOT friendly to keyboard users. The controls are very flighty, and you can't keybind with the normal WASD setup. You are given a tutorial at the start of the game that explains that you can use the right click to move (which is incredibly odd). The problem here is that the character likes to take wide turns. Jumping, something that many games includes, is fairly nice in this; except for that god awful sound effect. SPROING, SPROING, SPROING. Don't hold the space bar down, use X to jump. The camera controls don't work in some places, leading to a poor view at times. In the starter town, these controls are pretty annoying and almost off-putting.\n\nAudio quality is varying. I understand that this game is meant for younger audiences, so I will approach it as such. As said above, the jumping mechanic includes a very annoying sound effect. VERY annoying. I'm not far into the game, but I'm almost positive that jumping will be required, so I'll be subject to the torturous sound when I need to progress with jumping. I could go on and on about how bad the sound effect is, but I'll leave it there. Music is charming and enjoyable, but it's incredibly loud. I've got the volume set to its absolute lowest, and it's still very loud. I've had to lower my computer's max volume just to get it to a reasonable level. As for voice acting, I apologize to any of her fans, but the voice actress for Parin just sounds so bad. She's unenthusiastic, and her dialogue sounds like she's just reading the script and nothing more. The grandfather at the start sounds so lively and cheery, and then Parin talks and sounds boring. I've read elsewhere that the PSP version has optional Japanese audio, but the Steam release does not. Either way, the voice acting is pretty weak. As I was wandering around the starter town, I suddenly hear a LOUD not-dog barking. Really irritating sound, AND loud. I didn't expect to get spooked by a cartoony game.\n\nCharacters are pretty cut and dry in terms of tropes. Parin, the heroine, is the peppy young female who is always cheery. Her grandfather, Hyperbollic, is the flighty and forgetful old mayor who's fun to talk to. Then there's Cyllinder. HOW DID THIS GET APPROVED? He's practically a pedophile with how he talks to Parin. It's incredibly creepy. The first monster you meet, Pino, is the generic cutesy \"mascot\" kind of character in the sense that she shows up out of nowhere, gets into trouble with a simple animal, and is rescued by a girl who is the only one who can see her. The monsters, prior to obtaining the drill, are all goofy critters that you'd expect from a child-friendy series. Other than the pedophile, the characters are all alright.\n\nGameplay...First off, I skip cinematics. The dialogue mixed with the ridiculous volume and bad voice acting are enough to get annoyed with. Thankfully that can be turned off so I don't hear them. Luckily, there's boards that explain what to do. In the first dungeon, you learn how to attack, push objects, and dodge. You also learn a move where you can stay airborne for as long as you jump and attack enemies. That's pretty enjoyable. One thing that bothered me at the start was the meter up top with the moving stars, but that was explained as the method for getting critical hits. Now things die too easily since I'm good at rhythm games. Still, it's a nice mechanic, and probably the one thing I really like so far. After the first dungeon, you meet another character named Popon, who uses a sword rather than a drill. I couldn't stand her voice, so I didn't play as her for more than a minute (I didn't close the game to turn off voices at this point). The most hilariously bad aspect is that you can't equip the goggles you're given at the start of the game. This may be because I run around in one of the alternate costumes, but still.\n\nDisregarding all of the glaring flaws, the core game is enjoyable even if the controls are flighty. In my opinion, playing the game muted is best, but that's just me. The story isn't anything fantastic, and the characters aren't all that unique, but it's pretty fun for a time waster. I'd GREATLY suggest getting the PSP version instead, since this game was obviously made for controllers instead of keyboards. I'm only selecting \"Yes\" for recommending since there's no \"Maybe\" option.\n\nAlso, that wardrobe lets you wear a skimpy leopard costume. On a little girl.

Played a lot of it on PSP back a few years ago but never actually owned the game until now. Nice artstyle and fun zelda-esque gameplay. The game also runs locked at 30fps (I think but im not entirely sure) so if you're the kind of person that wines about 30fps then you might want to hold out until someone unlocks the framerate. Otherwise Gurumin is A cheap, fun RPG from the creators of Ys. Pick it up if you're a fan of Zelda or games like it.\n\nThe game has a pretty choppy/weird performance for a lot of people (including me). Its annoying at times but it isn't much of a bother. (However if this is something that bothers you, You might want to wait for a patch or a mod that fixes it or try turning off Vsync. Which fixed the problem for a lot of people)\n\nEDIT: A little side note. The game has trading cards marked in the steam store, However the game does not have any trading cards at the moment. They'll probably be added in a few days or so though.\n\nEDIT 2: The game has recieved an update which adds WASD to the control scheme.\n\nTL;DR - Fun Zelda-like game. However is held down by Questionable control scheme and 30fps lock. \n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1427743101, "timestamp_updated": 1427987970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 71, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.749457", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15129260": {"recommendationid": "15129260", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047008556", "num_games_owned": 1718, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 3725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431119586}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome Action RPG from Nihon Falcom.

Now that I'm looking at it, there's 2 things so far that have slightly annoyed me - the controls. To put it bluntly, at the moment, when playing with a 360 controller, it kind of feels like your wrestling with it, on default controlls. However, that is my opinion, but remapping some of the controllers makes it a lot easier to play through - especialy helping, for me, with not pressing attack, when I meant to jump - and doing so, having to restart a platforming section. Aside from that, the next and final issue I've found is that the subtitles look out of place, as in, they look almost fuzzy. To put it bluntly the game looks good, but then the subs look wrong - almost out of place.\nEDIT: ONE MORE ISSUE;\nThe cutscenes. The cutscenes are jarring, in comparison to the rest of the game. In my opinion, they could recieve an update, however if you're not running this in 1920x1080, I can't comment on how they'd look. Despite this, the game is still over all pretty good. Though, it is only some - the consistensy on how the cutscenes/animations look isn't exactly there\nEDIT: [b][i] ANOTHER ISSUE[/i][/b];\nThe lips don't sync up. Yep. That's it. It's kind of like you're watching a realy badly dubbed anime. You know,  it's translated, it's animated nicely, but you can't quite keep yourself looking at it. You can't quite get a true grasp of how the game looks, preforms and operates, it's jarring. It's a small, but extremley noticable things - to the point, one character wasn't talking, but their lips were moving (insert a joke about the Meghan Trainor song here)\n\nAside from that, the graphics look pretty good - a cutesy cell shaded graphics style, the voices fit, the music is excelent, comedic timing is pretty good - and a few of teh jokes directed at characters made me chuckle a fair bit, an [b] Intresting [/b] combat system - over all, it's pretty good. I'd give it a 7/10. Not the best game, but considering it's old, and a port, it's not too shabby. The problems could be improved, and the in game dialogue regarding controller inputs could be changed based upon what it detects as per the game pad  (y being refered to in game as z, being the most noticable one). If you want to see as to whether or not this game is for you - just look at a lets player, mute the person playing if you want, but judge it from how it looks.\n\nUPDATE 3;\nI've put in another hour or so of gameplay. The game's style changes, it appears as though it was only the opening animation to the \"monster viliage\" area of the game, which was so different compared to the rest. That being said, the voices dosn't get any better through out the game, furthermore, I've actualy noticed that bits of people are  translucent, like you can see the mane characters gloves and you can see her mouth, or other characters through them, almost as though the body parts are made of tissue paper. At the moment, I'd strongly reccomend this game, however if you don't like action rpgs, then this game will not be for you. You might get kicks out of the comedic aspect, but the gameplay - you probably won't like the combo - rythm system that the game takes, for it's fighting portions of the game.\n\nNOTES; I'm currently playing the game on an AMD FX8350 and an R9 270x, running the built in amd catylst vsync.", "timestamp_created": 1427741633, "timestamp_updated": 1427752911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.459576", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15128972": {"recommendationid": "15128972", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062971460", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1427743834}, "language": "english", "review": "Kawaii", "timestamp_created": 1427741382, "timestamp_updated": 1427741382, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.223068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 435, "total_negative": 39, "total_reviews": 474}}

Instead of a top down view, this game is played like an old school Sidescroller. Each mission, of which there are currently 30 in the game, puts you inside a hostage, bomb defusal or simply a \"kill everyone\" scenario and your job is to save the day. \n\nBut you're not one of those boring people, who want to waste hours of their life coming up with the perfect plan... No, what you want is to be the guy who kicks in the door, throws a flashbang, clears the room and becomes the hero. And Action Squad delivers exactly that satisfying experience. \n\nYou get to choose between 3 operators. An Assaulter, who gets to wield MPs and Carbines, a Breacher, whose choice of weapons are shotguns and a guy with a Shield and pistol.\n\nWeapons in this game are quite simple, but feel satisfying. Shotguns usually kill in one hit and can breach doors, so you don't have to keep punching them or bring breaching charges with you. The MPs and Carbines are powerful and accurate, but get uncontrollable very quickly when firing them full auto, so you should better stick to 3-round bursts. Pistols are kind of disappointing though, as they don't really excel in anything. \n\nThis game is quite a blast to play in Co-op. You can support each other, or split up and try to take out different areas of the map simultaneously. The different operators actually complement each other quite well, so one could play as the Shield guy and protect the Breacher when he opens the door. There is no friendly fire using guns, but grenades and breaching charges hurt your teammate, too. Once Explosive Barrels come into the game, the possibilites of jolly co-op skyrocket tremendously. \n\nFor every kill and everytime you save a hostage, a little bar fills up. Using the shift key, you can order various items, such as medkits and ammo crates, but can also call in for a sniper support. This feature brings in a little bit of decision making and tactical planning into the game, as you can either use it to increase your health, revive a teammate, or take out multiple enemies with the sniper's help. My only complaint is, that this feature does not feel very responsive. Sometimes you need to press the fire button multiple times, before the item is selected. \n\nThere is (currently) a downside to this game, which is its lack of content. Playing through this game once will probably take you about 3-4 hours. Only if you're really interested in getting highscores, will you actually be able to get more out of the game. Since I enjoy getting highscores and currently hold 23 of 30, I say you could at least get another 5 hours of fun, or more, out of it. \n\nEnemies in this game are interesting. Some just rush you with a knife, others threaten you with Uzis and Rifles, but the real gems are the enemies who use the hostages as shield or threaten to shoot them if you get too close. These enemies actually pose an interesting threat, which might force you to approach a room carefully for once. \n\nOfcourse, this game is only getting started and if you know the previous Doorkickers game, you know that Killhouse does not skimp out on providing content for their game. \n\nI absolutely recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a fun arcade shooter with a tactical nuance to it.", "timestamp_created": 1515624168, "timestamp_updated": 1515625571, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.462046", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39238585": {"recommendationid": "39238585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090574477", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 113, "playtime_forever": 293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515214577}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10\n\nwould blow myself again by kicking an explosive barrel\n\nplease release this game's ost as dlc when it comes out of early access", "timestamp_created": 1515611731, "timestamp_updated": 1515611751, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39234721": {"recommendationid": "39234721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198274951513", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1515601212}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Exelente Game, muy bueno ser\u00eda genial el Espa\u00f1ol pero eso es un punto malo el resto Genial !", "timestamp_created": 1515601295, "timestamp_updated": 1515601295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39229924": {"recommendationid": "39229924", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148645169", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 357, "last_played": 1515847083}, "language": "schinese", "review": "qw\u57fa\u53cb\u8bf4\u9001\u6211\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f..\u7136\u540e\u6211\u5c31\u60f3\u5230\u4e86\u5728B\u7ad9\u4e0a\u770b\u5230\u8fc7\u7136\u800c\u5acc\u592a\u8d35\u6ca1\u6709\u4e70\u7684\u7834\u95e8emmmm\u7ed3\u679c\u81ea\u5df1\u5012\u8d34\u4e86\u5341\u5757\n\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u5c31\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4e86\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5199\uff0c\u5199\u4e86\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6709\u4eba\u770bwq\n\u8868\u793a\u5355\u4eba\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u65e0\u804a...\u7b49\u7740\u57fa\u53cb\u4e5f\u5165\u624b\u4e4b\u540e\u8054\u673a\u73a9qwq\n\u76fe\u7239\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u5f3a..\u5f39\u5939\u91cc\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u53d1\u5b50\u5f39\u53ef\u4ee5\u79d2\u6740\u4e00\u5207\u654c\u4eba...\u4f46\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u4f1a\u5931\u6548\n\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6253\u811a\u4e0a\u4e862333\u6240\u4ee5\u8bf4\u9762\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u654c\u4eba\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5269\u4e09\u53d1..\u524d\u63d0\u62ff\u7684\u662fM1911\n\u4f60\u61c2\u6211\u610f\u601d\u5427emmmm\n\u603b\u4e4b\u8fd8\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u7684qwq", "timestamp_created": 1515586863, "timestamp_updated": 1515586863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39223175": {"recommendationid": "39223175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802087336", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 423, "last_played": 1516153422}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought the door kickers bundle having never played either game before  . Door kickers the original i knew was popular and had great reviews and there was next to nothing about the action squad side scroller version . I just knew it looked cool from the videos i watched online . Turned out i didnt like door kickers the original at all . It felt like i was just clicking guys from room to room while they shot guys or didnt . It was really a let down for me . But Door Kickers Action Squad is pretty sweet  . Its  a challenging side scroller game that somewhat resembles rainbow six having a baby with Broforce but maybe the baby was dropped on its head so it didnt quite come out as magical as that infusion would really be . Theres already a lot of content in the game and its not fully completed . Theres online coop included but ive yet to be able to find a single other person to play with. Hopefully it becomes more popular and online works out well. Havent played this game nearly enough to give a real accurate review of pros and cons and so on but so far it seems really good to me . one thing i would like was more blood gore and explosions like broforce. And also the guy you control , I wish his actions were exaggerated to make it more action like . But i think they were trying to go for a more real to life physics than a broforce esque world . There also doesnt seem to be any melee kills , which sucks . Everybody likes melee killing bad guys in video games .

You have to kill every criminal and rescue every hostage without mixing that up - dead hostages are a no-go! In this, it's just like the first Door Kickers. The criminals have no depth, the hostages have no story, you're just there to solve the puzzle and get the innocents out alive.\n\nSo what's different? The gameplay! Instead of a top-down strategy game, it's a platformer ala broforce. You're a single dude or dudette. You can jump, shoot, etc - you know this. What makes it stand out? The level design, the way it approaches its concept. You cannot run in guns blazing and expect to come out alive, as you're pretty fragile. You have to look at every individual room and figure out how to shut down every enemy before they kill a hostage or you. It feels more measured in its pace than Broforce - not to say that it's slow, but you'll want to take breathers between sections to feel out your plan of attack for the next section of a building - because these levels are big, and a single death means you have to do it all over again.\n\nAs of the current build - as this game is Early Access, not that it feels like it - there are three classes. You can be someone with an assault rifle, someone with a shotgun, or someone with a pistol and tactical shield. They all feel very different in play! Shotguns kill almost instantly at close range, but take a few seconds between volleys, so if you let a machete guy get too close between shots you can be dead almost instantly - whereas the assault rifle can fire for a long time, but gets more and more inaccurate the longer you use it, so you'll mow down enemies until the guy in the back gets you with accurate shots. The classes have access to different super-skills, too - as you kill criminals and rescue hostages you charge up your ability bar, which lets you summon medkits, backup, or get sniper support...or other things. This thing is key to success, especially if you're a sloppy player like me, who needs those medkits and snipers.\n\nIn sum, this is an early access game with an incredibly solid base. There's a ton of missions already in, the gameplay feels finished, and honestly the biggest mark against it so far is that you can't rebind keys. Also it's tough, like the original Door Kickers - but it's satisfying, and controls well, and I like feeling like a GI Joe as I rescue hostages.

There is no tutorial (yet), but most things are straight forward and easy to grasp. \n\nThe alpha provided enough content to keep us excited. The 3 characters each had their own playstile, which brought variation to the gameplay.\n\nThe difficulty is perfect for casual players who can somewhat work together. There are some more difficult bits where you have to retry a couple of times, yet nothing frustrating. Players who seek a greater challenge may try to get all stars on every level.\n\nThe game ran very smoothly on my GTX 1060 @ 1440p.

Las armas y equipamiento de los personajes se pueden desbloquear con las estrellas que se ganan al completar las misiones, pero solamente hay tres armas por personaje, los equipamientos se comparten entre los personajes, aunque por lo que not\u00e9, no son muy \u00fatiles.\nOtro factor que arruina el juego, es que aunque se puede jugar online, nunca vas a encontrar partidas. Seg\u00fan \"Steamcharts\" solamente juegan como 4 personas, esto se debe a la cort\u00edsima duraci\u00f3n del juego. Una vez que se lo termina, nada te incentiva a seguir jugando, porque ya tendr\u00e1s todos los equipamientos y armas desbloqueados.\nSin embargo, es un Early Access, as\u00ed que es muy probable que todo esto cambie, obviamente van a agrear m\u00e1s misiones, m\u00e1s enemigos, probablemente m\u00e1s personajes, etc.\n\nConclusi\u00f3n\nEl juego es muy entretenido durante el tiempo que dura. Los gr\u00e1ficos son \"amigables\" y funciona perfectamente.

I love Door Kickers. Even so much, that I am playing it on my phone. Action Squad however is the perfect single and coop experience. It's fast and super difficult, like Hotline Miami. Yet as tactical as Door Kickers in its core. The fog of war mechanic adds a layer of difficult and realism. I hope the devs will add fibre optics and actual door breaching techniques to further expand the tactical component of the game. \n\nGameplaywise I usually play with a controller. I would suggest to alter the controls, if you plan to play with a keyboard. But you can totally tell, that the game was designed with a controller in mind.\n\nI am absolutely hooked up and so looking forward to the content update in December as well as any other content update.

The only real similarities are the art style and the sidescrolling perspective.\n\nDoor Kickers: Action Squad is an action game, for sure, and will test your reflexes, but you will not succeed if you rush into rooms blindly. As a spinoff of the original Door Kickers, which was a top-down strategy game, Action Squad translates parts of what you need to succeed into a game of an entirely different genre. You will need to make on the fly threat assessments as you clear levels room by room. The enemy with a machete charging you is more dangerous than the one with a pistol, but less so than the one wearing a bomb vest. Oh and be sure not to hit the hostage he's standing next to! Using your gear (breaching charges, flashbangs, etc) and your special abilities is imperative to success as well.\n\nI've mainly spent the time in solo but it's a very good game already just on your own, though it is clearly designed for 2 player co-op. Two things to keep in mind. You can only shoot in the left or right directions so when you need to hit anything above or below you things get tricky. I don't know if they plan to add more directional shooting later on but it's not a huge deal. 2nd thing is, I would highly recommend having a controller to play this.", "timestamp_created":

Your weapons have different damage ratio, recoil and reloading time. Every kill and release of a blondie female prisoner fill your skill meter, which can use it to ragain health (2 uses), armour, call a sharpshooter (kills 3 enemies in view range), regain grenades (yes, you have flash and frag grenades) and have an extra life to continue in case you die...when you complete a mission you gain from 1 to 3 stars which can use it to unlock better weapons, armour and equipment. 3 campaigns, 12 missions each one, with 3 to 5 minutes to complete them. Unfortunately in 3 hours i managed to finish first two campaings with 3 star rating in all missions. The game is short. If they release more campaigns or a mission modding tool then it's a must buy.

The retro run and gun style translates perfectly to Doorkickers: Action Squad. From top down changed to side-scrolling makes a huge difference and is very addictive and fun to play. I could spend hours playing this ongoing in-development game. For Early Access it sure is playable and is actually a game and feels like a complete one. One thing I would ask of you though: ADD MORE MULTIPLAYER SUPPORT! This game is meant for both Single Player and Multiplayer, although Multiplayer is probably more fun. I say probably because everytime I go to quick match I cannot find someone to connect to. Perhaps you could do something to remedy this? I will keep trying to connect and try hosting, because this is definitely worth it. Anyone reading this that wants to play please add me.

This game trades out the cascading explosions and supermeatboy meat grinder for an action-puzzle, much like Mark of the Ninja or the dev's own Door Kickers. Quick thinking and smart threat assessment is as valuable as your twitchy trigger finger.  The art style is subdued but highly detailed and readable, making the most of the industrial settings with wide level design variety and garish splashes of blood where violence has occurred.\nNew tactical situations are presented at regular intervals, requiring flexibility and a willingness to try new equipment or higher risk maneuvers. \nThis is good tactical fun on solo play, but the game really shines with couch co-op. Character classes are symbiotic, and you'll quickly develop your own preferred breach-and-clear playbook. As the challenge increases, good communication is key to getting perfect scores (and the upgrade points that come with them).  Fast reload times and high player mobility keeps 2-player deaths from being frustrating, instead keeping the 'let's try it a new way' impulse alive. It's also damned funny to experience those botched attempts together.\nThere's a lot to like and an impressive amount of detail and polish for an alpha.  I played at a friend's house and immediately on getting home, bought myself a copy. Whether you're in it for the 80s contra vibe or the learn-as-you-go tactical challenge, there's far more to discover and enjoy than what you'd expect.

(it plays similarly to Nidhogg in that remark)\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n-There is not alot of content. (They're going to add more content, though. [i] N. B.: This sentence can be applied to most Cons [/i])\n-There are not alot of weapons. \n-Grenades and flashes are not useful IMO.\n-There are only 3 charachters.\n-I haven't seen randomised placement of enemies. This would give the game replayability. (Sidenote: while there is no randomisation, the game does have a star rating system, so you can replay until you get those 3 stars. Maybe you consider this replayability.)\n-Not alot of levels, and seeing as I found those levels to be the same when replaying, it may be better to wait until there is more content if you want to buy this game.\n\n[h1] Final Verdict: [/h1]\nThis game is an obvious masterpiece in the works, but not in its current state. There is not alot of content, not alot of replayability but it is amazing. I personally recommend this game, because I know the devs will add tons more into this game, but if you have had bad experiences with Early Acces games before, don't buy this. The devs said the first major update will come out in December, which meanse there'll be alot more content in just a few weeks, which would resolve, or try to resolve one of the major issues with this game: lack of content. If you don't trust the devs, or if you are impatient, wait a few moths and then come back. I guarantee that you will see a completely new and fresh experience. For the more trusting and patient people out there: get this game immediately, it will provide you with some quality time.\n\n[h1] Rating: [/h1]\n8.5/10 devs pls make nades gud\n\n[h1] EDIT: \nI finished all the levels with the maximum score (3 stars) in about 6 hours, so don't expect alot of content. It is possible to finish the game entirely in about an hour, or even less, if you are a dedicated and skilled gamer. \n\n[b] Please upvote if you thought this review was useful, so other people can see it too!

Kicking down doors is really fun, and blowing them up is even more fun.  The AI for a 2D game is actually decent.  They will shoot you on sight and if they are a suicide bomber, they will charge you as fast as they can.  Like I said above, the game is non linear so you can play any of the missions as long as they are unlocked.

Action Squad is a puzzle/twitch shooter, and while I know that sounds strange it's true. Especially if playing solo. The game is made up of trial and error approaches through the different levels till you find the path that leads to victory. You will more than likely die a few times before you find that sweet spot approach. (Video Version of Review w/ Gameplay) https://youtu.be/0_2P6c27p28 Now I'm not complaining about this as there is a very addictive nature to trying to find a way through while shooting true. I enjoyed the challenge very much, and loved unlocking new gear (although there is not to much right now.) There are 3 characters to choose from each with 3 weapons to unlock. There is also two gear slots with different options available and advisable depending on the mission (I love the multipurpose breaching charge!) One thing of note is the boost system in the game. For every postive action a meter fills granting you boosts that can be activated. These are things like sniper support, health kits, gear refills, etc. The game should offer at least 4-8 hours of play, depending on your style, with more content on the way. The graphical style and art is pleasant and well done, but didn't blow me away. The one thing that I need ASAP is the ability to reconfigure the controls as I felt I was fighting the default layout. Overall I would say that if you want a tactical 2D shooter that will make you think just as much as react, than you may have a winner here. I look forward to the continued development, refinement and expansion of this title.

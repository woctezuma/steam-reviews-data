Hell even the later TC games in the Ghost Recon and Rainbow series became cover shooters.\n\np.s. make sure to get the PC version as the XBOX,PS2 and GC versions were decent enough but the maps were smaller, you couldn't plan missions and you only got one go-code to use. The multiplayer was fun and X-link kai still has a small community for the game(and the other TC games) If you're interested in the console version thats the only way i'd recommend it. Its also worth noting the xbox version is backwards compatible on the 360.\n\nPROS\n\n-Your Squad Is Your Weapon: mission planning allows for great replayability, and i've seen some pros so good at it they don't even play the mission directy they just do observer mode and issue go codes. I've spent upwards of an hour before coordinating sniper teams to hit enemies through windows while another team breachs the door and snatches the civie.\n\n-Scalable Difficulty: Allows for new players to get more accustomed to the game with 3 distinct difficulties and an auto aim feature.\n\n-Great Gunplay\n\n-Mod Support: Allows for new features such as new guns, attatchments, modes, and maps.\n\n-Great Multiplayer: Classic modes such as T-Hunt, Hostage Rescue, One Life Adversarial and more.I never have trouble finding a server with players although you'll have to install the fan patch to play online, ALLR6 has a really good guide for this.\n\nCONS\n\n-Controls are a little weird but can be fixed easily.\n\n-The A.I. has not aged well, at times it feels like your in the jungle with charlie and at other times they'll just do stupid shit like stand in doorways. (this goes for enemies and team mates), this can be fixed with a mod though.\n\n-Animations are a bit dated but this was never a problem for me as the gameplay more than makes up for it.\n\n-The story takes a background role here which is dissapointing as the series is based on the novel from '98, this is something I was always thought the console ports and seventh gen games in the TC franchise did better.\n\n-This is kinda stupid but my biggest issue with the game is that you can issue the ai to in your immediate to do zulu flash and zulu frag, but if you want to do a C4 breach you have to plant the charge and pull the button yourself THAN issue a movement command to tell the squad to enter the room which usually gets them shot because the ai doesnt know to expect enemies when you dont issue a zulu breach. you can only map C4 breaching to the alpha, bravo, and charlie go-codes which can only be performed by other teams. This is a fundamental problem with the game because it usually means you're gonna put your own ass on the line every time you reach a door that way you can pie it for enemies.

Disponemos de una gran serie de personajes los cuales se especializan en distintos grupos, como los francotiradores, asalto, demolici\u00f3n, stealth, etc... por lo que para cada misi\u00f3n vamos a tener que elegir a quienes nos convengan m\u00e1s con la equipaci\u00f3n adecuada.\n\nEn cuanto a las opciones tacticas, diponemos del planeamiento donde podemos no solo situar a nuestros agentes, sino comandarlos marcandoles un camino determinado seguidos de comandos que pueden ser activados ingame por ordenes, por ejemplo, decirle al team verde que se mueva en por un camino, hasta una puerta, luego que coloquen una carga de demolici\u00f3n, que esperen a alpha y luego al dar el comando de luz verde se ejecutaria esa acci\u00f3n, esto es un simple ejemplo de una gran cantidad de opciones.\n\n[h1]Lo... \u00bfmalo?[/h1]\nEl juego tiene una dificultad muy elevada desde el principio, los tangos son unos aut\u00e9nticos snipers, si te ven es muy probable que te maten instantaneamente de un disparo, por lo que hay mods, que mejoran la IA, arreglando su campo de visi\u00f3n, y sobre todo la punter\u00eda, que parece estar al 100% por defecto. Por otro lado, decir que el juego tiene por defecto activado auto aiming, para los jugadores m\u00e1s casuales y mancos, por ello recomiendo desactivarlo no solo para una experiencia m\u00e1s inmersiva sino tambi\u00e9n para no aburrirte y creer que el juego en realidad es facil.\n\n[h1]Algo de modding[/h1]\nUna peque\u00f1a gu\u00eda que realic\u00e9 del mod supply drops, que a\u00f1ade nuevas armas, camuflajes y miras.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1258919537\n\n[b]Blog de Akpin creador de las mejores skins para nuestros agentes[/b]\nhttp://blog.daum.net/akpin\n\n[h1]Resumen[/h1]\nRecomiendo el juego enormemente, es el \u00faltimo en su especie de gran calidad, y ahora con mods y online revivido, adem\u00e1s la versi\u00f3n de steam incluye Expansiones.", "timestamp_created": 1515536894, "timestamp_updated": 1515537039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566474", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39195695": {"recommendationid": "39195695", "author": {"steamid": "76561198151262125", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 93, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 11, "last_played": 1515440956}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is probably the best of the Rainbow series.

If you want a tactical action game play SWAT4. If you want a bit more planning most Ghost Recon games are better. \nAll RS6 has to offer is sitting in a pretty basic planning menu that has all the depth of a kiddy pool. I might rethink this when and if I bother to beat it but so far I'm not having any fun at all because all the difficulty comes down to whether or not you can idiotproof your plan enough to a point where even terrible AI can do something without dying, which can sometimes be completely random and out of your control. Even during the training mission I had two of AI teammates die while following tutorial instructions because when breaching a room and throwing a grenade they decided to stand in the open. Also throwing a grenade is about one of the few things you can have them do. The tactical menu choice comes down to picking where operatives go, when do they wait and how do they breach, just going in or throwing a grenade and then throwing in, truly complex system.\n\"If you want something done right you have to do it yourself\", if you follow that saying the games becomes into a rather unremarkable shooter because enemy AI rather stupid too, usually enemy AI difficulty would depend on their health, a gun they carry, how they use their surroundings and how accurately they shoot. All except for last one doesn't much matter in this, enemies don't know what cover is unless they were spawned behind it and even if they have a shit gun it still doesn't take much to kill any of the operatives, what you have to do to defeat them is simply shoot first. They didn't see you? Great, that's a free kill. They saw you? Well then there are two things that can happen, you either move away and shoot them while they run to find you or you shoot them faster than they can shoot you. If not you'll probably be dead or at least take damage.\nSure my opinion might change but so far this game is both boring as an FPS and boring as a tactics game cause both aspect are way too basic. I'm not even gonna mention how boring the maps have been and how generic the story is, though given how it's Tom Clancy people probably don't expect anything amazing out of the writing.\n\nEdit: Well I beat the game and the Athena Sword expansion and my opinion of it only got worse. \nAfter first few missions it becomes way too clear that one of the most common mission conditions such as saving hostages or disarming bombs is there only to force the player to rely on the terrible AI operatives because it usually requires overwhelming the enemy by entering from multiple angles. It's less of an issue in Athena Sword where they had bomb missions had time limits and I think in at least one hostage mission the enemies weren't rushing to kill the hostage is they as much as sniff you. Still, it's a really bad mechanic that's only there to limit player's options.\n\nAnother thing that gets annoying is how meaningless the armor is, even with the heaviest armor on you're dead, even if your armor blends in with the environment you will be seen. There are mods to fix this but this is a review for RS3, not for the mods.\n\nWhat baffled the hell out of me is that both Raven Shield and Athena Sword lazily reused old maps and had you play them again after changing the lighting. It's especially egregious in Athena Sword to me considering it's only 8 missions long anyway.\n\nThere's also one stealth only mission in the game and I have no idea who thought it was a good idea, this game wasn't built for stealth, it doesn't have machanics that would be neccessary for a stealth game it doesn't have AI buitl for stealth. Peeking around the corner from a distance? Too bad you failed. Your only way of getting an idea of what's ahead of you is a heartbeat sensor and that thing doesn't tell you which way the enemy is facing. It's essentially just a tedious excercise in trial in error that not in any way satisfying.\n\nIn the end, this is a bad game, with almost nothing going for it in my opinion. The movement is very clunky and slow, operative AI is terrible as is AI of terrorists, the only difficulty when it comes to combat is positioning and it's not exactly difficult, a lot of the time you can just find a nice spot where you can't be ambushed and wait as all enemies rush into your kill zone. \n\nThere are better tactical FPS out there that make returning to this a questionable choice.",

Athena Sword builds on Ravenshield, and Iron Wrath (make sure to download and install, super easy)  is the pinnacle, the missions are brutal and the maps look stunning. This is definitely a pre-DLC era game. \n-Game is set within the Tom Clancy universe and builds upon the formula from the previous Rainbow Six entries\n-6 classic Rainbow Six missions remastered with the new engine (dozens of fan-created remakes as well). \n-The pre-mission planning phase is what puts this game on another level. There is nothing more bad-ass then looking across the map and seeing Green team creeping up to a door in recon stance and then flash and clear it in blitz stance, while Gold team is on overwatch. All is possible from the planning phase with ALOT of practice.  \n-fully costumize your team, your gear, your plan, and the way you execute the mission however you want.\n-choose from dozens of operatives from every NATO nation, in fact the game is so far ahead of it's time you can have female operatives kicking ass in combat, and I love how teammates communicate in mission \n-offline costum missions including every campaign and multiplayer map, you could spend a lifetime completing them all and still find something completely new by trying a different route. \n-brutal difficulty if you want but very accessible for more casual gamers by selecting pre-made mission plans. Weapons have wieght to them and firing single rounds from a fixed position is your only chance of surviving. Every linear danger area has to be smoked prior to crossing. Every room has to be flashed pior to entering. Hostages must be rescued in a swift, coordinated manuever, or they got slaughtered. It's very rewarding when you design your own plans and beat missions on 'elite' (no team-AI mods ;) ) \n-best room clearing and stacking mechanics ever seen in a video game, as if the devs actually knew a thing or two. Reloading is also more realistic than 99% of games. \n-full multiplayer with dozens of game modes and hundreds of maps (thank you to everyone at allR6.com for revitalizing the community and bringing back online servers in 2017! I play daily.)\n-super easy to mod and if you want a new armpatch, map, or uniform you can just learn to make your own or find one, this is the game that inspired to get into development and have learned so much from the community. \n-incremental door opening, fluid leaning, status reports, go-codes, under-hand grendade tosses.. things that are unheard of modern FPS, where even left/right peaking is rare. \n-tons of console commands to play around with for some wild experiences. Slow mo, summoning all terrorists.. ahh the good old days where devs gave you freedom\n-1000's of hours on Uplay, that version is actually prefered and I also keep a CD copy just in case Ubi tries to purge it someday. \n\nRainbow Six in 2017\n-Game has nothing to do with Rainbow Six or Tom Clancy, yet Ubisoft shamelessly mooches off the brand\n-No AI squad commands, extremely limited offline modes\n-dozens of microtransactions, modding is prohibited\n-designed for e-sports\n-been around for several years, still garbage\n\n\nMAKE RAINBOW SIX GREAT AGAIN!", "timestamp_created": 1499146512, "timestamp_updated": 1515525856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 29, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.663674", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33095387": {"recommendationid": "33095387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198269512037", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 810, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 54, "last_played": 1516444504}, "language": "french", "review": "Excellent Jeu que j'ai pu jou\u00e9 tant d'ann\u00e9es\n\nLes + appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s\nCampagne Raven Shield : 20/20\nCampagne Athena Sword : 20/20\nGraphismes : 19.9/20\n\nLes - appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s\nDur\u00e9e de vie : 9/20\nMultijoueur : 14/20\n\ndonc on conclu 82.9/100 pas mal.

I deferred to his taste and judgement in games however and decided to buy it from Walmart.  The first thing I noticed was that it was based on the Unreal 2 engine.  This lead to some of the similar graphical capabilities.  I was amazed with the complexity of this game at first not understanding how to play it.  I thought it would be a simple terrorist shooting affair, which didn't appeal to me very much.  The surprising aim-mechanics (reticle snapping) were also one of the first things I noticed about this game.  You get control of an entire squad, which you'll want to bring back intact.\n\nBut when the goal isn't to rack up kills but is to finish a mission objective, and you inherit some sense of self-worth from how well you achieve that objective, it changes everything.  Soon you are meticulously approaching every door ready to use all of squadmates and weapons in your arsenal (and you feel guilty for the stupid sob's whose lives are about to end).\n\nYou drop in, kill everything that guards, get your hosties, and get out, and it's much better than the Counter-Strike approach ever was, because whereas Counter-Strike inherits from the Half-Life engine and the Quake engine, this actually inherits from the Unreal engine.\n\nAnd if you think back to all the things Unreal engine did that Quake never did, you'll start to realize this engine has some intersting capabilities.  Unreal had vehicles implemented during this engine cycle, large maps, and high-res textures.  Quake never implemented vehicles, and it still doesn't do that well (they're usually just static objects.)\n\nThis game doesn't have vehicles, but its scripted in tactical mechanics show the extensibility of the Unreal (vs Quake) framework.  Unreal engine now forms the basis for a bunch of other games including some VR titles.\n\nBut this also deserves a look.  It's really cool, I'm glad this friend recommended it to me, and I extend the reccomendation to you folk.\n\nIt's an old title, but it checks out.  You won't be disappointed by the strengths of the single-player oriented campaign here.

Daher erwartete ich die gleiche Kost, wie in den Vorg\u00e4ngern - und bekam sie auch.\n\nIch habe das Spiel nicht auf Steam gespielt, daher die kurze Spielzeit. Tats\u00e4chlich habe ich ca. 12 Stunden gespielt um die 15 Missionen durchzuspielen. Mit dem Add-On \"Athena Sword\" bekomt man noch 8 weitere Hauptmissionen, welche die Geschichte weiter erz\u00e4hlen.\n\nZum Positiven:\nWer auf kompromislose Taktik-Shooter steht, ist hier genau richtig. Ihr k\u00f6nnt eure Mission bis ins Detail selbst planen oder ihr nehmt eine vorgefertigte Einsatzplanung. Im Einsatz ist dann genauste Befolgung des Plans wichtig, sonst kommt das Ende eher, als man denkt.\n\nIhr habt die Auswahl zwischen Spezialisten f\u00fcr verschiedene Aufgaben und es steht euch alles an Ausr\u00fcstung zur Verf\u00fcgung, was das Taktiker-Herz begehrt.\n\nZum Negativen:\nDie Story ist echt lahm und die Pr\u00e4sentation alles andere als mitrei\u00dfend. Auch die Gegner bleiben absolut Gesichtslos. Wer hier nach Spannung sucht, ist verkehrt. Die ergibt sich ausschlie\u00dflich aus der Mission und deren Schwierigkeit.\n\nGrafik und Musik wirken mittlerweile sehr altbacken und irgendwie farblos/beliebig. Selbst in 4k und allen Details hat es mich nicht mehr begeistern k\u00f6nnen.\n\nBeim Add-On \"Athena Sword\" hat sich das Ganze etwas gebessert. Allerdings bleibt es storytechnisch genauso mau wie im Hauptspiel. Immerhin gibt es ein paar weitere Videos zu sehen. Im Gegenzug hat man aber die Sprachausgabe in den Briefings weggelassen. Das ist ziemlich unverst\u00e4ndlich.\n\nDer Sound an sich ist ganz ok, aber nichts au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches.\n\nWas mir allerdings den letzten Nerv geraubt hat, war die stellenweise echt d\u00e4mliche K.I.

Kill the terrorists, save hostages, defuse bombs, theres nothing team rainbow can't do. This game is challenging but is also rewarding when you use TACTICS. Todays games are not tactical except for a select few like Arma, Squad ect ect. If you want a good tactical shooter that is realistic and is not filled with shiny camos and run and gunners, then this game is for you.\n\nIf you want to play Multiplayer again check this out:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=816081740", "timestamp_created": 1493770240, "timestamp_updated": 1493770322, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31431387": {"recommendationid": "31431387", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096720764", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 716, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495341899}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly this is a very well made game from the early 2000's. Even though it does show sign of age, it is probably one of the best tactical shooters I have played. Everthing from the pre-mission planning, to the loadouts, and the actual missions are very well laid out, precise, and play well. It's sad game these days take on the more action based, COD approach, while this gem makes you take your moves carefully otherwise it can be very punishing. No walking in guns blazing, you need a strategy and you abosolutely need your teammates.\n\nPlease, Ubisoft, remake Rainbow like it was in the good days before becoming a duck and cover simulator.\n\n\n\n(Note) I am playing this on a modern system, so I had to make a couple tweaks to make it run smooth.

I picked it up for just over a pound on sale and expected an hour or so of fun before it got boring. I was more than wrong. This is extremely different from the modern RS games and one I really recommend to any fan of tactical shooters. \n\nYou can deploy up to 3 squads on a mission (of up to a total of 8 men throughout all 3 squads) and their gear can be customised to the T. You begin by carefully planning the actions of each squad via plotting waypoints with commands on a map; and while this isn't as detailed as it could be (you can't control the direction your squad is looking, for example) it's more than satisfactory.\n\nAfter planning, you enter an FPS \"action phase\". You can play either as a commander of one of your squads or simply spectate and issue orders on a radio. Either way, it makes for some very tense situations as you struggle to keep everyone alive. This tension is made greater by the fact that dead squadmates stay dead throughout the remainder of the campaign.\n\nSo, overall, I definitely recommend this game.

I definitely recommend getting the 2.0 mod for this game, as it's a vast improvement over the original layout. On to the game: I'm sure you've heard this game takes place in two parts - planning and action. Both are incredibly well done and are borderline simulation territory, but definitely still very gamey. The AI is pretty good, but not perfect. You can tell your squad to go clear a room and sometimes they will bunch in the doorway, ignoring terrorists. Another favorite is missions where enemies may not be armed, but are trying to complete some objective (like deleting data from computers). Many times, the AI would be told to clear a room and ignore these enemies, leading to a mission failure. For this reason, I feel there are a few missions that are just bugged and don't reflect the base game (namely mission 11, where it's unclear what is causing a mission failure, as all weapons were silenced and all enemies were killed upon entering a room). For missions like these, it's nice to have access to the developer console and just 'completemission.' This game is far from perfect, but it's really fun when everything comes together. The Gold Edition comes with the expansions, too, so you get a lot (around 30 missions?) for your money.

Great multiplayer and a variety of maps and equipment.\n\nThen Ubisoft shut down the key activation server for the addon (but not the main game) so suddenly half the maps and some of the guns became singleplayer-only. That was annoying.\n\nNow they shut down the key activation server for the main game and tagged it as singleplayer only in Steam. It's not nearly as fun in singleplayer. So go buy Arma instead.

This game was the absolute apex of brilliance when it came out. I remember taking the journey to GAME in Wimbledon with my mate to buy it the day it came out. My PC simply wouldn't run it at the time, so we took turns in having a life each. on his PC. We both digested the manual on the train back to his house and both watched the progress bar patiently as it installed from DVD.\n\nLittle did we know at the time that this game would form such a grip on our gaming lives and produce so many amazing nights of pure strategic fun and frustration. One fond memory was on Airport we hunted down the last Tango. Me and a mate we both stacked up on separate doors, in the upstairs above the hangar. He flashed and I ran in with pistol, we both dropped the tango on entry with syncronised double taps. Was perfect and still comes up in conversation when we meet for a beer to this day.\n\nThe beauty of this game for me was the amount of firearms available, the MP5 A4 was amongst, and still is my favourite. You can run with it and fire in burst or full auto and still hit your target. Weapons ranging from SMG through to sniper rifles can be deployed on any mission. Flash bangs, smoke greanades, tear gas (don\u2019t forget your mask), Breaching charges etc. A plethora of pistols and with differing calibers and even the ability to switch the ammunition type, FMJ or HP. Such a nice level of detail even down to armour loadouts heavy for protection light for speed low drag set ups.\n\nIt is a little dated by todays standards both graphically and in terms of movement but the core game mechanics and play is still great with a bunch of your mates on comms. Still some really nice touches in there for such an ageing title. The ability to open doors bit by bit so you can drop a flash in the close it then open it when the bang detonates is amazing.\n\nYou can still play the game via the in game browser, limited severs but still some hardcore players still linger, after all these years. I can\u2019t even remember how many times I have come back to this game despite it\u2019s glory days behind me. I tried to play vegas 2, it is a little dumbed down but has some nice features and it was a great game but the sound loop bug was never fixed an persisted to haunt me playing MP. So I couldn\u2019t play it online with mates.\n\nSo I bough the gold edition so I had a copy on steam (hence the hours recorded are few compared to the actual blood sweat and tears that have gone into it on the DVD version), I still have Ravenshield and Athena sword on disk, though this gold editon doesn't have Ironwraith that came out. Not sure if you can get this now. Which is a shame, no doubt you can find a Website somewhere for a forum of die hard players will have it or modded it.\n\nA truly epic game worth owning even just for posterity.\n\n\n\nEdit: UBISOFT finally pulled the plug on the in game browser and it's ability to scan for servers.

It's infuriating, it has complex controls, enemies are super tough, and even with the tutorial you still don't know every aspect and you'll die a lot. But god do I love this game.\n\nNOTE: I played like, the first level of Athena Sword and that's it. All I've played so far (mostly) is Raven Shield, which is the base game. I also played it with a mod called Raven Shield 2.0 (which you can find on moddb). I HIGHLY reccommend it, as it improved almost every aspect of the game by adding weapons, camo, ironsights, and adds nice little tweaks.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ For a early 2000's game, the graphics are decent. Not fantastic, but you won't be looking at the game and throwing up.\n\n+ The environments are very well detailed. Even rooms that are out of the way with nobody in them are still lovingly put together. Except for a few reused missions near the end, there don't seem to be many glaringly reused assets, and as you go to different places around the world they defintely put care into making you feel like you were there.\n\n+ Good arsenal of weapons, although some are clearly not as good as others. You'll likely stick with the same few weapons for your team every time you play, but the choices are nice.\n\n+ Tight shooting. Each weapon handles fairly well and as with real life, burst fire and semi-auto will take enemies out way faster than spraying. Playing with the mod adds ironsights, but in vanilla there are none, making it more akin to Counter Strike in how you aim (although you can still zoom in slightly).\n\n+ Great tactics. Planning out your entry is always worth your time, and failing a mission can, yes, feel like utter BS, but then you can go back and study where you went wrong. You tweak your plan, change this and that, and when you're finished your plan goes smooth as butter. Even if you don't use the planning screen and go in blind (which I've done for a few), you still have a good repetoire of on-site tactics at your disposal. Order your team to burst in a door guns blazing, or maybe soften them with flashbangs, or you can tell them to go in on command so you can hurry over to a good vantage point to aid them from a flanking position. Basically, if you liked the quick tactics of R6 Vegas and Vegas 2, you'll catch on quick here.\n\n+ As always with the early R6 games, the music is fantastic. You'll get pumped up for sure.\n\nMEH:\n\n~ The story is ok. Nothing special, just enough to keep you going in one direction.\n\n~ Limited movement. In the early R6 games you could mantle and climb, but here you can't even go up a 2 foot platform without finding stairs. You get used to it, though.\n\n~ Your team AI can be a mixed bag. Most of the time they're great, and they'll spot and kill enemies you didn't notice, and they have far better reactions than you (obviously, since they're not human!). A few times, though, they can get a bit irritating. (Minor Spoilers ahead, although I'll try to stay vague). There's a point where you go to stop some chemical weapons, and enemies in hazmat suits are the ones that activate them if you're spotted. Unfortunately, those hazmat dudes are \"non combatants\" and thus your team members dont target them! I lost that mission so many times because my team wouldn't open fire on those enemies, simply because those enemies weren't a real \"threat\" to us!\n\n~ While it has been updated to modern resolution settings, the main menu is still locked at like, 800x600 or something.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Enemy AI can be a pain. Missions with hostages can be suddenly lost because they open fire on hostages since they know you're here. Thing is, they /shouldn't/ know you're there. You'll have to be extra careful playing this game, because there WILL be times that you lost because of BS enemy AI.\n\n- Dated controls. Be sure to edit the controls before you start playing. The defaults are hallmarks of the old R6 games, back when FPS games didn't really have a \"standard\". Things like reload set to Z, Run set to Mouse2... yeah. Not a bad terrible thing, but when I played the first mission I freaked out because I had no idea what to do.\n\n- Little explanation of stats for players and weapons. What is \"self control\"? What is \"stability\"? I have no idea. Some make sense, like Stealth or Electronics, or Damage and Accuracy for weapons, but despite the game having many tooltips, they have none for those. I'm not a mind reader!\n\n\nSo in conclusion, its great. I love it, despite the difficulty and obtuse-ness of the game. I won't give it a number rating (because how I might percieve, say for example, a 7/10 might be different for another person). I will just say that for 10 bucks, you can't go wrong with this. Quite a few missions, plus you can replay those maps plus a few more with different modes, which might give you an extra hour or two of fun. Again, I do suggest the Raven Shield 2.0 mod for this game, because it \"modernizes\" it in all the right ways.", "timestamp_created": 1470974799, "timestamp_updated": 1482816883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24767244": {"recommendationid": "24767244", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994502398", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426631064}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of my favorite games of all time.

This game requires planning and strategy.  It is very realistic for a game.  \n\nReasons that this game is better than the other Rainbow Six Games:\n-Enemies go down in 1 or 2 hits and so do you.  Spotting and shooting the enemy first is a must.  Just because you or an enemy is down does not mean that they are dead.  Use the heart beat detector to see if someone is just down for the level or actually dead.  \n-You will spend a great deal of time planning and preparing.  You cannot win by superior reflexes alone.  \n-You cannot recover health on a mission.  Not even the world's best surgeon can make you as good as new a few minutes after being shot in the chest.  Hint, do not get shot.\n-When someone dies they die.  Even just being immobilized from injuries will cause someone to be unusable for the rest of the campaign.  Unlike many other games where you will be take an RPG to the face and when the fighting stops get right back up again like that was just a scratch.  \n-The computer AI is much better than the previous Rainbow Six games (especially friendly AI).  In an earlier Rainbow Six game I once sent a team of eight people to attack the enemy and they could not figure out how to open the first door.  Eventually the enemy became bored and opened the door where he casually shot and killed all eight members on my team.  No one on my team even fired a shot.  The AI in this game does not even have to be given orders.  They know to shoot bad guys and to defuse bombs that they pass.  \n-One of the worst things about the previous Rainbow six games was the stealth missions.  There is only one stealth mission in this game and it is actually beatable without having to try over and over again until the enemy moves in just the way you need them to and without having to use cheat codes.  \n\nRainbow Six... You will be missed.\n\nStrategy:\n-Use the camouflage type that the computer picks for you in the planning phase\n-Put silencers on all of your weapons\n-Stay crouched down\n-If you do those things you will almost always get the jump on the enemy even if you just threw a flashbang in the next room (missing realism here).   \n-The best all-around weapon is the Galil.  \n-All you really need is flashbangs and breach charges except for the stealth mission where you will need a heartbeat monitor.\n-On hostage rescue only missions always look for the quickest route to the hostages and do not spend any time exploring.  \n-Always wear heavy armor except on the stealth mission.  \n\nBugs:\n-On the first airport level your team will lose their path finding ability if they go out on the balcony and they will be stuck there until the level is over.  \n-Playing the game on Windows 10 is difficult because there is some setup work you have to do.  You must play in windowed mode, which means setting up the config files to run the game in the same resolution as your monitor so that it is full screened and windowed mode.", "timestamp_created": 1466813486, "timestamp_updated": 1466813486, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622625", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23743791": {"recommendationid": "23743791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116874598", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 61118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 133, "last_played": 1516499562}, "language": "english", "review": "old but incredibly challenging game .

Change it to \"UseVSync=False\". (Use ctrl+F to found UseVSync(...). Save and close the file.\n\nGo to your ATI/NVIDIA Control Panel and make sure that the vertical synchronization or vertical refresh is to the option OFF or Application Specific.\n\nThat's the first part of fixing it.\n\n2)\nYou can do it with 2 ways:\n\nEither disable one core by Alt-Tabbing out when the game is open, going to the Task Manager, going to the Processes, right-clicking to the ravenshield.exe from the list and selecting \"set affinty\", and deselecting CPU 0.\n\nor the recommended way so you don't have to do this each time you start the game:\n\nGo to your raven shield folder (not the system), and create a text file there. Open with notepad and paste this:\n\ncd system\nstart /affinity 01 ravenshield.exe\n\nand save the file as \"fixedstart.bat\" or whatever .bat\n\nNow by double clicking on this file will start the game single-core. You can create a shortcut for this to your desktop for easy launching. \n\nOBS: Sometimes the game will bug your mouse, just restart the game or your computer.\n\nOBS 2: If you are a little boring to found all enemies, press ' (the buttom bellow the ESC) and write \"route\"\n\ngod - makes you invencible\nghost - you can fly\nwalk - disable flight mode\ngodhostage 1 - invencibility for hostages\ngodteam - you team never dies\nneutralizeterro - neutralize all terrorists\nrescuehostage - rescue all hostages (obviously)\ndisarmbombs - disarme all bombs\ntsurrender - all terrorists surrender on sight\nfullammo - gaves you full ammo (obviously again)\n\nHave fun!", "timestamp_created": 1464171702, "timestamp_updated": 1464172690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888253", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23190004": {"recommendationid": "23190004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088156196", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471574745}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS 10.\n\nThis game used to be my life.

Exteremely quick (and in the campaing, permanent) death, slow movement and the ability to carry only one rifle, one sidearm and 6 grenades at most are somewhat realistick but don't believe it when people call this game hyper realistic. The game's immersion is broken easily by things like hip-fire reticlespread applying even when using a scope. The relatively braindead ai is a known problem, but it doesnt matter because the enemy isn't supposed to do anything else than react to hearing gunfire and fire at you when they see you. Your teammates on the other hand do just fine, because they do as they are told and don't improvise anything stupid. Except when they decide to fall off from a ladder and die, forcing you to restart the mission. The pseudo-randomized enemy placement and the sometimes unreliable teammate ai make sure that however well you plan your missions, you will need at least one retry before you get the desired no casualty -run. The fact that planning your mission can take up a good 20-30 minutes and executing the plan take a rough 5 min depending on mission. That is, if you get it working on the first try. Fixing your plan between retries can easily take up a cumulative 30min unless you have to redo the plan altogether. All that combined and you can waste an evenening just trying to complete that one hostage recue. The game can be very frustrating on the other hand very satisfying when you finally complete that one mission.

At launch, this game was well worn out by me and my crummy disc drive back in the day. I probably played 200+ hours total of this game, and half of those hours spent on Lan or on Ubisoft servers. This review will partially be based on those good and memorable times that I had, as well as the time that i spent owning this game over Steam. So if things sound unusual and out of perspective, it's probably because of me remembering the good ol' days of fast and tactical games. (Also not to mention the amount of bias put into here.) So, without further ado, here's the actual review...\n\nThe Rainbow Six games have always been a special gem in my heart. It's slow, creeping suspense and sudden firefights have always left a warm feeling in my heart. The old ones kept me in excitement, with every day of school meaning a night of fun with my friends and I. Rainbow Six 2 was always personally my favorite, giving the most diverse and exciting gameplay of its time. It was great. \n\nHowever, those times ended, and my faith flew out the window when I was surpised to hear the next day that Ubisoft bought Red Storm out of the blue. This made the bright shining gem in my heart turn into a dark, twisted gem that I couldn't possibly light up again. How could Ubisoft create a great, diverse Rainbow Six game that follows the rules and dynamic systems that the previous installments had? I had little hope left, but something told me I had to try it. And so I bought the disc...\n\nAnd it was AWESOME!\n\nI shouldn't have let Ubisoft down. They left a hole in my heart, but somehow, they still managed to create a great game like all the rest. It was a polish of Rainbow Six 2, complete with weapon models, HD texture, and not-so-braindead AI. It was the most fun tactical shooters I had. \n\nRainbow Six 3 not only delivered the game to the fans, but delivered it with passion. It was such a great game that they couldn't have possibly dissapointed. The singleplayer was great, competative online was good, and LAN Parties over Co-op was the BEST. Even to today, I still invite my friend over with his PC, have some pizza, and play a little bit of this exhilirating shooter. \n\nAnd then this Steam version came out, and, although the multiplayer services are down, (Thanks Ubisoft, you assholes) you can still get a good time out of this game. \n\nSo, as expected, here is a rundown of the scores...\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10\nGraphics: 7/10 (Better than COD and BF though)\nMultiplayer: 9/10\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\nRecommendation: Everyone should give this game a try, but Rainbow Six # aims for tactical people who like to have a little fun with their friends. (And possibly not have friends anymore.... Just saying) \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1456348496, "timestamp_updated": 1456348496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21360959": {"recommendationid": "21360959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025157394", "num_games_owned": 272, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 4000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487176717}, "language": "english", "review": "Best one in the whole series\n\nPS: We need Rogue Spear on steam", "timestamp_created": 1456051510, "timestamp_updated": 1456051510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740520", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21354745": {"recommendationid": "21354745", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995243303", "num_games_owned": 214, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4768, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509765135}, "language": "english", "review": "The enemies are psychic retards, your allies are the regular variety, there are a bunch of weird glitches like planning mode options breaking and soldiers going on not thier gocode, the stealth mission is impossible to do without cheesing it with the heartbeat radar, and some missions towards the end of the game require you to instantly kill everyone vaguely in the area really quickly lest they destroy the objective (they WILL sense you through doors).  I spent 61 hours on it.\n\nOnce you figure out the interface, planning out missions gives a satisfaction linear military shooters will never have, and once you figure out how to handle firefights and clear rooms you'll feel Operator as hell.  Permadeath and the complexity of planning might make this game suboptimal as your first tactical FPS, but still try it if you're not willing to hunt down SWAT 4.  Partial door opening and leaning are absolute brilliance, too bad your teammates can't toss a grenade through a door crack.\n\nSmoke grenades are great, don't take hours and hours to realize that like I did.  Don't go out of your way to make complex plans, especially if they require parallel movement (reserve that for particular sections and rooms).

I got this game when it came out in 2003 and I just re-installed it, and it's as good as ever. I've beaten the single player 4 times, twice on elite, and it doesn't get any better than the feeling of successfully completing a mission with no fatalities.

I enjoyed Vegas 2 immensely as well but Rainbow six 3 is just superior. It is so amazing when you set out a complex plan and have your team execute it successfully. \n\nThe shooting in this game is also quite fun and there is a good challenge to it. This game is all about setting up a strategy for your 1-8 team members (each are unique and have their own stats like sniping, electronics, etc), in which you can create 1-3 fire teams and set up complex orders for them in the planning stage. You can set \"go codes\" which mean a team will wait for a player order to set up a synchronized attack (such as having gold team breach and clear and green team toss a tear gas grenade in, while red team sets up a sniping potion to protect the flanks).\n\nThe missions are fun and have excellent map design where multiple different strategies can be executed. There is perma-death for everyone so you must be careful with their lives.\n\nThe AI while basic at times can be quite intelligent. It can flank you, toss grenades, retreat to a different area and even surrender (careful sometimes a surrendering enemy will have an enemy their to flank you when you try to cuff the bastard).\n\nThis is a game for a more intellectual FPS gamer and is the best Rainbow Six game out there (I've played them all except siege but that is nothing like this game at all).

Which was realistical tactical shooter, where you would create your own plan for the level and then execute it, being excited to see how your dumb AI teammates will get slaughtered this time. And yes, it uses \"one shot, one kill\" system, almost. Released in in 2003 by Red Storm and Ubisoft, it also had console ports for Xbox, PS2 and Gamecube. Consoles ports were different: no planning, you command only one 4-man squad and each got few hitpoints.\nThis is Gold, meaning that it comes with inclusion of original Raven Shield game and the first expansion pack - Athena Sword, that mostly adds few more levels, released in 2004.\nThere also was a second expansion pack, which was almost finished (probably meaning that it just didn't go through debugging), Iron Wrath. It was released for free in 2005 on Internet anyway. Meaning that people were happy, aside from 56kb modem users. \n\nSo, technical stuff. While main menu and planning phase work at 4:3 resolution, gameplay itself supports widescreen resolution. But it doesn't change FOV, so you will be seeing chubby people. But it crashes sometimes when you change between planning phase and execution phase. So always save your plans!\nExpansion packs are a bit weird in that they will not play their new sounds, that are briefing voice acting and new sounds for new weapons. To fix that, you will have to go to mods folder, find folder of needed expansion pack, and then copy \"Sounds\" folder from there to the root directory of the game.\nYou also will have problems installing free Iron Wrath, as installer will not recognise Rainbow Six for what it is. To fix that just check Steam Guides. In nutshell, you will have to create new key in Registry where retail version of a game keeps all the needed info about itself. You don't have to screw the system itself, don't worry.\n\nAs for multiplayer, well, you could play in either coop or competive. It used old Ubi service, but as of now, multiplayer is technically dead. I heard that at some point you was required to use UPlay account instead, but it didn't work for me.\nEDIT: Because turns out that my actual login, that is email, is way too long for the game. HA!\n\nIn this game you play as anybody of Rainbow Six squad, the point of which is to make terrorist think that they are dealing with six pony-loving hippies, only to be met with eight aim-botting hard-try top operatives. But because it's a top secret squad and it's actions are written off as actions of special forces of whatever country they are in, the shock tactic of the name just never works. Just use flashbangs for that.\nWell, in this part you are dealing with neo-nazi terrorists who love taking hostages, listen to briefing and watch occasional cutscenes that make you feel good and even heroic for a job well done. Which is nice. It has ending video, so that's enough.\n\nAnother thing to note is that Rainbow Six is full of only top-top-top people, only the best individuals from separate parts of world. And then, after collecting them all, no one bothered to teach them how to work as a team. The only thing they ever learned is that they are supposed to walk in a line. And even then it can go wrong in small hallways, where a leader of a line will turn around and start pushing the tail out, as it refused to turn around, until his heavily armored butt slides out from the doorway and gets filled with bullets, while you scream at the screen in observation mode. Good bullets. Shiny, sturdy, can survive from -50 to +50 degrees of temperature. Must be 7.62x39mm ones. A bit outdated, but good bullets indeed, tactical-realism fans approve.\nNo, really, I got to see that few times.\n\nBut really, AI in single-player game can do a lot of things to sabotage the fact that game relies on squad-based tactics.\nAnd well, let's say that Rainbow Six 3 isn't as best ever as fans tend to call it.\nOr at least it didn't age well.\nAnd when I say \"didn't age well\", what I mean is \"SWAT 4 came out\". Which was not only more tactical, but implented proper AI teammates. No planning phase though.\n\nAt least graphics and music in this game are still nice. Even got ambient music sometimes playing during mission and such. And ragdolls look funny nowdays, just crashing onto floor. Blam.\n\nAnyway, since fans of tactical-realistical games always brag about such games and on question \"what is tactical exactly?\" they answer only \"ummmm... you are too stupid to get\", here is what you get to expect: Abuse leaning around corners when you are controlling a soldier; Abuse the aimbotness of AI teammates and place them in such way that no one walks behind them; Throw smoke grenade to become invinsible for AI; Try to come into difficult room from few directions with different teams. Those four rules is what makes this game. And planning.\n\nYou get into mission and first thing you get is briefing. After that, you are going to set up a plan. And oh boy, that's the main feature of the early games of franchise, as you get to put waypoints for up to three teams. You can also coordinate them together by setting go-codes. Tell them to throw grenade or breach the door. Actually, you can either try to beat level with no plan like generic realistical shooter, use pre-made one, use pre-made one and edit if neccersary or just make up a whole new one. And it's just awesome that you can make the map play out the way you want. \n\nUntil you will find out that AI can't open door slightly and throw grenade in, like players. Or bounce grenade at the wall, limiting the usage of flashbang. Or that they have tendency to never stop at waypoints and fire full-automatic while walking. Or that they will never decide to wait for enemy come out if they hear \"huh, that's strange\". Or the way you can't order them to throw smoke grenade down the tunnel in the third mission, so it's only up to player. Or just find out that some tasks AI does really badly.\n\nIn other words, while it DOES require tactical planning, but for dumb AI. Through trial-and-error of execution you will find what AI does best and judging by this you will build your plan for dummies. Which takes away some enjoyment.\nIf you try to pull something clever in this, you will have to do dirty job with your own hands. And even if you build a good plan, there is a bit of randomness on placement of some terrorists, so it can sometimes go wrong anyway.\n\nAfter that, you set up a squad, pulling 8 members for a job and separating them into teams. While wondering what's the point of Demos, who just make some objectives complete few seconds faster, and recons types. After that you look at huge list of samey weapons that you don't care about, pick the strongest/favourite assault rifle and put silencer onto it, as there is no real tactical choice. Unless sniper rifle. Then you look over some more useless devices, including multiplayer-only, which are in campaign for some reason, or like tear gas grenade and gas mask.\n\nThen you start execution and watch the new way your team getting slaugthered in some wacky way on the first minute, then beat remaining mission as a lone wounded machine gunner, slumbering with broken legs and getting through by abusing leaning, which is how I did pre-last mission. Actually, that was slightly fun. But only for once.\n\nBut really, the main reason to recommend it is the lack of alternatives. No other tactical FPS outside of Rainbow Six has detailed planning, as far as I am aware! So it's sad that Ubisoft wasted this part. New R6 games are still nice, but should have kept feature that was making franchise unique.\nNot as sad as lack of SWAT4 on Steam though.\nAnd for epic main theme that overloads nostalgia.", "timestamp_created": 1443643000, "timestamp_updated": 1464713988, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706528", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18141219": {"recommendationid": "18141219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198145333121", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442897736}, "language": "english", "review": "Win 8.1 Dont bother buying waste of money unless your vision happens to flash at the exact same time this BULLSHIT does.. rediculous dont sell a fucking game that doesnt work anymore guys\n", "timestamp_created": 1442897835, "timestamp_updated": 1442897835, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18126993": {"recommendationid": "18126993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112011479", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 82, "playtime_forever": 1241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 351, "last_played": 1515901396}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4e00\u4ee3RAINBOW SIX\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u91cd\u590d\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1442803342, "timestamp_updated": 1442803342, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18092829": {"recommendationid": "18092829", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991350530", "num_games_owned": 727, "num_reviews": 108, "playtime_forever": 1015, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488079793}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't be fooled by my steam playtime, I have much longer logged on my boxed copy and still play to this day. It's a game I enjoy so much I bough a steam copy just for backup purposes.  \n\nThe end of an era, it marks the last great tactical shooter on the market before this series descended into mediocrity. Nothing else since this has come close to equalling its quality of brutal, unforgiving tactics. This is a game that wears its realism on its sleeve and isn't afraid to let you drop dead from one bullet fired from a guy you couldn't even have seen coming. You move slowly and even walking throws your aim way off. Repeated autofire might as well be fired with your eyes closed. Guns feel weighty and impactful, dropping enemies in one or two torso shots.  It's harsh and doesn't feel remotely fair at times, but having smooth, flawless success in this game is more satisfying than any other shooter I've played. \n\nUnlocking all the maps requires playing through the campaign mode, where the iffy team AI and permanent injuries/death to the squad members can make things frustrating, but if you take the time to plan things out they usually go well. The game has no tolerance for the slightest mistake, for even a single corner left unchecked, and requires awareness and caution you rarely need in other games. \n\nThe real fun comes with friends. Competitive modes are fine, but nothing's better than the sheer teamwork it takes to clear out a whole map in co-op. And the sheer disaster that can strike if any one of you slips up for a moment.

Don't care about the graphics. It is outdated yes, but the gameplay makes you forget all about it as it is just amazing to be an officer for Rainbow Six.\n\nThis is the last best game in the series (Still waiting for the cod version of Rainbow Six, aka Siege), and is a must if you love S.W.A.T. 4 or any of the Rainbow Six games before Siege. If you love tactical shooters in general, this is a must buy.\n\nRainbow Six 3 has a really systematic and a fantastic planing phase, where you decide all the orders of what Teams Red, Green and Yellow shall do (if you have more than one team). You get to decide movement, actions, aggressiveness and order other teams/your team to wait until you give the command to move or the other team is ready. The enemy A.I. is not great, they react poorly to sounds and friendly corpses. If you run, they'll hear you through floors, if you shoot, they'll only hear you if your standing next to them. If they witness someone die, they don't care, why should they?\n\nShooting feels great and realistic. It is really hard to hit something if you're not aimed down your sight. If you spray, you'll miss your target and probably die. Bullets are deadly, meaning you'll die in just a few bullets even with the heavy gear. You're not a bullet sponge, be careful around corners.\n\nLeaning, leaning around corners is REALLY important here, and they've done a fantastic job with that. There is the standard q and e to lean, but also ctrl. With controll, you can lean how ever you want, it makes taking cover a much easier job than in other shooters.\n\nRS3 has the standard gamemodes, Terrorist Hunt (killing terrorists), Hostage Rescue, Bomb defusal and so on. However, in RS3, hostages can and will be shot by Ts, if not careful. If they're alerted, they'll shot them without hesitation. Plan your moves, don't run and gun, and be f#cking careful.\n\nI love the Rainbow Six series, and fully recommend getting all of them.

It can still be fun to play with people, granted they know what they are doing. The game may have some technical flaws (it being old). If you want to play good old Rainbow Six without wrestling with the Original's engine, pick this one up.\n\nRainbow Six 3 is a squad based, tactical shooter. This game allows you to take control of the elite counterterrorism unit RAINBOW (yes, that's the name of the unit).\n\nThis game is not something you rush into. You need tactics. The game has an entire planning phase where you can modify how each group of operatives moves. You can tell them to wait on your mark, then when you give the go-code, open the door and flash through it.\n\nMultiplayer still works, however you have to have a uPlay account. You could try lan or hamachi, but I didn't test that. \n\nThe game has a mutlitude of weapons and armor for you to choose. You can use silenced smgs with flashbangs and go full on stealth, or use 50.cal snipers and M4's with frag grenades to go all out.\n\nThis game is also not as easy as your usual FPS. You get a maximum of 1-3 hits before your dead. Everyone follows this rule. Once someone's dead, they can no longer be chosen, so make sure your teammates don't die.\n\nThe game also has some mechanics that I've never seen any other FPS have before, or after. These are the fluid lean and door opening. Using the mouse, you can adjust your character to lean at many other angles other than one. Fluid door opening allows you to open doors halfway, a tiny bit, or just enough to let a grenade through.\n\nThat said, the game has flaws. The planning stage is locked at ~800x600 (the game isn't but the menus are). The game can sometimes be a bit hard to get into, and you may have to do levels over and over to make sure your preferred teammates didn't die. This game is way different than alot of FPSes out today (Call of Duty, Team Fortress, and Battlefield aren't very comparable. Counter-Strike is a bit comparable, but still has alot of differences).", "timestamp_created": 1420066670, "timestamp_updated": 1420066670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13690506": {"recommendationid": "13690506", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033659080", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486096503}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a shame this style of PC game play has disappeared over the years.

Also the choice of guns is impressive - you can pick from higher number, than in e.g. any CoD series game.\nBut what makes the game unique is planning and executing the plans. You need to pick at least one soldier (up to 8 with 4-men limit per squad) and here is your choice. You may plan exactly your actions, so that you do not need to even touch the keyboard, because the soldiers will do everything for you. You may play it as a shooter (though a much harder one, than the new ones) or play a 'hybrid' version - plan some key actions -e.g. synchronize the assault of one room (with a hostage being kept there for example) and attack it from two sides. It doesn't matter, which playing style you enjoy more, because it will be great anyway.\nIf you're a fan of a true gameplay and enjoy playing tactical shooters - this game is perect for you!", "timestamp_created": 1419467555, "timestamp_updated": 1480331267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13576956": {"recommendationid": "13576956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000224381", "num_games_owned": 137, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1297, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462654003}, "language": "english", "review": "Motherfucking old school classic.

The enemy AI will execute hostages if they see the player, run if they are outnumbered, and even surrender to trick the player into letting your guard down, so that their friend can shoot the player in the back! \n-Lots of weapons, gear, and customisability. One can customise not only their own soldier's weapons, gear, and armour, but their teammates as well. \n-Planning. The game allows the player to set waypoints for their team and AI teams, and the AI teams will automattically follow. One can even set \"Go codes\" to make the AI wait for the code to begin an action, such as breaching. \n-The multiplayer still works. One can set up their own dedicated server in a few simple steps. See my discussion post for help. \n-Lots of fun game modes and maps. This game has many fun game modes, such as Lone Wolf (terrorist hunt alone); Terrorist Hunt (kill all the terrorists); and Hostage Rescue (self-explanatory). It also features classic maps such as Peak, Presidio and Prison. \n-Fairly good graphics. While these graphics aren't amazing, they still hold up well today. \n-Non-linear maps. Play your way. \n\nSo, if you have played Rainbow Six Vegas 1 or 2, come see what the classic games were like!

Since then, I have played that thing to death: memorizing enemy locations, the stats of certain characters, and the best weapons combinations. Why? Because not only does this game have excellent gameplay, but no matter how many times you beat it, you can always find better ways to play, or cooler ways to succeed.\n\nThe positive aspects of the game are inherent to the gameplay - being a tactical shooter, Rainbow Six 3 (Raven Shield) with its expansions let you use maps to guide ally movements and actions. An example: I know that there is a hostage at the room on the right above the stairs. I can map Green Team, the group I have equipped with heavy assault rifles, to breach the double doors in the center while Red Team, with their silenced weapons, push through the exit in the back, cutting them off quickly. This all happens while I send Gold team to snipe from the runway, ensuring no tangos get the jump on us. We go on the call \"Bravo.\"\nIt's the most fun I have had playing a Tom Clancy Game.\n\nThe negatives come only with the age of the game. It was made in 2003, so the graphics, compared to today, are sub-par. That also means the the AI is a little slow and flawed. Sometimes terrorists can pinpoint your position and pull off a headshot without ever knowing you were there, and sometimes your allies will walk into a full warehouse of badies walking backwards, continuing the slaughter. This can be incredibly aggravating, but these occurences are few and far between.\n\nYou have a lot of freedom with gun customization, especially for a game of this particular era, and a lot of freedom with how you plan and execute your missions.

I used to play this all the time with my dad, and as such constitutes some of my fondest childhood memories.\n\nAnyway, let's dive right in.\n\nThis game has technical issues. The menus are locked to 800x600 (?) resolution, though the game itself supports much higher resolutions. It did 1080p just fine for me. However, due to the different resolutions, your resolution will fluctuate whenever you enter/leave the menus. Kind of annoying, but no big deal. You better get used to the low resolution though, because you'll be spending a lot of time in the planning menu. Which brings me to my next point...\n\nThis is not your typical action FPS. It's relatively slow paced and you spend a lot of time planning things out. There are 3 teams you can customize. You can outfit each team member with different armor, weapons, weapon attachments, various types of grenades, and various utility tools. During planning you can dictate where your teams go, how they go there, what they do when the reach there, etc.\n\nFor example, you might want green and gold team to wait for your signal (\"Alpha, go!\") before they clear a particular room. \n\n- Want one team to throw a smoke and the other to throw a flashbang before doing storming the room? Done. \n- Locked door? No problem, tell them to breach it first.\n- Hostages? Throw some tear gas in. Don't worry, you can outfit your guys with gas masks.\n\nThere is a ton of ways to complete missions. You can take control of a team as well, and co-ordinate with the other teams in clearing a level. \n\nAI sometimes spotty. On occasions the AI will get stuck bumping into one another, or they'll be looking in stupid directions while taking fire. Most of the time though the AI is quite capable. You'll see your teams moving in formation, covering for one another. They'll strafe into rooms. I've actually been saved by my AI companion more times than I can count, so they're certainly not a burden.\n\nThere is auto-aim, but you can turn it off. You can also configure how sensitive you want the auto-aim to be.\n\nThere is a lot of trial and error. Your plans will not work on the first try. You'll be going through the level halfway when one of your teams starts getting killed off. Then you'll go back to the planning stage and try to rectify the flaws in your master plan. Maybe green team should throw a smoke before storming this particular room. Maybe you should reposition gold team so that they can better cover fire for green team. This is as much a strategy game as it is an action one.\n\nAnother this is that death is permanent. You have a roster of soldiers, and if they die during a mission, they will not be available for subsequent missions. This gives you an incentive to complete missions with minimum casualties. Soldiers can be wounded too, making them move slower and have slower reflexes. Wounded soldiers recover after a couple missions.\n\nThis game is fantastic, but it's not for everyone. It can't really be compared to anything else on the market.

Though I did enjoy them, The Rainbow Six Vegas games were a little watered down to cater to the casual gamer compared to Raven Shield and Athena Sword. In fact, I believe this was the last decent and truely \"realistic\" tactical FPS. There are tons of maps in this game that allow for play styles varying from precise, patient and meticulously planned long range engagements to savage, fast paced and adrenaline fueled Close Quarters Battle. There is a massive selection of weapons, attachments, class specific items and even ammunition types allowing the player to tailor their kit to their play style. The armory is bigger than any game that I can think of. Because of this, the replayability of this game is endless. \n\nWhile it continues to be surprisingly entertaining for a game released in 2003, it is beginning to show it's age and lacks some of the innovative features seen in modern games. The player cannot look down the iron sights of the weapons. Unless optics are mounted on the weapon, the right mouse button only causes a zoom effect. Also the graphics are a bit obsolete. The installation of the Ravenshield 2.0 mod fixes this, however, by improving textures and adding many of the features (including iron sights) that we as gamers have become accustomed to in the last decade. \n\nTo summarize, if you haven't played this game and you crave a challenging, thinking man's tactical shooter over the mindless run and gun FPS' you get these days you need this in your Steam library. If I can play this game consistently for over a decade without it getting old, I'm pretty sure you can get at least 100 hours out of it.

I played Rainbow Six on the console and I beat it once... only once. The game has you playing against Supersoldier-Nazi-terrorists from the future, seriously you should watch the intro... that's the only way I can explain the story, for America. You thought CoD: World at War was deep? This game is deeper. This game is about fighting for America.... in Switzerland.\n\nAs a fun, challenging game, Rainbow Six has you taking control of up to three teams and with you planning out their movements along with placing checkpoints yourself. As you start the mission and having your teams following their pre-constructed paths, they will all inevitably die to the incredible aim of the Super-soldier-Nazi-Terrorists (I always manually take control of teams and members to make sure no one dies). Still, it was much easier than the console version which basically had you and three other guys (or four, I forgot) with no backup and running into a whole lotta crossfires and traps. Men get blown to pieces by Terrorists with their grenades and you will get cutdown mercilessly by molten metal fired from the barrels of hidden guns.\n\nThis game is easier, with the ability to pre-plan your movements and the ability to take control of multiple teams and team members. This game isn't about twitch shooting or aim, it's about precaution. Precaution as in, \"Don't run in clear view of a sniper you dumbfuck.\" The game doesn't hold your hand and requires a lot of luck at times, but in all honesty it is how you plan and how you plan to execute it along with a plan B if everything goes wrong. If you find firefights too frustrating, the game even allows aim assist (the equivalent of aimbotting). You have to anticipate the shittiest situations and how to deal with them. I like the weapons, most of them have different stats and have situational advantages during some missions. However, shotguns are completely inaccurate unless you've got a scope on it (which I find strange).\n\nTeam members also have stats and it somewhat rewards you for keeping them alive. The more men survive through missions the better stats they get, so they can aim better, run better, etc. Always keep stealth team members with other stealth team members otherwise the other dudes in the group will give them away. Having a balanced number of team members and organizing their equipment is actually.... fun.\n\nI get to choose what weapon to use, what grenades I want and who I want with me. Yeah, the game can get frustrating at times, but mostly it is your fault if you lose. You have to observe enemy movement, study their patrol paths and watch them intently then plan actions accordingly. You can't run in every room throwing a smoke grenade because of your limited supplies. The heartbeat sensors actually make the game easier because you can see where terrorists are going through the walls and doors (console game had thermal vision). You're never supposed to fight the enemy head-on not unless you've put yourself in a advantageous situation (i.e. smoked room enemy can't see you, flash bang renders terrorists unable to fight back etc.).\n\nMultiplayer is also a blast, if you ever get to play just use your Uplay account username and password. I had to play with three or so other guys against hordes of terrorists in the other room with us throwing tear gas this way and that. There are plenty of wonderful pvp and pve levels that has you killing terrorists on top of buildings, in cities, on boats and wherever the strange and unique level designs take you. Did I tell you I got to fight Nazi Terrorists...

Texture is better, character models are well detailed\nGameplay-wise, it's still the same old Rainbow Six game; Slow-paced, u die very easily and u only get one chance.\n\nThe game is pretty fun and frustrating at the same time coz u'll never know what is gonna come up next. Clearing rooms, wide areas, u wont know whether u'll die or not and that's the point of being tactical. Cover the corners, make sure that the room is clear, using different grenades to ur advantage.\n\nIn conclusion, if u're a fan of Rainbow Six, this is the last Rainbow Six game right before the Vegas series to stand true to the old Rainbow Six vibe. I recommend u to pick it up and just play it. Although the online experience is pretty dead but there are a few servers that has players in them.\nIf u're NOT a fan of Rainbow Six, it is ur choice.

I haven't seen this much weapons in most other shooters).\nThere are usually lots of ways to approach a mission, so it never gets boring to me.\n\n\nMore importantly, this game is REALLY great at coop-gameplay. (so I'm focusing on that)\nIn fact it's one of it's big strenghts were it excells vs. other shooters in my opinion.\n\nThe AI is fully functional (no bugs AFAIK) and coop-missions with other players against the AI are really a lot of fun.\nUsually the AI is occupying some building, and you and your squad (up to 8 players) need to clear the building or rescue hostages or whatever else there is to do, depending on the game mode selected.\n\nYou have to work as a team, coordinate actions etc. in order to win against up to 35 (or even 40?) terrorists.\nNo annoying \"spawns\" of enemies behind your back, like it's in the newer Rainbow Six Vegas games.\nEvery enemy is placed on the map right at the start of the game, so no one \"spawns\".\n\nThe only way they can end up behind you is either if they are patroling or if they spot you and \"escape\", they usually try to flank you or they run away and cause trouble for some of your teammembers.\nBut there is no way they can \"spawn\" behind you, as they are placed on the map right at the start of the round.\n(enemies that spawned behind my back were a huge annoyance in RS Vegas 2 to me...)\n\nAnyway, this game really gives me the impression that I'm working in an elite squad consisting of 8 members, that has to take out a bunch of terrorists.\nThere is no other game that's better at delivering this \"feeling\".\nAt least I don't know of it, if there is any equal or better at all.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who likes to play tactical shooters with coop-gameplay.\n", "timestamp_created": 1403865648, "timestamp_updated": 1403865648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10846653": {"recommendationid": "10846653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043218780", "num_games_owned": 556, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487715745}, "language": "english", "review": "Tom clancy simulator 2004\n\nrip/dead", "timestamp_created": 1403814913, "timestamp_updated": 1403814913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.492443", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10835449": {"recommendationid": "10835449", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994659542", "num_games_owned": 414, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1916, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496868685}, "language": "english", "review": "THE best tactical shooter by far.\n\n - Work with your friends or solo to save hostages and defuse bombs.\n - You die in about two hits so you have to plan every move carefully\n - You have a range of commands for your AI team, breaching doors, clearing rooms etc.\n - A large selection of weapons and customisation", "timestamp_created": 1403794737, "timestamp_updated": 1403794737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10812149": {"recommendationid": "10812149", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090514599", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2750, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514495440}, "language": "english", "review": "AWESOME GAME!

Both Vegas games have their fair share of problems, including bad third-person cover systems, enemies that spawn behind you, nonsensical instant deaths, sound glitches, and (in the case of Vegas 2) a sprint function that makes the multiplayer feel more like a slower CoD than a tactical shooter. Everyone on the internet told me that RS3 is better in every way, the definitive tactical shooter.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nRainbow Six 3 has enemies that can't hear gunfire from 10 feet away or see their friends die right in front of them, but they are quite capable of seeing through brick walls and hearing footsteps from across the room. On more than one occasion, I died at random, one time by an explosion that didn't have an accompanying grenade or terrorist.\n\nThe weapon selection is decent, though I find it hard to find anything to be excited about. You can customize your weapons by choosing between features like an extended mag, a scope, or a silencer. Some weapons have multiple ammo types which don't really matter in a terrorist hunt. Character customization does not exist, but it isn't really needed.\n\nMovement is slow, but that's to be expected. What isn't expected is the painfully slow sidestep.

SWAT 4 is very close but RVS comes out on top. In Rainbow Six 3 you take control of an international counter-terrorist unit called Rainbow and your job is to prevent terrorists from doing whatever it is that they are trying to do. To achieve this you use the powerful mission planner to plan your mission to the finest detail, coordinating up to three teams or a maximum of eight operatives. The planner will let you do anything you need to do to get the job done. For example you can set up go-codes to clear a room from multiple directions simultaneously. You can define how the teams make entry into a room: should they breach the door using a breaching charge? Should they throw in a flashbang or gas grenade before entering the room? You get the picture. You can also define the rules of engagement and movement speed of your teams for any waypoint. You can command them to be stealthy and only fire when fired upon for example or you can make them run and shoot on sight if you need to cover ground quickly to get to a hostage or bomb. The planner is awesome.\n\nAfter you've finished planning your mission you can equip your teams any way you want. There's a lot of gear to choose from. There are light, medium and heavy armor and they affect your stealthiness and speed. Light armor is quiet and stealthy but does not offer much protection. Medium is a great balance and heavy armor looks kind of like riot gear and gives you extra protection but all your actions like switching weapons, turning around etc take a little longer to complete. You'll also be louder when you move. Then there are the weapons. There's a huge selection of SMG's, assault rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols, machine pistols, grenades etc. There is also a selection of tactical gear like heartbeat sensors, demolition kits (to speed up defusing of bombs), lockpicking kits etc. You can equip each individual operative however you want.\n\nWhen you get in the mission itself you can switch between teams and operatives to control them at any time or you can stick to controlling your guy and let the AI do it's job according to the plan you've set out for those teams. The friendly AI is very good. The trailing guy will cover the rear of your team and they are very aware of their surroundings and they are accurate as well when firing. They're also good at clearing rooms. They get through the door quickly and each operative will cover their own area of responsibility in the room. You can command your AI team mates on the fly to perform actions like clearing rooms using breaching charges, flashbangs, gas grenades etc. You can also command them to pick locks, defuse bombs or to escort hostages out of harms way. You can perform these actions yourself also. The damage modelling is pretty awesome. You suffer different effects depending on where you're shot (if you're lucky enough to only get wounded that is). Your aim suffers a lot if you get hit in your arm for example. You can't run and your walking slows if you get hit in the leg and so on. Good mission planning is crucial because you want your team members to survive the mission so you can use them again. You have a limited number of operatives of varying skill levels and specialties and if they get wounded they will need time to heal before you can use them again. If they die you lose them for the rest of the campaign. The sounds are awesome too.\n\nThe enemy AI could be a little better although there's nothing in their behaviour that would get really annoying during gameplay. Sometimes one of them will drop a grenade as he dies and after it goes off you can hear \"huh, what was that?\" from the next room as if you can't tell when a frag grenade goes off in the hallway. They're pretty good at coming to investigate noises and stuff like that and they will use cover and get backup if you miss your shot and they get away. On the hardest setting they can be pretty brutal and it's tough to complete missions without any casualties to your team unless you've planned it perfectly.\n\nAfter you get the hang of the game you can get online and you'll find there are still people playing. You can play adversarial modes or you can play the campaign missions co-operatively with your friends, coordinating take downs etc. using teamspeak for example. Multiplayer requires a ubi.com account and the game does lack voice comms of it's own but those are not big minuses.\n\nThe game is still every bit as awesome as it was when it came out. The graphics are a bit dated but it will run like a dream in very high resolutions and with ridiculous amounts of AA and AF on. With those kinds of settings it looks pretty good. Also you can get a mod called Raven Shield 2.0 that will enhance the realism of the game to even higher levels adding things like iron sights and it also has higher resolution textures for the operators and terrorists enhancing the look of the game.

Are you wearing armor thick enough to stop it from killing you? Your leg is injured, you are limping and bleeding in pain. That shotgun is too close, there is no surviving that.\n- Monumental gameplay mechanics (described in my rant below)\n- SO MANY MODS! \n\nCons:\n- No online servers left alive (aside from 4 or 5 hard-to-find custom servers)\n- AI is overpowered in some moments and stupid in others\n\n\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3 - were to start?

Whether you go on a mission with a team of expert counter-terorist operatives, or you head into a mission lone-wolf, alertness and strategy is key to success - your life, your team's lives and the lives of helpless hostages all depend on your execution, which cannot be anything less than perfect.  \n\nBefore each mission you may chose from a range of multi-national Rainbow Operatives to accompany you on a mission. Each operative has his/her specialty - be it alertness, stealth, leadership or skills with various equipment from breaching charges to sniper support to clearing rooms in close-quarters combat. It is up to you to decide each member's loadout (primary, secondary, type of ammunition, accessories, armor type, etc.,) You may chose to go in with a single squad or split up into 3 separate squads. Then comes the fun part - mission planning: drawing up a master plan takes time and dedication to carrying out a successful mission with zero casualties.

The main thing is gameplay. And gameplay is really great.\nAt the beginning of every mission, we have briefing. In the briefing we'll know our objectives, how many terrorists on the level and other information. Then we should choose who will go on the mission. There are more than 50 persons in the game. We can choose evryone from the beginning, we mustn't unlock them during the game. Then we equip our operatives.We change their uniform, weapons, gadgets and others. After equipping our team, we should have a plan. This is the most interesting thing in the game. We make checkpoints to our team. Our team will go to these checkpoints. Also we can point, where should operatives throw grenade, or where should they wait another team.\nAfter we are ready, we are going to the \"battlefield\". We can control EVERYONE in our teams. Usually on missions there are 2 or 3 teams. Usually you should kill all terrorists or rescue all hostages. Sometimes you should deactivate the bomb or  plant bugs in the computers. Terrorist die from 1 or 2 shots. But you also die from 1 or 2 shots, so this game is hard.\nThe graphics are still good for our days. Yeah, not Crysis, but Raven Shield is from 2003! The controls in game are not comfortable, because there are a lot of options: open doors silently, order your teammates, change operative and etc.\nAlso there is cool multiplayer. There is not a lot of players, but it is not hard to find them. Usually on servers you should eliminate all terrorists. Also in Gold Edition includes Athena Sword, short campaign with new objectives, operatives and new missions with time limit.\nThis game is very cool, the best tactical FPS of all times.

Deuxiement les plans doivent etre excessivement bien fait mais le pire c'est quand vous devez libere des otages( c'est l'enfer, parce que souvent les otages se font tue quand vous ou vous compagnon ouvrez la porte).

The game is arguably the funnest tactical shooter ever and this is the game people point to when asked about a more tactical and professional feeling Rainbow Six game than the action games like Rainbow Six: Vegas. Being a game from 2003, the graphics look a bit rough, though that doesn't hurt the gameplay at all. You play as a sort of commander for the elite, international, blacker-than-black ops team Rainbow. Rainbow specializes in counter-terror and hostage rescue missions and are deployed when needed around the globe. This means that the levels take place across a variety of settings. You'll go from saving dignitaries in the Swiss alps to foiling bank robbers in London to clearing a mansion of baddies in the Cayman Islands. This keeps things unique and interesting throughout the game.\n      Each mission has a set pattern to it. You start by learning about the situation from Rainbow Six, the leader of Rainbow, and the other advisors with him. You then go to the team room where you select which operatives are going out on the mission, select their guns, armor, and other equipment, and choose what teams they'll be on. Then you go to the bread and butter of the game: the planning room. You are given a blueprint of the area and tasked with creating a plan for the teams to follow that will result in a successful mission. The planning system does take a bit of time to master but once the get the hang of things you'll find that the planning system is robust and customizable with a great depth to it. Once you have a plan created you can choose what team you'll be leading, in first person shooter style, through the action phase of the mission. \n     The action isn't as fast-paced as other games, but the methodical and tactical way that you can move through the area is unique, very enjoyable, and by no means boring. The action gameplay can shift from stealth to sychronized takedowns to all out gunfighting at a moments notice. The operatives and the terrorists all react realistically to bullets, meaning they die near-instantly. If that sounds too tough for the more tactical-minded gamers, you can also choose to observe the plan from a third-person flying camera and let the A.I take control of the operatives on the mission. You'll invariably find your plans don't always succeed, but there's much fun to be had from tweaking your plan until the teams move through the level like a well-oiled machine; to qoute the A-Team, \"I love it when a plan comes together.\" On a related note there are pre-made plans that you can load in if you find the planning system too much to handle or are frustrated with repeated failures.\n    The last great feature of the game is the custom mission option. This gives you access to all the maps that you've unlocked in the campaign and some that are only available in this mode and allows you to create a random mission from a good amount of mission types. Replaying story missions, terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, and lone wolf wherein you are alone and needing to get to the extraction point. The custom mission feature garuntees that you won't get bored with this game. Add to all the goodness explained already the fact that there's still a thriving modding community keeping this game fresh and adding better graphics and more gameplay to this already massive game and you've got a shining gem of the tactical shooter genre that still hasn't been topped in the decade that it has been out.", "timestamp_created": 1372093674, "timestamp_updated": 1372093674, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1543881": {"recommendationid": "1543881", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994475768", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 753, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501436823}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the finest realistic tactical shooters ever devised.

The environments are all urban/indoor and the missions are very fast paced, just like real urban ops. The mission planner adds a lot of depth to the strategic side of the game. Picking out your team, their load out and their waypoints/actions and then watching it unfold as an observer is extremely addicting. Sometimes I prefer observing to being with the boots on the ground because it's so satisfying to create a flawless plan. \n\nThe gun selection is execellent(My favorites: G3A3, G36K, MP5A2/10mm) and they perform convincingly like their real world counterparts. Co-oping Terrorist Hunt mode is really intense and one of the best parts of the game. I HIGHLY recommend the 2.0 mod which re-skins everything in higher resolution, adds iron sights, goggle vision,  and other small tweaks for more realism. I don't have much faith in Ubisoft to do the next Rainbox Six installment any justice.

This is because it adds a lot more to the table in terms of weapons, game modes, maps, decent AI opponents and team mates, as well as allowing you to perform more actions; as an example, you're able to 'fluidly' open doors so you can silently open it a crack to peep through, just swing it open, or even put a breaching charge on it.\n\nIn terms of weapons/gadgets you can use, other than having literally a mountain of guns to pick from, (although I always say the FNC and Steyr AUG are the best ;) ) ranging from assault rifles, sniper rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, light machine guns and pistols (including automatic pistols), there are a whole load of grenades and other equip-able items you can pick from. For example, there are of course your typical frag and flashbang grenades in the game, but there are also CS teargas (and gasmasks you can take to counter this) and smoke grenades. Not to mention the various other explosives and utilities, such as claymores + remote detonators (no magic hostile presence-detecting ones like in other games), C4 explosives, heartbeat detectors and many more.\n\nAlso, the iron-sight haters won't have a problem with R6 3:RS either, as they've still got the good ol' zoom - which shouldn't be an issue for those who dislike the zoom, as there are plenty of choices with scopes of varying types, as well as other attachments for your weapons.\n\nSo yeah, essentially if you want to play a realistic and fun shooter with loads of different tactics and choices, get this!", "timestamp_created": 1335441900, "timestamp_updated": 1395739493, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502418", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "276027": {"recommendationid": "276027", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967385142", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1378079020}, "language": "english", "review": "Best Tactical Shooter of all times period.", "timestamp_created": 1332696036, "timestamp_updated": 1332696036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "1448178": {"recommendationid": "1448178", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993336515", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 298, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435170642}, "language": "english", "review": "the last good tom clancy game", "timestamp_created": 1331699729, "timestamp_updated": 1331699729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "3370615": {"recommendationid": "3370615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021595278", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1391028036}, "language": "german", "review": "is gut", "timestamp_created": 1331457962, "timestamp_updated": 1331457962, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "993807": {"recommendationid": "993807", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983895305", "num_games_owned": 976, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 3885, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508595665}, "language": "english", "review": "Rainbow Six 3, like most of Tom Clancy's titles, is a squad-based tactical shooter with a lot of depth.

Once you are comfortable with how the planning stage works, you can coordinate attacks from multiple angles, give go-codes to execute orders, set the rules of engagement, and so on. The game gives you the option to either play through the mission or watch the AI do what you have told them to do.

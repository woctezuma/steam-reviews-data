I can see a little motion sickness for some people on the choppers etc but this is WAR! \n\n100% recommended!\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1510160940, "timestamp_updated": 1510160940, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36187106": {"recommendationid": "36187106", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987827305", "num_games_owned": 672, "num_reviews": 70, "playtime_forever": 212, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505854369}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Years ago, before the days of modern personal computers and way before the rise of Xbox and PlayStation, people used to get their gaming fix by visiting their local arcade. A pocket full of change and a few spare hours could bring endless joy.\n\nOperation Warcade is a VR shooter that attempts to bring back that gaming nostalgia by transporting you into a classic 1980s virtual gaming arcade. It might seem like a simple premise - especially when you realise that you can only play two of the machines in the arcade - but its original take of two experiences of the same game in different styles, gives it enticing originality.\n\nIs Operation Warcade's side-scrolling and first-person shooter combo concept as interesting as it sounds?\n\nOperation Warcade VR is one of the most enjoyable and original VR games we've played. It's smart and witty, yet has that nostalgia value that always warms our hearts.\n\nWith the variety offered by the two gaming modes, along with the challenges, achievements, unlocks and a ranking system, there's plenty of opportunity to get hours and hours of gameplay out of this one. \n\nIn our various play sessions, we were disappointed at having to stop due to standing up for too long or having other real-world issues getting in the way - you know, like having to go to sleep. Which is testament to how addictive Operation Warcade VR's gameplay is.\"\n\n\nRead the rest of review here - http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/142252-operation-warcade-vr-review-reinventing-the-arcade-experience-for-virtual-reality\n\nAnd see gameplay footage:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8O6kaKViko", "timestamp_created": 1509529445, "timestamp_updated": 1511378694, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.560811", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36154794": {"recommendationid": "36154794", "author": {"steamid": "76561198289877342", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 8, "last_played": 1513668087}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are on the fence about getting this game Grab it now why it's on sale.

There are two possible modes; classic mode in which you can pass 6 levels and the final boss, or a mode in which you can complete 108 missions, 36 levels and unlock upgrades. The game is incredibly immersive, and there are even some other unique features that you can experience, such as shooting the enemy from inside of a tank or helicopter, and playing from different perspectives during combat. Leader-boards are present, which is great as this adds a competitive aspect to the game. You can also play this game in 2D/3D on your PC if you wish to.

Don't let that put you off though ;)\n\nThis game is by far the best VR experience I've had to date.  I'm old enough to remember the original Operation Wolf in the arcades. That machine got a lot of my 50p's I tell you.\nSo what can I say about this game? \n\n1. Whether you have VR or not, buy it. It plays in 2D/3D on a regular screen as well.\n2. I got it in the steam sale for \u00a38.99 but it's easily worth the full asking price.\n3. You build up a posse of NPC fans behind you. Virtual pals are better than none I guess.\n4. If you feel the rage after losing go for a walkabout and punch/push some of them over.  It's very theraputic.\n5. In VR mode you can almost stick your head in the screen to look around.  \n6. Immersion within immersion.  There are various immersion points in all the levels that give you a different POV in the game.  This is amazingly executed in VR. I luvs the explosive <3 bow & arrows <3\n7. It surpasses the original arcade game in many many ways, suffice to say, the game is awesome.\n\nOne niggling issue is the game crashes out on rare occasions. \nAnother bug is the game glitches sometimes in VR, making the view jumpy/shaky, which is a little off-putting to say the least. Thankfully it doesn't happen very often and when it does just restart the game. Not a huge problem as I said but will keep submitting bug reports.\n\nWhether you're into playing classic arcade or want fresh, fun challenges, then this game deserves a bit your time. \n\nQuite simply, this is an excellent remake of an 80s all time classic.

It is what it looks like: you go into VR and then into an arcade. If you were a teen in the 90s, you probably sunk some quarters into this baby. Nostalgia aside, this was a lot of fun. There are two modes (2 stand up arcade machines in fact), one for a regular version of the game with optional 3d mode (just shoot at the toggle) and the fully VR immersive. The 3d was a strain on my eyes (felt like I was going cross eyed) so I stuck with the VR. \n\nYou can play like normal except you can defy some laws of somethin' and stick your head in the game to scan (and shoot) the areas. It was more fun that it sounds. At regular intervals, an \"immersive\" mode pops up - you shoot it - and bam! You are inside the game and in some kind of fight for your life. These immersive experiences vary from throwing knives, double uzi's, to (poorly) flying a jet fighter. And that's all I got to before logging out and writing this. This game is a keeper for me.

Revisiting childhood games of yesteryear can often reveal that you are remembering them through rose tinted glasses. \nFirst let me be clear on this, i can not say if the game copies the level layout of Operation Wolf, the old arcade game may of sucked many an hour away from my life, made me late for a date and ate a lot of my loose change back in those years but i can not tell you the level layout lol, but the feel of the game is there, the style of the sound effects etc are perfect. \n\n[b]ROOMSCALE / ENVIRONMENT / GRAPHICS[/b]\n When you load in you get two arcade cabinets in front of you and find yourself in a small arcade, the environment is fine for its purpose though i found some of the arcade denizens a little creepy. So why two arcade cabinets?\nOne is the immersive mode (more on that in a second).\nThe second one is the standard one, this plays much like the original arcade machine from way back then, though with a toggle to make the screen 3d (with an effect that would make any 3d tv hang itself from its power cord in shame, really it is that good of a 3d effect...but hey we are talking vr here and we all know that vr is better than 3d to a degree so high it is not worth talking about) \nSo let us get to immersive, here is where this game really shines! As you load in you find yourself in a dark room with a large window, this overlooks the game, tiny enemies scurry about as you shoot them through the window, there are pickups there are special grenades, all in all if this was just what there was to the game i would be giving it a hearty recommendation, it is good, VERY good and a unique perspective to play in\u2026..but it actually got even better, i shot a pickup and found myself moved into the game, i was driving an APC i was controlling the wheel with one hand and shooting with the other, this was amazing. Later on i got pulled into the flight seat of a fighter jet...which did not last very long as clearly the jet was defective and did not fly right (nothing to do with my piloting skills honest\u2026.ok ok it may of been my fault but it was hard to fly, but oh so very cool. There are more of these type of interactions and they make for a very cool feature in the game.\n\n\n[b]PERFORMANCE[/b] \nI had no issues until i tried to up the video settings, this crashed my capture software and sent performance issues throughout, However that is more a streamer issue than one you will face every day (and the reason for the double video).\n\n[b]INTUITIVENESS[/b] \nCertain things are not explained well or at all, i had no idea how to fly the plan or what i was expected to do in it for example or that i could teleport around the arcade, while this is not major it is something that the developer needs to improve.\n\n[b]MULTIPLAYER:[/b] \nIt has leaderboard support\n\n\n[b]PROS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Operation wolf.\n[*] The immersive mode viewpoint is awesome to play in!\n[*] The immersive mode \u201cpulled into the game\u201d moments are very cool.\n[*] There appears to be a lot of levels that will take a while to complete.\n[*] Although this is an old favorite and nostalgia can often cloud opinion of them it\u2019s fresh perspective makes the game so much fun.\n[*] As well as the immersive mode you also get the classic mode which is like having your own arcade cabinet at home.\n[/list]\n\n[b]CONS:[/b] \n[list]\n[*] Some of the controls (ie plane) are not well explained)\n[*] The arcade users are creepy\u2026.no really, i turned round to see a woman with her arms out like she was going to clap just shaking them while staring at me\u2026..that is nightmare fuel man.\n[/list]\n\n[b]VIDEO[/b]\nThis is actually the first and second tries together as i crashed the capture software changing the video settings and did not realise for a while (this also meant the second try i was a little tired lol)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MjDrD_qSW0\n\n\n[b]VERDICT[/b] \n\nIf you have ever wanted an arcade cabinet in your home or played Operation wolf, then get this game. If you like to reward developers that create something unique (that viewpoint changing is indeed unique) get the game. If you like vr then....you know what...get the game, you will not regret it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1501684283, "timestamp_updated": 1501684283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.621455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33967655": {"recommendationid": "33967655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094778467", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501587496}, "language": "english", "review": "Operation Warcade VR is a Virtual Reality wave based shooter which provides plenty of nostalgia and a unique spin on a familiar VR genre. \n\nFans of the classic Operation Wolf or similar arcade shooters from the 90s will instantly feel right at home. The game launches with you standing in front of two arcade machines;  One providing a \u2018traditional\u2019 arcade shooter experience, the other transporting you into a large imax style screen experience for you to enjoy the game. It\u2019s a fun way to hide the \u2018menu\u2019 user experience within a virtual reality interface. \n\nOnce you are in the game, nostalgia reigns supreme. The tried and true arcade shooter cliches are all here; dumb soldiers running from spawn, exploding barrels, incredibly fragile helicopters and lots of explosions. \n\nExperiencing this all in virtual reality however, provides an extremely unique and refreshing trip down memory lane. It also allows for the major selling point; the ability to be transported directly into the arcade machine  at key moments to experience the soldier's first person perspective. \n\nWave based shooters are slowly becoming a tired VR genre, but this unique mix of \u2018physical\u2019 arcade machine mechanics and first person perspective provides a unique spin on the genre.

There is not a single VR game that i could compare it to.\nThere are 2 different modes to play the game.\nThe first as a arcade machine simulator. You are in front of an arcade machine, take your gun and shoot at the screen. Like the real ones were you have a real gun in you hands. The only difference is that you can teleport inside the game at some set spots and shoot or drive vehicles for a short amount of time. (really cool)\n\nThe 2nd (immersion mode) is what you will play porbably most of the time. Its is a bit like the first mode but instead of a small arcade cabinet screen you have a big movie theatre screen in front of you. And now it gets funny. As soon as the level starts the flat screen becomes 3d. This enables you to look into the screen to both sides beyond the boarders of the screen. This is a great idea and should be tried for other games as well. \n\nThere will be 36 levels (ca. 5min per level) with 3 objektives each. Every cleared objektive gives you a star. With the stars you unlook levels and upgrades(more ammo, time....)\n\nFor older people who liked the arcades back than it\u00b4s highly recommended. Also if you look for unique games and well as for showoff games.( no explanation needed)\n\nIf 20 bucks is to much for you right now leave it on your wishlist and wait for a sale.

You know, those places where you have many arcade machines that work with coins. These types of establishments were easy to find in the 80\u2019s and I used to spend endless hours playing in them. Operation Warcade VR was inspired by these classic 80\u2019s arcade war games. Now you can experience at home and in virtual reality being in a game parlour and taking on an army with your Uzi and grenades in Operation Warcade VR.\n\nOperation Warcade VR is an action / shooter game where the player is standing in front of an arcade machine; you can immerse yourself into the game by activating an icon.\n\nHere you are in your own virtual game parlour and right in front of you you\u2019ll see two arcade machines on display. They are the same games, by the way; one is the 3D classic game version and the other one is the immersive VR experience.\n\nBefore you start a mission, you\u2019ll notice three specific tasks to do within this level.  If you successfully achieve all the tasks, you will be awarded three stars which will go towards unlocking new levels and upgrading your weapons.  Bear in mind that some tasks will take you more than one go to accomplish and there are one hundred and eight stars to collect! \nThe game-play is just brilliant! It feels like you\u2019re playing the game from a window perspective; soldiers will run from the right and left, coming out of buildings or out of the jungle (depending of the stage). Some will be shooting bullets, other will throw knives at you. Some of the bullets can be shielded off with your Uzi but knives and mortar shells need to be deflected with an accurate shot. To top it off, vehicles such as jeeps, helicopters and boats are appearing everywhere. All you have is an Uzi and a few grenades! As you progress within a mission, you\u2019ll notice icons here and there. Each of these icons can be activated by shooting at them. One will have a slow motion effect; the ones I really like are those you activate and then jump into the front line, in a car, on a boat or in a helicopter with the massive machine gun at your disposal - just a lot of fun and something I have not experienced before in VR. \n\nThe graphics are really good and the controls work pretty well, too. I personally did not experience any crashes whatsoever, but there were a few glitches. Bear in mind this game is still an early access at this stage. \n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tGood graphics\n-\tPlenty of levels \n-\tPlay the game in classic or Innovative immersive mode\n-\tGreat gameplay\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tCouple of glitches here and there \n\nA really fun shooter with an innovative immersive mode of play! I can\u2019t wait to see the full version.\n\n7/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

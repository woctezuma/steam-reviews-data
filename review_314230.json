I love that different planets seem to have different length rotation cycles, as being on the dark side of a planet can make things a little more frustrating. The idea that one can customize any part of one\u2019s ship to fit their needs is amazing. I can make my ship literally seem like I\u2019m in a flying invisible cube from the inside, so you can see everything outside around the ship like a one-way mirror, should you so desire. Never had any complications with the controls, just give it a few hours to get familiar with. The lights from your character and ship react different on which ever planet you are on. Hit those lights on Morena (Ice planet) boom, you can see for miles all day as the surface seems to glow vibrantly. Hit the lights on Perun (Dark gloomy purple mountain planet) boom, your assss is almost still flying blind. Another trait about this game is that your character has the ability to leave your ship while it is still in motion (Both the pilots chair or the physical ship). To leave the pilot chair at break neck speeds can be really cool visually from inside the ship. The fighting system is fun, I feel with the damage output from the Xeons (Alien bad dudes) and the unlimited ammo pair in a fair manor. The sound track has my assss in a tranquil trance as I space the fuke out in space, truly amazing. The game overall has a load of potential and I can\u2019t help but keep coming back even after I have finished the available story thus far. Things that would be nice to see in the future would be things like boarding enemy ships both active ships, and destroyed ships (Which I believe is in the works to some degree). Different weather fitting to different planets, as this would make locating something on a planet surface crucial to time or location in general. And also, the personal flashlight to transfer seamlessly from inside the ship to a planets surface, as one will need to quickly turn it off and on again to activate the lighting on the planet surface.

Just... WOW !\nThis game is amazing ! Well not the game itself, but the story is crazy addictive.\nI bought the game today and I was not able to let go off of it until I finished the story. Took me about 8 hours.\nI litterally did only that today, that and eating some junk food.\n****************\n\nHere is my review : \n\nPROS : \n--------\n\u2022 Story is incredible, as long as you read everything and you imagine the 'movie' in your head. It's like reading a really good book, you can see the story in your head, see what happened and imagine the characters... This is exactly that. And it is very addictive too. I didn't get emotional but you feel the story, you feel how the characters feel. I got very attached to the characters of the first chapter.\n\n\u2022 The technology behind the game is well done. Planets are orbiting the star and also rotating. There seem to be a real orbital mechanic into the game. When you are on the surface of a planet or an asteroid, you can see the enemy ships orbiting above you. Really nice.\n\n\u2022 You can land on anything; Planets and Asteroids seemlessly. No loading, nothing 'poping' in existance. When you look at the surface of a planet from space, this is exactly what you will see once you get closer.\n\n\u2022 You can move inside your ship even when it is moving. You can get out of the ship, anytime, any where. Even in space. You can float around and navigate with your jetpack. You can get inside wrecked ships scattered around the system.\n\n\u2022 You can design the inside of your ship quite easily. It's fun to create your own design and then walk around your own ship. Also, if you do 3d modeling with Bender, well you can create your own ship model. But I don't so... it is still a pro, for those who can.\n\n\u2022 Many more pros I cannot think of right now.\n\n\nCONS : \n----------\n\u2022 I don't really like the 'Low Poly' style games. I wish the dev, at some point in the future, will upgrade the visual quality of the game to make it more HD. But I guess this is the style the dev wanted to give it. Anyway.\n\n\u2022 Very repetitive. It is alway the same. That is why I mostly played the story. Didn't do much else because there isn't much else to do. You can kill enemy ships, it is fun. But quickly becomes boring. And on the surface's markers, there's always a few enemy ground units. You can land and kill them with your gun, or park your ship above them and destroy them with your ship's weapons. Either way, every single marker is the same thing.\n\n-------------------\n\nIf you are still reading, I strongly recommend you to try the demo. I did install the demo, and maybe 20min later I bought the game. Like I said, the story is very very good as it is, and with futur updates it will get even better.\n\nThe story alone is worth the price, and I can't wait to see what's next for this game.\n\nEnd of my review.\n\n---\nMessage to the dev :\n\nI know you work mostly by yourself and it is a lot of work to pull off a game like this. But maybe it is time to hire more people. Because this game is awesome, but it is empty. You need to add so much more stuff to do,  more planets (with more details), variations... even consider a multiplayer feature.\n\nI really enjoy the game so far, can't wait for Chapter 3 and beyond !", "timestamp_created": 1515386915, "timestamp_updated": 1515387185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521008", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39171410": {"recommendationid": "39171410", "author": {"steamid": "76561198189677703", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 586, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 586, "last_played": 1515546794}, "language": "english", "review": "One of my favorite games... of all time.

Other little details left by the game developer also add a small sense of humor while exploring. An example would be the little data chips that can be found randomly on astroids and planets that give highly condesending advice ranging from teaching you how to breath air to survive to building highly complecated terraforming systems using grade 1 level language. Then you get to the on foot exploration and mechanics, and ive got to say, getting out of your speedy ship and starting to walk around and seeing how little objects move on the planets really gives you a sense of scale. This very sense was what sold this game to me, ive rarely ever seen it happen before in a game (skyrim was the other) and simply got blown away by it.

Rodina is a massive colonization ship that'll arrive in the Zorica system in 2-3 years just behind the Vangaurd, but the Vangaurd didn't finish it's mission due to the alien infestation in the system and the \"captain\" of the Rodina needs you to clear the system before they arrive, but you acquire a different mission that you can't finish due to the game being early access. This game is massive and is going to get bigger and you can make it bigger yourself by changing the code of the game.\n\nThe graphics of the game give a it a 90's look but you can make it look like the 80's with the retro option\ncharacter controls are easy to learn but ship controls are a bit harder seeing that the game has somewhat realistic physics     I fully reccomend this game to anyone and everyone but keep in mind that developement will be slow because the game only has a single developer who wants to see his game grow and I also want to see this game grow \nif you don't think this game will be any good please try out the 1hr demo the dev has on his site (https://elliptic-games.com/) which I did \n\nI'll rate the game 8.5/10 but don't take my word for it try the game yourself and give it the rating you think it deserves", "timestamp_created": 1513644051, "timestamp_updated": 1513644051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.625605", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38366815": {"recommendationid": "38366815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076958278", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514883965}, "language": "english", "review": "Rodina is a Space Exploration game in which you can seamlessly travel from planet to planet.

While the scale is large enough on it's own, I feel that there wasn't enough variety of planets to warrant further exploration (Was my experience a while ago I'm going off, so if I'm wrong here let me know & I'll correct the review)\n\n-Poor lighting on models in certain situations & occaisonal muddy graphics (Can't help but feel that when I land a ship on a planet, that nothing is being reflected off or onto my ship, and the same goes for weapons too) although being an indie title going for a more primitive graphical style I can't hark on about this too much) \n\n-Bugs aplenty! But this goes for most Early Access games, so it's not really worth mentioning them outside of a bug report.\n\nIn summary this is an interesting little game if you're into that cool sci-fi \"one man & his ship\" setting, and the gameplay is (supposedly) intended to flow a little similar to older Elder Scrolls games, so this is definitely a unique title to keep your eye on, or purchase if you wish to support the developer (Who's just 1 guy on his own, and a pretty cool guy going off my interactions with him in the past)\nIf I got something wrong in the review, feel free to let me know & I'll make corrections according.\n\n6/10 Interesting experience", "timestamp_created": 1511896699, "timestamp_updated": 1511896860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.573926", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "37740046": {"recommendationid": "37740046", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028431485", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514173081}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is great. 100% worth every dime even if there isn't a whole bunch to do as of yet!

As of right now, you can literally build the interior of your entire ship, and the game comes with neat ways to customise existing textures by altering colors, and customisable lights.  Flying the ship is fun and intuitive, even though it has no inertia dampening, it's easy to control.  The only thing that DOES get annoying is the clutch.\n\n  The story is entirely optional.  You can fly around wherever you want, although being limited in the beginning to an asteroid field if you don't progress in the story.  The logs you can find are entertaining, and well written, as well as being in an easy to read font, especially as someone with minor dyslexia.\n\n  Planet rendering is fast, with decent heightmaps and terrrain that doesn't get too ridiculous in shape.  Atmospheric lighting looks brilliant, and the art style of the game itelf is pleasing to look at.  Planetary textures aren't too shabby either, and the lighting from ship spotlights or the players flashlight has a really nice distance, and quite a large area of illumination.  One of my favorite features is the holoscreen, which lets you turn any room on your ship into a viewing area, foregoing a standard cockpit view, though I suppose the pilot station fills that role.\n\n  The ship interior customisation is very similar to Doom Builder, if anyone reading this has ever used it.  You can make up to 7 floors, although 2 are quite tiny.  The interior space is quite large, you can make your ship a maze, a small cube and an airlock, or, if it suits your style, a rather phallus shaped cockpit \"wink wink.\"  It's an easy to use system, with a decent amount of options.\n  \n  Combat is a bit easy, but I think it is mostly because of the really slick control scheme.  It's very easy to get your ship to do what you want it to.  The combat will likely get more diverse too, and the ship guns and even the fps guns, limited as both are, feel good to shoot.  The devs update relatively frequently, and the game is by no means dead.  They even comment on reviews!  Furthermore, they even try to help with issues a player might have.\n\n  The UI is easy to read and clicking on things is crisp and responsive.  Performance is nice and smooth, with tons of graphical options to suit your needs and preferences.  The controls are concise and well developed, there doesn't feel to be any artificial smoothing or acceleration, which is a welcome change from all the games with forced smoothing, accel, or even, UGH, negative acceleration.\n\n  TL;DR, if you like space exploration and combat, pick this game up.

It's rather hard to explain.\n\nThe game is simple: You get a ship that you can fully customize the interior of (Including how many floors it has, as per a more recent ipdate), and you get sent off in to space. Currently the story isn't fully implemented, but from what we have so far I can tell it's going to be interesting. \n\nPlanets are the main attraction, I would imagine. They are utterly massive and I was in awe at the sheer scale of them when I first tried to land on one. \nThe combat isn't the best, but it's fun. It's very basic and works for this type of game, I think.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a game you should at the very least keep updated on.

AAA titles.\n\nCurrently (at the time of writing) there is:\n-literally 1:1 scale planets to explore (FOUR OF THEM!)\n- Proper space combat with newtonian physics so you have to juggle aiming at the enemies and dodging and not drifting off away from the enemies\n- FPS sections that feel REALLY satisfying and look like they're taken straight from a metroid prime title\n- No Loadscreens, everything is streamed straight from the disk (be that in an airlock when moving into a ship or as you're travelling between places) and it really doesn't seem to affect anything to do with the performance.\nAn in depth story that may or may not be mostly finished, but if what i've seen this dev do is a good idea of his effort, it's huge AND unfinished (in a good way)\n- Actual regular updates that aren't just bug fixes but tend to only add a few small things at a time (this is honestly a much better idea for a game like this because it means the dev can get feedback on each change rather quickly, instead of pushing a huge update that changes a lot of stuff that might take hours or days for the community to properly test).\n- Like straight up ship interior design, loads of it!\n- Complete difficulty options, in case a certain aspect is too hard for you, but you don't want to lessen other aspects of the game.\n- you won't get literally everything done in any reasonable amount of time, this game just has too much to do in one sitting (not that that's in any way bad)\n\nliterally the only negative i have is that occasionally it bugs out, but these bugs are almost always fixed quickly due to a rather active community that isnt salty as all hell over not getting some features that they want (or maybe those people just up and left early on in development but still, they aren't around

Skip some more exploration and jumping around I come up to my first planet. Nearly burn up in the atmosphere (im not a very good pilot) only to find that the planet is so cold that its freezing my ship. Move on to another planet; once I get into atmosphere there is a squad of scouts waiting for me. \"I can take six scouts, I've fought single and double scouts before really easy so six must be possible\". \n\nGot eviscerated, managed to take two of them down with me before the engines gave out. In a blind panic I jumped up from the pilots seat, ran through the fires that had started all across my crashing ship, scrambled into the airlock and jumped out. Because my ship died way up in the atmosphere I ended up falling for a solid 3 or 4 minutes before finally falling back to the planet. The battle happened so far up that the ships attacking me are ignoring me now. After a good 20 minutes of hiking around the planet I finally found the burning wreck of my ship.

The developer made so many smart design decisions. The music enhances the gameplay experience and sets a tone of adventure, wonder, and potential danger.

And the holographic viewscreen design is gorgeous. \n\nThe tutorials and explanations are very clear, although initially I didn't understand that the ship had default weapons other than missiles I picked up as this wasn't indicated but it's a minor oversight. I also enjoy that the ship's health regenerates after not taking damage for a time. This signalled to me that the game would focus more on adventure and exploration rather than wasting the player's time gathering resources, like in many other open world exploration games. \n\nThe ship to ship combat is fun and intuitive and I also liked the fps combat. Fighting in a low gravity environment with a deep space background against multiple jumping enemies reminded me of some of the best parts of unreal tournament (in terms of the atmosphere; I don't mean to imply the gunplay is as nuanced as a more narrowly-focused fps would be expected to be). Also, the writing seems solid thus far. Each entry doesn't read as being from the same voice, even if it was written by the same author, which is a plus for immersion.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is interested in a fun and easy to get into sci-fi/space exploration game with great atmosphere and honestly fun gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1498355385, "timestamp_updated": 1498395286, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.693770", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32747504": {"recommendationid": "32747504", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201042833", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1521, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512805649}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo Excelente, tem desenvolvido bastante, vale a pena comprar para explorar esse sistema de Rodina", "timestamp_created": 1498346309, "timestamp_updated": 1498346309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32679238": {"recommendationid": "32679238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202552420", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 532, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512601350}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is incredibal!

The core game it's self right now is as follows. \n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]\n     The gameplay in Rodina Is, as of now, mediocre for a space game. You can land on asteroids and planets, or burn up like I did and be amazed by the pretty sights, go in space battles or combat in fps style. You may also salvage data sticks and other supplies. The data sticks are these little bits of the story and surprisingly funny. That's about it, not much, but there may be much more according to raptor (The dev)\n\nIn terms of bugs there aren't many due to the lack of content, as the game is currently a frame for what's to come. But there is a surprising amount of freedom in customization of your vessel (interior only),\nand that freedom will only improve as I see.\n\nSpace combat is surprisingly good, much better then others as the fire mechanic can lead to some pretty intense battles with multiple craft, really makes you have to use some maneuvers to avoid missiles and blasters, but even this can get repetitive at times.\n\nAnother big aspect of the game is customizing your ship, many of my hours in the game have been customizing trying new layouts as there is simply so much you can do and it'll only get better with time.\n\nAnother plus the game gets is the lack of loading screens, as this is much better for people who love immersion in their games. There isn t even a loading screen on new game. Speaking of which, The beginning of the game is pretty simple, you spawn on  an asteroid near your ship, after a basic tutorial you get in and from there salvage and fight. That's basically the whole game for now.\n\n[h1] STORY [/h1]\n     Believe it or not the story for this game is very interesting and original (compared to the other space games) and the game currently tells the story through data sticks you find, the story from what I put together goes as: Humanity has grown tired and used up earth, now boarding a massive scale ship, called the Rodina is heading towards a star system called the Zorica system, housing 4 planets and an asteroid belt, now your character who by default is named Sara was aboard a space craft sent to colonize the system, prior to the Rodina.\n\nThe Zorica system was infested with aliens who destroyed the vanguard and your the only know survivor, your only goal right now is kill as many aliens, possibly wiping them our or driving them out so they don't destroy all of humanity when the Rodina arrives.\n\nSo the story is very original and the story telling as well is fun!\n\n[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]\n     The graphics in Rodina have a cute little pixels in them and a nice charm to them, specifically the fire extinguisher affects after putting out a fire. I'm sure there will be many improvements and changes.

You will also find small bits and pieces of lore and story along the way. The gameplay is fun too, but doesn't feel completed yet (hence the game being early access, though its been there for a while now). The reason I can't stand behind Rodina is that it just overall feels like an alpha, and I could understand that if it's only been out for a while. But this game has been out for 3 YEARS now and doesn't have too much development of the starting product to show for it. It almot feels as if the game will stay in early access with no further work being put into it by the developer. That is the reason for my refund. Overall, Rodina is a good game with a lot of potential, but it seems like the creator is too lackadaisical to give it the attention that it needs.

The dev posts updates regularly and is active in communicating where the game is going, so this is one piece of early access that I have no worries about becoming abandonware.\n\nThe story, while complete as far as major plot elements, is still unfinished. Mind you, the story itself is entirely text based, but it's damn well written. They did a great job of keeping me both guessing and wanting more. I found myself trying to bolt from place to place to find out how everything would progress.\n\nExploration is definitely this game's strongest point. The planets are HUGE and there's plenty to poke around with in the asteroid belt. There are some elements that haven't been finished yet, but that you can find floating in orbit within the system. To say that I'm curious to see how they're going to be implimented would be an understatement.\n\nSome elements do feel somewhat grind-y. The big one being ground combat with collecting items. I like curve-balls thrown my way with games like this, so take what I say next as you will. When landing to collect items, there's always a handful of ground troops to deal with. While that's not a bad thing, there's not really much variation with it. (Especially with the variety and number of enemies you come up against.) Sure, you could land, get out of your ship, and engage them that way, but over time I found myself just hovering above them in my starship lighting them up with the ship's main guns. The situation felt a little... Overpowered. (Though there was one instance where a ground troop had some sort of rocket launcher energy weapon that wrecked my shizzle. Pleasant surprise and I appreciated having to mix up my strategy.) I have nothing wrong with a situation like that, but being able to rinse-later-repeat that scenario over and over again feels like a bit of a balancing issue to me. If they added some element that necessitated me getting out of my ship to attack the enemy, that would help mix things up a bit. Maybe add something like SAM/AA batteries (Both stationary and mobile) that can fire at you while in the ship, but not on the ground. Another idea would be to have the enemy send out something like a distress call to nearby patrolling aircraft if you're attacking the ground forces with your ship rather than on foot. There are some aircraft patrols, but they're not very regular. The potential is definitely there, but there's certainly room for improvement.\n\nAircraft battles, by comparison, are significantly more difficult and far more satisfying when you win. (Ground battles are definitely lacking in the satisfaction/accomplishment department even when you're fighting from the ground.) Strangely, the battleships are fairly easy to take out with a hit and run tactic, while bombers with fighter escorts are way harder to deal with. (Enjoyably so too.)\n\nOverall, this game is definitely worth the price. (I have yet to run into any noticeable bugs. The whole thing runs really smooth.) It's immensely enjoyable. Normally I try to stay away from early access, but this one is truly a gem.

Absolutely fantastic!  It's built in an old-school style, with no loading screens, no waypoints, no tutorials, no dumbed down guidance.  It gives (nearly) absolute freedom to go whereever you want, do whatever you want (aside from a minor planet-locking system, which is not grindy and well-done IMHO).  The game plays completely in first person, or allows you to move about in your ship first person and fly third person (I personally prefer all first-person play).  You literally press a button, while flying, and can walk about your ship as you fly, totally seamless.  You can open your airlock (while in space) and get sucked out as the interior atmosphere escapes into space, you can jump out of your ship while planetside and drop to the planet.  Atmospheric re-entry is extremly cool, and gives you the feeling that you are in a real spaceship being tossed, turned, and burned as you plunge.\n\nGameplay mechanics perfectly follow the KISS (keep it simple stupid) principle, there are debris fields all over the asteroid belt and the four planets, which are inhabited by Xenos (hostile aliens) who attack you from various ships, and also on the ground in a sort of \"Tribes\" like FPS combat.  As you gather debris and encryption keys from the debris fields, more of the story unlocks (all text based).  Don't be dissuaded by the text based story, it is extremely well written and pulls you into the game like a good book, and has a fantastic twist.\n\nProbably the very best aspect is the musical soundtrack.  It flawlessly captures the feeling of lonesome space sickness, the awe of extra-solar planetary exploration, and changes thematically depending upon your position, with each planet and area getting it's own theme.  The music is in an orchestral style, and holds it's own against the likes of John Williams (Star Wars).\n\nCan't wait to see where this developer takes Rodina next.  Speaking as an older old-school gamer, this game is absolutely the best thing to happen to space games since LucasFilms in the late eighties.\n\nAll that said, if you are a multiplayer fan (I am not), I don't know that this would be the title for you, as I don't believe the developer has worked on netcode or has any plans to incorporate it (fairly certain here).  Also, there is no voice acting, and no top-of the line animations, though what is there (animation wise) is extremely smooth and aesthetically pleasing in it's own right.  Also, while the planets and planetside landings are extremely cool, and the seamless nature of the game makes them fun to explore, they are rather barren, and could use quite a bit of love.\n\nCan't recommend this one enough, it stands with the best classics.", "timestamp_created": 1494084252, "timestamp_updated": 1494084461, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.721697", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31578633": {"recommendationid": "31578633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171073018", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512922330}, "language": "english", "review": "A lovely dev, great game and every time I hear that soundtrack my heart judt melts, though it does need some improvements there's a demo that you can try so if you don't want to spend you don't have to.\n\nGood luck finishing the game.", "timestamp_created": 1494069415, "timestamp_updated": 1494069415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31496934": {"recommendationid": "31496934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167415826", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1146, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1515281382}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a game for people dissapointed By No Man's Sky, even though this one came out first, but its also still not anywhere near finished...anyways the designing of the ship is amazing, you can make ANYTHING in there.

It's playable, it's fun and it's a great teaser of what might come next, but if you're looking for a fully polished space game, this isn't it. Go and get Elite or something.\n\nBasically, you're a person who is flying round, building their ship up, killing aliens and following some vague plot threads about the state of humanity and the events preceeding the game. These threads begin to draw together and form what the game calls 'Chapter One', which I found very enticing, and which goes in a very interesting direction by the end. Presumably, I'm on Chapter Two now, which involves building a wang for a robot, but again, this is dressed in a very interesting set of threads.\n\nOne of the main features that this game has over most is the ship interior editor and moddability. Say you want to have the Enterprise, you can make your interior like it, then download a model to make it look like that (I'm not actually sure if there is an Enterprise, the mod scene is small). Or if you want a little ship, you could have one room with all the stuff you need. Even though the building system is very much not complete, it's still really fun and quite powerful (and multiple levels and a better layout planner are on the cards for the future updates).\n\nAll in all, if you're willing to take a punt, buy it or try the demo.

Writing this review as I'm playing lol. The artwork is amazing and the soundtrack is on point. Every place you visit seems like a new challenging experience from the landing of the aircraft to the looting of new items. Some things that could be tweaked though:\n\n- Lack of personality/character. I think introducing some type of AI with the ship such as a HAL could make the game go a long way.\n\n- More diversity in looting areas. Everywhere you land your ship to get items its the same thing with aliens shooting you, why not some places with just items or even friendly AI? \n\n- Video data fragments. I think the implention of Video data fragments into the game for cutscenes would be another great way to build onto the story.

Have I mentioned the music? It goes so unbelievably well with what planet you encounter and land on! Your ship's interior can be customized to your liking, and can have multiple floors! Everything is so seemless, as well! When I land on a planet, or exit a planet's atmosphere, it's impossible to tell when something unloads! One time I landed on a planet, and saw another planet against the sun, the planet I saw looked like a tiny speck! And planet size is AMAZING! They're pretty much actual size, it's bloody amazing (Being from Washington USA, I don't normally say bloody like that, so you know I mean it)! Everything about this game is just AMAZING!

I originally started off with the demo, and I was sold. I insist you do the same.\n\nThe story and soundtrack in Rodina are supurb. Although the main story in this game isn't on par with games like Mass Effect, for a one man dev, the writing is fantastic (I'm not sure if Brendan/Raptormeat does all the writing or if he has help). Rodina's story is refreshing, in a sense that you really feel like the transmissions you read are from real people in a real universe. I've been on the edge of my seat when reading some of these. The story drew me into this ficitonal universe.\n\nThe soundtrack, story, ship customization, and the sheer scale of the planets are what really drew me in. I'm a gamer that loves a good soundtrack, and this game definitely delivers.\n\nAt the time of writing, I have 9 hours logged (I bought this game yesterday (1/16)); and I would say that 4 of those hours were consumed by ship customization. You have complete freedom when customizing your ship. There are mods for this game that one can download to acquire new types of ships, but I really enjoy the simplicity of the vanilla ship.\n\nAs for the planets, there has been countless times where I've landed my ship, thinking I was close to my target, when in reality, I was hundred of meters off. People who have played this game know what I'm talking about. At times, it's truley hard to comprehend how massive some of these planets really are.\n\nIf you're not yet convinced, try the demo.

Rodina might be the game for you.\n\nIn Rodina you explore a vast solar system with 4 massive planets all roughly the size earth and tens of thousands of asteroids. You will need to scavenge items and fight off hostile xenos to uncover the storyline. The feeling of loneliness surrounds you and the amazing soundtrack enchances the feeling of solitude.\n\nThe storyline is absolutely amazing even when it's purely made of text. Be prepared to read. It will keep you engaged and it will surprise you.\n\nThe combat happens in air and on land. The land battles FPS battles against xenos with different kind of weaponry. The air/space battles are fought with space ships and different kind of weaponry which you can easily equip to your spaceship. My only problem with the combat is that the guns you get to currently use in land combat feel like peashooters, so it's a lot easier to just kill everyone with your spaceship.\n\nThe spaceship has a fully customisable interior, which I have spent a lot of time on making it fit me. It really adds to the homeliness of the spaceship. While the exterior can't be changed in the current version in vanilla, modding the game is pretty easy so you can go download exteriors for Nexus Mods. So with mods you can fully customize the ship to your liking.\n\nThere is basically only one type of thing you do to get forward in the game. Fly into a plus sign in an object, kill all enemies on the site, and salvage the items left there. It might sound lame but I have had a lot of fun with it so far, purely because the atmosphere engrosses me in the world.\n\nThis game is still in early access, but it still manages to do what many other games will never achieve. Best part is... It keeps getting updated and in the coming year the game will advance a lot. I recommend looking the roadmap at the Elliptic Games site.\n\nBasically this game is worth your money in it's current state and it will only get better from now.

And much like those games, Rodina has an interesting concept and has potential to be a good game.\n\nHowever, it is not a good game, it is not moving at any appreciable pace toward becoming a good game, and the purpose of reviewing a game is to offer an honest assessment of said game.  A reviewi s not a hopeful prediction of what the game will be in five years if the developer actually decides to work on his game.\n\nThose who recommend a game based on the theoretical potential of the game are no better than the yahoos at PC Gamer who gave Outpost one of their highest scores ever and it turned out to be a worthless tech demo with no actual gameplay.

The story combined with the stunning star system the game takes place in really make Rodina a great experience despite not being so early in it's development. The updates to the stable branch are few and far between but when they come out you can always tell how much the developer cares about the game he's creating. Truly a gem in the Early Access scene.\n\nAs far as the game itself goes, the combat is challenging and fun, it doesn't feel at all boring or cookie cutter. The music is probably some of the best I've heard out of a small indie title like this, and the planets are properly massive and breath taking. The models are for the most part very primitive, yes, but you'll hardly notice that as you're trying to put out fires and shoot down enemy ships.\n\nI could probably go on for a while longer about all the things I love about this game, but my favorite thing by far are the organic movie-esque scenes that happen on a regular basis. Watching enemy ships fall to the planet below in a ball of flame is probably one of my favorite things in the world.", "timestamp_created": 1481344664, "timestamp_updated": 1481345028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28276015": {"recommendationid": "28276015", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314416553", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 612, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511008332}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0441\u044b\u0440\u0430\u044f \n\u043d\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u0410 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0448\u0435\u0442 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u0430\u044f \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0435\n\u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u0441 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044f\u043c\u0438 \n\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u044f\u0445 \u043f\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0443 ,\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0445\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0430,\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044c(\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0435\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u043b , \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u044b, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043a \u0438 \u0442 \u0434). \u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0440\u0435\u0448\u044c.\u0432\u0435\u0434\u044c \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430\n\n\u043d\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b (\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0438) \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442? \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u044b \n\u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e \u0430\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0442\u044c\u043c\u0430, \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0443\u0436\u043d\u044b\n\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0437\u044c\u0431\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 (\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e 15 - 20) \u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0430\u044f\n\u0438 \u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443.\u0415\u0435 \u0447\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0447\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0438 \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432", "timestamp_created": 1481313822, "timestamp_updated": 1481313822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493349", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "28249499": {"recommendationid": "28249499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038571649", "num_games_owned": 351, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465949575}, "language": "english", "review": "Baing made by one guy this is impressive.

Not literally, of course, but thematically; I felt that this was the underlying thesis of the entire work.  My interpretation, anyway.\n\nThat's probably a pretentious way to start.  Okay!  I'll talk about the game now in more literal terms.\n\nShort version:\n\nDo I recommend?  That depends.  Rodina is quickly becoming one of my favorite games, but that's because it's both a fun  activity that revolves around interesting exploration in a vast, vast world and a vehicle for philosophical quandaring through some pretty excellent writing.  If this does not appeal to you, then no, I don't recommend.  If it sounds remotely intriguing, then yes, I whole-heartedly recommend.  Do it.  Play the demo.  Then pay the 250 that this company sorely deserves (if I had that on hand I would do so in a heart-beat).\n\nLong version:\n\nI'll describe the game by listing and explaining each facet any game would typically have.\n\nGraphics: \n\nSubpar.  I find the visuals to be charming, reminding me of a few games I used to play when I was a kid fiddling around with my parents' bulky Macintosh.  Honestly I never cared about the graphical style of a game I'm playing, so long as it doesn't hamper the overall experience (I like Minecraft, for example).  Compared to some AAA games out there, it'd get trampled in this department.  However, I think the initially unappealing look of the game works to the game's advantage, in what I think the game attempts to portray.  I won't spoil, however.\n\n(I saw that there was a separate artist for this game, so don't take this as me dissing you - I'm only comparing it to games that have like a zillion dollars backing it and pretty much nothing else, and also I can barely draw a stick figure so take that what its worth.)\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe actual, full-on, no BS reason I bought this game in the first place was because I read you can walk around in your own ship.  Seriously.  After playing Starbound and finding great satisfaction in essentially piloting a flying house, not being tethered to anything anywhere else, I was greeted with a great sense of freedom I don't find in any other game.  Alas, Starbound was still limited (2D notwithstanding), and I longed for even greater freedom.  Rodina, then, heard my call, burst into my living room, stripped itself of all clothing articles, and demanded that I make love with it.  Of course with the graphics I was mostly aversive but I at least complimented its hair.\n\nOkay, okay.  So yes.  Walking around in your own ship - a ship whose interior you can design AND walk around in whilst mid-flight - was just really fun for me.  As was the difficult control scheme.  Learning to fly took a lot of effort, but it made it worth it.  Same with dog-fighting.  I've seen complaints for this, but honestly, I found the hectic nature of the space battles riveting.  Especially when you're in the atmosphere of a planet, having to pay attention to where you are so you don't burn up while also keeping track of the swarm of enemies trying to practice their anti-protagonist agenda.\n\nIn addition to movement and such, I am also continuously amazed at the size of this world.  It's merely a solar system, yes, but holy cow is it gigantic.  The planets feel collosal, in a way that makes you quickly realize that you're just a speck.  Likewise with the distance between planets and asteroids.  There's just a scope here that I'm still wrapping my head around.  If nothing else, this game seriously hammers in the idea that, hey, space is really big.  Like, bigger than the biggest thing you can think of.  Yes, THAT big.  Some kind of space scientist would be proud.\n\nIf I had one minor complaint, though, it's that I think the Xenos' weapons are a bit over-powered.  Not against your character, mind - that's just fine.  I expect a rocket to blow your face off.  However, how come a few pew pew bullets can down your entire space-craft?  Especially those homing thingies.  Two of those and you're gone.  Feels kind of uneven to me, but what do I know?\n\nStory:\n\nAnd this is where we rub up on the reason I think this game works as well as it does.  I'll get this out of the way, first, though - the writing is excellent.  Delegated to out-of-the-way documents that you can collect, each contain a small part of a short story that interconnects with the greater context of the universe.  It is not required that you read any of them in order to get any enjoyment out of the game, but doing so will deepen the world you inhabit while you murder those poor green men.\n\nThat is, until you rip through the story without reading anything and get to the end, where you should be thoroughly confused by what happens.  And this is where I fell in love with the game.\n\nIt's not visibly enormous or spectacular by any means, no.  It'd just generate a small bit of confusion that may compel you to read why it happened.  But for me, this created a thrust that I just haven't seen anywhere else.  A context was created that perfectly married the graphics, game, and story into a single entity - you.  The player.  A trajectory is set at that moment, one that I'm unsure could be stopped, and I think the understanding of that is what propels this game into the profound.  In the end, it made me realize that with the scope of the game's world, the abilities I possessed, and the enemies I've mowed down, I realized what exactly this protagonist was capable of now, and will be capable of in the future.\n\nThe game at this point asks, what is more frightening than a God?

What a beautiful game, I simply can't understand why you would play anything else.\n\nFirst of all this game is set in space so it's already cool, but what is even better is your FULLY CUSTOMISABLE SPACESHIP! with that you can really get to know your ship and maybe even roleplay a bit.\n\nThen there are space enemies, meaning you can have epic space battles fighting with or against a variety of weapons. Or you could decide to take it to close combat and blast the alien fools once you've boarded their space stations.\n\nMeanwhile in this already fully immersive and incredible combat you will have some cool music playing. Music, no big deal right? Wrong. The music in this game makes it twice as better even if you're cruising around a planet, or in fast paced combat or even running around your spaceship like a madman.\n\nAfter all this there is more! The flying in this game is absolutely brilliant, at all times you feel very in control of what your ship is doing. (Except when you are in limnal drive.) Zoom around space at multiple speeds and really understand how BIG space is. Even at the fastest speed you're going to have trouble reaching the other end.\n\nThe Planets are excellent and many aliens inhabit them. Then there are hundreds of asteroids, seriously that isnt an exageration. The asteroids also inhabited by aliens. Then as mentioned before there are alien space stations littered around space. On all planets and asteroids there is tons of loot to find including space emails that progresses the story. All planets have there own music too!\n\nThe very simple art style works perfectly.\n\nThis has been my review on Rodina, obviously this game is in early access at the moment and things could change but when it is finished i will look forward to playing it. At it's current state i would give it a very honest 9.5/10.\n\n-Niteguard  \n \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1480109526, "timestamp_updated": 1480109526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540913", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27531128": {"recommendationid": "27531128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062452722", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513317799}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best space games I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1480102760, "timestamp_updated": 1480102760, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.491445", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27523875": {"recommendationid": "27523875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049649622", "num_games_owned": 713, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495992796}, "language": "english", "review": "Perhaps one of the most interesting & innovative games made in a  while, especially for an indie title; this is amazing...

Although there is plenty of space fighter combat - and the AI pilots display impressive teamwork - these sequences are merely obstacles to the core of Rodina: Scouring the solar system for apocalyptic logs that tell the story of the original Rodina mission. It's clear that the developer (one person, I believe) puts most of the focus on collecting the log fragments and encrypted messages that unveil the fascinating retrospective exposition. If you enjoy reading the messages and log entries scattered throughout games like System Shock 2, Deus Ex, and Bioshock, you will find much to enjoy here.\n\nIt's equally clear that combat and logistics have been super-simplified in order to prevent player frustration and to keep the focus on exploring and searching. All action takes place within a single solar system. Logistics are utterly simple: Ship and personnel damage are repaired automatically, most weapons can be fired constantly without reloading, and engine upgrades speed travel from point to point. Your ship's floor plan can be customized from the airlock menu, but this seems like a placeholder feature with no practical impact. Similarly, if a fire breaks out on your ship, you must exit the cockpit and race around the ship's deck spraying a fire extinguisher at the flames. This adds to the tension of an already dangerous battle or planetfall, but it also comes across as a placeholder with zero narrative or gameplay purpose.\n\nIf Rodina truly is completely the work of a single person, that person is both a skilled software developer and a talented author of fiction.

I had seen this earlier in the year and had forgotten about it. Tried to get No Mans Sky to work and it wouldnt then I rediscovered this game. \n     \n     So this game gives me the feeling of playing minecraft way back in the day when it was very simple, it was amazing. So is this, I love just flying around and shooting down other ships, and recently took on a Vanguard Chunk so that was cool too. One of my favorite features is the ability to modify the layout of the ship. I look forward to continuing on with this game as I have read the Developer blog about the features that will be added within the next 2 years. This game is going to turn into something even more awesome.\n     \n     Overall I would say this game is a 9/10 currently. Only lacking a point due to some features that are not, but will be present later.\nMy Feedback on this is that it would be cool to have the ability to drag and place room sizes within the ship, or maybe just make that functionality a little more advanced, which I think is planned anyway. Also maybe an player inventory system, Like in order to put a datastick into the archives, you must manually walk to the archives and file it. I am sure that will come along as well with the additional health items being added. last thing i may suggest is instead of flying from the cockpit being the last position your player was at, make an interface tha treats it like you are a camera at the front of the ship with a hud for alt. distance. ammunition health etc, also as an alternative to that, a pilots station view with a holoscreen monitor setup for cockpit driving.\n\nStill, I love this game!", "timestamp_created": 1471532608, "timestamp_updated": 1471532608, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24989961": {"recommendationid": "24989961", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997949902", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512375305}, "language": "swedish", "review": "This game is pure art.

If you aren't sure, then play the free demo.\nUnfinished, but still easily worth the price.  Aspires to be Daggerfall in space.  Already immersive.  Fun flight gameplay, Unreal/Quake style FPS gameplay.\n\nBecause I don't want to forget, I'll mention this up front: the music's great.  There aren't many tunes, but they're all very evocative of whatever environment or situation triggers them.\n\nYou can edit the layout of your ship; the current assets are simple, but still enough to keep you busy personalizing it.  The exterior shape is static regardless of how you arrange the interior, but the interior is still a physical place that you walk through to get to the cockpit.\n\nPiloting the ship actually gives the feeling of navigating a massive, largely empty space.  You've got four \"gears\" depending on how far you want to go and how fast you want to get there.  The ship manages to feel ponderous at some speeds and agile at others.\n\nThe exploration involves flying your ship to a celestial body of indeterminate size, landing your ship, and then getting out of your ship and grabbing the loot.  There are text logs that provide information on the culture and context of the game, ammo pickups for your ship, and upgrades to let you visit specific places.  The planets are bare, but terrain is quite varied.  Counterintuitively, the closer you get, the less detail you see.\n\nDogfighting has been implemented - quite well, I think - but there doesn't seem to be any progression, so the enemies are exactly as tough several hours in as they were at the beginning.  You have your infinite-ammo chaingun, but you can also pick up ammunition for special weapons.\nI've seen three types of enemy ship in space (scout, bomber, battleship) and an additional one in atmosphere.\n\nThe FPS combat takes place in procedurally-generated pieces of debris.  For me, the easiest point of reference is Nethack.  Rooms of random size connecting to other rooms of random size, although thankfully Rodina lacks the dead-end tunnels.\nThere's only one weapon at the moment, a Megaman-style blaster, and only one type of enemy with the same weapon.  However, being from the old school of FPS gameplay, the combat tends to be frenetic and challenging rather than dull.  Lots of strafing and either rapid clicking or twitchy charged shots.", "timestamp_created": 1471313649, "timestamp_updated": 1511625470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660287", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24944710": {"recommendationid": "24944710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220396920", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514607922}, "language": "english", "review": "Please...

While exploring you find interesting data logs and decrypt keys to further unlock the story while being guided along loosely by your FTL Communicator. It's a really immersive enviroment and with a great soundtrack. The story on the whole is excellent and really immerses you, with the game having no loading screens or anything of the sort which breaks immersion, it feels like your living the story, even more so if it was made VR compatible. Overall, an immensely great game which I recommend highly to anyone who likes the genre, I'm excited for more and possibly an expansion on the story? :P", "timestamp_created": 1470311421, "timestamp_updated": 1470311421, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24702250": {"recommendationid": "24702250", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120250656", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1870, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494815812}, "language": "english", "review": "Now usually early-access games are terrible scams and you have no guarantee that it will get any better.

It has everything that I want in a space exploration game and although it is still a work in progress, it shows signs of improving vastly with each new update. So if you are wondering what Rodina offers, it's basically this: You start on an asteroid where you find your ship. After you board your ship, the galaxy opens up to you. It's not a whole universe, but it is the largest game map I've ever seen. An entire galaxy is ready to be explored and it feels massive in scale. For instance, when you look in the sky, you see hundreds of dots which are each collections of smaller asteroids. The asteroids can be explored, and often contain loot. However the biggest appeal is planets, which are massive in scale. It would take hours to fly around one and probably days to walk, as compared to the thousands of asteroids which don't take very long to completely explore (Keep in mind this is real life time, not in game time). Once you've taken in the awe of the scale of it all, you can explore the galaxy to unravel the game's story. As of writing this, there are no npc's, but the story comes in the form of written documents scattered on planets and asteroids. It's very well written and it's easy to get lost in the lore and backstory of it all. I won't spoil anything but it's worth playing for. Combat is also really fun. There are several types of enemies and weapons you can use to fight them. It feels like space battles done right and it's all very enoyable. The other thing you can do in this game is customize your ship. There is a well designed customizing feature that is very easy to use and lets you make your ship unique. There is also another feature the game added which is awesome, but may be a minor spoiler so only scroll over this part if you want to know: [spoiler]Once you beat the story you have the ability to make robots. They don't have dialoge but they follow you around and are pretty neat.[/spoiler] However, this brings me to Rodina's biggest flaw (flaw is a strong word but I can't think of a better one): It's very empty. The loneliness of space can bother some people and I can understand if some people get bored or disinterested. I should make something clear: this game is in early access, so if you want to get this game be aware that it is empty in terms of content and the gameplay can be boring and/or lacking at times. If you are like me and roleplay in your head you won't get too bored, but if you prefer your story more straightfoward then you may not have as much fun as other people playing this game. So should you get this game? Yes. If you are not sure there is a free demo on the store page. It's the full game with a 1 hr. time limit and should give you a great idea of what you are in for. However after replaying the hour of the demo I think everyone should buy this game at full price. The price is very reasonable for what you are getting, it's very fun, and it runs great on low end pc's like mine (as of writing this.)

Repeat x5 and I was getting a little bored.  The gameplay is interesting, but repetitive.  An autopilot to selected planet would help, as would an auto-land feature.  The \"no loading\" feature is amazing, as the game more or less seamlessly transitions from deep space to planetary atmosphere.  Atmospheric landing was interesting; I loved the shaking of the spacecraft during atmospheric descent.  The game leaves you quite on your own at the beginning, and some tips in the tutorial would be welcome.  (Hint: follow all indicators on your screen, and land as close to them as possible.)  I will probably leave the game for a few weeks and revisit, just to give myself a fresh chance at it.  Overall, not recommended from me at this time, but the game has real potential and needs to flesh out the universe for it really to come into its own. \n\n2017-02: back to playing with it and I am reminded that the music is fantastic. I bought the soundtrack to support the developer.  Finding the alien NPCs to be a bit comedic as they race at full tilt around asteroid surfaces shooting blasters at you.  I'm sure this will be fleshed out in future versions.  Still find the game slightly tedious and the planet surfaces boring, but I'll make my way to one of the new gravity bikes and try those out, if I can.  All gripes aside, floating in space listening to the excellent music is worth a few bucks.  Graphics are nothing to write home about, but somehow, it's easy to overlook them while you float in space.  I'd recommend at a discounted price, or for anyone who just loves to tool around in a free world-universe (that doesn't really have that much going on) while listening to great music.

Die Antwort folgt nach der Auflistung dessen, was in der \"Tech-Demo\" enthalten ist.\n\nIhr startet auf einem Asteroid und kriegt dort die Einleitung f\u00fcr die Geschichte, fliegt ein St\u00fcck und holt euch eine Verbesserung f\u00fcr euer Schiff und dann gehts weiter.\n\nDie Grafik ist sch\u00f6n, aber insgesamt ist alles sehr leer, f\u00fcr Asteroiden OK, bei Planeten ist es unglaublich langweilig, wenn dort nichts ist, au\u00dfer Fels- bzw. Eislandschaften.\nIhr k\u00f6nnt und m\u00fcsste eurem Schiff Verbesserungen geben und bekommt Munition f\u00fcr \"bessere\" Waffen. Viele Verbesserungen etc. sind das allerdings nicht.\nVon au\u00dfen sieht euer Schiff aus, wie ein Stein.\nDer Innenraum sieht schon wesentlich besser aus, ihr k\u00f6nnt ihn auch gestalten, was in diesem Stadium des Spiels aber keinen Sinn oder gar Mehrwert bietet.\nDas Sonnensystem und die Steuerung sind gut gemacht, die Entfernungen und die Gr\u00f6\u00dfe der Objekte (Sonne, Planeten, Asteroiden) erscheinen realistisch, die Steuerung auch (tlw. Newtonsche Physik, Kampfe sind OK, Planetenlandung ist herausfordernd und insgesamt macht es Spa\u00df das Schiff zu fliegen).\n\nInterface ist zweckdienlich und erm\u00f6glicht eine gute Spielbarkeit des Spiels.\n\nEs macht keinen Sinn die Gegner anzugreifen au\u00dfer um an eine bestimmte Stelle zu kommen (bei Asteroiden) oder zum Spa\u00df, ansonsten hat man nix davon. Selbst wenn sie abst\u00fcrzen, so findet man nichts an ihrem Absturzort, au\u00dfer eben das brennende Wrack. Irgendwann wird man sie einfach nur umgehen, was eher schade ist.\n\nSoweit, es ist eben ein Early Acces-Spiel und wird auch nur von einer Person entwickelt.\n\nMit all dem w\u00e4re man eine vielleicht maximal 2h besch\u00e4ftigt und dann w\u00fcrde es sehr sehr langweilig werden.\n\nWird es aber nicht und das liegt an der Geschichte und nur deswegen kann das als vollwertiges EarlyAcces-Spiel gewertet werden und nur deswegen lassen sich die 15 \u20ac rechtfertigen. Und auch nur wegen der Geschichte ist die Bewertung so gut.\n\nNeben der Kerngeschichte, die ihr St\u00fcck f\u00fcr St\u00fcck entdeckt gibt es noch diverse Datenfragmente, die ihr an diversen Absturzstellen aufsammeln k\u00f6nnt. Mit diesen Zusatzinfos bekommt die Geschichte mehr Tiefe und teilweise ist es sehr lustig geschrieben (alles in Englisch). Die Geschichte ist sehr gut erz\u00e4hlt und echt spannend. Besonders dieser Punkt, wo ihr begreift ... aber ich will nicht vorgreifen. Entdeckt es selbst.\n\n[b]Dieses Spiel ist +10 \u20ac wert und kriegt eine positive Bewertung, weil:[/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*]es trotz des EA bereits eine \"runde Sache\" ist\n    [*]also ein abgeschlossenes, wenn auch kurzes (10h) Spielerlebnis bietet\n    [*]die Spielmechanik gut und vielversprechend ist\n    [*]die Story den Spieler gut mitnimmt und Tiefe hat\n[/list]\n\nDer momentane Fokus liegt voll auf der Story, wer das Spiel wegen Weltraumsim, Erforschen und Abenteuer kauft, der wird eher entt\u00e4uscht sein. Wer sich aber mal anschauen will, was es technisch bietet und sich dann auf eine gute Geschichte einlassen will, der ist hier richtig.\n\nIch hab die Geschichte gem\u00fctlich in 10h durchgespielt, k\u00f6nnte aber noch weiter forschen um mehr Neben- und Hintergrundinfos zu bekommen oder h\u00e4tte das ganze auch deutlich schneller machen k\u00f6nnen.

(doesn't really happen to me, I have a pretty beefy PC)\n-Sometimes crashes (only happened to me once)\n-All of the planets are just wastelands and mountains.

It definitely has potential, but some major flaws are noticed early game.  The landing is a bit awkward. Even when I use the docking speed and very fine tuning with the strafe/FWD/BCKWD to bring her down.. it's just that the ship seems weightless.  It wont stick to the ground in most situtations. It's almost bouncy even on a very very soft landing.  \n\nThe other problem was the first planet I visit- it's littered with marks all over as you approach, indicating plenty of areas to explore.  But you have to enter the atmosphere at an angle, and there's no telling how long it'll take, so there's really no way to aim your way to a good spot.  So now I'm on the planet.... and I'm cruising. endlessly.  10 minutes go by- nothing but the same landscape. None of the points of interest show locally, nor am i finding any at cruise speed (the highest you can go in the atmosphere).  Another 10-15 minutes goes by and at this point I've put down the game. I'm all for exploring  and all- but not when there's so little to explore.  My suggestion would be to keep some of the local marks on screen so you can move toward them, instead of zig-zagging around aimlessly for half an hour, still finding nothing. \n\nIt has a whole bunch of potential if a whole bunch of stuff is added.

There is a major lack of content. While this is a valid point (and basically the only valid point), it is completely and totally offset by the many positive factors.\n\nNow, to the billion GOOD reasons to buy this game\n1) The Developer: ERMUHGURD! The developer! This is a one man team (hence the lack of content) and should be judged in accordance, but he works with the speed of ten. I got this game probably around 2 years ago and since then this game has changed in more ways than I could imagine, this is even better because the content changes didn't morph the game that I had come to love, but like a gem, it has slowly been chipped and polished so it can shine even brighter. Plus, if you are worrying about the game being caught in early access hell, A) did you even read what I wrote? and B) the dev has proven to be extremely aware of this issue, that is why he made the demo and seems to offer refunds to any unsatisfied customers (THATS how consumer-friendly he is)\n\n2) The Soundtrack: Just... Just play the game and you will know exactly what Im talking about it. As any good Syfi anything, the music is soo epic and fits the tone perfectly. Speaking of...\n\n3) The Tone: The best way I can describe the tone of this game is like the early days of minecraft. It is often overlooked just how lonely that game can feel. When you arent playing with anyone, you really get the feeling that while minecraft, with its haunting piano track and all the unkown factors, gives you unlimited freedom, it comes with this soul freezing feeling of lonelines. Rodina uses its epic soundtrack and scale to bring you the same affect. Oh I almost forgot about the scale!\n\n4) Scale: This is probably one of the only games I have ever owned that made me comprehend much better something that would usually be considered incomprehensible in ways only a video game could. This game made me grasp just how vast and empty space really is while still making it an enjoyable experience throught how the game progression curve and the sheer size. I'm trying to avoid anecdotes because I truley belive that this game needs to be experienced first hand, but ill say this. It makes you feel like a flea.\n\n5) Combat: While it does take some time to get used to the controls of flying in 0G, the intuitiveness of the game is unprecedented for games of its caliber.

nothing to flashy, i just like to see my hands and feet! makes it that much more imersive\n- some form of space station/outpost with instant travel and vendors?\n- animate the sun and clouds on planets, just subtle, too flashy will kill it\n- higher res background would be awesome. \n- warning siren and outer screen flashing red for dangers ASWELL as low health\nhope this helps!

This game has been on my wish list for a long time and finally bought it (at full price like a crazy gamer shouldn't do for early access games). The devs have been active on the forums (and with updates) and the concept of being able to move about my ship and on the planet is an amazing concept. Any Star Trek, Star Wars or space fan will enjoy this game. Although quite limited in it's early stages, [url=https://elliptic-games.com/?page_id=738]the dev has a huge plan to implement possible one of the best space games ever[/url]. \n\nRodina is this Star Trek's fan biggest dream game. I have played Star Trek Bridge Commander (and thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay, storyline and graphics) and yearned to walk around the ship. Rodina brings this fantasy to reality with it's concept. The devs are really specific in saying that this is a seamless space game, meaning there are no loading screens. The player can walk around their ship, pilot their ship, get off their ship, get off the planet and onto the ship without any loading processes. The absolute first feature players will notice is that they are able to walk anywhere around their ship. There is only one ship at the moment but there is a small modding community that offer different ship designs. These mods are not flawless and some may need special attention to get working properly (in-game and out of game). The player may design and change the inside of the ship at any time. If you would like a bigger bridge, bigger room, bigger hallways, that can be done with a few simple clicks. The design menu isn't super friendly but does provide the player with basics to design what they want. What is a neat feature is that the player may remotely control the ship from certain panels. For example, say you don't want to walk to the cockpit every time you would like to pilot the ship. There is a panel located by the air-lock located on the back of the ship for the players convenience. That by itself showed me there was some serious thought put into the game.\n\nThe player may fly the ship in almost any direction and can pilot/interact with panels by pressing \"F\". WASD allows the player to move as well as steer the ship. Spacebar allows the player to jump while allowing the ship to move upwards on the z axis. There is no crouching ability (I'm assuming yet) but CTRL will move the ship downwards on the z-axis. The controls/sensitivity can be modified for your preference. Some secondary weapons can be picked up on stray planets or asteroids and can be equipped by pressing R. There is no first person mode to shoot as of yet but there may be plans in the future. The devs haven't singled out many suggestions but are keeping to their road map and are focusing on a campaign. Tab will allow the player to switch between first person and third person view. This is only possible while piloting the ship. Left button will fire the ships weapons while the right mouse button acts as the clutch (in which the player will need to press up or down to switch between drive systems). Some drives will need to be picked up by the player by exploring. Currently, I have experienced four drives in which the fourth will let you travel at light speed. Piloting and landing have been made relatively easy to do. The ship will approach a planet/asteroid and slowly start adjusting itself as you attempt to adjust yourself to the horizon. Leaving the planet to travel is also equally as easy but entering will require some skill as the atmosphere may burn you and your ship up! Quick! Grab the fire extinguisher!\n\nThere are no significant or diverse NPC's at the moment but this is on the agenda. There are a few enemies you will encounter upon traveling the stars. The [b]campaign[/b] as of now consists of the player starting on a barren rock, finding their ship then collecting some materials (such as crates, weapons - limited, diary logs and technology) then traveling to the next planet. The player then may choose where they wish to go next. Most planets will have enemies defending it as well as cargo on it (be it logs, weapons or empty crates). There is a minor story line that the player can follow but will require them to decipher certain messages while other messages can be simply read. [b]Graphics[/b] remind me of minecraft but there is an HD mod out there to help improve the visuals. I personally hope there will be a significant upgrade in this realm. [b]Sounds[/b] are basic at the moment and do not vary much. All the fundamentals are there though!\n\nOverall, the game seems promising although limited at the moment. Hardcore space fans will find hours of fun in this early access while regular gamers may be waiting for a full release to come out. Early access is a tricky gamble but I've bought the game in hopes that this will become a great game. I will give it a recommendation but will advise players that they should really do their homework before buying.\n\n\nEARLY ACCESS RATING : 6.85/10\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n\n[h1]ScreenShots : [/h1]\n\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686696410] View from the cockpit[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686696515] A mod in action[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686696541] Planet discovery[/url]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=686696551] Don't jump into an atmosphere quickly.[/url]\n\n[h1]Video :[/h1]\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khgJG9fo-Iw] Rodina Highlights Review[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1463550486, "timestamp_updated": 1482697942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614281", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23040699": {"recommendationid": "23040699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158408155", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1035, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475358394}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a very fun game, but what would be good is if we had multi player and the planets have more too them", "timestamp_created": 1463505141, "timestamp_updated": 1463505141, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23039034": {"recommendationid": "23039034", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967329422", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1516011213}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game in early access, best game I can remember buying early access.\n\nTried it when it was in beta, was a great Idea and needed work, the dev has actually finished on his promises and more.

The graphics appear to be very plain and flat from the screenshots, but the beautiful lighting and atmospheric effects combine to provide breathtaking scenery, underscored by an unexpectedly powerful soundtrack of orchestral and synth space music which makes simply orbiting at speed above a planet feel profoundly emotional.\n\nThe game is rather simple to play, and does a good job of leading you from quest to quest. The story presented so far at this stage of development is impressively thought-provoking and engaging, a legit science fiction epic inpsired by masters such as Azimov, Clarke and Kurzweil, with surprises for the player that deserve not to be spoiled.\n\nThe controls are direct and unencumbered by over-simulation, and allow you to pilot you ship with full 6 degrees of freedom and utilize your momentum to perform satisfying maneuvers. Usually control setup and familiarization is the biggest hurdle to getting into a 3D spaceflight game, however Rodina's controls and GUI are extremely accessible, arcade-like even. \n\nAn interesting feature is the various \"gears\" you can put your ship in to control speed: a slow speed for landing, a faster speed for combat, full cruising speed at which you cannot use weapons, and ultimately a giddy and scale-accurate lightspeed where the distance between objects in light-seconds is the precise amount of time it takes you to get there. Each speed setting is essentially an order of magnitude faster than the last. This system works very well to permit easy transition between the fine control needed for negotiating a landing and the coarse adjustments needed for interplanetary travel, as well as getting the hell outta Dodge when necessary.\n\nUnlilke many starfighter games, the ship does not pilot exactly like a fighter plane, but much more like the agile ship from the Descent games, and so combat can be approached with lateral strafing and reverse-thrust distancing against smaller, faster enemies, while larger, slower enemies are best circled and then rushed from the side. You can also switch to the fastest cruising speed momentarily to outrun missile locks and enemy aim, swing around and attack from the flank. The combat is solid, although more enemy ship types such as huge battleships would be nice down the line.\n\nCurrently there is only ship-to-ship battle, although it appears that personal combat and invasion of enemy ships and bases is the next significant addition slated, which will certainly add new depth. \nThere are several weapons you can acquire to fill out your ship's arsenal, from fire-and-forget missiles and bullet swarms to slow, heavy-hitting cannons. Nothing terribly incredible but a quite adequate variety to handle the 4 or 5 enemy types I've found, from light to heavy armor, each specializing in equivalent weapons to those you obtain.\n\nThe story is rather short currently, I completed the main questline in a day in which I found myself incrementally engrossed in the adventure with each upgrade and story log, but I was completely satisfied with what I was able to play, and am eagerly looking forward to the additional content laid out in the development roadmap. \nThere are many things that Rodina is not, at least currently. It is not a space trading game, or survival game, or simulation game, or a relentless high-action shooter. It is a very relaxing exploration adventure that lets you tackle the mystery of the Zorica star system at your own pace and contains all the necessary elements to make it worth the trip.", "timestamp_created": 1463435778, "timestamp_updated": 1463516093, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23013437": {"recommendationid": "23013437", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082120467", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506139448}, "language": "english", "review": "I thoroughly enjoy this game.

And if you're looking for something to sate you until No Man's Sky, this is your best bet (although they will end up being totally different games in the future).", "timestamp_created": 1463368167, "timestamp_updated": 1463368167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23011294": {"recommendationid": "23011294", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070885672", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486068464}, "language": "english", "review": "good game but needs mac support so i can play with my new computor", "timestamp_created": 1463356970, "timestamp_updated": 1463356970, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22993953": {"recommendationid": "22993953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062233761", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469955939}, "language": "english", "review": "why did I buy this?\n\nword of advice DON'T PRESS THE \"EMERGENCY OPEN ALL DOORS\" while you are flying, it will send you mach 7 speed into the walls of your ship then out into space...", "timestamp_created": 1463297454, "timestamp_updated": 1463297454, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497319", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22990727": {"recommendationid": "22990727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050072529", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 51, "playtime_forever": 3002, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513384353}, "language": "english", "review": "What Rodina currently lacks in detail and content, it makes up for in scale. When you hover over planets and even minor asteroids for the first time, you don't understand what you're looking at. No really, because of the lack of any features on planets other than small textures, you won't comprehend that the hill you think you're looking at is a miles high mountain part of a mountain range that when viewed from space looks like a small blemish. That's where Rodina shines, when you get down to the surface of planets and strafe left and right until you realize that those mountains you were whizzing by in your shuttle aren't moving anymore. These are real planets when it comes to scale, in an also vast solar system. The planets themselves, mixed with asteroids of various shapes and sizes are fun to explore for a few hours, expecially coupled with the game's amazing, if not slightly repetitive soundtrack.\nThe story is interesting, considering it is told through Datasticks, and encryption keys you find throughout the various planets and asteroids. The main story unfolds through the Pilot Wave Radio on your ship. There is no exposition, or dialogue choices, so if you're not interested in reading I would recommend you simply play freeform mode (you can still pick up Datasticks). The story at the time of this review is unfinished and cuts off (you get an in game message telling you this). If the story hasn't been spoiled for you yet, play through the game and experience it yourself.\nThe combat is simple at this time. There are a few enemy types that you will encounter, from small scout fighters up to battleships. Your primary weapon is a fast shooting and unlimited laser. There are other weapons you unlock throughout the game by finding containers of their respective ammo. I usually stuck with the starting weapon. Some of the enemies can be simple with practice, while other enemies could use some tweaks.\nYour ship, an (as far as I know) unnamed \"Gunship\" is a modified human shuttle. It is the medium through which you experience Rodina. To reflect this, the interior of the ship is modular, meaning you can customize it with a generous amount of layouts, props, usable items, and decorations. I say generous as this game is far from complete and I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of options we have at this time. \nOverall, Rodina is a great game, and will be even better with future updates.

Going through atmosphere's can be fun also.  However the planet landscape is where it kind of kills it for me.  For the most part its pretty much the same landscapes just different colours.  \nSame with the suns.\n\nMoons around a planet would be great.  First and foremost.  Presently, its like there's thousands of asteroids (all which so far have got enemies around every one which is quite unrealistic) - but surely some planets would have at least pulled some of these asteroids in and have them orbit to make moons.\n\nNo Gas Giants.  However, realistically, Gas Giants also have moons around them.  They're not a waste of universe space.  If Jupiter or Saturn were not around we'd be having a ton more comets and things hitting us if it wasn't for their gravitational pull keeping those sort of things away from us.\n\nI basically went to four planets and 11 asteroids in my two hours of play.  the four planets (can't recall the names) -\n\nOne I started on.   One that had an acidic atmosphere and I couldn't stay on it longer than under 2 minutes because it burnt through the hull of my ship.\nOne That was Icy that basically did the same damage type to my ship by freezing it out.  I couldn't stay on it longer than under 2 minutes.\nThe last one - Peren - all purple, green sun... totally featureless landscape.  I also couldn't find a thing on it although I did see markers for crates and so forth but never found em on my short stay on the planet.  \n\nI have no doubt that this game will go quite some way as long as the developer considers the ideas from the community but as its an Alpha game, I checked it out.  Its not for me quite yet - but down the track I could be interested.

This game is beautiful in every possible way. I just got to what was originally the end of the story, however the developer is still adding to it. So let's go down the basics, starting from (in my opinion) the least important pieces, to the best part of this game.\n\n1. Graphics:\n\nQuite obviously, the least important part, but a part anyways. The graphics are a bit simplistic, but they get the job done and actually fit in nicely with the rest of the game.\n\n2. Bugs:\n\nNow, this game is only being worked on by one person, and if you keep up with their developer's updates, you'd know that they're going through quite a rough point in their lives right now. That being said, this game is practically bug free. It's amazing how polished this game is [b]especially[/b] considering the developers current personal status. I've experienced a total of 2 bugs in this game, and one of them was a crash. Okay, to be fair, the game has crashed twice, but I didn't even lose any progress, thanks to this games marvelous autosave function. The other bug was a graphical bug. I found a strange wall in a ditch on one of the planets. I assume this was caused because of the textures being combined at the edge of the planet. It's like folding a flat blanket over a sphere, you can still see the seams. However, as soon as I was far enough, I couldn't even see the bug anymore. \n\n-Addition: I just tried edditing my ship to make a few changes, and in the entities catagory, no matter what I choose (Move, rotate, or delete), I can only rotate an entity. The statement above still apply, however.\n\n3. Sountrack:\n\nThe soundtrack to this game is gorgeous, and stunning. I love every bit of it. It fills you with exactly the same feeling that the rest of this game does: a feeling of being alone, but not upset, or sad, but joyful. It's hard to explain how you can be so lonely without feeling any sort of bleakness.\n\n4. Gameplay:\n\nThis subject will be split into multiple parts, as there's a lot to cover.\n\nI - On planet/asteroid travel:\nThis is the first part of the game that you experience, and the part that you get the least of. It's easy to understand, only using the standard WASD controls, F to activate things, G activates a flashlight, press space to jump, and press space again to activate a jetpack. You'll only really be in this mode for a few seconds when collecting this out of the ship, and to activate a few things inside the ship. Easy to understand, simple and easy, not overused, and a good addition to the game. \n\nII - Flight/solar system travel:\nThe most common part of the game. There are four different flight speeds, all of which you unlock within the first 30 minutes of playtime. It has a very responsive control system that's very satisfying to use. There are also scanners that you can place inside your ship. These act as a map to help guide you through the massive solar system. \n\nIII - Combat:\nThis can be really easy, or really hard depending mostly on one variable: the number of enemies. Though the combat is just a responsive as the flight system and very satisfying, the enemy A.I. is very limited and not very advanced. Taking on anything from one to six is a walk in the park, while seven and up will have you tearing your hair out. This is due to how the enemies attack. With no self preservation, they just come flying at you shooting the whole time. This, however, isn't that bad, considering that their top speed is the equivelant of your second speed, so in the event that you need to retreat, or go to the other side of all the enemies, it is easy to do so. \n\nIV - Ship customization:\nThis part was a lot of fun for me. It may depend on how much you like customization, but personally, I would not recommend using the default ship, so customization is almost a manditory part of the game. The game allows you to load up an empty map and go to town with every tool at your disposal. A tutorial for some, would be nice, but I found no problem with picking everything up. Customizing your ship adds value and care for it. It makes it feel like it's really [i]your[/i] ship. I might not have liked this game nearly as much were it not for the ship customization.\n\n5. Story:\nThis part is what inspired me to write this. I will not say anything about it, except that you have to read the encrypted messages. The encrypted messages are the main story, everything else is just fluff. Quite nice fluff, but just fluff. If you have not had this game spoiled yet, you have to buy this game now. Do not look up the story. Go into it completely blind; you'll thank me later.\n\nThat concludes this review. If I had to rate this game, I would give it a 9.8/10. I have to take that .2 off because of the few and far between bugs, and slightly dodgy graphics, but I hardly noticed any of that. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone who will give me five seconds to talk.

Rodina is a space exploration game, with enimies that you can shoot down to take over a planet. There are 4 planets (Hopefully there will be more in the future) that you can visit and land on. Although in the spaceship that you fly around in makes everything seem small, YOU'RE SO WRONG. SO SO SO WRONG. The sense of scale in this game is far past anygame that I've ever seen. Infact, the spaceship itself is about the size of a house. The mountains are gigantic, in the sense it takes 30 minutes+ to climb some of the tallest ones. You have a jetpack that lets you fly around as well, which is very fun. The game has three main modes, Normal, Freeform, and Peaceful. Normal is more or less the main story of the game, in which you can easily die. Freeform is basically the creative mode, although you can still die in it. And I haven't played peaceful, so I'm not sure what that is about. The games graphics are kind of polished-pixelated. They look amazing but can run on most computers, even if you have a potato.

Many are usually more or less incomplete games, so Early Access, for many games, is essentially an excuse for Beta testing without having to pay anyone. However, there are some games that are a full, complete game even in early access, and provide new and interesting content untill the developers feel it's ready to fully release. Rodina is NOT one of these games. So the question is, why do I reccomend it so much?\n\nThe answer is simple: Rodina is a very open, very easty-to-play, and very fun game, and will one day be something amazing.\n\nAs it stands, the world is very baron and empty, with only a few game mechanics involved, which includes flying around, collecting things on the surface of planets and asteriods and flying. I wouldn't callt his a complete game at all. However, what is in there are plots with a dark sense of humour, as well as what is so far an interesting main narritive which, althought it can be hard to follow at times, keeps you wanting to find more things.\n\nBut easily the main reason i'd reccomend this game is atmospheare. This game has such an immense sense of scale, that coming right up to the sun and seeing its size actually made me feel ill it looked that big. And the flying mechanics are absolutely great too. And planets are planet-sized. You could fit the GTA5 map on the smallest plannet dozens of times over with ease. Each planet has a unique feel to it and all are worth exploreing, as long as you can get past the enemies.\n\nThis is where we reach the weakest part of the game: the combat. I am really dissapointed too, because this is finally a game that makes me feel like i'm flying around in 3-D space without having to learn too many complex controls and yet the combat system is so broken. Perhaps I am simply bad at the game, but the enemies take way too long to die, and the extra weapons you find on the ground are very limited and either don't add a whole lot or are pretty much required to stand even a chance at beating them.\n\nBut again, this is where I still want to keep reccomending the game. I know for a fact that the combat system is going to be improved eventually, and I am sure that it'll be better and more diverse. I have a lot of faith in this game and I would at least reccomend getting the free demo, to see if it's the sort of game you'd like.\n\nIn conclusion, while most Early Access games are a game which feels like a tech demo, this Early Access game is basically a tech demo which feels like a game.

The \"reading about the best parts at home\" and \"actually going to space\" sides are equally interesting. Rodina makes space realistically boring in this fashion. You can see mountains the size of continents, but they still look like piles of red dirt once you get over their size. You can see canyons miles deep that circle entire planets, but they're mostly the same westward as eastward. You can see 10,000 large space rocks but they're all more or less pointless unless you find the one that's only the size of Connecticut. You can see purple skies and a green sun just as easily as yellow skies and a blue sun, and both look equally routine after spending enough time under both. Warp into the sun accidentally, and you'll get a quick laugh. Warp into someplace that isn't the sun and wonder what you'll find. Hit planetside without dieing and your reward is an endless desert, as not-really-picturesque as the REAL Saharan Desert, as it stretches on samily for all of the miles. Maybe you can find some fun rocks, but you have to sift through a billion tons of rainbow dirt to find it. Shooting aliens gets normal after you figure out how to start shooting at max range and backpedaling. The game is boring, but rightfully so because if it was always interesting then it'd be unrealistic.

The music is pleasant and the writing is well done (the interview with Malcolm McCreedy is my personal favorite).  The single quest line will likely take you a couple of hours to complete, unless you rush through it.  The interior of your space craft is fully customizable within the game.  The exterior of the ship may be 'modded' with third-party tools, and a number of modded ships are available from fan sites.\n\nCombat is unrewarding, beyond a personal satisfaction.  There are no 'experience points' to earn, and destroyed enemies drop no loot.  Combat is practically optional, as groups of enemies are easy to navigate around.  This allows you to decide if your gaming experience will be \"guns blazing\" or exploration.\n\nThe game is a work in progress, and the developer is very active in the game's community.  Based on his forum posts and his own description of the game, the developer clearly has big plans for Rodina.  In its current state, you may expect to \"run out of things to do\" after a day or two of game play.  Once you have completed the quest line and discovered all of the data modules, all that's left is combat and sight seeing.  \n\nI recommend this game because I sincerely enjoy playing it.  I find myself smiling as I travel from planet to planet, and I found the short stories entertaining and diverse.  Rodina is a refreshing game with a bright future that is worth experiencing and supporting. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1447122934, "timestamp_updated": 1447122934, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18979245": {"recommendationid": "18979245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110273347", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 640, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489813914}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh...oh...my goodness. I just finished the storyline as far as it goes at the moment, and I'm just sitting here in awe. Forget any other purchases you were going to make, buy this game right now. You will not regret it.\n\n\nFor a more in-depth review:\n\nRodina is a retro-style space sim done in an open-world style, meaning that you can fly about an entire actual size solar system with no loading screens. It's a bit thin on features at the moment, but it's still Early Access, and in my experience has been incredibly stable for an Early Access title.\n\nGraphics/SFX: 8/10\nGraphics are kind of retro-styled, but still look quite good, with terrain textures being fairly detailed, ship interiors looking AWESOME, and sound effects being perfect for this type of game. However, the exterior of your ship is somewhat bland (the ship design can apparently be edited in 3D modeling programs, so if you would like, I believe this can be changed), and planet terrain mostly consists of cliffs, hills, and mountains, with no vegetation or anything to make them feel more \"real\". This is perfectly acceptable in an Early Access game imo, but it's worth noting.\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10\nGET THE SOUNDTRACK, TOO. I'm serious. The Rodina OST is one of the most beautiful pieces of work I've ever heard, perfectly meshing with the gameplay. Flying between asteroids? The music is nice and peaceful, capturing the awe of just staring at the beauty of the universe. Moving into combat? The music shifts to adrenaline-inducing battle music. It's a masterpiece equaled in only a handful of other games I've played. My top three game soundtracks are (in no particular order): FTL, Risk of Rain, and Rodina.\n\nGameplay/Story: 9/10\nWords cannot describe it, because it's so freaking AWESOME. The only reason that it misses out on a perfect score is the fact that it's currently unfinished. The combination of listening to the awesome soundtrack while reading the incredibly emotional dialogue in the encrypted communications...beautiful.\n\nOverall: 9/10\nA beautiful work by a very talented developer, missing out on a perfect score only due to the unfinished nature of the game.

Also the interior feels kind of \"ghostly\" atm, because there are beds, toilets, blank screens/consoles but no real purpose to them.

Other than that, there's really little to no gameplay at all right now.  Fly to a planet.  Find a + sign.  Land.  Collect empty crates, empty barrels (neither of which currently seem to do anything) some missiles and a couple of pink crystals.  One will let you continue the storyline in the form of encrypted e-mails which you read, and the other will give you a data entry of some passingly interesting letters collected from the previous inhabitants, which you read.

If not, it's just not enough content for a $15 game.  Perhaps in the future it will be, and at that point I'll revise this review.  \n\nBut as it is, my rule of thumb is that I should get about $0.50 per hour play time out of a game.

The combat system can be rather tricky, but overall it's very fun.\n\nThere's also a system in place that allows you to set the speed of your own ship. You have a choice between \"Docking Speed\", \"Combat Speed\", and \"Cruising Speed\". There's another speed modifier you can find via exploration called \"Limnal Speed\" which allows you to travel at, what else? Light speed!\n\nThere's tons to do in this game as well. Including landing on planets/asteroids! When you're near a planet (with an atmosphere) you will begin atmospheric re-entry. This is a little 'minigame' in which you attempt to keep your ship at a proper angle and speed to avoid it being damaged by the heat. This heat can also spark fires in your ship, but don't worry! There's a handy fire extinguisher for you just in case.\n\nOnce you land on a planet, exiting it is very simple. Simply point up and out. However be wary of the enemies that surround the planets in this game. They're far more common on the planets themselves instead of asteroids and WILL hunt you down! \n\nThere's already tons of things to do in this game, and it's not even finished yet!

While this is entirely correct, it does little justice for this masterpiece's true nature. Few, if any, games capture the true isolation and vastness of space. The in game planets are, well, planet sized, and the distance between them feels very real. Combine this with a stellar sound track and a unique visual style, and you have a truly great enviroment.

The game is still in development and therefore not perfect. The developer is very open to the community and is extremely active on the  Rodina Subreddit; a great model for all indev games.

Doesnt make sense, considering this game is low graphics and I can run Crysis 3 at max. Unfortunately I have no means to prove this, and it happens so rarely that a quick save and reboot of the game fixes it (still kinda unweary about it though)\n\nSometimes the GUI disappears after combat/piloting ship in first person, quick save and restart fixes it.\n\nOverall: \n    I had tried the demo, instantly got hooked and played until the timer went out, purchased the game the moment I could, and have no regrets. This game is a fantastic open-world (or should I say, Open f-ing solar system) game with some serious potention added to its already fantastic gameplay physics and immersive storyline. Hope to see more in the future. \n\nIf you have doubts, don't have doubts. And if you DO have doubts, at least get the demo to test those doubts.

The game mixes amzing exploration with a brilliant, and kinda sad, story which, as someone who usually doesn't read anyhting in games, excited me and challenged me to put the pieces together. This is definitely worth buying if the idea of loadingscreen-less exploration, life sized planets, awesome story telling, and sci-fi themed games excite you. If not buy it anyways as it's quite fun to spam missiles at a group of enemy ships and watch them explode and burn.\n\nOther good things about this:\n-Retro mode! Over the age of ten? Miss retro video games? Gotta shit pc? Fear not, with retro mode you can increase the pixel size to whatever you want (within the range of 2 to 8)  which is pretty great if you use a potato as your pc.\n-The dev. Yeah, it's odd but he seems to be one of the best devs ever. Just look at the comments on the negative reviews. So if you buy it and you decide it's pretty crap but you can't get a refund of Steam, it seems the dev is happy to help. Also the things he's planning sound great, so keep up the good work.\n-The emergency open all doors button. In the middle of space? Have the burning desire to be thrown out your ship? This button's for you. Just plonk down a control panel and go on the ship tab, have fun!\n-The fix player button. It's a nice little touch if you don't roleplay and you can't find your ship. Also stops you from having to load an earlier save, which can get a bit annoying in some games.\n-The modify ship layout option. You can customize your ship to be whatever you want. Want every tile a holoscreen? Choose from 6 different tile types, including bathroom! Want a shit ton of barrels? Place items where ever you want and have as little or as much as you want. Scared of fires (and you should be)? You can put down a lotta fire extinguishers in a lotta places.\n-The demo. Yeah before I sure wether or not to buy this I played the demo a lot. Also use the demo to test wether or not it will run on your pc. It was a pretty great demo and you can continue your game in the full version from where you left of in the demo.\n-You can leave the controls whilst the ship moves. Wanna have a walk around your ship whilst on a long journey. Just press tab whilst steering your ship for it to continue on.\n-First and third person mode. Wanna see what your pilot would see? Just hit f to switch to first person mode.\n-The clutch controls are fun and they work well.\n-Great soundtrack. Really fits the feel of the game.\n\nSo yeah 9/10.

So many things to interact with that at the moment don't have a use but I'm sure will before long.  I am seriously looking forward to where this game is going and it is honestly the best 15$ I have spent in a long time! \n\nIn short.... buy this game!  Please buy this game?  Please?  I want this dev to get the support they need to reach the goals they have in mind for this game.  It is amazing and while the 15$ right now is more then worth it for the game as it is you're also getting all of the things they have planned.

Maybe that's being slightly too generous, but I guess I'm thinking in terms of direction. It's a throwback to a nostolgic art form that takes advantage of modern technology to produce something spectacular. Or at least, that's how you need to approach Rodina in order to appreciate it fairly. The truth is, anyone who is spoiled on Bioware games and the like complete with all interactions and audio feeds being fed to the player via *cough* audio may not like the fact that the storytelling in this game requires a lot of context switching from gameplay to patient reading. \n\nThat said, the lore (which, again, must be read) is surprisingly well written, it's witty and sometimes filled with sarcastic humor while at other times helps immerse the player into the backstory of this universe. And by universe I mean solar system, and by solar system I mean planets surrounding a sun that themselves are surrounded by asteroid belts. And by this I mean you can seamlessly fly around to any of these and interact with them. No cutscenes. Everything is linear. There is travel scaling (such as \"gears\") so that you don't have to sit around for hours, but you're in complete control. You can land on an asteroid (which is where the game starts) or on a planet and get out of your ship and pick up ship upgrades, ammo, and electronic debris that typically contains radio transmissions that populate this lore I've already spoken too much of.\n\nLearning how to play is apparently supposed to be part of the fun of playing. I found discovering the mappings with my Xbox 360 controller and/or tweaking them to be a slightly arduous learning process, but in the end I'm quite happy with gameplay controls. Changing gears using the controller while approaching soil by using a L-trigger + L-Joystick-Down combo is a rather scary, clunky process, but adds to the immersion, I suppose. Mapping to D-Pad up/down would be easier, but feel too arcade-ish.\n\nBetween landings, you must evade and/or fight alien sentry drones and other alien ships that are keeping a watchful eye over the planets and the loot. You're armed at first with a machine gun with infinite ammo, but as you pick up planetary loot you can equip other types of weaponry such as missiles and blaster guns. The game seems to support the Xbox 360 controller just fine, which has proven to be my favorite way to play the game, and let me just say that the space combat, while simple, is quite a blast. It's like the 1990s game Freespace, except less fluff, more action, and you can fly to planets and land and walk around, so Freespace has nothing on Rodina. \n\nThe game performs a quicksave whenever something important happens such as entering atmosphere or entering battle, which is great because I hate having to redo things that I succeeded doing before. Speaking of \"entering atmosphere\", any time you approach a planetary surface you must sit through 60 or so seconds of your craft being on fire during entry. It dramatically adds immersion. Unfortunately, there aren't nearly enough things on the planet's surface going on to make atmospheric reentry a worthwhile game \"feature\", so it does get a bit old after the 20th landing for a loot pickup. \n\nYou can walk around inside your ship, making the game feel a lot like a throwback notion of Star Trek at times, but with it being so big it feels rather lonely and non-interactive at times, since you really are all alone. There are some computer consoles you can interact with, but for the most part everything in your ship is Minecraft-style decor. There's a ship interior designer interface where you can redesign the rooms. I find all that distracting, to be honest. I'd rather more gameplay elements be added. \n\nSometimes your ship can catch on fire (as in, the engine room or your bridge). When this happens, you have three options (that I've found). 1) load a savegame, try to avoid what caused it to happen [lame .. and I'm guilty of doing this most often], 2) grab a 20th century fire extinguisher hanging from the wall and try to put it out by hand (LOL .. honestly this is kind of funny, no ceiling mount sprinklers or anything?), or 3) if you're in space, run to an operations computer console and hit the Emergency Open All Doors button to let all the oxygen out. You yourself might get sucked out into space if you do this, so position yourself where you won't. It's a cool concept. This is GREAT content, by the way, the game author is on the right track!\n\nI hope that people are buying this game and the creator(s) are building up some good cash flow to put back into the game because the help this game needs more content at this point than one person (or a small handful of people?) can do alone. That is to say, the game isn't a AAA game worth $59, but at $15 it is a wonderful way to spend an evening or two, way more interesting than a movie night at the theater.\n\nFeatures I hope get added: flora, land creatures, body of self w/ switch to 3rd person view, some more complex space situations than drones and fighters (i.e. a mothership to take out Star Wars style), more interaction with the ship's interior objects, some \"good guys\" beyond lore to join the player as A.I., and multiplayer support.\n\nThe soundtrack quality is spectacular.\n\nI'm guessing I'm only about a quarter or so into the \"story\", if you want to call it a \"story\" (again, it's a sandbox game with some lore delivery triggers as sequential radio transmission / journal pickups), but I can't help but wonder if my character is himself an android.

I've played Elite: Dangerous and spent the first hour going in and out of the options screen.  I spent the first hour of Rodina exploring asteroids and planets and engaging Xenos in combat.\n\nThat's the best part here -- no lengthy tutorials, no flight schools, just jump into your ship and go.\n\nThe physics model is good, the stellar system is huge, and so far, it's a lot of fun to explore.  I can't wait to see what the developers will add, and add they must, because there's not much to do right now.\n\nI would like to see less inertia in the physics model.  I like flying sideways and backwards, especially in combat, and I've noticed that downshifting from cruise mode to combat mode slows the ship down.  I would love it if the developers would implement zero gravity onboard the ship, but I don't expect that to happen.  Of all of science fiction, artificial gravity seems to be extremely commonplace, yet it is probably the most fictional element present.\n\nFinally, what I'd really like to see is facilities that spawn NPCs, good and bad, and the ability for NPCs to expand operations by building more facilities.

The creation of the ship is fun and you will find new ways to design and arrange things. The aliens were fun to fight and the planets were all pretty cool.\nThe problems I had were few but I will address them fully. Combat sometimes felt repetitive but the fire on the ship thing was cool. The universe felt empty was another issue I had. I liked the game and would explore more if there were caves, aliens on planet, weapons, treasure, or just something I was aiming to do. For the most part I tried to explore all the planets first but they all felt empty. Like emptier the Fallout 3, a game that is supposed to feel empty. If I could collect things and sell them at like a hub planet with a shop and missions to go and buy things and get cool quests.

If you aren't interested in actively following the evolution of Rodina, then you probably shouldn't buy this.. yet.\n\nWhat exists gameplay wise is a bit repetative. Go from place to place and pick up stuff. I feel as though I exausted the gameplay with my time spent as of this writing. (4.7hr) Story wise there is a lot I have not read, but what I did read was of real good quality and had charm. \n\nThe seamlessness combined with the vastness of the game area is pretty darn cool and has a lot of potential, as quite a few others have said. However, I don't feel like there is much of a reason to explore in this game, which is a big shame. It shouldn't be that hard or time consuming for the developer to throw in some easter eggs or collectibles here and there. (Cosmetic stuff to put in your ship?) Maybe some damage upgrades or something, or at the very least, add some variety for what is already there. \nHaving everything of interest \"marked\" for you really defeats the exploration aspect, although due to the vastness of the game space I see why this was chosen. I feel there should be a better solution somehow.\n\nThe biggest feature I'd like to see is Multiplayer support, that and/or the ability to build bases on asteroids or planets.\n\nAlso... the sun wont let you warp to escape if you get too close..

Right now in it's alpha state i would have to say that the 17 dollars i spent on it was worth every penny because of the amount of content that is already in it. The main feature of this game is that the scale of all the planets and astroids are insane because they are practically the size of real life astroids and planets and you can walk on the planets and astroids unlike elite dingus.\n\nThis game has huge potential and it would be a good idea to support an awsome, original concept like this. If you are still unsure you should try the demo because the demo is the main game without saves. That basically means you have no content restrictions in the demo but you still cannot save so it is worth it to buy the full game. The official website offers a pay-what-you-want sytem where you pay what you want for the initial game but each new update requires you to chip in a bit more money. This is also nice because it means that if you are short on money you can still play the game the way it was meant to be instead of maybe having to pirate it because you dont have 17 bucks.\n\nTL:DR Gud game", "timestamp_created": 1437136946, "timestamp_updated": 1437136946, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17086663": {"recommendationid": "17086663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198137241171", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508808078}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are looking for a great relaxing space exploration game, this is for you...

Sure Kerbal Space Program might be really complicated (and realistic?), but Rodina is a great little package for $15 that you can just pick up and play...and get addicted to. \n\nIt has all the bells and whistles you'd want in a space sandbox game: Huge planets to explore, hundreds of asteroids to find and explore, logs that act kind of like journal entries that piece together a story, space combat, and more.

Have that space exploration itch located in the most awkward spot? Well this is the closest thing you're going to find that can reach that itch.\n\nRodina is set in a single solar system Occupied by 4 life size planets, over 400 gigantic asteroids, and 15,000 tiny asteroids. All of them are teeming with loot, lore, and a hostile alien race. It is up to you to ensure that Humanity can colonize this new system safely before they arrive.\n\n In Rodina, your ship, is YOUR ship! You can set the layout of your ship however you want and furnish them as you please. Make your bedroom, bathroom, engineer room, and your bridge. There's even a Tile set made entirly of Holoscreens, which project the outside area on the walls in 3D, making it perfect for cockpits and/ or observation decks, so that you may gaze upon the stars. \n\nSpace combat takes some getting used to, but very satisfying as you unleash hell on alien fighters and watch them hurl towards the surface of the planet in a fireball of glory! \n\nSpace exploration is a tad bare bones at this time. You find a marker, destroy any hostiles gaurding it, land, grab the Datasticks (lore), Encryption Keys (story progress), and any special weapons ammo, and repeat. Although you can exit your ship, and explore the surounding terrain, theirs not much to see other than some amazing vistas on mountain tops and HUGE canyons. This is my only gripe in the game, however the Developer is very active in the community and is working on fleshing the game out.\n\nDid i also mention Mod support? Can anyone say, kestral ship mod? :P\n\nall in all, for $15 you're getting alot for whats available right now.

The vastness of space at your fingertips. The lonliness of it all. It grew on me. I hunted the data cubes for scraps of story, for clues, for hope. Those close calls with me running to my ship followed by enemy fire. I fought the 'enemy' with purpose. I fought for revenge. For fallen comrades and the future of my people. I [b]wanted[/b] to.

The combat is fast-paced, but balanced and requires a fair amount of skill.  The difficulty ramps at just the right rate and the enemies are fun to fight.  Ship layouts are fully customizable and have an accessable interface to do so.

However,[/strike] the auto-save feature is abundant [strike]and rarely have I felt my progress wasted.[/strike]\n\nWith no non-hostile NPCs, yet, it does leave me wanting.  It contributes to a lack of things to do within the game.  However, the developer has recently begun work on making the first non-hostile NPCs.\n\nI would like to see more weapon options for the ship.  As well, I would like the option to eventually set up permanent bases on the planets.

Rodina made me feel like a child, playing video games for the first time, again. The basic premise of the game is exploration. You're told you are the last survivor of an alien attack on a starship on which you were traveling. Rodina, the capital ship from which you're told you hail send you an urgent message that you need to gear up and prepare for battle, because you alone are meant to destroy the enormous alien presence in the solar system you now inhabit. As you set off from the asteroid you start on, you immediately discover that this solar system is massive. That it is home to more asteroids than you could imagine. You suddenly feel like you're truly, actually in space, in an alien solar system, far, far away from your home. The immersion factor of the cockpit mode and holoscreens make you feel like the interior of your ship and the exterior of your ship aren't disjointed anymore, like they once were before cockpit mode was introduced. You can now set your ship to cruise, get out of your pilot seat, walk around your ship, and all the while, your ship will continue flying without input, while you monitor its progression through windows (holoscreens). The very thought of it makes me giddy with excitement. The planets you discover, one by one, are each unique. Jarillo, in particular, stood out to me, because of its immense mountains, which make you feel so small when you're on its surface, though in a few short seconds you could be miles and miles above its surface, laughing down at the planet. Its things like that that make the game so wonderful, and mysterious. Rodina manages to keep you suspenseful the entire ride if you decide the pursue the story. And what a wonderful story it is. Alecja and Tavi's personal story is a heartwrencher, and you really get a feel for the other characters you get to know, not only through the encrypted communications you must decrypt, but also through the datasticks you find at every other debris field.\n\nAll in all, Rodina is a game that deserves your support. If you're a fan of space games, this is certainly a must buy. If you're a fan of exploration, Rodina has more exploration than you could imagine. If you enjoy blasting aliens, Rodina has a hefty amount of combat as well. If you enjoy a story that you must uncover yourself, and feel rewarded for doing so, then this will be a masterpiece for you, as it was for me.

But during my time in the demo and for a short while recently after i finally bought this wonderful game, there was one thing that seemed to be constant:\nNothing happened.\nAll i did was fly around a planet, looking for upgrades and more things to find about the lore of this game to keep myself intriguiged.\nThen I found a reason to truly enjoy this game.\nThis was what happened that made me love this game not long ago before posting this review\n\n---\n\nDoing buisness as usual, looking around for upgrades and such, just trying to find the indicator to appear to bring me in so i can dock and pick it up.\nFinally, i see something and fly over to it and try to dock.\nMiserably fail, and my ship takes critical damage because it hit the ground too hard, leaving it with under 20% hull integrity, with a fire starting.\nQuickly, I land the ship, grab the fire extinguisher and take care of the fire.\nSomething wasn't right though, the ship wasn't repairing itself.\nCurious, i make my way back to the captain's chair to pilot the ship.\nRight before i start to pilot, a Red warning began to flash infront of me: \"WARNING: MISSILE LOCK\"\nOh Fuck.\nPanicking like fuck now, and boosting away as quickly as possible, and then turning around to see what I'm up against.\nFour enemy ships, the first time ive been up against more than 1.\nUnder 20% health, outnumbered, and most likely outgunned, Chances were most likely not in my favor.\nStill, i give it my best shot, boosting back towards one enemy ship, slowing down before blasting it to pieces, and then boosting off as another missile lock appears.\nAs i repeat the same process with each ship, in the end I emerged victorious, and quite proud with myself, with four burning ships litter the ground.\nTime to see what was in store for me.\nAs it turns out, one of the things i was trying to pick up before i was rudely interrupted, was the upgrade i was looking for, a heating upgrade so i could go explore the ice planet. Exactly what i needed to progress.\n\nAgain, for a time when i reach the ice planet there was period of time where not much happened.\nFound three areas with data sticks that uncover more of the backstory, but only signals of enemies that were too far out.\nThen, my opportunity comes, after hunting down another upgrade, i find a site where one might be located, as i approach, enemy contacts appear, a metric shit ton of ships converge ontop the site.\nIts that time again.\nWanting another fight like i did not too long ago, i rush to the enemies, as i get close, they do exactly what I imagined they would; scatter and then swarm me.\nGood thing the primary weapon in this game spreads like crazy. Even though there were much more ships than last time, I make short work of them while sustaining a fair amount of damage, as it appears they lacked the ability to use missiles, unlike the ones before. But even after winning the fight, the battle music is still playing and my hull isn't repairing, Naturally, i looked up to figure out why. A new group was coming in.\nKnowing if i tried to fight them directly, i wouldn't stand a chance, i run off a little, and then come back to destroy a few of the ships, this hit and run tactic was for the most part, effective.\nAfter a few, quick hit and runs I'm once again, victorous, and with a lot of burning ships on the frozen ground.\nOnce more, the music did not stop. Just a little above my position, a third group was coming in, thinking this would be the same as before, I made the same attempt to fight them, one thing was off however, these ships could use missiles. And one ship in particular looked different, and hell had a different trail than the other ships, the others had green trails, this one had a pink trail. It didn't take long to realize this ship could be special when i saw a barrage of missiles come flying at me, and then quickly kill me.\nIt was time to get creative, and then die. A lot.\nAnd that I did.\nAfter dying multiple times, i get the idea that if im always behind this special ship, it cant pummel me with its own missiles. So, i try it.\nAnd it worked, after this thing was finally destroyed, I turned my attention to the other ships that were with it, and made short work of them.\nThe battle music finally ends, and my ships starts to repair.\nIt had finally ended.\nAnd it was well worth it.\n\n---\n\nThats pretty much my experience with this game so far, and has quickly become a space sim game i truly enjoy.\nIf you have the money to do so, i'd say go buy this game. If you dont, try the demo.

The graphics are a bit primitive at this stage, but I've been waiting too long for a space RPG where you can fly from one world to another, get out and take in the view, and perhaps fight a few aliens along the way.  The exploration aspect is what I've been waiting for.  I'm a huge fan of Orbiter and Kerbal Space Program, so I like more realistic space sims than the overwhelming majority of space games that consist of a few three dimensional sectors with an atmospheric-style arcade flight model.  My dream game would be the Orbiter flight model set in a Space Engine-like procedural universe (along with SE's graphics) with a first-person MMU mode and no FTL.  Instead, I would favor a game that uses a futuristic energy source like antimatter or a black hole reactor to accelerate at 1 G until Lorentz factors are great enough that the on-board passenger could make it to the destination in a timely manner (due to time dilation on board, hundreds of years could pass outside the ship but only a few years inside the ship - in addition, space ahead of the ship would contract).  In-game time acceleration or a hibernation mode could skip much of the travel at these great speeds for the player.  I realize that for the majority of players, this would be extremely boring, but Rodina is a good step in the direction I prefer.  The flight model isn't as realistic as Orbiter, but because it is completely open I feel that it is a nice compromise between the requirements of a fun game and the immersion I require to feel I'm exploring space.  What I feel would really make my 'dream game' described above fun, despite its disadvantages, is a great story.  And, wow, Rodina has an amazing story.  I can't wait to play it through to the final conclusion.  The current form of the game ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, but what an amazing twist at the end!  I hope future editions of the game allow the player explore another star system.\n\nOverall, I would say this game is fantastic.  Can't wait to see the completed masterpiece.  Beyond being a fun game, it's just a really good science fiction story.", "timestamp_created": 1428000647, "timestamp_updated": 1428001028, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15120338": {"recommendationid": "15120338", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048109191", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2090, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510972842}, "language": "english", "review": "I will absolutely say yes and back this developer. The story is great, reminding me a bit of homeworld.  This game has you taking place as a lone fighter pilot in an attempt to surive in a solar system full of alien ships that are trying to hunt you down and any other survivors of a massive ship crash. Coming with that means you must find ammo, scavenge for upgrades and weapons to your ship. You must also pick your fights and be wise about engagements, even on low difficulties, the enemies can travel in groups from 2-6 as you see in the video. Combat takes skill and you must save up your ammunition types for big enemies like the missile firing blimps. Fighting those things are hard as hell but when you destroy it listening to an absolutely fantastic soundtrack, you will feel pretty happy of your new accomplishment. Rodina's soundtrack ranges from calming exploration music, to the exact right tone of combat music for fighting and is done so well. I kept imagining my pilot looking at the viewscreen, sweating and shaking with fear, with a fire indicator going off as he keeps his hand clenched around the joystick, pulling the trigger in a bitter battle against the aliens in a fight for survival while listening to the soundtrack. If music can put detailed images like this did in my head, I would consider it a great work of art. The graphics on the ships are dated, but you will get past this as you start exploring, fighting, and finding bits and pieces on the planets. The planets are HUGE and they arnt kidding when they mean full-scale. The solar system and planets are absolutely vast places. PLanets have an atmosphere, which means re-entry. Good luck not burning your ship to bits in your first time re-entering an atmosphere :). Planets also have a day-night cycle, i never thought that sunset and dawn would look so cool on a planet. Basically, planets feel like actual planets, however they are very desolate at this time in development with not a lot of stuff on them besides differing natural features. The Ice planet Morena has deep cuts in its crust just like Europa in our solar system. Veles has a highly hot and an acidic atmosphere just like Venus. Jarilo is the temperate and desert planet in the solar system just right for life to exist on it so it is comparable to Earth (besides the desert part). I cant give a comparison for Perun yet. People also complain that this game has no updates. This is completely false and here is my proof from https://elliptic-games.com/ Cockpit Mode on Beta Branch!\n\nMarch 22, 2015 \n\n\n\nCockpitMode\n\n\nCockpit mode is now available on the beta branch on Steam! To try it out:\n\n* Switch to the beta (or dev) branch\n * Either start a new game, or load the new default interior so that you get some Holoscreens in your cockpit. You can also add Holoscreens, or the new Holoscreen tileset, if you want to keep your current interior.\n * Sit in the Pilot\u2019s Chair by just walking into it\n * While flying the ship, press \u201cF\u201d (for \u201cActivate\u201d) to bring up the pilot menu, and choose \u201cToggle 1st/3rd Person\u201d\n\nNow you\u2019re flying in 1st person mode!\n\nWarning!\n\nCockpit mode is for Rodina experts only. You think atmospheric entry and combat were hard before? Now they are even tougher!\n\nAlso:\n\nThis is build 1.1.6 and it comes with some caveats: this particular build is not going to come out of beta! There are a few reasons for this:\n\n* Cockpit mode introduces some pretty big performance issues. It may not be playable on your machine!\n * MSAA anti-aliasing is still turned off\n\nI\u2019m going to be out of town for a little over a week, but after I get back I\u2019ll fix any bugs you guys find, and start on an optimization pass and put anti-aliasing back in, before fully releasing this build!\n\nAt the time of this review, that was 7 days ago, the developer is working as hard as he can on one thing at a time. He spent the entire month of March during this year to make the first person fighter mode (which i will add looks amazing). He also wants to add ship boarding, interactive NPC's, More Robots, and so much more. And the icing on this cake is finally the ability to mod this game. People are literally able to make their own planets and i have seen them before. Spend a little time on the game's discussion page. Some person has made his ship look like a damn X-Wing from Star Wars. You can make your ship look absolutely any way you want to with the help of a modding tool. Because this game has so much potential and this one passionate developer is hardworking and trustworthy, i put out $15 to support this game. The product I was presented with in my opinion was spectacular and fun. If you arnt going to buy this, i highly suggest that you observe this game and watch the development process. For people that arnt buying it now, you should buy it later when all these features are added. If you are going to buy it, what can i say, Have fun!!!!!

Obviously the game has very little to offer in terms of content at this point - the whole fun being in taking off and entering a planet's atmosphere to grab resources. You will mostly fight if you engage enemies yourself, but at this point enemies aren't influential or dependant on the game's content.\n\nHere are some suggestions to the developer to *improve this demo specifically* (I'm sure you have a lot of ideas for the final game, but you should get this jewel to a point where hype builds up faster) - He has done a great job so far with this, but I juust want to provide my humble ideas to help market this game faster, because I know it can become great.  If you just improve this demo 20% more,  people will experience more out of the game and they'll share the joy more (as well as download it more).\n\n\na) Radio signals / story: WAY too much to read. While I'm sure the story can be insteresting, you should provide smaller (yet more frequent) pieces of information - especially for the purpose of this demo, so the playing can last longer. I would also suggest dropping the colors in text and removing the \"computer OS' entries, I felt it kept me away from wanting to read. The first text I actually read was towards the end (the wife and husband part).\n\nb) I would suggest equipping the ship with a resource scanner (beeps faster as you move closer), then letting the player find the packages him/herself instead of the crossmarks.\n\nc) Picking up encrypted pieces of data: Add more. Maybe let the player \"piece together\" encrypted data on one same planet to construct the final message?\n\nd) Empty crates: Kinda useless, remove - replace with encrypted data (see above)\n\ne) Enemies: Destroyed enemies should jettison cargo, missiles or other elements that the player ship can \"scoop\" manually by exiting the ship while in space. Makes for some stressful action :)\n\nf) Enemies: Maybe some enemies should hunt down the player entering a planet's atmosphere to make for more space combat. Right now they're kinda pointless.\n\ng) Music: Nice job overall - maybe music on Veles is a bit aggressive while nothing is going on. \n\n\nI have a lot more ideas, but I guess that's it for now.

[/url]  [/b]\n\nI myself am an avid player of immersive space simulators, and Rodina is a simple, yet brilliant addition to my much beloved genre. Rodina is already full of great features, and has excellent potential in terms of the endless possibilities for the modding side of it. Even though Rodina consists of only one system, it has the potential to habitat so much inside of it.\n\nThe flight and combat in the game is very enjoyable. The movement is all inertia based, and the weapons look and feel amazing. Shooting down enemies high and the atmosphere, and watching them fall out of view, knowing that you could fly all the way down there and find some wondrous mountain range where the ship crashes, makes the game feel extremely grand. \n\nIts story is basic at first, but I suspect it will later develop, which gives purpose to exploring and fighting the large amounts of enemies. The feeling of flying straight out of space and onto a planets surface, while dealing with the fear of burning up in the atmosphere build so much tension and requires focus, particularly on the higher difficulties. Once you are on the surface, and have fought off any enemies in the area, you can land and walk around your ship and the planet, you can even edit the layout of your ship. You can see some great sights exploring on the surface of planets, though, in its current state the surface of a planet/asteroid/planetoid gets a bit repetitive after a while. \n\nAs with most immersive space games, watching the day start, go by, and end on an alien planet is something that gets most immersive space game fans worked up (and anyone who enjoys something beautiful), what makes it even better is knowing that you can go do it all again on another planet.\n\nThis game is already a great experience, for a very low price, even if a short lived one.

Before you click the buy button you should know that while they certainly share aspects, they are different games and the world generated by this game will never be as rich as NMS is going for \u2013 but that\u2019s ok because it works for this game.  The sparsity of the game actually adds to the game.\n\nOn its own, this is certainly a great entry in the procedural-world space games. This game stands by itself and what the small development team has done is impressive. \n\nGame play is fun - Combat, exploration, and atmospheric entry. Combat and exploration can arguably be simplistic overall but I think they have a great balance on the atmospheric entry mechanic. \n\nBear in mind that this is an alpha listed game (although if development stopped now, I\u2019d be happy with my purchase.)  More is planned according to the website.  Looking at the other side of the asteroid (heh), the simplistic gameplay makes the game very accessible and easy to play. It\u2019s a good intro to combat space-craft mechanics given the \u201cget in and fly\u201d mentality. \n\nThe controls do take getting used to \u2013 mainly because it\u2019s not a plane \u2013 there is no up, no down.

You can discover astroids and find abandoned treasure such as missile's and lost info, You can run into enemy ships and take them down. You can visit planets and conquor all the enemies lurking there, build your own massive spaceship, or just fly around space, on a massic scale.\n\n(Pros)\n+Easy to learn controls\n+A massive amount of things to discover, such as astroids or even planets.\n+The Soundtrack. It is AMAZING. OH MY GOD IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DYNAMIC ORCHESTRA SOUNDTRACK THAT I LOVE.\n+Runs smoothly on most windows\n+Combat is easy to learn and enjoyable\n+The sheer size of the galaxy. Astroids are small, have little treasures on them, but there are THOUSANDS on them. Seriously, you could count. While there being a small amount of planets, they are HUGE. GIGANTIC. Massive mountains to fly over, tons of treasure to discover, enemies to fight, and the scale of these planets could be considered THE SIZE OF EARTH. Not joking, yet not guranteed.\n+No loading screens.\n+The ability to fully customize and build your own ship.\n+Many more things I personally enjoy, like entering the atmosphere of planets, and the enjoyable feeling of the combat.\n\nI could go on about the pros, but lets not waste to much time.\n\n(Cons)\n-Limited space to build spaceships, you can't have them go on forever.\n-Missiles are unable to counter, which I can understand, this game is still in alpha, and will probably have alot more things added.\n-Enemies have extraordinary accuracy. While not dealing to much damage, they land almost every hit, but this could just be considered adding to the difficulty.\n\nYou could say I lack some cons only because I am trying to defend the game, but that's not true.

The enemy ships in Rodina start out small, like a couple of fast, low-firepower ships. As you progress through the game, you have to fight larger, more powerful ships, and usually a different strategy is required. I would describe the combat itself as a spacecraft dogfight. The main weapon is a machine gun-like weapon with an enormous spread. At first it seemed unappealing, but I grew to love it with use, and so will you. The game has four (so far) different secondary weapons, and the player may only select which secondary weapon to choose while inside the ship, using its operations computer. This forces the player to choose the secondary weapon outside of combat, which means you must plan your battles.\n\nI could go on and on about the gameplay and never get tired of talking about it. Rodina has many interesting features and challenges to keep the game interesting. For example, if your ship takes enough damage, you may have to leave the controls to fight a fire inside your ship with a fire extinguisher, or else slowly lose health until your ship explodes. Also, when entering a planet's atmosphere, the player must control the ships speed so that it doesn't differentiate into the atmosphere. Also, the controls become unstable during this, adding to the challenge.\n\nAnother fantastic feature of the game is that it is, of course, completely seamless. Even in hyperdrive mode, as you cross an entire galaxy, the only discomfort you will encounter is a tiny drop in fps.\n\nThis game is amazing. Sure, some things can be improved and added (most of the walking around, planet surface walking, player weapons like guns), but there is plenty of room for more features. Personally, I'm excited to see the next chapter of the Rodina story. Do yourself a favor and get the game, it's a great experience and you will follow the development of a fantastic game with a riveting story.", "timestamp_created": 1418885752, "timestamp_updated": 1418885752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.677478", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13412943": {"recommendationid": "13412943", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001418172", "num_games_owned": 289, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 478, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434556792}, "language": "english", "review": "It's cool.

For those who are not interested in reading on, I can tell you now that Rodina holds up as one of my best gaming experiences of 2014.\n\nTo begin with I'll address the topic of Early Access: Rodina stands out as one of the more robust offerings from the alpha pile currently on Steam. The major mechanics are all solid and the one or two bugs I have encountered have not upset my experience. Furthermore, Rodina offers a freeroaming play style for those of you who would prefer to save the story beats for a more feature complete version of the game.\n\nIn game, Rodina offers players a space exploration sim with jaw-dropping world design, customisable ship interiors, collectables, combat and an impeccable musical score. The almost seemless transition from planet surface to ship interior to piloting out of the atmosphere is key to the immersive experience and this will only be enhanced in subsequent updates with the inclusion of cockpit piloting mode. \n\nKeyboard controls are on the whole functional, however playing with an XBox 360 controller feels far more intuitive and the developer has eluded to this being the standard input for play-testing. Graphically Rodina looks very pretty, particularly when you dive down into the atmosphere of the vast planets, however this is countered by far more blocky animations as seen during ship fires or firing up the limnal drive. Strangely, this juxtaposition seems to work well for Rodina, although Elliptic has suggested that these graphics are merely place-holder at this time.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Rodina has a solar system which rewards exploration. At the hundreds (perhaps thousands) of 'sites of interest' dotted around planets and asteroids you will find weaponry top-ups as well as memory sticks which serve to flesh out the world around you. These breadcrumbs are welcome reward for stealthing or fighting your way past enemy vessels, the latter of which proves to be the most challenging aspect of the game.\n\nAll told, the current version of Rodina offers a beautiful world for players to delve into. While item collection and ship-to-ship combat present more traditional gameplay hooks, I have found myself enjoying this title more for it's zen-garden qualities. Watching the blazing red-sun rise over the ice-canyons on Morena while stood next to your personal space ship is superbly cool. \n\nThe developer, Brendan Anthony, is actively engaged with the community and has excellent calibre in his previous body of work. Impending updates will inevitably increase the variety and functionality to Rodina, however the game in it's current state is already well worth your time and money.

In terms of gameplay it's somewhat simple - so far there's only fighting other ships, entering atmospheres and finding loot to occupy you, BUT it makes up for the lack of quantity with quality:\n-The dog-fighting is fun, and you can find ammo for new weapons as loot. Some of the enemies are incredibly strong compared to your little ship, so you have to learn to fight them which is something I love (and watching balls of flame fall to the planet surface after a battle in orbit is one of the most satisfying things I've seen in ANY game)\n-Flying in itself is actually a pretty fun experience too: you get different 'gears' that you shift between - basically different speeds. Super slow Docking, nippy Combat, speedy Cruising, and then the cross-the-solar-system-in-seconds Limnal Drive, the game's warp drive (also incredibly satisying to fly in)\n-Entering atmosphere is something you have to do to get to the best loot sites on the planets, and it's actually pretty realistic. Not too hard, and you can always make it easier in the settings\n\nOne of the nicest things in Rodina is the simplicity of the graphics - the pixelly fire and smoke of fallen foes is surprisingly nice looking, and the Limnal Drive warp too - and the basic models of the ships are fooling; they're pretty lethal, and it's one hell of an empowering experience to land next to a downed battleship and realise your petty gunship is basically a speck of dust in comparison. Trust me, the dev pulled off the ship designs really nicely\n\nAnd finally, the best part of the game in my opinion: story. In it's Early Access state it's wonderful already. The backstory is immense - the dev has clearly worked for hours just typing it all up, let alone creating it. At every loot site along with empty containers and ammo is a data-stick, each of which gives you a little article of backstory; things taken from books, reports, meetings, communications etc. which sheds a little light on the Rodina universe - the history, people's stories etc. It's so well thought up. \nAnd of course there's the actual story. I was skeptical at first, since this is an indie game and in my experience inde game stories are simple or odd. This is not the case. AT. ALL. The story is good, maybe not the greatest in the world but above average at the least. It actually got me with a plot twist, which was a refreshing change. The story is seriously just... it's worth getting Rodina just for the story.\n\nIn conclusion (tl;dr): Rodina is really good already. Short and slightly empty feeling, but what's already here is a really good quality, especially the story. I played the demo 4 times and and have finished the game thus far, and I seriously reccomend it. Despite the Early Access the game runs well (it's only crashed once in my experience at the main menu, and autosaves so much that I wouldn't be that upset if it crashed in game).

Even just racing through the massive, deep and extraordinary 'cracks' in the service of the ice planet is fun, but Rodina is not perfect.\n\nThe story is told through text, which may put some people off, but for me it seems to get the main story line across and some how create a immersive lore.\nOn the other hand, the story isn't really present in the gameplay. The story makes out that there is news stations and various interesting characters... when really you get to see none of them. In this sense the gameplay can seem quite removed from the story; The enemy you fight is faceless (they could be anything for all it tells you) and seem to be the part with very little lore apart from 'they are bad' (however this does create mystery).\n\nThe gameplay is very fun; it is the reason why i have put so many hours into Rodina and i will put in many more i am sure.\nThe ship flying is quite easy to grasp; there is 4 different speeds which your ship can fly at, each seeming to be a lot more faster than the one before. Finding these speeds and using them is rather a shock as they go so fast, but in a great way. The speed of the ship adds to the scale and it is mindblowing when you go down a speed on a planet and realise just how fast you are going and how big the planet is.\nYou can get out of your custom built ship to explore asteroids and planets; there are resources on these planets/asteroids that you can collect, which seems to be the main goal of the game. The character outside the spaceship seems to move very fast and sometimes it can be difficult to pick up resources. I feel there needs to be a way to make the character slower.\nThe combat is so very excellent and the weapons each different from the last, at the moment they do seem a bit limited but certainly do suffice to destroy the various enemy types and make me go \"Wow! That is so awesome\". There is many enemy types each with different weapons or a combination of weapons and the enemy's certainly put up a fight. Each can be fought with different tactics; the game leaves it up to the player entirely what weapons they wish to use and how they want to fight an enemy, or if they want to fight an enemy at all. One could argue that the later more stronger enemys may be 'bullet sponges', as the saying goes, and take alot of repetitive action and time to fight.

True immersion. A true universe. A few games have tried this, a few have even pulled it off on the technical side, but those games (*cough* X Rebirth *cough*) have never delivered on the actual game side of things.\n\nRodina does a lot of things right, and only seems to lack in areas that are understandable considering the entire staff behind the game is one person. The game, even at its very early access stage feels nearly complete. The ship feels functional and every individual component doesn't just feel like a prop, they feel like they are there for a reason, because most of the time they are. Flight feels fairly realistic and very intutive. Atmospheric reentry is as challenging as it should be, and combat is challenging on a whole new level. To be able to escape from a firefight by going into Limnal (warp) drive and flying hundreds of AU away in seconds feels amazing and freeing, and the game really gives you an appreciation for the sheer scale that it offers. Even from the very moment I pressed the play button, I was already blown away. Rodina makes no effort to slowly introduce you to the universe you're put in. You simply are. And that is how it should be. Rodina makes no effort to tell you where you should be going and what you should be collecting. You simply do. And that is how it should be. Rodina simply allows the player to play, only guiding the player's progression through an entirely optional series of backstories all unravelling at the same time, and all very well written.\n\nRodina offers so much content in such an infentile stage, from custom ship designs to an intricate background story to ship upgrades to an entire asteroid belt comprised of hundreds of bodies to land on and explore, you will not find yourself bored any time soon. There is always more to discover and do, and even while the planets are currently baren bodies populated with nothing but enemies and loot, the universe feels populated, and just as the empty void of space has you feeling truly alone, you'll encounter something that has you feeling otherwise.\n\nDo yourself a favor and download the demo. Because of the games completely dynamic nature, there is no scripted cutoff point in the demo, simply play and experience as much as you can for an hour, and if you enjoy what you've experienced, buy the game.

The framerate gets really choppy when trying to load new enemies or regions, so that could be optimized.  I'd suggest initializing the load sooner and making sure the framerate doesn't drop under 60 FPS while loading.  The programmer art in this game is out of hand, also the user interface feels too quiet and spends too long on some text effects, particularly at the beginning of the game when choosing a name.  I would suggest animating actual visuals more than text, and having sound effects alongside those animations.  This game could really benefit from some modifications that would allow for multiplayer.  Ship layout customization feels empty, as it seems most of the objects available have no purpose.  Planetary exploration still feels kind of drifty, mostly due to a lack of view bobbing and footstep sounds.  I never feel like I'm really on another planet, just another moon.  Feels fine on asteroids and small objects, but planets should feel more solid.  Planetary entry feels unnecessarily difficult.  For the love of gosh please add some distance numbers onto the navigation icons, not having those makes the Limna drive feel crazy unwieldy, I never know when I should come out of warp.  I think the player should be able to let go of the controls whenever they want, it doesn't make sense that I have to land before I can put out a fire on my ship.  On that note, a cruise control would be great, and specifically one that can stay on even when I'm away from the controls.  Fires spread so fast that even when going at it with 2 or 3 fire extinguishers I have no hope of being able to put one out.  Some type of prologue showing the destruction of the vanguard would be cool.  A basic controls and abilities tutorial would have helped me out a lot in the early game.  Also for the demo version I'd recommend at least allowing players to load auto saves for the character they are currently playing, I had to scrap a save in the demo version because my ship was on fire and my game decided to save when the ship was at 5 hp, so there was no possible way for me to recover that ship.  It would also be nice to at some point encounter AI controlled allies, and also some of the more important dialogs should have voiceovers, so that you don't feel quite so alone in the universe despite having all this communication you're reading and reviewing.  Please make the player ship model have more than 12 polygons.  It's really ugly.  Great game though!  I love the concept and have been having a lot of fun with it.

It doesn't feel like Freelancer or EVE or any other space game, it prioritizes momentum and special weapons. It seems to hinge on the \"stickshift\" mechanic, which works excellent with the flow of the combat/navigation, and ties everything together well. The places you visit are varied enough, but will definitely feel flat and boring after a few hours of seeing the same crevasses, blank textures, and lack of surface features save for a heightmap.\n\nBuilding your ship is also rewarding. After I realized that the ship was definitely bigger on the inside than it was on the outside, I decided to fix that. I'd spent too much time getting lost in the default ship anyway. In about five minutes I had a sleek interior that was sized approximately to the actual size of the ship, and looked fine. Maybe a bit bland, but the editor controls are decent enough. I could recognize some amateur tile-and-entity selection/manipulation mechanics, but with a little ironing out I'm sure it'll be fine.\n\nThat makes the game sound pretty lame, I know. It's early access, and seems to be progressing apace. But what really sold me was the story.\n\nLook, I'm not one to hype up story-games, especially not when it's done in a \"find game item, read blurb, find game item, read blurb\" format like this. But my mild interest in the story turned to appreciation near the end (no spoilers), which tied together the reason you (the player) existed, why you were different, and what was going on. Very rarely do I feel like a story explains why the player acts how he does (players are crazy, we don't act at all like normal people in the real world), or why he knows nothing about the universe that everyone else has been living in. Rodina explained all of that beautifully with one single twist, and I'll recommend the game if for no other reason than to encourage someone to have that \"whoa, cool!\" moment that I did\n\nMy biggest gripe is that the re-entry mechanics are a little frustrating, and seem to take too much time with you just spinning around in place. In cruise mode in space, you can orbit any planet in under a minute, why does re-entry take so much fkn time? Why is my cruise velocity so low once I'm in atmo? I get that spaceflight would really be like this (especially in denser atmospheres), but game mechanics need to serve the game, not reality. If it wastes my time and makes me feel tied down, it shouldn't be in a free-roaming game.", "timestamp_created": 1408596389, "timestamp_updated": 1408596389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11801555": {"recommendationid": "11801555", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991412153", "num_games_owned": 924, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495951528}, "language": "english", "review": "MIssion accomplished!

It feels like this beautiful mixture of Mass Effect, FTL, Metroid, and a hint of Fable: TLC. But even with this mixture it still feels so unique and wonderful and sets this great tone for the game (my only complaint is a bug during ship customisation that stops the music from constantly playing, I just opened up youtube for the 2 hours I spent in the customisation before buying the music on steam before I went to bed.\n\nGo grab the demo, it's a 1 hour trial of the full game.

I think this comes from the total freedom of movement and how you interact with everything.\nFor starters, I've never played a game that allows for this level of interior design, truly making a ship your own not only in feel but also gameplay.\n\nYou can go from walking on a planet to navigating your way to the toilet block on your ship to sitting in the cockpit (now in complete first person). But it doesn't stop there because you can start to fly your ship, get out of the seat, get a drink, then come back and take the wheel again but have it still moving at the same time.\n\nIt has that elderscroll level of choice where you are given a bunch of mechanics then told to have fun, and a story to hold your hand if you so choose.

The planets and asteroids seem small and undetailed, until you land on them and see how freaking huge some of them can be.  Then you can take off and land somewhere where the landscape is completely different.  \n\nThe biggest selling point, however, is exploring the star system and finding more lore about the universe.

Now Rodina's gameplay is stellar - don't get me wrong - but nobody seemed to point out the story in Rodina. You might not have even known it had one. That's why I'm here.\n\nThe story in Rodina is set up a little differently than most other games, being that instead of playing through a chronological chain of events, you discover pieces of it at a time. The pieces you collect are written, and I have to say, the people behind Rodina are certainly no strangers to writing. The remnants and transmissions you obtain detailing Rodina's story succeed in inducing a strange twinge of awe inside you, along with the bizarre growing apprehension of the larger scheme of things at work.\n\nThere are two kinds of story elements I suppose: the Encrypted Transmissions, and the Archive Remnants (just what I've chosen to call them). The Transmissions are unlocked procedurally, and give you more and more info on the situation the Rodina's 'Vanguard' faced (roughly) years ago. They are witty, somewhat humorous, and make for great reading. The Archive Remnants are other 'Datasticks' you collect and add to your Archive, which describe various scenarios or bits of culture pertaining to the world and life on the Rodina. Some are single pages, while others are in pieces of four or five, and the latter usually tells its own mini story as well.\n\nFinally getting that last encryption and discovering the truth behind the Rodina and the Vanguard made something click in my head; you could say it confirmed my suspicions. To put it modestly, it felt wierd. Really wierd. The writing, and the way the story is told, coupled with the expansive solar system and seamless world Rodina had created gave me goosebumps. And let me tell you something.\n\nI live in Minnesota.\nI don't get goosebumps easily.\n\n\n[EDIT] Quick developer note: Turns out the writing is done by Andrew Schurr, a friend of the Brendan Anthony (the developer)!

As a freform space exploration game Rodina doesn't really hold your hand or tell you what to do, and if you need that in a game you'll feel yourself wanting here.  However if this just your thing then you won't be disappointed.  \n\nRodina strives not to be a sterile simulation and does have a neat underlying story that is worth the discovery and it really tries to immerse you into it.  On top of that being able to walk about your ship and look around and if landed go outside onto whatever terrestrial body you happen to be on simply adds to the immersion.  Granted the terrestrial bodies are pretty barren the scale of it can be bit breathtaking at times.  Look and feel asside you feel as though you have been dropped into the midst of some mysterious event and are compelled to find out what happened while at the same time trying to simply survive.\n\nPersonally I think it is the little things that make the difference and make for interesting events as you play like getting into a fire fight and the alarm going off stating that there is a fire aboard your ship as the enemy hits you just right.  I found myself having to evade the enemy first and jump away to safety before I even get up and deal with the fire on an already damaged ship.  Scrambling about trying to remember where the fire extinguishers were and then frantically spraying the fires while watching the health of my ship deteriorate with me in it makes for a tense moments as you finally put out the last of the flames and your ships health is down to 8% [i](Maybe someday we'll get the option to vent the atmosphere in the ship with consequences in and of itself instead of just extinguishers or other upgrades like a fire surpression system)[/i]\n\nI digress I recommend this game to anyone whom likes to drift about in space, and explore a solar system, while getting into the occasional firefight and maybe become part of an interesting story and make up stories of your own.", "timestamp_created": 1408258480, "timestamp_updated": 1408258480, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11745792": {"recommendationid": "11745792", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054303125", "num_games_owned": 585, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1466, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504411114}, "language": "english", "review": "I am seriously in love with this game, a bit sad that I \"beat\" the game so far but still I really enjoy it and cant wait to see what becomes of this game.

A few games have tried this (mostly unsuccessfully), but right off the bat, Rodina pulls it off beautifully. Entering an atmosphere is intense, and you really get a sense of a given planet's scale as you're hurtling towards it as a fireball. Managed to land successfully on my first go, which says something for the intuitiveness of the controls!\n\nNot interested in being a meteorite? There's space combat! Yep, good old shooty fun, right in your own personal ship. Since movement/phsyics appear to be mostly Newtonian, it's less like flying a fighter plane, and a bit more like playing 3D Asteroids. I can tell you that's a lot more fun than it sounds in text: my usual tactic is to cruise-drive up to a group of enemies, spray them in the face, then zip off a few thousand meters in a random direction before their shots land. Tricky, yes. Possible to crash doing this? Oh yes. Very exhilarating!\n\nWhat's that? Don't like being stuck seeing the outside of the ship only? Then wander around in the inside of it! Check out the furniture, play with the knobs, pull the levers, all that good stuff. From start to finish, it's pretty immersive, especially for an early access game. Whether you're checking your radio, messing with your bed, or putting out a massive fire, first-person in the ship just feels right, not unlike seeing FTL from a personal perspective.\n\nFrom a development perspective, Rodina reminds me of how Minecraft was in 2011: loads of fun, and just waiting to be packed with new goodies over time. The upside to this, of course, is players will be able to say exactly what they hope to see, and good ideas might end up put in by Elliptic Games. Given the sheer number of games touting themselves as \"early access\", yet being little more than a proof-of-concept that makes little progress over a year or more, it's refreshing to see a game out there that doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. Devs aren't calling it complete, but they also haven't put up the equivalent of a semi-interactive demo, like many other early access games do. There is quite a bit in here to keep you busy, and given the ambitious nature of the game, I expect we'll see much, much more.\n\ntldr: If you love space games, buy this. If you want to fly around and shoot things in space, buy this. If you want to see what is, to me, one of the more impressive space-to-atmosphere landing mechanics systems, buy this.

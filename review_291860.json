Playing with your friends and making jokes seems to be the spirit of this game.\nthat being said, single player is still very engaging for those worried that the campaign would be too dry without co-op.\n\nIf you are new to Behemoth games, now is just as good of a time as any to jump right in to Pit People.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516043573, "timestamp_updated": 1516043573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39370290": {"recommendationid": "39370290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996106117", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 678, "last_played": 1516134078}, "language": "english", "review": "Insanly funny game!", "timestamp_created": 1516038105, "timestamp_updated": 1516038105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39350363": {"recommendationid": "39350363", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028550968", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 736, "last_played": 1516138759}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely brilliant!", "timestamp_created": 1515967099, "timestamp_updated": 1515967099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39337921": {"recommendationid": "39337921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351538210", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 46, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514689896}, "language": "spanish", "review": "la wea wena", "timestamp_created": 1515935536, "timestamp_updated": 1515935536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39337239": {"recommendationid": "39337239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198153663387", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513005646}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is sooo good just get it now!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1515933728, "timestamp_updated": 1515933728, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39331762": {"recommendationid": "39331762", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078480303", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514511843}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked Castle Crashers, get this.

This is definitely your go to game if you are looking for something to quench your thirst for dark humor, sarcasm, and the absurd. Even though in terms of game play all it has to offer ultimately is repetitive fast paced role play, the kind that you would eventually try as hard as you can to avoid (If you've played games like final fantasy IX, you will know what I am talking about) what it lacks in game play depth or story depth it makes up for in the ingeniously hilarious sense of humor and diversity of collectable items, that again, are well thought of to come off as unexpected, absurd, and greatly reflective of the wit of the game creators. It keeps you playing because you want to experience more of its humor and you are left wondering where the game will take you, because anything goes and anything can happen. If you are into products like rick and morty YOU WILL ENJOY THIS. If, like me, you have enjoyed previous games by Behemoth, especially for their fun, cute and funny art style and witty sense of humor you will enjoy this because it is an upgrade of both.

(Healer, buffer, saboteur, dps, etc)\n-You get to pick the equipment of the Humans/Demi-clops/Cyclops so you can customize the role they play to your liking\n-Tons of cosmetic choices make your team actually feel like YOUR team.\n-Some characters can be found with rare text animations and colors for their name.\n-No options to rename characters making the hunt for character names you like yet another thing to hunt for.\n\nDislikes\n-Some races of creatures (Zombies, Gnomes and Kobolds) come in pairs. Currently there isn't a way to trade members of those pairs with the same creatures. For instance, lets say you have a Zombie pair - Hearts(in special red text)/Peanut. If you wanted to switch \"Hearts\" into another zombie pair, you can't.\n-There are tons of equipment but very few of them have elemental properties.\n-There's a gold cap of 19,999",

things from other games come into action into this one.\nAs the storyline for the first two missons were amazing and funny also in the way.\nThis game is not also easy but also its not hard at the same time.\nPlay with someone with the split-screen opition or MP in a Duel.\nDiscover many types of gear and get about I guess maybe 12 new races never really counted, but thats quite a lot.\nI'm just waiting for more content and the main story to be released so far.\n\nPros: Art\n         Game play content\n         Funny\n         Many types of gear and again content for many races.\n

visiting family. in the evenings they get tired and you can play because you are not tired yet and you want to play one more round till you feel sleepy. you can catch things like in pokemen and then they can fight for you. the writing is really good as well from a funny side of viewing if you look at it. it's like a true art but i laugh a lot like in a ben stiller movie i once was with my best friend from college. we laughed alot as well and then we watched a movie which had ben afleck as a leading role. we didn't laugh because it wasn't funny but we thought every american named ben is funny. that was a mistake. pit people however is funny even though an unfunny ben might be in the company who owns this game and develops new content like every month. i like the other games of the company as well. oh man i laughed like every time when i played battleblock theater for example. another great game for on-line or couch-coop. sometimes games are meant to be played in multiplayer. it can make them more fun. i haven't played pit people with other people as of yet but i'm quite certain that it is much fun with other people. the soundtrack is da bomb as well. totally legit art all the way. i was dancing to the music once while no one was looking. i had a real blast. oh boy what a game. i would encourage you, dear reader, to buy it ASAP\n\n10/10 game of the year",

Maybe an option for a character to say, take off their pants in order to carry more gear, something funny and in keeping with the games atmosphere.\nPossibly some kind of changes to the roster setup? Because at the moment having 6 character slots not be unlocked from the get go is a little redundant, seeing as you can unlock both of them in about 20 mins of play after starting the game. Just seemed a little odd how easy it was to get - there was no sense of progression. Maybe unlock them after doing quests for the town or something. Or they unlock by completing random quests that aren't one of the 4 options you get on leaving the city?

To better explain this, the depth of the game's battle strategy can be broken down into:\n\n- Organize and modify your team at base [making a compatible party suitable to your playstyle].\n- Strategically place your units on the field of battle for optimum damage, tank-ability and utility.\n- [Sometimes] manage which enemies you target to save the last enemy to be recruited.\n\nThese two and a half only layers of the battle scenarios are strangely enough to keep you playing the game for a long time. But, I do admit, it eventually can become redundant, and maybe even boring. There are only so many combinations of your \"team set-up vs. enemy team set-up\"s you can go through before it starts to become repetitive routine strategy.\n\nWhat I can only hope for is that the Devs add in at least one sort of extra layer of depth to the battle-dynamic which they add in through the development process; A layer like:\n\n- In-battle item use.\n- Added character-type activatable or auto-activated abilities (ex: leap for archers, charge for cyclops, etc).\n- Talent tree sort-of-thing for personalization of each character you own.\n- Something more brilliant that only a Behemoth dev can come up with.\n\nA layer that can take you out of your routine comfort in a battle to yell \"F***, I hate it when that f***er does that\" or \"F***, I love it when my little character dude does that\".\n\nAnyway, despite that one main criticism, the game really does nail everything you can love about a Behemoth game and more: Comedy, re-playability, well-constructed world, killer music, the always loved animation style, the unpredictability of every story-quest. Other reviews capture the best parts of the game in more depth.\n\nAll in all, 8.5/10.

Good controller support and a nice combat interface. Funky tunes. Good dialogue, characters, narration. Worldbuilding is currently lacking and the open-world potential of this game isn't really used. Not much point in freeform exploring I didn't start having fun until taking quests and avoiding most combat encounters.

After the tutorial, all enemy types are now avaliable and could be recruited to your team. Each species does different attacks and have different stats. You could do the story mission which is not in an abundant amount, the side missions which is more fighting and hilarious dialogue, or just explore and recruit people. The customizability for your team is huge as there is a lot of weapons, and there is a lot more factors you need to concider when assembling a team. The fighting is intense as you move your units around either to focus attack on a single target or positioning for retreat/attack.

Not only is the development cycle of this game all over the place, so is the community.\n\nTo start, Pit People isn't a horrible game but it definitely isn't great. If you like turn based strategy or The Behemoth's typical humor you will most likely enjoy this game...at first. When stepping into Pit People you have this incredible feeling of exploration and a deep combat system with nearly infinite unlocks and collectables. However after a few hours the game is bare-boned and shallow as they come. \n\nFirstly, the classes of characters in this game are not developed and balanced enough. They don't feel unique enough and when putting them in raw combat to compare they all pretty much play out the same. There really isn't a strategy aspect to the game as it stands and I don't think it ever will. Your party will almost always be able to take on 2 encounters before having to heal or return back to the hub. If you're great or if you're terrible it always takes about 2 battles to make you need to retreat. This game gets incredibly stale after your 10th battle; they're all the same despite what enemies are present and how many there are. It is very clear The Behemoth is doing trial and error on this one as they go. The strategy aspect of this game is absent.\n\nSecondly, the map and it's exploration. This game has about 5-6 maps in which each time you load into a new world it picks a spawn point on one of those 6 maps. There's really no point to this aspect of the game. I was fine with it at first but after updates they removed the beacon back to the city. This makes trying to get back more annoying than difficult because time stops when you stop to open the map and try to guess where you are... Over the updates there was also a feature to make elite enemies stun immune, more aggressive, and inescapable. This is incredibly annoying because now special enemies on the world map just attack you out of nowhere and there's no way to stop them beyond out-driving them. The same missions spawn in all the same places each time there's really no point. They could have just gone with a really big static map and it wouldn't have changed anything...\n\nLastly the collectables. This aspect is just rushed. They had their artists pump in as many crazy things as they could but they're almost entirely cosmetic. The weapons in this game used to be all the same and they tried to change that by making some unique. As time went on, they did this more and more with wider differences. Now, a lot of these weapons are beyond useless and simply cant be used in a strategic sense. There's no easy way to get these collectables or direct means of getting them. If you could just pay for a random item in a gambling machine it would be fine. Currently, the only way to obtain items is catching an enemy (kill all the enemies first, and have a character with a net catch it) and by random loot drops from doing missions/beating enemies.\n\nEverything about this game just screams placeholder and subject to change on a balance level. The Behemoth is taking their sweet time with the game. (months between updates) Despite these huge time gaps between content they aren't changing much. The gameplay isn't getting anymore engaging, the main story isn't progressing, and most of each update is just more collectable dumps. The core of this game will never change. It's still the same casual flat \"strategy game\" through and through. After countless rebalances of how levels and stats work the game is still exactly the same as the first build, worse really. I wanted to give this game a good review, I really did but it's clear these are permanent problems lingering over the game.\n\nThe icing on the disaster cake is the community. Right off the bat, it's dead. Most people try to be helpful but its just a ghost town. \n\nI have personal problems with this community day in and day out. Back in the day I used to be extremely active, I would help people with any questions or problems. I would boast about having the most completion because I loved the game and played it religiously. However the downfall of the community was The Behemoth and their connection to said community. \n\nThey moved over to discord and the forums here were getting more and more silent by the day. So they decided to make a community manager, a fellow player. I don't want to seem jealous, but they made this guy a manager out of no where for no reason and he isn't an employee. He simply embraced a meme and became the center of attention by making his profile themed after Pit People. Sure, this is fine at first but he really isn't helpful or active like I was. He was basically made community mod to be a jester to liven up the place. (That worked really well right...?)\n\nThen just yesterday I go onto the forums after being disappearing after many months and updates. I come looking for help to get 100% completion or as close as I could. What do we have...? No one. The forums are empty for the most part. I stumble across a group of select people trying to make a full list of everything in the game. Turns out, they're close buddies who won't help out unless it's to help themselves. They just want Steam forum fame on an empty game. So I continue my search...\n\nI go to the Discord today asking around there. I find someone who's willing to help. To my surprise they had more items than me despite me 100%'ing the game a few updates ago. What do they do? Oh yeah, they scam me. Turns out this guy is also buds with the small group of completionists. Wow, great community huh? He accused me of cheating for having the max number of items when I played this game a lot longer before there was more content but okay...\n\nYeah, wah wah wah personal beefs right? Wrong.

This will leave a waypoint back home from everywhere.\n\nSorry someone in the community didn't trade you proper.  We have a trade mode in the game that makes sure each person has sent something over if you want to prevent that in the future.\n\nThanks for the feedback!"}, "35465182": {"recommendationid": "35465182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198213638180", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511437616}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u66f4\u65b0\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1507101577, "timestamp_updated": 1511437752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35463033": {"recommendationid": "35463033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100677658", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1016, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507201907}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u4e00\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u5440\uff0c\u6211\u6ca1\u51fa\u73b0\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u6b7b\u673a\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5233\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u8fd0\u6c14\u597d\u5427\uff0c\u753b\u98ce\u6e05\u5947\uff0c\u91cc\u9762\u4eba\u7269\u8111\u56de\u8def\u51fa\u4f17\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u5f97\u5f88\u667a\u969c\u7684\u72ec\u89d2\u517d233\uff0c\u56de\u5408\u5236\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8f83\u4e3a\u67af\u71e5\u7684\u6218\u6597\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u800c\u88ab\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\uff0c\u503c\u5f97\u4e00\u73a9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u4f60\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u548c\u4f60\u4e00\u8d77\u73a9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b233", "timestamp_created": 1507091969, "timestamp_updated": 1507091969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35449281": {"recommendationid": "35449281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198426248248", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509186801}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u6709\u610f\u601d\u4e0d\u8fc7\u540e\u671f\u6709\u70b9\u4e4f\u5473\u76ee\u524d\u5267\u60c5\u597d\u50cf\u6ca1\u6709\u5b8c\u6210\u753b\u98ce\u6bd4\u8f83\u559c\u6b22\u6240\u4ee5\u5f53\u7136\u662f\u63a8\u8350\u4e86\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1507043183, "timestamp_updated": 1507043183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35423220": {"recommendationid": "35423220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064265103", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500238387}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is super fun, turn based combat and mixing up your team with newly aquired combatants and weapons, humorous dialog and visuals, i recommend. only issue with me is the lack of *new* content. the game isn't finished yet, so keep that in mind, otherwise enjoy ^^", "timestamp_created": 1506962798, "timestamp_updated": 1506962798, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35421946": {"recommendationid": "35421946", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157532203", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515150692}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u043e-\u0432\u0441\u0451", "timestamp_created": 1506960018, "timestamp_updated": 1506960018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35410219": {"recommendationid": "35410219", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053301435", "num_games_owned": 483, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507894647}, "language": "english", "review": "Just buy it", "timestamp_created": 1506937505, "timestamp_updated": 1506937505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35400400": {"recommendationid": "35400400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041552633", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507435752}, "language": "english", "review": "The combat takes forever, and the enemy teams do not feel balanced.

Pit People whilst sharing an art style and humour isn't at all like those games. Unlike other Behemoth games it isnt fast paced and its humor comes from the story rather than from its visuals and its gameplay isn't exactly top notch. Its supposed to a stratagy game but bar a few differing abilities there is not much to the combat, you get to choose where your characters move and thats it. The turn based system is also painfully slow too making battles just not that fun. Every fight is just \"move here, now wait\".\nI also didn't think it was that funny, like i said before it puts its humor into the dialoge rather than visual gags like in other games, the world is still fantastic in many places though. The visuals are great in combat and out of it with a lot going on in the backgrounds. The story is its strongest part but as of now its just a handful of quests and a few (really good) cutscenes.\nThis game isn't bad but it isn't \"overhelmingly positive\" in my view.

The reason i got this so quickly was because it was from the creators of Castle Crashers. The campaign is quite short. There are heaps of side quests, At times hillarious humor. To a unrealistic god-like bear that can rain acid to child eating enemys (Not really it's just they're name and they're speech is why they are child eating). The artstyle is creative, It's got unique elements ti the game, heaps of characters/enemys that you can recruit so you can use them in battle. Heaps of weapons but, I THINK there is only 3 types of weapons, Swords, Maces and bows. Why i said heaps of weapons is because there are heaps of weapons that go into each of those 3 groups of weapons. Overall great game i'm not a fan of turn based games but this game was really addicting to me even tho it wasn't my favourite TYPE of game. You don't need to like turn based to enjoy thi great game.", "timestamp_created": 1505549993, "timestamp_updated": 1505549993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score":

It seems this developer CAN'T make a bad (or even mediocre) game. Pit People is a tactical-turn-based, squad-management, open-world game. Right after finishing the prologue, you can travel ANYWHERE you want on the world map and fight anything and anyone that you want, which is a refreshing degree of freedom. The game is quite difficult if you don't understand the positioning of your squad on the battlefield, or the squad-management aspect of the game but you shouldn't feel bad if your squad gets destroyed... the game honestly has a nice degree of difficulty to it. Combat is 'slow', but it's a turn-based game so that can be expected... battles can sometimes take 10minutes+ for per fight, but time simply FLIES by because of the amazingly-upbeat music! The music is simply delightful and gives the whole game a whimsical feel to it (almost makes it feel like a cartoon). The dialogue of the characters is also quite funny and the 'voices' of the characters even more so... There's honestly nothing negative I can say about the game and for $15 it's WELL worth it, because you can easily get 50hours+ out of the game, even in the current early access state.

These being first Co-op element of the game which typically increases the fun factor of most games by upwards of 100% and I feel in this games case would make for a far far far superior experience.\n\nB. The pit, an arena in the games city hub area thingy that features arena battles against both npcs and AI with coop also being an option.\n\nC. The \"hard core mode\" or whatever it is called, while less important as not many people will be hinging their purchase decision on an additional difficulty setting, it still bears mention.\n(Okay not entirely true, I did switch it on at one point but there were loud noises, flashing light, smoke and fire... long story short I got scared an immediately turned it off again ;-;)\n\n                                                 [b] With that out of the way, Let Us Begin! [/b]\n\n[h1] The Pros\t[/h1]\n\nThis game. Is. Bonkers. \nI never expected in my life that I would be setting the personal objective to go out of my way in a video game in order to..\n\nGet a prettier pair of leggings.. that are purely cosmetic.. for my spider lady.. so that they would match the style of my companion.. who rides on her back.. and is also a sentient cupcake.. that flings portions of its body into teammates mouths.. so that it can heal them.. while slowly killing itself in the process.\n\nNow in case you aren\u2019t sold quite yet, here are some more general pros in my opinion.\n\n- It can be described as \"babies first strategy game\" and [b] NOT [/b] and a derogatory sense.\nEven if you have never played a strategy game or plain suck at any of those that you have tried, rest assured that you will be able to perform competently in this game. Simple and Satisfying is the motto I use for the gameplay.\n\n[b] **AND YET! [/b] The system cannot be called shallow so easily given the wealth of weapon types, unit types, team combinations and hazards/status effects that all serve to enrich the base combat experience.\n\nAdditional likeable features of the game that come to mind include the games vast degree of customization items (well over 1000 individual items) that give little advantage over each other in reguards to stats.\nSure some might have certain resistances or attributes such [i] +dodge%chance [/i] etc. \n\nHowever as a whole this does not subtract from the game experience, it helps avoid a balancing nightmare and constant player worrying \"are the stats good enough? Do I have anything optimal? Omg heavens forbid I am not min/maxing to the fullest extent\" ad infimum.\"\n\nInstead this lets the player simply... have fun! New hat? Like the hat? Stick that sucker on! \nFashion souls to your hearts content, better to kick butt in style am I right! ^-^\n\nA final attractive feature I will mention before moving along to the next portion of this review [spoiler] (which I can already tell is going to be long af so settle in kiddies) [/spoiler] is the games full co-op (both local and online) functionality. Worked seamlessly into the game, for example;\n\n[list]\n\n[*] Want to go to the shops in the city while your partner edits his team build? Sure! You can both do as you please without causing any inconvenience to the other party.\n\n[*] Over world map travel? There\u2019s only one carriage with one driver... so one of you gets to be the gunner on top, allowing for some additional team interactions and coordination to stun enemies that you would rather not start an encounter with.\n(Can be done as a solo player as you are given control over movement and guns in that instance so don't worry)\n\n[*] Combat? You both take you full teams into the battles and.. well it's a turn based strategy game so it's not like much can really go wrong or inconvenience either party mechanically.\n\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The Cons\t[/h1]\n\nCombat can get very repetitive and once you capture all the creatures you want, unless you spot an over world mob with an item you [b] really really [/b] want, you may find yourself in the same position as me.\nActively avoiding combat outside of quests and even if you get sucked into one... just fleeing because scccreeww that.\n\nThis however is not a con within the context of said quests, this being due to the simple fact that a lot of tender love and care is put into quests. The maps which these encounters take place in are typically hand crafted and narrated, not only adding charm and character to both the enemies and the environment but also changing the gameplay.\n\nThrough adding in map objectives (camps to destroy, buttons to press, key targets, etc.) you can complete the mission without having to actually kill everything in the level! \n\nMy favourite example [b] (will be vague to avoid spoilers) [/b] of this is during a mission where most of the gimmick is to throw tons more foes at you than you initially expected. \nThis still works. Why? The way the enemies are introduced is entertaining and each new enemy adds a new map objective making it easier beat the level beyond brute forcing i.t \n[i] (aka surround the mofo's one by one and dog pile them for a quick 1/2 round kill.) [/i]\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAnother issue with the game to some might be the early access status of the game, however with Behemoth working on the game given their track record with past titles and the update work on this game over the years you can stand to feel a little less anxious.\n\nThe main storyline is still underdeveloped in the sense that there are only a handful of mission (albeit recently paced, narrated and designed with interesting cut scenes and objectives) that you can be done within a few hours easily.\nThis will however continue to be expanded over time and is more forgivable given both the quality level and the games vast array of side quests. \n\nThese aforementioned side quests will keep you running all over the world map always excited for the next to see how the stories unfold. For example (spoilers) One mission leads you to [spoiler] Travel to the FRIGGEN SUN to retrieve some sorta solar great sword of massive damage and aoe fire starting nonsense!\t[/spoiler]\n\nA final note before we wrap up for the cons is\u2026 hard core strategy players... \nThis might not be the game for you, the game is quite simplistic compared to other strategy games due to features such as the fact that if you move a unit to a positon. Whereby it *can* target more than one opponent... you have no control over which foe it will actually attack so... soooo yeah, that might cheese your onions if you know what I mean.\n\n[h1] Conclusion\t[/h1]\n\nThe game is only going to get better with time and the price is said to be getting hiked up about five bucks or so whenever the game leaves early access. So all around I would say it is a fantastic monetary and time investment.\n\n                     [b] !Hours of fun and so much more potential to be tapped into as development continues!

astonishing for an Early Access game I will now give my pros and cons (by the way this review will change when the full game is released)\n\nPros\n-Combat is unique and interesting and is really fun\n-The Behemoth has an amazing art style \"Dan Paladin\" is a very talented artist and I hope he stays the artist of these games he is awesome I love his art style\n-I don't know who wrote the dialogue but they did an awesome job as well and there are some really really funny lines said by characters through out the game all around the comedy is really good\n-The amount of quests you can do is amazing there are a lot of side quests sadly there aren't many Story Quests but that is only because the game is in Early Access so it's forgivable\n-The amount of characters you can recruit and fight is amazing and they all have really cool looking designs\n-All the weapons, shields, bows, and just all the items in this game are amazing there are so many of them and they all look really good\n-The limited amount of story in this game so far is really interesting and I am very excited to see how the story goes on from where it is now\n-Awesome music the people that made the music did an absolutely amazing job I love the music\n-The amount of stuff in the overworld is just perfectly done\n\nCons\n-The sound an enemy makes when they see you in the overworld is a tad annoying especially if there are a lot of enemies that notice you\n\nVerdict\n-Great art style love it\n-Unique combat system I love it\n-Awesome soundtrack \n-Amazing amount of quests to do really make this game's runtime longer\n-Overworld is really interesting\n-The sound enemies make when noticing you is a tad annoying\n\n**Score 10/10** \n(This score may change when the game is fully released)\n",

Essentially gameplay is slow and not too engaging, it feels like an incredibly simple board game, it might NOT be incredibly simple but it certainly seems like it. Also, combat and overall gameplay is incredibly repetitive.\n\nDespite being an open-world, their doesn't seem to be much to do, in this game you can pick a quest that has little amusing cutscenes explaining the situation, then you fight. And the combat just isn't enjoyable for me, because again, it's simply selecting a character and moving them. Exploration seems fairly bland to me, the world feels almost randomly generated, being open plains with tree/mountain/buildings/water that have no seemingly real significance besides being things you need to walk around. I'd go so far as to say exploring in Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theater was more interesting. In Castle Crashers you could go through a level, find a cool new weapon, blow up walls to find hidden rooms, or even bring that one bird that finds secrets. In Battleblock Theater you could find secret rooms, and walls that looked real but you could actually walk through, leading you to treasure like gems or yarn.\n\nTreasure is also interesting in Pit People, as far as I know, there is:\n-New units.\n-New Cosmetics/Armor.\n-New Weapons.\n\nIt seems to me from my time playing that Pit People has the most character customization, but personally with the different types of weapons and armor I think they overdid it, it's been a while, but I remember lots of different options for armor and weapons. I believe there is like 3 types of shields, 3 types of helmets, a few different types of bows and swords. Seems kind of like a lot for a game so simple. In my opinion, Battleblock Theater actually did weapons really well, weapons are so incredibly different there are lots of things you can do with each one. (Freezing ice or exploding frogs?) Unlike Pit People in my opinion, where you can trade a light shield for a slightly bigger shield. (And yes I am aware that these have minor differences, you know what I mean.)\n\nThe humor, possibly the most important thing. Hmm. When I played the game, I was amused for most of the experience, but nothing sticks out as a particularly funny moment and I actually don't recall laughing at all. I won't pretend to be a humor expert, but I didn't laugh. \n\nI think it's cool that Behemoth has decided to branch out a bit from their usual (beat-em-up?) games, but personally it's not my cup of tea so far. Maybe it will be though, the game is still in Early Access, right? I don't really think I'd recommend this game unfortunately, I really do love Behemoth, but this game isn't something I'd recommend to someone (But I'd still encourage them to try it anyway) who:\nA: Enjoyed previous Behemoth games.\nB: Enjoys strategy games.\n\nAs I haven't said much of anything positive in this review, I'm going to have to not recommend it. Which is causing me physical pain, I love Behemoth, and I'll try this game again sometime.\n\nIf I remember more things I will update this review.", "timestamp_created": 1502167385, "timestamp_updated": 1502167998, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.477432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34093835": {"recommendationid": "34093835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198149978849", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1457, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509487174}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Me encant\u00f3, muy original y divertido", "timestamp_created": 1502158478, "timestamp_updated": 1502158478, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "34088432": {"recommendationid": "34088432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092542249", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492556431}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty fun game so far.

Which is to say, your characters do their characterly things based on their position and circumstance.

And this time you really did it!\nWhen I first saw the game in the store, I quickly got the feeling where the game origins come from. Hearing the same narator from the previous titles, I lost it at the very spot.\n\nBut my personal question as a life long rts/4x player was: How convincing could a \"strategy\" (Round based strategy with rpg elements) game be from such a studio?\n\nWell, I was oddly surprised and genuinly impressed when I watched the very beginning in a Let's play video and considered a journey with the game afterwards. The way too familiar characteristics as the artstyle, sound and music (Also the same guy from BBT) never lost their charm, and while I played around 25h in solo I'm looking forward to play it in coop as I rarely had that much actual fun in most games recently.\n\nTaking a closer look the [b]graphics and animations[/b], they surely are nothing comparable to other games like Battlefield, but then again, what would you expect from a 2D strategy game? I wouldn't even dare to compare it to any games other than perhaps Don't starve, if that even. With this kinda pointless statement being said, the graphics are gorgeous and yet simple with clear lines and single color tones, nothing to complain there. The animations are doing their job, but I see in this category why the game is in early acess state. The game holds a large amount of different characters which require different animations (i.e. attack [with various weapon types], take damage, special moves etc.), but some are simply not done (yet?). This problem simply was solved with no animation other than idling, at least you see the feedback from dealt damage by showing numbers of dealt / received damage and mostly the victim animating from taking a hit.\n\nThis topic might be a rather personal thing, but I mostly prefer to mute any ingame [b]music[/b] and play something else in the background. This game actually managed to keep me from doing so. While it's quite difficult for me to name the direction the music the game is following, I'm really enjoying the it, as well as the electro swing music played in town. However, I was a bit surprised when I figured out it's actually from a different artist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSBzvhud3Io . Well, they surely picked a song matching this rather crazy ambiente of a city.\n\nOverall, This game might become my personal favorite game released (in EA state) this year, though there are a few points someone might complain about:\n\n-The character control turns out a bit confusing in multiple aspects, as well as the camera control trying to center the screen but messing up sometimes\n-After finnishing the current existing story, I understand people recommending to wait until the full development of the game. You can finnish the existing main story really quick and it suddenly just stops. That was a little turn off when I reached this point.\n-I hope that some items will experience various stat modifications in the future. As of now, most items have the same stats and are basically just reskins. A much higher complexity would allow more strategy coming from the equipment.\n\nOverall, I certainly do like this game. Keep it up, Behemoth!<3\n[spoiler]And please don't add too many more meme references[/spoilers]", "timestamp_created": 1501093874, "timestamp_updated": 1501093874, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5,

Combat is completely out of your hands outside of positioning- meaning that this is a more passive type of RPG than a traditional TRPG.\n\n It's a fun and unique system and the co-op elements are amazing but for me it got boring after about 9 hours of playing. Why? Because there isn't much progression involved, you won't be much stronger mid way through the game than you were at the start. Let me clarify, what mostly changes is your capacity for different group make-ups and different ways to counter certain enemies. You'll be stronger in the sense that more options will open up to you, not that your stats/skills are necessarily better. Your stats DO slowly increase as you level but most enemies level with you so it doesn't really net out to any progression that feels like you're getting stronger. You can certainly get cool new items but as an example, a new bow might have less damage than your old bow but will provide some other stat or freeze to compensate. A new monster may be armor piercing but is weak to unicorns. Stuff like that really isn't \"progression\" in the traditional sense though  as it's all fairly balanced. I guess it's all to encourage you to use anything you want and to balance PVP a bit easier but to me it just means there's less reasons to keep playing.\n", "timestamp_created": 1500883582, "timestamp_updated": 1500883582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499032", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33757783": {"recommendationid": "33757783", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219849785", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 469, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500711416}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5f88\u6709\u4e50\u8da3\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5b98\u65b9\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u66f4\u65b0\u6c49\u5316", "timestamp_created": 1500865797, "timestamp_updated": 1500865797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33757538": {"recommendationid": "33757538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272963503", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 19989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 252, "last_played": 1516043511}, "language": "english", "review": "Leave it to Behemoth to make a turn based game a fun experience for me.

As a matter of fact if it wasn't for the EA flag and the incomplete story mode I don't think I'd even realize this game wasn't complete. Pit People basically plays as a fast-paced tactics RPG with a Pokemon style collection element that feels amazing as you progress through the game.\n\nI primarily play via gamepad on my steamlink and it works great, my wife will sometimes join me for coop and the game has no problem reading both gamepads and the keyboard/mouse at all; and even prompts the playstation controller buttons on screen by default - I was really blown away by that bit. Not to mention the game has a lot of humor written into it that kept my wife and I laughing for a long time. The music is catchy, but the selection is a bit limited. Looking forward to more music tracks in the final release. :)", "timestamp_created": 1500424651, "timestamp_updated": 1500424651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499032", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33639526": {"recommendationid": "33639526", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152071254", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491527234}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0421\u0438\u043c\u0443\u043b\u044f\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u043c\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0432 \n\n10 \u043a\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0435\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0438\u0437 10", "timestamp_created": 1500416875, "timestamp_updated": 1500416875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33635486": {"recommendationid": "33635486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143736813", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1359, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510672984}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u6709\u5f85\u52a0\u5f3a\uff0c\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u5c3d\u5feb\u5b8c\u6210\u6c49\u5316", "timestamp_created": 1500402526, "timestamp_updated": 1500402526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33634251": {"recommendationid": "33634251", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028354069", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 3414, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507093969}, "language": "english", "review": "Pit People is great for co-op!  Finally, something I can jump into that's cooperative instead of competitive and which requires very little investment or foreknowledge to enjoy with a friend.  Don't get me wrong - you certainly benefit from experience with the game and by having more options in your roster - but generally speaking a fresh player is nearly as capable as a veteran and you can have a good time with both casual and dedicated friends in the game.  It doesn't have a ton to offer in single player if you're not into collecting but for co-op I definitely recommend it.  It's fun to see what wacky, creative or just plain devastating combinations you and your buddy can come up with.\n\nI'll admit I stayed away from Pit People for a long time because I just didn't like Castle Crashers... both in terms of gameplay and the humor.  This title works for me in both areas and I was pleasantly surprised.  The \"Early Access\" aspect was also a point of concern for me but I'm  happy to report the game is quite complete enough for co-op.  Balance changes are still ongoing though so I recommend you don't get too attached to specific strategies and enjoy the variety.", "timestamp_created": 1500398406, "timestamp_updated": 1500398406,

Charming, Psychotic, and Lemony Fresh\n\nThe Behemoth once again bring their charming artstyle and unceasably comedic dialogue to the strategy realm, with hints of the team member catching of pokemon, thousands of unit cosmetics with varying functionality seen in every other jrpg, and the afforementioned charm from Battleblock & Castle Crashers.\n\nQuests and Characters are spread accross the world that inexplicably want to kill you just for 'almost running them over with your wagon.' Reference after reference is hidden everywhere from the NPCs, to the Areas, and even the occasional hairstyle. You wrap yourself into this world of crazy people as a gang of fanged beasts attempt to destroy all our precious cow painted ten-gallon hats, just to give an example of some of the thing you can encounter (and no I did not make that up.)\n\nWith the 20 different races to catch (one of them is a clone of another) of varying pros, cons, & strategies entailing them. Each one brings a new set of rules to follow and it's up to you how you want to utilize them in battle as a few are flexible enough to fit different roles. With synergies galore and a new weapon/hat/shield earned after every battle, no one team ever feels the same (unless of course you made it be the same as another team.)\n\nOne of it's prime features is the thing that the title speaks of, THE PIT, a multiplayer battle arena where you can duke it out 1v1, 2v2, or face 3 waves back-to-back alone or with a friend by your side. With gold cosmetics able to win via the tournament, you'll be able to show off your champions in their new beautiful outfits in no time!\n\nThe biggest problem with the game atm is that its story is missing, something clearly stated by The Behemoth. Although the multiplayer has been the star of their last two games, the story shed light onto the land's lore and brought it's own crowd of players there for a singleplayer experience. I can't feel truly satisfied with this greatness until I see an end to the story, HOWEVER, the core gameplay mechanics are still enough to bring you to enjoy and play it while still in it's early access.

Not sure how it happened. One second I was waiting on the cashier at the dollar store, on the way back from work, then the next moment an enormous wormhole or something, a huge black hole you only see in overly ambitious sci-fi movies sucked us all up, then plopped us out in this....this strange, strange world. All of us, everybody at the store, including the store itself. Immediately, we were in the hands of the gods. Their screwed up gods, I tell ya. Colorless fellas with sadistically twisted, morbid and disgusting heads or headpieces, I don't know what to call them, were chanting to a mass-proclaimed deity or something, shouting \"Chog, chog!\", rooting for the enormous beast to devour us whole in a sort of sacrificial ritual, but all I could think of was how similar their blindly devout chants sounded to the \"Chug, chug!\" you may hear in a 2005 frat party home video. All of them died, one by one, like mindless sheep in a particularly explicit slaughterhouse. It chills my bones to just think about all the blood and entrails, all the suffering I've witnessed. Some enforcers of the deity, coming at us with loaded machineguns, gigantic baseball bats, rocket launchers that shot cruelly sharp emerald swords and table forks the size of my leg. Huge, smirking bats, furry spiders who all for some reason looked like my mom's girlfriends and one eyed moster people. They all died before my own two eyes, all of them from the store. The naggy, slowpoke clerk, the smelly dude behind me in line, the old lady browsing the kitchen utensils, even her dog who was just patiently waiting, leashed at the entrance. Shot to a bloody damn pulp, that puppy. There were some other people, too. Lots of people, actually. Some of them looked normal, like us, confused and scared. Others looked like them, like the strange people from the crowd, eyes glazed at the arena. Some of those seemed to be joyed by the commotion. Religious followers of the deity, readily prepared to sacrifice themselves, as I found out later. Freakish. Death, death. A resounding thought. I closed my eyes. I felt a thunk, then heard a bang. When I woke up, I was surrounded by maybe 5-6 people, with a mixed variety of strange deformations and dressing habits. Silly hats, ridiculous weapons, fish bowls, cookies, all sorts of weird crap turned into make-shift shileds and weapons. I couldn't understand their gibberish language, but I felt that they had good intentions, towards me at the least. I got handed a few tools to make myself useful. Weapons, terribly unfashionable hats, et cetera. I've been roaming these murderous fields in their company every since. It's been fine so far, I took it better than expected. I was always used to changes, even before, when pops died. However, I am starting to be afraid. Even with all the gibberish, I am beginning to understand the words they are saying. And there is one, just one, even these battle-hardened warriors are deathly afriad to speak out loud. A name, only ever spoken of in whispers, from the shadows. A name that has given them, now us, something to be afraid. A massacrist vagabond, murderous fiend they seem to be....gibbering? Deep in the night, guarding our nomadic tents, they stutter his name. The killer. The murder machine, Horatio. We're all starting to be terribly afriad. I don't wanna die. I'm still just a boy. I put this message in a bottle, hoping it would reach someone. Please, tell my mom I love her very much. Tell her I stole the money from the stash, it wasn't Ellie. Sorry, Ellie, I owe ya one! Please, give Birdcrack, my sweet sweet dog a treat in my name!

(Made me avoid enemies and didnt want to engage them)\nEquipment system (at least early game) needs work, starting weapons barely mean shit, and there isnt really a ledgend to tell you what all the buffs mean, which is so fuckig needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIve been playing these games from alien hominide up to battle blocks and enjoy how they always change genre and manage to keep the humor fresh, refined and unexpected. I welcomed this new titles and loved the opening which these guys have nailed but this game has a few issues that turned me off at the start of the game.\n\n- The UI is very stylish but all over the place, transistioning is very slight and hard to see and the controls for the ui and very light meaning you can go flying all over the place. The Main Menu Could of been Simpled down without losing its charm. And the City Hub Menu is like castle crashers world hub, maybe pan the camera back or something idk it didnt look right to me.\n\n- The combat is amazing, its free flowing and non turne based, the characters dont have alot of special abilites but you can recruit people who have one special ability. its amazing, and the fact that each character can only do one thing or two, the proximity targeting is a great balance for strategical planning. But the fights become way to long winded, as i said before i was turned off after the prolouge mainly cause of the combat, The co op pust a boat load of enemies on the field which at first looks exciting(i will get to that in a minute), but evtually become a turn off to me cause i know i will be here for more than ten minutes, both enemies and your team barely do much damage, i had flankers go for archers but it took 12 turns to get one and the flanker died,   The slow crawling pace of the fights are leagues different from the fast paced action based game previously made, and again i havent played to much but if i was to suggest maybe quicker fights but add a few more enemies to balance it out, heck bring in reinforcements, The previous titles liked to try and overwhelm you before but the challenges are always fair.\n\n- Lastly , ive played the co op and like all the other titles you share a screen, but that becomes a major flaw, the camera doesnt pan out for both cursors, sometimes forcing one to move, it doesnt try to center both and making descions without having to wait on your partner to finish making his choices is a god damn bore, it either needs splitscreen or a better camera that pans out. i did not like waiting when i wanted to get right back in the fight, the enemy turns are instant but i had to wait for my partner so i could make my choices or vise versa. we ended up just meeting at the middle and forcing the enemy to come to use. the camera forces team play which isnt bad but im saying it again but its different the other titles, before co operation was not needed, hell you could obstruct and ruin your partner for the giggles but mechanics were also given so that you could do the opposite. Sometimes you are forced to co operate and sometimes its more fun to lone wolf. But this title, the camera is so bad for co op play that it some how forces you to work to gether so the camera wouldnt bother you.\n\nAgain i cant speak for the whole, game just my few hours of playing it. Im somewhat mixed on the early access, it lets me know the game is being worked on but i fear it may die out.

As an avid player of Battleblock Theater (On Xbox), it was easy to make the decision to buy. Humorous, diverse, a few secrets and a TON of weapons to find, one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a while, AND comes with a narrator out to make the main protagonist's life hell, Pit People is worth every dollar spent on it, even in it's current Early Access state. It has potential to be an amazing game after the release of the completed version. Speaking of Early Access, if you want it, you better get it now before the price raises for the completed game.\n\n\nAs a warning, here's some features and things to consider before you whip out your wallet:\n\n-The story is incomplete, so you'll be waiting on that for a bit.\n-It's not really getting constant updates.\n-There aren't many City Quests series at the moment; we're standing at about 6, but each one offers it's own challenge, with weapons, gold, and sometimes exclusive fighters as rewards. The dialouge and story for said quests is quite humorous, you'll at one point find yourself recreating what's basically the American Revolution (see 'The R3DC04Ts Are Coming!')\n-When traversing the world map, there are MANY quests to find and do, they'll usually result in fighting. You'll get juicy rewards from them though!\n-There is a wide variety of fighters to 'recruit'. Said recruiting is done through killing your target's friends while leaving him alive to watch, then throwing a net at them and stuffing them into a cage not shortly after throwing said net at them.\n-Also, said fighters can also have some pretty good gear that you can strip from them later and place onto your better fighters, others have overall stupid but funny names, said names are left up to RNGesus to pick.\n-Once you've made a good, well balanced and well leveled team, you can place them into 'The Pit' to fight to the death against other players in real time via use of a giant space telephone. However, I can say from experience that finding somebody to battle with takes quite a while, so be prepared to wait. \n\n\n\nChoice is up to you if you want to buy Pit People or not, but I highly recommend you do.

Taking out an enemy in a single turn is near impossible, and even healers are surprisingly tanky, which can end up making many fights into battles of attrition around a single choke point. \n\nAll unit targetting is completely automatic, as a unit will target any enemy within range at random with priority given to closer targets when applicable. There are ways the player is expected to manipulate this, including making sure only a single target is within your range or flooding an enemy's range with minions and such to mess with their targetting, but it comes off as more annoying than anything else. However, there are some clever uses of this random targetting that make up for it, like one unit who can make people target other units on their team making enemy AoE units completely backfire and splash onto their own units, but those are far too chance based for my liking.\n\nThere's a vaguely Disgaea-esque distiction between human and monster units, where human units have a large amount of customization for their stats and equipment while monsters are limited to a single or often no customization option/s. That being said, most of the customizations boil down to damage+dodge or defense+block for melee, and damage or number of shots for ranged characters. \n\n[strike]Probably my biggest qualm with the game though is the fact that it is nearly impossible to see numbers on ANYTHING besides damage and status infliction. How much defense does my Gorgon have compared to my Mushroom? Who knows, one bar is slightly taller than the other! How much health does my Archer have? 4 and a half hearts worth! How much is a heart worth? Who knows! How much health does that Fairy have left? Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3, and that's all you get to know![/strike] EDIT: As it turns out, most of this can be found out if you mouse over the stats in the customization menus. \n\nDespite all my mechanic complaints, Pit People is still a very fun game, but don't go into it expecting the height of strategic gameplay or you'll be pretty disappointed.", "timestamp_created": 1499627821, "timestamp_updated": 1499645244, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33408168": {"recommendationid": "33408168", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090931406", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513532468}, "language": "english", "review": "Brilliant", "timestamp_created": 1499616833, "timestamp_updated": 1499616833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33407906": {"recommendationid": "33407906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092324557", "num_games_owned": 894, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499616102}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6218\u65b9\u8ddf\u57ce\u5821\u7834\u574f\u8005\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u7684\u65b0\u4f5c~\n\u6e38\u620f\u867d\u7136\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u7b80\u5316\u4fdd\u7559\u6838\u5fc3\u56e0\u7d20\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u8da3~\n\u660e\u660e\u662fSLG\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e48\u4e0d\u9ebb\u70e6\u7684SLG\u5df2\u7ecf\u597d\u4e45\u6ca1\u73a9\u4e86\n\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5267\u60c5\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u4eae\u70b9\uff0c\u4e00\u60ef\u7684\u8f7b\u677e\u641e\u7b11\u98ce\u683c\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u7684~\n\u65b0\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u90fd\u8fd8\u6ca1\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u65e9\u65e5\u66f4\u65b0~", "timestamp_created": 1499616233, "timestamp_updated": 1499616233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33407858": {"recommendationid": "33407858", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096052149", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513100660}, "language": "english", "review": "A pretty well thought out strategy game only made better by Behemoth's artstyle and humor, along with Stampers wonderful voice.

Everything is lively and original, just like Castle Crashers or BattleBlock Theather.\n\nThe music is quite something, too! Again, as expected from a top tier indie developer, many of the tracks really stick out as something out there and original with a much smaller emphasis on orchestral compositions and a much larger focus on combining unique sounds you don't hear every day or using singular instruments which really stand out.\n\nOf course, since this is an Early Access game on Steam in 2017, you can easily expect one of two things about the dev support: Either the dev commits fully to noting every single mistake, responding to bug reports from their players and working with them on fixing said bugs and mistakes OR they couldn't care less and leave the game in Early Access for years to come. I'm extremely pleased to say that Pit People's dev team lands itself in the former category! I've personally reported a few bugs (/ grammar mistakes) and had the devs list the problems on their site then fix them within upcoming patches and work with me to find the root of a bug more complicated than spellchecking. \n\nOverall I can see an extreme passion for this game from the fantastic dev team and can't see it dropping below \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" in the near future.

There's a super-hard mode available but it doesn't make the fundamental gameplay any less casual. The only command you give your characters is where to move. ALL other decisions are handled by the AI, including which character or characters within range to attack if multiples are present. What type of action is taken is handled in a relatively intelligent manner (the AI doesn't attempt melee attacks when out of range for example), but the bottom line is still that the only choice the player has is where to move.\n\nThe writing and art are great as expected from Behemoth, but I just can't recommend it as a strategy game when so few options are available to the player.", "timestamp_created": 1499583493, "timestamp_updated": 1499583493, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484206", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33394442": {"recommendationid": "33394442", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992686171", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 19, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486237185}, "language": "english", "review": "This is like a casual version of Vantage Master (a very old hexagon turn base game).

It's in early access, and I felt like I might not have known what I was talking about if I had reviewed it earlier. But at 38 hours right now, I feel like I know enough about the game to assess what's right and wrong with it (at least at the moment). \n\nTo start off, let me just say that I love The Behemoth. I've never played Alien Hominid, but I've poured a lot of hours into Battleblock Theater and Castle Crashers. Both of those games I immensely enjoyed, and still play quite a bit today. So, after seeing the release of this game in the steam store about 5 months ago, I was extremely excited. Fast-forward to the first few days of the summer sale. I bought this game right away.\n\nIn my first few hours of the game, I really enjoyed it. It seemed a little simplistic, but I figured that was just because I was still in the beginning. The art, music, and atmosphere were (and are) wonderful. But what occurred as I continued to play was the grave realization that perhaps the gameplay wasn't one of the strong points. \n\nMany other people have complained that battles are way too slow-paced, although that wasn't a real weak point in my eyes. My main problems were the repetitive gameplay, the lack of progression, and because of that, not much of a reason for encounters. \n\nLet's start with the repetitive gameplay. The game has somewhere around 100 quests. At the moment, there are about 3 story quests, 7 questlines, and the rest are one off quests found out in the wild. The problem with these is that there's only really 2 missions. One is to fight a battle. The other is to go to a certain point (and sometimes fight a battle when reaching said point.) On occasion a mission will have a small twist, such as having to destroy a wall, or having to protect a certain unit. Other than that though, the missions are mostly the same, with the exception of different dialouge, which is enjoyable, but doesn't help the lacking gameplay. \n\nThe gameplay in a battle itself isn't bad, but gets repetitive after a while. After playing with the same team for a while, you'll see that the same strategies and moves always seem to emerge, and, most battles end up being handled in a similar way as the others. The main weak point with the repetition is that you don't get a lot out of it. This leads me to my next point, which is the fact that there is virtually no progression in the game.\n\nThe lack of progression in this games stems from the fact that leveling up does almost nothing for your unit leveling up. A level 99 (max) unit might have maybe 1 or 2 more in the damage stat than a level 1 unit. If you've played the game, you'll know that this is not a lot at all. Besides that, even though there are loads of them, the items that you use on your units have mostly the same exact stats, but are just sorted into different subgroups. There are about 4 different helm groups, a few different weapon groups, and that's about it. Some of them have light changes, but this is not a lot of them. And to add insult to injury, most units can't even use items that affect their performance. For example, cupcakes (healers) are all exactly the same. The items used on them are purely cosmetic and don't affect anything gameplay-wise. Besides the miniscule stat bonus you get from tons of leveling, every cupcake's stats are the exact same thing. Humans and cyclopses are the only units to be able to use all categories as far as I know. The rest either have none or can equip one of the helmet subgroups (with the exception of the gorgon, that can equip a sword)\n\n[Update: As of Update 5, stat upgrades are used a lot more liberally, with 1 every 10 levels or so. I think this is a good addition, but the rest of the points in my review still stand.]\n\nSo, the only thing you get out of capturing/encounters are cosmetic items and gold. What does gold do? It lets you buy more cosmetic items in the market, or buy supplies before you leave the town (which are going to help you get more cosmetic items.) This just lets the game boil down into two things: An insanely tedious collect-a-thon (most quests last about 15-25 minutes and only net a few items.), and decent actual gameplay that gets old quickly. I feel like more effort was put into adding more to already thousands of items, than actually worrying about gameplay.\n\nThere are a few other things besides that. PvE in normal mode feels way too easy. I realize that differentiating normal and insane mode in a more free-roaming game is harder to do, but I feel like normal mode never really poses a challenge, whereas in the other Behemoth games, Normal mode posed a challenge, at least for a short time.  \n\nTL;DR\n\nThe core gameplay in Pit People isn't bad. It just get's repetitive after grinding for items for a long time. If you really want to pick up this game, I recommend PvP, because I'd definitely say that it's the game's strongest point.\n\nOverall, I think my main problem with this game is that it too heavily revolves around collecting cosmetic items, instead of having some kind of satisfying progression. I don't see why people enjoy this game *so* much, but if they do, good for them. If you enjoy dumping tons of hours into repetitive gameplay where collecting doesn't do any good for you, then you'll probably enjoy this game. The thing that really hurts is that I really wanted to enjoy this game. There's definitely tons of potential for great gameplay, an awesome atmospthere, great graphics and dialogue, and abstract but enjoyable music, but that's just my two cents.\n\n5/10\n\n\nMajor Edit 1: I'd like to make clear that this review was written during update 4.

On s'y d\u00e9place au moyen d'un chariot \u00e9quip\u00e9 d'un canon \u00e9tourdissant, dont l'utilit\u00e9 est d'obtenir le premier tours dans les batailles. On y croise plusieurs petites maisons habit\u00e9 par des pnjs pouvant proposer des qu\u00eates et une ville. La ville se compose de plusieurs magasin, d'une entr\u00e9e o\u00f9 on pourra pr\u00e9parer le voyage, grace \u00e0 l'achat de divers objet contre quelques pi\u00e8ces d'or. D'un stand de march\u00e9 ou il sera possible d'y recruter des combatant(march\u00e9 aux esclaves) ou d'achet\u00e9 divers armes et armures pour \u00e9quiper sa petite troupe. On trouvera aussi en ville un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone g\u00e9ant pour l'acc\u00e8s aux fonctionnalit\u00e9 aux jeux en coop en ligne ou local. D'une ar\u00e8ne nomm\u00e9 le Pit et d'un jukebox pour tout ce qui est option de jeu.\n\nVoil\u00e0 pour les bases du jeu, mais maintenant les fonctionnalit\u00e9 multijoueur :\n\nLe multijoueur se d\u00e9clinera sous deux forme la phase pvp et la phase coop\u00e9ration.\n\nLe pvp se d\u00e9roulera principalement dans ce que le jeu nomme le \"Pit\", une ar\u00e8ne \u00e0 la configuration incertaine ou il sera possible soit d'affronter d'autre joueur en \u00e9quipe ou en solo, soit de faire \u00e9quipe avec un joueur pour d\u00e9rouiller du pnj et ce dans le but de faire progresser ses h\u00e9ros et de glaner quelques pi\u00e8ces fort utile pour aqu\u00e9rir les objets cit\u00e9 plus haut. \n\nLa coop\u00e9ration quand \u00e0 elle vous permettra de partager l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de l'aventure avec un ami.

I was initially a bit hesitant because of the early access status and the turn based combat which I generally haven't cared for in games since the early 2000's.\n\nThe first hour or two may be rough in figuring out the quirks and getting your butt kicked, but once I got the hang of it, this game's charm and absolute craziness that made me love the previously mentioned two games finally hooked me in here. At first combat feels slow with the turn based movement, but a couple of hours it turned out to be fine with the given need to position units carefully and plan out strategies ahead of time.  This game gives lots of customization options, lots of different classes you can recruit for your squad, and quite a bit of depth with each class and equipment having their own ups and downs.  \n\nPlaying solo gives quite a bit of content, but if you have a buddy to play co-op with, this game's content increases exponentially as you two can coordinate your own squads to take into battles.  Mixing and matching our teams has been an absolute blast.  The music in this game is pretty damn catchy too, with no themes really feeling like they overstay their welcome or becoming too repetitive.  If you loved the artwork from Behemoth's other titles, and you loved the narrator from Battleblock Theatre, you absolutely need to get this game while you still can at a lower price in it's early access status.", "timestamp_created": 1499239860, "timestamp_updated": 1499239860, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580153", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33262923": {"recommendationid": "33262923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016421307", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502617949}, "language": "english", "review": "Previous readers of my reviews have listed my reviews as Non-helpful, so I will try to clarify information about this game to help you make an informed decision on whether or not to buy this game. \n\n     I am one of the few original fans of Newgrounds.com and their amazing selections of humorous animations, underground soundtracks and colorful art galleries; I grew up on that site.  If any of that sounds familiar to yourself, then this is one of the best purchases you can come across, and possibly the best waste of time you'll ever invest in.  (In a good way.)  \n\n     This game focuses on immature humor, fun challenging gameplay and collecting stuff in game (There is over 1400 items to collect).  If none of that tickles your fickle, then this absolutely not for you.\n\n      The gameplay is a little bit similar to Xcom, turn based stradegy combat.  The story is more focused on the journey you make for yourself across the game's world map, much like castle crashers: Good hunting down Evil without much character development in a more comedic fashion.  The in game collectables are pretty to look at and are easy to unlock, half of them are weapons and the other half are cosmetics for your units.  The sidequests are cleverly written and very witty, the massive amount of content in this game glistens with charm from Developers who clearly care about what they make.\n\n        Also a side note here, clearly the game isn't finished, the story missions are not all there.

I was always captivated by that which made Newgrounds, Newgrounds-- the fact that anyone could make anything and upload it, and anyone else could comment on it or rate it. And nothing stood out to my juvenille mind more than the works that made the website famous; the ultra-violent Madness Combat series; the absurdist humor of Eddsworld; the insane difficulty of early iterations of Super Meat Boy... The list of media that changed my budding self can go on and on. I retained all of it; I'll blame my entire personality and sense of humor on what I grew up watching and playing on my dad's old laptop. But the one export of Newgrounds that I always loved the absolute most was The Behemoth. I fell in love with their beat-em-up classic Castle Crashers at a Kid's Night Out party, as I played it on an Xbox 360 there. I was obsessed. Every waking moment I would think about, draw about, talk about the game. When I finally got my own Xbox 360, Castle Crashers was one of the first games I bought for it, back when you paid in Xbox points (where one dollar was equal to 80 or 160 points). I was a junkie for that game; I even brought my own Xbox to my friend's houses so we could play together locally. Years later, when I heard they made Battleblock Theatre, I bought it on the spot. It was everything I wished for-- The Behemoth's signature art style, sense of humor, and pefectly challenging gameplay, but on a platformer. I had a new drug, and I was hooked. I played that game whenever I could. Sadly, eventually, the burning passion I held in my youth died out. I would still play both games (Alien Homonid too, but to a lesser extent) from time to time, reminiscing on the bygone era of the post-Golden age of Newgrounds. Time passed, and I caught wind of a new Behemoth game from either Game Informer or PC Gamer in the magazine rack of a local supermarket. And this time, it was a turn-based RPG! I was amazed. I was excited. I spent as much time as I could researching it, trying to find out where, when, and how I could play it. That was years ago. Pit People was a cloudy fuzz of nostalgia and excitement in my mind until the day I opened up steam and what did I see on the front page-- Out now, Pit People. I was ecstatic. I couldn't wait to get it. What stopped me? My own wallet. In my youth my pocket changed flowed freely, and I splurged on whatever I felt like-- games, DLC, food, movies-- but in my teenage years I was not the same. I decided to myself, \"ah, early access. I'll wait until it comes out for real\". 4 updates passed, and I couldn't hold back. I whipped out my debit card on the first day of the Summer Sale and proceeded to buy it. And I must say, it's everything I hoped for and so, so much more. Where do I begin? Everything is exactly as I remember The Behemoth. The gameplay is challenging, in just the right level of fun. There's tons of options for how you want to play the game. There are cosmetics galore. The story is humorous but engaging, light but oh so rich. The announcer is the same from Battleblock Theatre and I love it as I did back then. This is the kind of game I would have made for the young version of myself growing up at my dad's overheating computer playing on Internet Explorer until I accidentally discovered Firefox. I give this game a perfect 10. If anyone at The Behemoth is reading this post, I want to tell you: Keep up the great work.

It occurred on 26 April 1986 in the No.4 light water graphite moderated reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat, in what was then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union (USSR).\n\nDuring a late-night safety test which simulated a station blackout power-failure and in which safety systems were deliberately turned off, a combination of inherent reactor design flaws, together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner contrary to the checklist for the test, eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open-air graphite fire.[note 1] This fire produced considerable updrafts for about 9 days, that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere, with the estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase, approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion.[1] Practically all of this radioactive material would then go on to fall-out/precipitate onto much of the surface of the western USSR and Europe.\n\nThe Chernobyl accident dominates the energy accidents sub-category, of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties. It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level 7 event (the maximum classification) on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011. The struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were, at many times falsely, perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings, ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles. During the accident, blast effects caused 2 deaths within the facility and later 29 firemen and employees died in the days-to-months afterward from acute radiation syndrome, with the potential for long-term cancers still being investigated\n\nThe remains of the No.4 reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus (radiation shield) by December 1986, at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold shut-down phase; the enclosure was built quickly as occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station, with No.3 continuing to produce electricity into 2000.\n\nThe accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed reactors in the RBMK (Chernobyl No.4) family, of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 2013.", "timestamp_created": 1498279372, "timestamp_updated": 1498279372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470243", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32709847": {"recommendationid": "32709847", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999877977", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 2650, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508088118}, "language": "english", "review": "Hands down one of my favorite games I have ever played.

[/h1]\n\nWhich makes me excited for release. [i] Hoooweeeever [/i] Pit People is still in development. Though you can have some fun now, It gets a bit eh. Tiring. Boring? Don't get me wrong, the game is good there's funny side quests per \"world\" there's Story. Etc, all the good stuff.\n\nHowever, It's just not getting constant updates the moment. \nMeaning if you're invested in the game and want to support its development while it comes out, sure go ahead pay now. However, if you want to enjoy the game in its full state and not just be stuck wanting to know what happens next. Well. Wait until the game is released.\n\nThe game has catchy (copyrighted) music. And its policy on uploading to youtube is fairly easy to abide to. If you want to avoid copyright mute the music, leave the narration on, and play and upload. EzPz\n\nNow As for the game there's tons of weapons in variation and quality. IE There's Bows, Guns (guns aren't as good or OP as you may think) Light Swords, Heavy Swords, Maces, All that good stuff. And they all have their pros and cons.\n\nFor example the Mace is a good weapon however its heavy. Meaning if you have the mace you cant wear armor.\nAnd if you wear armor, you're weakness is a mace. (Or club) and even then there's multiple and tons of races not limited to the Electrobots, Giants, and Spidaurs. Oh and a Troll mother. You know that giant bushmonster thing from Castle Crashers.\n\nAnd again, each race has its own pros and cons. Electrobots cant heal through cupcake races, only through gnomes and do massive AOE and possible stun damage if aligned correctly (they can also float) Wraiths can do debuff damage an an AP (armor piercing) attack that ignores armor. However its melee only. However the Wraith has a Weakness to Rainbows, (and possibly pixies?)\n\nBut I'm not going to guide you through everything the game is lively but incomplete. You will yes have fun, some units have funny names. Game makes me want to play it but. Well. Doesn't have much for it right now. I'd recommend waiting until release to buy it, as at release you can at least get a taste for the game before refunding (if you choose to do so) But I certainly recommend it even so, It's worth the money (especially at release whenever that happens) and is done by the Behemoth, who can do no wrong in my eyes yet. That and the artwork is by Dan Paladin so. It's all just great.\n\nBut again, I suggest waiting until release before you fully judge the game.\n\nAlso this quote from the \"Why Early access\" question.\n\nWill the game be priced differently during and after Early Access?\n\"Yep. When the game is completed, it will cost more than it does now. ORDER TODAY!\"\n\nAlso, Also. The developers listen to community feedback and bug reports so once again.

First off, keep in mind this game is in beta, and not nearly finished (at least I hope not.) \n\n[b]Concept[/b]\nSo this game is a turn-based rpg kind of deal. The main concept is that a giant space bear smashed into your planet and shattered it into hexagons. Throughout most of the story, there is a narrator who clearly dislikes Horatio, your character.\nIn essence, this game is you going around and fighting things, as well as capturing enemies and adding them to your party.\n\n[b]Story[/b]\nAt this point, the main storyline is fairly short, with a grand total of two missions. That being said, this is the third update, so that's definitely going to change. There are also quite a few sidequests that you can complete, and lots of random encounters of varying difficulty. Lets also not forget what gives the game it's name; The Pit. This is a gladitorial style arena where your team of characters fights against three other groups with increasing difficulty. The Pit yields many rewards, and is a good way to level up and pass time when you're not playing a mission.\n\n[b]Battles[/b]\nIn the battles, each character has a specific amount of hexagon tiles they can move per turn.

Spatula for a sword, large piece of bacon for a shield, lol!\n\nCONS:\n\nMain storyline is limited to only one, really awesome btw, quest once the tutorial missions have been completed.\nSound track is VERY limited at this point, and music can get repetitive.\nThere needs to be about 20 more monster types added for capturing and battle variety.\n\nCONCLUSION\nGreat game that's worth a buy already. Made by a team you can trust to see the project through to the end and finish with a great product. Highly recommended, worth it for the laughs alone.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1496496277, "timestamp_updated": 1496496277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2051, "votes_funny": 49, "weighted_vote_score": "0.975617", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32147537": {"recommendationid": "32147537", "author": {"steamid": "76561198255710586", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496479187}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6e38\u620f\u505a\u7684\u4e0d\u9519\u4f46\u662f\u6ca1\u4eba\u73a9\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c1\u6708\u4efd\u770b\u89c1\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u521a\u53d1\u552e\u8d76\u7d27\u5c31\u4e70\u4e0b\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u73a9\u7684\u4eba\u8fd8\u633a\u591a\u5339\u914d\u4e5f\u662f\u79d2\u5339\uff0c\u8fd9\u600e\u4e48\u624d\u8fc7\u4e86\u534a\u5e74\u8fde\u4eba\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u4e86\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5c31\u662f\u5b57\u4f53\u4e5f\u548c\u4ee5\u524d\u4e0d\u4e00\u6837\u4e86\uff0cui\u4e5f\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\uff0c\u770b\u5f97\u51fa\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u662f\u60f3\u597d\u597d\u505a\u7684\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u600e\u4e48\u5c31\u9b3c\u670d\u4e86\u5462\uff0c\u5751\u4eba\u4e5f\u662f\u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u6218\u68cb\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\u771f\u7684\u5f88\u597d\u73a9\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u540c\u4f34\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e5f\u5f88\u65b0\u9896\uff0c\u914d\u4e0a\u4e00\u5982\u65e2\u5f80\u7684\u9b54\u6027\u753b\u98ce\u4e0e\u9b54\u6027\u914d\u97f3\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u8ba9\u4eba\u89c9\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u559c\u611f\uff0c\u603b\u5f97\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u6b3e\u597d\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1496479713, "timestamp_updated": 1496479713, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622827", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32144276": {"recommendationid": "32144276", "author": {"steamid": "76561198373866849", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10848, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514782491}, "language": "english", "review": "i like this game ,but i hope this game can have more different character to catch ,but still the best game i play ever!!!!!!  hope the director can think about my suggest>>>>>>\n", "timestamp_created": 1496465347, "timestamp_updated": 1496465347, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499647", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32141582": {"recommendationid": "32141582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127498455", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492011308}, "language": "english", "review": "YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE", "timestamp_created": 1496452505, "timestamp_updated": 1496452505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496972", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32122900": {"recommendationid": "32122900", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264962169", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 477, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498707142}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u56de\u4e8bi?\u600e\u4e48  \u4e2d\u6587\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cc\u8fb9\u4e00\u822c\u662f\u82f1\u6587\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8bf4\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u90e8\u4f5c\u54c1\u5f88\u5931\u671b\u5f88\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u90a3\u5947\u602a\u7684\u82f1\u6587\u5b57\u4f53\u6709\u600e\u4e48\u89e3\u91ca\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1496385521, "timestamp_updated": 1496385521, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.430139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32094411": {"recommendationid": "32094411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088823168", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508012071}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a couple of beanie babies sluggin it out.", "timestamp_created": 1496264737, "timestamp_updated": 1496264737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "32092548": {"recommendationid": "32092548", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115812513", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 74, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1516320979}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty good.

The art direction is perfect, the music is outstanding (just the best).\n\nThe turn-based gameplay is a blast.

I'm having a hard time trying to figure out what the hell it is I need to do to... just DO things sometimes. It makes it very frustrating. I feel like this should be as effortless to understand as other Behemoth games, but sometimes when I thought I could do something, I end up pressing every key, controller, or mouse button to try to find out what it was.\n\nAlso, sometimes you can accidentally get trapped between conflicts you don't want to. Repeatedly. There is no \"flee\" command, or if there is, it's a real bitch to find. Your only option is to be trapped between fights until you kill off your party. Yes, there is a \"stun\" cannon on your wagon, fairly early on, but it's not great, and there is so much pomp involved with restarting after you accidentally got trapped between a couple of overpowered enemies. Yes, I know, you should avoid those situations, but when you do get into one, I'd rather not have to reload the game (I keep on fighting them to the bitter end, despite my knowing they will stomp me). In some ways, this is worse that random encounters. In games with random encounters, I usually can run away.\n\nOverall, though, it's great so far. The basic, underlying game is amazing.

You find out there is nothing left to do but fight in the pit. BUT THEN you realize no one is ever online or worse yet, there is no one online that wants to fight in the pit. There is a setting that allows you to fight people from other countries instead of just people in the same country as you, but still after 15 minutes of waiting still no one will join.

Play with a friend. or B.) play on the weekend afternoon because that's the only time you're gonna find at least one other player to play against. \n\nMaybe once the game comes out of early access (which who knows how long that will take) more people will buy the game.

sunk a pretty notable portion of my playtime so far just running around the open world and capturing opponents for their gear or to build new teams, and the gameplay surrounding the constant goal of collecting a lot of dudes is excellent. \n\npit people puts the sorts of elements into the tactics rpg genre that you would expect from the behemoth (battles are super chaotic and shit explodes constantly, you can't directly influence every single thing your units do to the same degree that you can in other games, etc) and it works shockingly well. i didn't really feel the gameplay (worth noting that this has only been in early access for like 3 months as of this review) growing stagnant, largely because the tone and pace are preeetty casual and laid back most of the time, and battles are visually entertaining enough that things consistently feel interesting and new.\n\nthe only current downside is the actual story is super dang short, but again, early access, and i believe the next update is focused on story improvements so no big deal there. there's also enough side content to keep you entertained for at least a dozen or two hours, w/ sidequests being available both at your hub and scattered across the world, and the whole appeal of the \"gotta catch em all\" kinda gameplay. the humor can be a bit hit or miss if you aren't into poop jokes, i guess, so that's worth noting. also, i haven't tried the coop or multiplayer in general yet, so i can't weigh in on that.\n\npit people's a promising as hell title though, i rarely play an early access game and immediately

Amazing competitive play that lets you try and go againts many types of enemy comps also co-op it\u00b4s really fun and would definitely recomend getting a friend to play with.\n\nA little bit on the down side, game it\u00b4s still on an early stage and while PVP/co-op it\u00b4s practically fully implemented the current campaign is very short, however theres A LOT of mini quests to play and they are fairly challenging and fun, theres a good amount of units to costumize your team and strategy but would love to see more units get added in the future.\n\nSee you guys in the pit!\n\nEdit: I think i have played this quite a while now to write a fair review, while the game is very good considering how much of it we get to play, it becomes quite dull once you have completed all the missions and it becomes a game where you just farm until you get that cosmetic thing you wanted or capture that rare enemy on some mission, dont get me wrong, i like that but i wish that there was more to it, like ultra hard missions with unique equipment loot, the pit is also very easy to grind and that golden gear well i wish it was more of a challenge to get, the pvm pit side can be farmed really easy and the pvp side its empty 23hours a day, its almost impossible to get a match, i wish they would nerf the pvm rewards (pit points, money and loot) and add a little buff to the pvp maybe just like the pvm, win 3 in a row get a bigger reward or anything else i dont know just something that attracts more people to pvp rather than the endless farm.\n\nNow my main issue with the game is combat, whiles theres many combinations and character you can choose from, combat gets quite repetitive and boring later on, i feel like theres not enough creatures to actually make combat diverse, also the little interactivity just makes it boring after playing it several hours i really hope a lot more creatures get added in the future as well as something that makes combat more interactive, maybe somekind of unique special ability depending of whos your team leader, this game need work but it isnt bad at all, i would have gladly payed twice the amount for it on its current state.", "timestamp_created":

I enjoyed this game a lot because of the unique Behemoth art style and all the humor. But the game lacks a little bit in story content. The story quests can be finished in around 2-4 hours. I'm more into the story of the Behemoth games , so I stopped playing after that and a few side quests. Sure , there are a lot of side quests but I'm not really interested into those. That doesn't mean I don't like the game , it just means that there's a lack in story content but it's still fun to play. I've stopped playing it for now but I will continue to play when more Story quests are added. The music , environment , voices and everything else is top-notch.

And provides a new \"Chess-like\" turn based fighting system that also breaks out of there \"Hack and slash\" fighting style they had for Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers, while also completly move away from the side scrollers such as from the previously mentioned and Battle Block Theater. While also introducing even more of a variety of weapons then Castle Crashers, but allows the use of different effects from different armor, swords, sheilds, and characters.

Okay first of all if you are a fan of turn based strategy and must play all of them stop reading this and buy the game now.  If you are new to the genre but are interested in tactical games I can truly recommend this for you.  If you are seasoned turn based strategy fan this is also for you.  For starters I want to say that the combat is very well streamlined.  In most TBS games you move your character, choose a direction and then choose a type of attack.  If you are a healer you choose your character,  move him into position, choose your spell and finally heal who you want to heal.  In Pit Poeple this ihs simplified.  The healer character will simply heal whoever it can within it's range while dealing damage to itself.  This may seem oversimplified but it tends to work and speed up the healing process. \n\nCombat is also streamlined and faced paced.  You simple move your character into postion and he will choose to attack whomever he wants.  It sounds dumb but it works well in the game.  There area good amount of weapons, armor and charactrer classes to keep you guys.\n\nIn terms of audio the music is just simply fantastic,  You can tell they had alot of fun coming up with great lively muslc that will tickle your funny bone.  Sounds effects and the narration is through the roof.  I did find some of the jokes totally lame but In the spirit of the game it was perfect.\n\nTo sum it up,  I'm an avid TBS gamer and this was a complete and total surprise!\n\n+Excellent animation and graphics\n+Psuedo open world gameplay\n+Excellent memorable soundtrack and voice acting\n+Simplified TBS controls that are streamlined and keeps it fast paced\n\n-Main quest super short\n-still in early access\n\nOnce this game is complete I can recommend it to anyone who has ever liked a TBS tacitcal game.

Pit people![/h1]\n\nPit People es  un juego que actualmente se encuentra en Early Acces, y que, seg\u00fan sus desarrolladores podr\u00eda seguir unos cuantos meses m\u00e1s hasta estar terminado. Un juego que ha d\u00eda de hoy ofrece una escasa campa\u00f1a principal, de  unas 2-3 misiones, que pueden llevarte 5 horas como mucho. Sin embargo el objetivo de Behemoth es el de construir un juego que te de infinitas horas, no solo con una campa\u00f1a mucho mas amplia si no con contenido secundario practicamente infinito. Y es precisamente eso, lo que hace a este juego tan especial, tiene una cantidad de contenido increible, incluso a d\u00eda de hoy en early acces puedes jugar much\u00edsimas misiones secundarias y otros modos de juego que ahora vamos a comentar. \n\nPero primero veremos que es Pit people, que tipo de juego y en que genero se le puede colocar. Pit people es un juego de estrategia rolera por turnos, juegos que \u00faltimamente est\u00e1n bastante de moda en la estrateg\u00eda. Un juego que se basa en el movimiento por hex\u00e1gonos que conforman un mapa distinto en cada combate, su sistema de lucha es bastante peculiar, tenemos unas mec\u00e1nicas bas\u00edcas de movimiento y acci\u00f3n que consisten en, colocar una unidad en la casilla adyacente a un enemigo y entrar en combate con \u00e9l de forma autom\u00e1tica, con la novedad de que nuestros personajes toman sus propias decisiones, si tienes que atacar a 2 enemigos cercanos, ser\u00e1 el personaje el que decida a cual de ellos ataca, igual que si una unidad tiene que elegir entre 2 aliados a los que curar, ser\u00e1 ella quien lo elija, aunque por supuesto puedes forzarlo tu, dandole solo una opci\u00f3n a tu unidad.\n  \nUn sistema de roles para nuestras unidades, unidades mas pesadas, otras unidades para capturar enemigos y unirlos a nuestro bando, otras para curar, algunas de rango etc.. \u00bfY c\u00f3mo le das a una unidad su rol?; pues con el equipamiento. Todas las unidades tienen una base pasiva, unas habilidades que no puedes cambiar por que son \u00fanicas de cada unidad, pero am\u00e9n de eso puedes modificar una unidad y convertirla, en una unidad de ataque pesado, o de defensa etc... \nY hay entra en juego otro apartado importante, que es el equipamiento y el rol en general. Nuestras unidades tendr\u00e1n unas estad\u00edsticas base que serviran de orientaci\u00f3n para saber como rinde nuestro personaje. Podremos tener un m\u00e1ximo de 6 unidades que podremos cambiar en cualquier momento en nuestra base para organizar cientos de estrategias y equipos posibles. El equipamiento le dar\u00e1 a la unidad personalidad, puedes equiparle un escudo pesado, ligero, medio etc... Con eso har\u00e1s que la unidad tenga mas resistencia ante disparos a distancia, pero seg\u00fan el tipo de arma que eligas tambi\u00e9n afectar\u00e1 a su movimiento en la batalla, el juego te da una cantidad considerable de opciones para que vaya jugando a tu gusto. \n\nPit People transcurre en un basto mapa por el que te vas moviendo con una caravana, un mapa lleno de sitios para explorar, misiones que hacer y enfrentamientos que te lo har\u00e1n pasar realmente mal, pues la dificultad del juego es bastante amplia, adem\u00e1s tanto el l\u00edmite de inventario como el hecho de que si pierdes todas las unidades perder\u00e1s todos los objetos que hayas obtenido en tu viaje, le dan al juego un toque survival muy interesante. Aunque solo tendr\u00e1s que volver a la ciudad de vez en cuando para reponerte, a no ser, que pruebes el modo de dificultad mas alto, en el cual si pierdes un soldado, ser\u00e1 para siempre!!. Por supuesto es un juego en el que, cuanto mas secundarias hagas mejor equipado ir\u00e1s y mas f\u00e1cil ser\u00e1 enfrentarte e los enemigos. \n\nPor otro lado a parte de todo lo que ofrece el juego por s\u00ed, su campa\u00f1a, la exploraci\u00f3n, las secundarias etc.. Tambi\u00e9n tendr\u00e1s otros modos de juegos con los que pasar el rato como la Arena. Un lugar donde puedes enfrentarte tanto PVP como PVE a oleadas de enemigos, un reto bastante grande y ademas competitivo, pues tendr\u00e1s que mejorar tus puntuaciones para ascender en las listas clasificatorias. \n\nPit People es un juego muy divertido, pero si algo puedes sacar a relucir es, sin duda, el sello Behemoth. Su dise\u00f1o tanto art\u00edstico, su banda sonora, su est\u00e9tica gamberra, todo es MUY descabellado y muy loco. Es un juego en el que no puedes parar de reirte, por que tiene un humor adulto y bizarro a mas no poder que enamora. Sus personajes y su argumento son increibles, te har\u00e1 pasar unas tardes cojonudas te lo aseguro. \n\n[b][u]En definitiva tenemos un juego terriblemente divertido, con el que te reiras, sudaras tinta, siempre tendr\u00e1s cosas que hacer y que solo podr\u00eda ponerle de pega el que no est\u00e9 terminado a\u00fan!! Un juego que no pod\u00e9is perderos, un juego altamente recomendado![/u]", "timestamp_created": 1490277187, "timestamp_updated": 1490277658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656071", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30681368": {"recommendationid": "30681368", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085007879", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490716180}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a review from playing a fair amount in Early Acces. Note that my experience is from update 2/3 era so if you are reading this at a later time it might not be matching what the game currently is.\n\nThe Feel:\nThis is a perfect game for people that like silly things. There is weird humor and references going on all over the place. The one story mission and the few side missions that are available for play at the moment are really fun. There is also enough going on the world map to keep you busy.\n\nGameplay:\nAs this is a sort of tactical positioning game mixed with random elements, it does pretty much what it says on the box. You set up your team of silly fighters, you place them where you want them to go and chaos happens. This is not a bad thing. Even when I am defeated I can sigh with a smile. Just the sheer amount of weaponised silly items (giant banana, crazy hats, throwing a gun at someone called \"self defense\") just makes me laugh every time i see a new item. At the time of writing there are about a 1000 items to collect in the game to customize your fighters with, and every time I run into a new pack of fighters with new hats/weapons I get excited. The fact that you can only take the last standing opponent with you makes it so you have to choose which of the shiny new things you want NOW :).\n\nRegarding the price:\nWorth every penny. You buy it once, and then you have hours worth of gameplay, especially when you consider there is a great amount of \"gotta catch 'em all\" involved.\n\nRegarding replayability:\nIn update 3 they added some daily tasks to do co-op with a buddy. Also you get an \"Emperor's order\" to give you some extra items the moment you complete a specific task. As these orders are infinite its a fine extra reward for stuff you'd be doing anyway. I think the biggest thing going for this game is definitely the collection of custom appearances and items that you can acquire. \n\nAny cons?:\nLike I said, it's still under developtment. I didn't notice anything that would interrupt the gameplay experience in terms of bugs or so. \nThat being said I'd like to see less daily tournament points awarded for people using the auto battler (that's right, you can even play your own fights as a spectator, while the computer dukes it out). At the moment I believe the ratio in the unfair challenge is that  you get half points if auto battler was used during a fight. Since I use auto-battler a couple of times during the day for a few fights and still finished high up, I think the rate should be lower so that people that actually fight their own battles can feel more achievement. But then again I think this will be less of an issue when the player pool increases.\n\nFinal thoughts?\nA great game for its price, especially when you are a completionist. As there is plenty of auto-save going on, it can also be played in short spans for when you only have a little time to relax.

I have a team that are all around level 60 but they are still doing the same damage and taking the same damage from enemies I fought at level 1. Aside from the free health from leveling up there needs to be a little bif more of a reward there.\n\nThe map is nice and open, with the idea of constanly changing the area you're in makes it feel some what fresh each time. The enemy placement is nice and diverse and there are enemies where you'd expect them to be, like robots in the techno zones and monsters in the gloomy areas. A few things could be explained the how the turbo effects the enemies and also shooting the sparkly ground gives you plenty of coins. I have yet to figure out what pushing all the buttons around the world map does but I'm working on that.\n\nThe sound track so far is catchy, that's the best way to describe it. A few more tunes would be nice if those songs were given to specific battles. Like say you're fighting mainly humans you'd play X song, then if you go over to the undead area there would be a chance to play a uniqe undead song out of the main soundtrack for the rest of the world. But that's a personal idea.\n\nAnother thing I would like to see is a little more interaction with the speaker, like a in combat modifier so if you're doing well he suddenly feels like you should die, special units the narator summons spawns on the enemy's team, like wise if you're losing.

Did you regret, not being able to shoot your enemies with a bow made from roses, while wearing a bow tie and a top hat?\n\nIn this case, Pit People might be your saviour. This colourful and humorous turn-based strategy-game is not only easily accessible for rookies, but offers an enjoyable experience for everyone with a taste for absurd humour. While it does offer you a Co-op-mode, it is equally as fun to play just by yourself. Quests and fights do not take a lot of time, allowing for a player to drop in or out, even if he has merely a few minutes time. That said, the customization-feature would let you spend hours, equipping your recruits with ridiculous outfits and weapons, if you so desire. Quests and storylines are filled with pop-cultural references and the soundtrack is certainly unique.\nA minor point of criticism is the lack of information concerning status/wapon effects.

You prepare your team of 6 fighters (selected from a growing pool of available fighters) with weapons and armour, then venture out in search of enemies to battle. You can either just go out and battle random enemies (they are all over the place) or else follow the quests. When you defeat an enemy, instead of wiping out all the fighters, you can capture the last one with a cage and recruit him into your squad. After a victorious battle you have to make it back to the village where all your loot is redeemed. If you're intercepted by another enemy on the journey back you risk having to battle them and lose your loot from the first encounter, but if you pay attention you can avoid this by using the cannons on the wagon to stun the enemies and slip past them, or use nitro to mow them down!\n\nThe battles are turn-based, played out on a hex board. The way I've played there's not really much thinking involved and it's quite fast-paced. You move each fighter into position one by one then hit the spacebar to proceed, and they each make their own decisions about which enemies to hit. As they inflict damage and defeat enemy fighters they gain XP, making them stronger for future battles. The different weapons/armour you give them also make a difference to the team dynamics, if you want to get down to the nitty gritty. My 4 melee, 1 ranged and one healer has served me well so far.\n\nInside the village you can buy new equipment in the market with the gold you've made on your excursions and play around with squad customisation, replacing members and switching equipment around. You can fight the AI in the Pit (within the home village) to gain some quick XP and gold, although I haven't had much success in there, I think I need to improve my team strength a bit more. You can use the big phone to dial up a PvP battle - I haven't managed to get a match yet but I haven't been too patient. This is a popular game so in general I don't anticipate any problems finding matches should I want to get involved with that later. At the moment I have more than enough to keep me busy with the singleplayer campaign.\n\nThe quests (which you can pick up in the village) advance the storyline as you defeat and rescue various characters along the way. The cutscenes are a highly anticipated treat.\n\nController is supported but mouse is better.\n\n[h1]Artwork[/h1]\n\nWhen you look closely at the cartoony graphics you realise there's a great deal of detail here. Everywhere you go, the screen is packed with a seemingly endless array of funny looking enemies, absurd weapons and fabulous cutscenes. You never know what delightful thing you're going to discover next and it keeps you motivated to continue.\n\n[h1]Sound[/h1]\n\nThe first thing I want to talk about is the theme tune. In my reviews I always comment on the quality of the music, but I'm always judging it as game-music, I would never dream of adding it to my actual music collection. Here is the first exception I've ever encountered. It's an awesome, rocking beat that belongs in the real music charts. The down side is that I have trouble starting the game. I sit at the main menu with my mouse hovering over the start icon, my neck jerking like a strutting pigeon. When I finally manage to tear myself away from that tune and log in to the game there are more great tunes to enjoy - selectable on the gramophone in the village - it's all very original, memorable and suits the game down to a tee.\n\nWill Stamper's voice acting has reached legendary status in the game world, his narration alone is worth the price of admission. There is no other voice like it. The absurd silliness and the way he yells \"shut up!\" is something I could listen to all day long. There is a lot of his voice in the game, but there is also a lot of content so naturally it's rather spread out, in the cutscenes and the odd impatient comment during battles telling you to get a move on. For me it's the main highlight of the game.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\n\nOn normal setting the singleplayer campaign and quests are fairly easy. I've won nearly all battles by just pushing my melee fighters towards the enemy and keeping my ranged and healer further away. In the home village there's an 'insane difficulty' switch that I dare not touch. I assume that you'd need to pay far more attention to the strengths and weaknesses of your team and your weapons in that mode.\n\nThe Pit is difficult even on normal setting - you have to win 2 out of 3. I can usually win the first round but my team's health stays depleted for the next battle and I always lose. Perhaps I'll have better luck later on when my team has levelled up more.\n\nIn conclusion, for me the enjoyment of the game is in the content so I'm glad that the battling is nice and easy and allows me to progress and discover it all without any hold-ups or frustration.\n\n[h1]Performance[/h1]\n\nThe game is in Early Access but if you weren't aware of that fact you would never guess. There is still more content to come for the single player campaign, that's why it's in EA, but it already feels like a full game. Totally bug-free as far as I can tell, tons of content and it just generally feels finished and polished.\n\nWindows only, but there is a firm promise of Mac/Linux on release.\n\n[h1]Value[/h1]\n\nAfter 10 hours of gameplay I've barely scratched the surface. My overall progress bar currently sits at 10% so that should give you an idea of the amount of content here, not to mention online PvP multiplayer battling. It's not only the amount of content that's impressive, but the general quality of every aspect of it. The price right now is a steal and you should grab it right away - there will be a price increase after final release.\n\n[h1]Steam[/h1]\n\nAchievements, cloud support, local/online co-op, local/online multiplayer. No trading cards but in this case it really doesn't matter. If you're going to let that influence your decision to buy then you're crazy.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nThe battling gameplay isn't exactly ground breaking or unique but it's very well implemented and satisfying. Everything else about the game - storyline, humour, voice acting, music, artwork, animation is absolutely outstanding. If you don't normally go for turn-based strategy, this is still a game you will love just for the bonkers fun of it all.\n\nThe Behemoth: \"We Make Games\".

To be clear the game is cheaper now than it will be at full launch price according to the Early Access description. I must say, I seriously think it's worth considering. This is easily the most fun I've had with an Early Access title ever and it has enough staying power to the point where I think one could get their money's worth in its current state if they are interested in its concepts.\n\nPit People is an easy to play/learn strategy RPG, with complicated customisable units and simple execution. You control up to six units (although some units allow you to break this rule) in a match by simply moving them in the general vicinity of their target. Potential targets/enemies on the map are highlighted and your selected unit automatically chooses how, depending on the distance between itself and its target, and who to attack. You can play the entire game smoothly on a controller and the AI is pretty decent, ensuring both allies and enemies offer some unique and interesting tactics. Your units can only heal outside of battle via campfires or the central hub, by levelling up during battle, or by a healing unit which sacrifices some of its own life, like a selfless and sweet prince. Battles are paced in such a way where you can finish a match easily in under half an hour (in some cases much less than that even) or marathon a chain of battles for several hours. The rewards for victory get extremely funky and allow you to try out new strategies or run different parties the next time you battle. They can range from equipment, to swords, to bows, to funny hats and hairstyles, to records, to memes, and... JUST GOOD STUFF WORTH HAVING AROUND OKAY?!\n\nYou are capable of capturing additional units, which can live peacefully outside of battle in the barracks. The satisfaction of meeting the capturing requirement, leave the wanted unit the last thing standing and utilize a capture unit with a cage, is a fun twist on the regular battle and can leave some interesting results during and after each encounter. Wanting to capture a stronger unit means you have to keep them alive on the battlefield, a threat to your team, same goes for a unit that may walk straight into your sword to protect a friend. This DOES include story driven bosses, which is quite satisfying alongside their COOL NAMES and COOL EQUIPMENT. Oh, and I guess the fact that you have the strength of someone relevant to the story, or something...\n\nSpeaking of story, what's there is pretty good! Admittedly the main story seems to be restrained prior to the full release, but it's still worth playing it through! There are many sidequests, scattered amongst the easy to traverse and diverse overworld as well as inside the castle hub thingamajig with a variety of objectives and peculiar battle scenarios. As someone who has played most, if not all of Behemoth's games, this is by far the funniest and my favorite in terms of story. You also get loyalty loot you might actually like for owning their past games! Stamper is in FULL FORCE as a narrator* and the dialogue between characters and the names of wondrous locales, is charming and delightful! Also pretty messed up sometimes! It doesn't overstay its welcome and is amiable in itself!\n\nThe game features some appealing multiplayer modes as well! You can compete with others on a leaderboard for daily special loot dependant on your ranking in THE PIT (filled with people), it's something which I've been extremely enjoying quite A BIT (not with people). Unfortunately I have been unable to test out the PVP and local/online co-op modes with others at the time of this review. That said THE PIT RULES (vs. AI) and the game is still fun, even running solo. Pit People is compatible with two players for the every mode, local and online, same goes for the four player battle mode. I do dream of the day I can try these modes. Hopefully I will...\n\nPit People as far as I can tell, is a game definitely worth playing, even in Early Access. With a lot of interesting and varied characters, a bundle of laughs, low pc spec requirements, multiple multiplayer modes, a new easy to learn/difficult to master spin on the SRPG genre, flexible play sessions, player driven initiative, policeman cupcakes called copcakes and MORE, I can, at this time, wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's by far my favorite Behemoth game. I do hope you consider playing it at some point. It's pretty good. There's a lot of stuff to do in it. It's a good time. Either way, Love & Respect!\n\nTL;DR - Good Early Access, easy to play SRPG game with new ideas and intriguing charm. A great entry point for the genre as well. If you think you're interested now, yeah, buying it is a good idea. It's supposedly cheaper for the time being too. Also CUTE CUPCAKES WITH POLICE HATS CALLED COPCAKES, 10/10!!!

I haven't tried out the multiplayer, but its not a draw for me. \n\nAlthough I love the game , Behemoth, and I'm happy to support them with my purchase, my 9 year old who LOVES all of the other Behemoth games doesn't even want to try the game out. I fear they missed the biggest consumer age group that drives their sales with this game. Here's hoping they are working on Castle Crashers 2 or Battle Block Theater 2 because this title might cause a huge problem for the studio if they don't come up with some way to draw in the younger players.\n\nI don't feel drawn to play the game repeatedly like I was with Castle Crashers or Battle Block Theater. Most of the replay value of those games were the easter eggs, leveling, and my son pushing me to play with him.

This game is really enjoyable if you have a few friends to play with!\n2. The system off the turn based and fightning can be rather fun!\n3.

"playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491669644}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought this game based on the fact that it had an incredible 97% positive score from over 2300 reviews and Stamper voice acting. For the first hour or so I was very entertained by Stamper, but I noticed the combat felt extremely simplistic. By the last couple of hours I played it for I was half-convinced I was just not understanding the greatness that clearly must be there based on the reviews. After reading the negative reviews I think maybe I'm not crazy and the gameplay in general is very shallow.\n\nI get that some people probably really like the collectathon aspect of the game where you capture all these different creatures, but when it comes right down to it all you're really doing is moving characters to appropriate hexes and ending your turn while hoping they crit with their one attack which you don't even get to decide who it's used on in many cases. \nEven the gear you equip your characters with has no real effect besides a few preset options like sword with shield or sword with bigger shield. The sword might be a candy cane or a golf club and the shield might be a cake or a playing card, but that has absolutely no effect other than cosmetic customization.\n\nIt seems like a lot of people are very loyal to Behemoth and I get that maybe they're also investing in the potential greatness of the game down the road, but as it stands this game is absolutely not one of the Best games on Steam in my opinion like the ratings would have you believe. I hardly ever review anything unless I think the reviews are very skewed in a way I don't agree with and this is one of those cases. I do not at all believe this game is worth $15 in its current state, but I understand why some people might buy it in good faith that it will be in the future and then some. To anyone else reading this please do more research on this game rather than relying on the review system if that $15 matters to you.\n\nEdit: Just a recommendation. I found a game called Battle Brothers that is a turn based tactics game somewhat similar to this one that I would highly recommend you save your money for over this game. The actual replay value of this other game is much higher than this one. There are far more options to customize your team beyond aesthetics and that game is highly recommended without the need for fanboys to automatically give it a positive review since it's by a studio I haven't heard of and I don't know if they even have any other games. \n\nI tried to play Pit People a few weeks ago to see if anything had improved, but the mind numbing repetitive nature of the gameplay instantly turned me off. I again highly recommend you do more research through gameplay videos rather than listen to reviews on Steam. This game can be summed up as kind of a silly chess with very little player agency. The style and vo is again very good, but the actual gameplay is garbage in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1487786503, "timestamp_updated": 1493334552, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590507", "comment_count": "45", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30103514": {"recommendationid": "30103514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155151262", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 249, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489835123}, "language": "french", "review": "super bon jeu", "timestamp_created": 1487784579, "timestamp_updated": 1487784579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30102232": {"recommendationid": "30102232", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124316036", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 899, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506714952}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440, \u043e\u043d \u041b\u0412\u041b\u0430\u043f\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b \u0437\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 (\ufeff \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1487780397, "timestamp_updated": 1487780397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30101828": {"recommendationid": "30101828", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313039195", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1032, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489675456}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd8\u597d\u5427\uff0c\u86ee\u6709\u8da3\u7684\uff0c\u73a9\u591a\u4e86\u5c31\u6709\u70b9\u65e0\u804a\u4e86\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u5267\u60c5", "timestamp_created": 1487778944, "timestamp_updated": 1487778944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30101362": {"recommendationid": "30101362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125936808", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487931848}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a very good game, to be early acces.", "timestamp_created": 1487777334, "timestamp_updated": 1487777334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30101345": {"recommendationid": "30101345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007377730", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498345327}, "language": "english", "review": "really really fun and nice twist on the turnbased.

Pit People features many recruitable characters, including (but not limited to) Pixies, Spiderpeople, Unicorns, Cannibals, Zombies, Gnomes, Cupcakes, Mushrooms, Robots, and a pesky moustachioed man named Horatio.\n\nIn Pit People, William Andrew Stamper is the incredibly charismatic and not-at-all-psychotic Narrator, just as he was in Battleblock Theatre.\n\n[h1] Now, onto the gameplay itself. [/h1]\n\nWhile it is early access, the combat is still quite sound, and I've yet to encounter any bugs. One of the only issues that I've encountered is the fact that the main storyline is incredibly short (which is understandable, given the fact that the game is still in Early Access). Despite this, there are still dozens of side-quests to occupy your time, as well as multi-player combat in The Pit.\n\nJust like Battleblock Theatre and Castles Crashers, you can play the majority of the game with another player, in Co-Op Mode. Unlike BT and CC, you can only play multiplayer Co-Op with ONE other player (which is understandable, it would be rather difficult to balance a four-player Co-Op combat system, unless every player was restricted to 3 fighters instead of the usual 6.)\n\n\n[b] I highly recommend this game for people who enjoy turn-based combat and comedy similar to Battleblock Theatre and Castle Crashers.

Let me explain why.\n\nPit People is a great game and yet another instant hit, like Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theater before it. It might seem like youtuber bait at first glance, with all the \"memes\" and (literaly) toilet humor, but it's got depth, it's got great customisation and it's got humor that is gonna appeal to all ages. The Behemoth team delivered again (might I mention, they are the only devs with multiple games that all have 95% on steam I know) and I'm looking forward to watching the game evolve and grow.\n\nNow let's get started for the actual review. As you might have already noticed, the aesthetic is very similiar to the previous games. The similarities don't end there either. You will often encounter creatures from the previous games and all kind of other references. These apear mostly in a huge variety of costumes and already mentioned creatures. \n\nSo how is Pit People different? Well, almost everything else is new. The combat system is turn based, kind of simplistic but very well implemented. Each creature has its own (mostly passive) abilities and stats, which can further be modified by items and weapons. Latter stands mostly for humans. There are four different types of elemental damage (fire, explosion, poison and ice), but there are also helmets and shields, armor, dodge and many more mechanics, that make fighting interesting (hint - stay AWAY from the farting mushrooms).\n\nYour base of operation is a town where you pick quests, equip items, fight in a pit or simply buy new items and fighters (there is no need for that really, as you frequently get them during wandering anyway). Once you set foot on the huge map, you encounter various groups of enemies, which you can avoid or fight. You can also pick up new quests on the fly, ranging from quite a selection. I've heard there are more than 100 avaliable.\n\nAnother big thing I've yet to mention - co-op. It's not 100% required in order to have fun, but it helps to have a partner. You both plan out your turn at the same time and due to much larger number of fighters, it can really get quite chaotic (which suits the theme of the game). However a thing that has been bothering is the camera, which is quite wonky during co-op battles, expecialy on larger maps. But hey, that's why early access exists. \n\nThe last thing I'd like to cover is the look, sound and narration. I've already stated the cartoonish look suits the game perfectly and I stand by it. Naration is done by Will Stamper, same old cynical guy you've had to put up with in Battleblock Theater. He does a fantastic job in being both annoying and funny at the same time, pestering your heroes and making smug remarks. The soundtrack is great as well and I haven't gotten bored by it even after 10 hours of play. \n\nConclusion\nWould I recommend Pit People? You bet your ass I would. It might not be 100% finished, expecialy the main story is lacking at the moment and I hope more creatures get introduced during development. Still, the game is well worth its price and has made me chuckle many times (expecialy some of the names). It's just as silly as it is serious and the combination simply works.

I didn't finish the main story line yet because I don't usually do that during Early Access phase or I wouldn't play the main story after its full release. But despite that, I've finished necessary main quests to enjoy the game's full aspect and some few sub-quests.\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\n So having played only intro missions, so far the story is funny yet very random! So far, I have no desire to finish the main story during early access phase, I cannot say much about it at this moment. Sub-quests are also great as situations often go hilariously unexpected. So far people are saying main story is quite short so I hope main story becomes longer than it is and maybe more sub-quests!\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n There are huge customization options in Pit People. Every units can fit into different roles depending on which weapons, shields and helmet you desire to put them on. As you explore the overworld, there are different unit types you can \"recruit\" by capturing them like Pokemon. Many of these units carry different avatars of item types, so capturing them becomes addictive. Although there are currently 19 types of units in this game, I wish for more types of units to capture.\nHaving to level them up during progression makes your units personally attached. Unlike XCOM, there is no permadeath so it's okay for them to die. Permadeath would be another good addition if there will be a sandbox mode.\n\n As turn-based strategy game, the positioning is extremely important. Unlike other games, you only command your units to move in specific positions while they will do anything on their own to their possible attackable enemies. But don't worry, they will do their best to win the battle.\n\n The overworld is huge! There are 125 POIs you can explore and features many different biomes to sink your foot in. [strike]While it's very fun to explore these places, I wish for randomized sandbox mode, which would increase higher replayability in exploring, randomized quests.[/strike]\nOverworld is procedurally randomized, so hopefully there will be more than 125 POIs on full release as I am already reaching near 100%\n\n Co-op campaign and pvp are great options to enjoy with friends and strangers over Internet. These make perfect reason why capturing units outside of the city is more enjoyable. Seriously, Pit People needs more interesting unit types to \"recruit\"! There are many different things to try like Insane mode, the pit with AI vs Players and etc which increases replayability.\n\n[h1]AESTHETICS[/h1]\nArt style is very consistent across Behemoth games. Having played their older games back in Newgrounds, they still retains that funny and funky art style. Avatars for each units are usually random and hilarious, having 1357 of them are excellent! Only thing I would point out is that some vector graphics are pixelated when zoomed in, maybe this should be eradicated when leaving Early Access. Excellent sound design, love the vicious narrator, overall very good!\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\nEven though this is early access title, it's well polished, very fun, highly replayable. Pokemon aspect truly shines as well as team-building aspect of this game.

Al ser early access la historia principal se encuentra mayormente incompleta pero lo que juegues de ella lo disfrutaras bastante! Luego de que termines con ella aun quedan varias misiones secundarias que completar que te mantendran entretenido por horas.\n  Pit people cuenta tambien con un modo de pelea online en el que puedes enfrentarte contra oponentes en linea que cuenta con un scoreboard o marcador en el que vas subiendo a medida que ganas peleas con tu ejercito unico y totalmente personalizado a tu manera.\n Sin mucho mas que agregar y para mantener el review corto, recomiendo totalmente el juego incluso estando en early access.

Nuff said.\n\n[h1]The Actual Review[/h1]\nThe humor is crude in the most wonderful way and it suits the art style perfectly. Speaking of art style, it's the most adorable looking game I've seen in awhile, it's really dorky in all the right ways and it contrasts beautifully with the over the top violence that is the game. The overworld aspect is a weird mixture of the really old school Final Fantasy and Legend of Zelda games with Pokemon, a lot of people have compared this to pokemon on account of how you recruit new members for your roster.\n\nThe main villain is one of the best I've seen so far, and right on Par with Dusan from Watchdogs 2 (perhaps a controversial opinion but I really liked him as a villain) and his near constant interference in your affairs will keep you on your toes without being a pain. Not to mention his voice overs. I want to give special mention to the actor who voiced him because he is just wonderful.\n\nThe music is the other feature of this game that's absolutely stunning, it's an interesting line up of electroblends, from swing to funk and a few others in between, and if you get sick of the music in the city (which is pretty hard to do) you can always find records and unlock new songs to change it too. One of the best features is that the song will remain changed until you change it again, even if you leave the city and come back.\n\nPit People lures you in with it's charming villain, humorous story and adorable art style but make no mistake, it will not be an easy experience. The game is forgiving enough, as death only has consequences up until you return to the town, but the battles can quickly overwhelm you if you're not paying attention and often times you'll find yourself losing fighters without immediately realising why. This game is incredibly fun though and I don't think I could recommend it enough.", "timestamp_created": 1487004115, "timestamp_updated": 1487004115, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29902934": {"recommendationid": "29902934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170026963", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3985, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513502626}, "language": "english", "review": "THE MUSHROOMS ARE ADORABLE", "timestamp_created": 1487001419, "timestamp_updated": 1487001419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29902512": {"recommendationid": "29902512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095628917", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512354214}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is ridiculous and wonderful.

It's funny. And it's pokemon of sorts. It also is a tactical turn-based game, where you need to position your squad well, or face the consequences.\nLets get to cons. It should be a game. But as of now, this is just a humor collection (and not the finest one either, let's be honest). This \"game\" horribly lacks one thing, and one thing only: GAMEPLAY. If you pick a character \"A\" and a character \"B\" of the same race, the only difference it will have is their level (and i actually doubt that it even has any significance). You can wear same gear as your other character, so what's the point? And most of the gear has no difference exept the looks. You wanna crush your enemies with golden scepter? Sure. You wanna do it with a lolipop instead? Fine, it matters not. You can even pick the giant ice-cream cone and it will be still as good for crushing your enemies, as the sax or some actual mace (this is somewhat untrue, since really rarely you get the gear with additional effects, like fire resistance, poinsoned attacks and stuff. But still). My biggest porblem as of now is that on the Xth battle you get bored. You probably have same characters as you had X-1 battles before, so you just do the very same thing you did for X-1 battles before, and kill your enemies the very same way you killed them for X-1 battles before. WHY? I had 30 level ups already, can't i be somewhat stronger? Can't i have some new skills to test? The best way to describe this game would be \"like heroes of might and magic, but without heroes, and all you have is your army - which is forever limited to N units per squad\". But if, one day, having 2 cupcakes will mean more than x2 healing. If, one day, having hummie \"A\" will mean something different from having hummie \"B\". If, one day, Horatio will actually DIE. That day will be the day when this game becomes much better than it is now.\n\nTBH, i cant say that this game is bad, or good. It is neutral. If you want some funnies, you will find this game better than neutral; If you want to play a game, you will find this game worse than neutral. But i will press the \"not recommended\" button, just for the sake of keeping balance with all those \"recommended\" reviews this game already has. Besides, this is Early Access. The game still has more room for improvement.

The story is not complete yet but this game is pretty long so you will have plenty to do. This is a srategy game and thats pretty diffrent from BBT which was a platformer and CC which was just pretty much a combat game with sword fighting. It is open world and running into enemies will start a fight like in most RPG's so yeah if you don't want to fight don't run into them cause there is no fleeing feature.

This game has a shit ton of collectible items to keep you going if you're planning on completing the entire game and different types of quests - Being story quests, town quests and map quests - all to keep you busy throughout the game. The visuals are improving and the music & sound effects are better than ever. This game uses strategic plays and planning to get through and good use of the variety of units and customizations you have. Overall I think this game is great in its current state although it's in Early Access.

I had my qualms about them moving into strategy with game 4 (Pit People), despite the first 3 games all being different genres to each other & all being pretty good, especially the latter 2 (Castle Crashers & Battleblock Theatre).\n\nI ended up buying it yesterday, even with the Early Access tag & only a couple story missions currently... And boy, I love it already, this game has the funniest voice acting I've ever heard in a game, Will Stamper who did the voiceover for Battleblock Theatre smashes it out of the park this time, so, so funny.\n\nThe game plays a bit like a blend between XCOM & Pokemon with a shit ton of loot. a strategy game where you can capture the last monster in each fight & recruit them to your mismatched group of heroes. Despite the game only having a couple story missions at the minute, it's rammed with content currently, I suggest you all check it out, even if you have no intention of buying, just Youtube the first 15 minutes. I can't wait to see what happens next but I'm off to recruit some new madness!\n\nThe big difference between this and other hex based strategy games are that you don't pick actions for your characters, you simply move them & they do the rest. This adds depth that you wouldn't think of beforehand, & brings a whole heap of strategies to the table that you wouldn't think of in other hex games.\n\nThe graphics and music are what you expect from a Behemoth title, sharp & colourful, with the music being a highlight, I think this may be the best Behemoth soundtrack yet & that's saying a lot. Behemoth aren't done with adding music yet & will be releasing an OST for the soundtrack. I think this may be the first game soundtrack I ever buy, the music is that good.\n\n- I'm not funny or creative enough to write a review that would fully give the game the appreciation it's worth, but I couln't recommend this game enough for people with a sense of humour, or even slightly enjoy strategy, loot, Pokemon, wierdness, or if you like to smile while playing.\n\nTL;DR - Youtube the first 15-20 minutes of Pit People, funniest game I've played in 25+ years of gaming.\n\nI'd rate this game at 8/10 for the moment, as people who don't enjoy grinding or \"catching them all\", may get somewhat bored without the story being there. I'm sure this will be higher when the full release comes around.", "timestamp_created": 1486804483, "timestamp_updated": 1486907275, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29842539": {"recommendationid": "29842539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148035857", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487691802}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great game by the behemoth", "timestamp_created": 1486803291, "timestamp_updated": 1486803291, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29842407": {"recommendationid": "29842407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316404771", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486385468}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u6709\u8da3", "timestamp_created": 1486802823, "timestamp_updated": 1486802823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29841805": {"recommendationid": "29841805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125047480", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498324555}, "language": "english", "review": "This game gave me the cancer antibody for the cancer for honor gave me", "timestamp_created": 1486800403, "timestamp_updated": 1486800403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29841020": {"recommendationid": "29841020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061100201", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505965248}, "language": "english", "review": "a mixture of castle crashers, xcom, maybe even pokemon??\ngreat voice acting from the narrator aka main villain\nvarious heroes type (humans, vampires, pixies, even cupcakes) that can you modify as you like\n\n\n\n10/10 would save the wedding's cake again by killing the bridegroom", "timestamp_created": 1486797268, "timestamp_updated": 1486797268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29840732": {"recommendationid": "29840732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018222149", "num_games_owned": 182, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486795967}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know why people say this game has great mechanics, it has terrible mechanics.

It's fast to finish your turn just a few clicks, that's right, there's no special type of attacks your characters can use. It's more about type type of charcters and types of equipment that just leveling up.\n\nThis game also features pvp, very fun and easy to start playing, there was not once i felt like i was under leveled or overleveled in pvp, but like i was outplayed or someone with more knowleage than me. You get rewarded with gold and points by completing these pvp (you can also play with the AI but you have to go though extra rounds) The points are your rank, there are three stages. Bronze, Siver and Gold. The higher the better the rewards are.\n\nNot going to give out spoliers but i'll say this game has pretty good comedy with the story, it's not fully finished but it's getting there!\n\nThe charcters you get are fun and different to use, like humans,  they can use different types of swords, clubs, bows and some throwable stuff. The Cyclops who can gaint weapons, clubs and send people flying! There is even cupcakes, wraths and other scary and funny allys (or foes)\n\nI'll give this game a 9.0 A bit hard to get into, but theres is so many laughs and adventures to be had in this game!

(Like a spear perhaps?)\nAnyway, its a great game and DEFINITELY worth every dollar!", "timestamp_created": 1486511859, "timestamp_updated": 1486511859, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29771469": {"recommendationid": "29771469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072246169", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489979172}, "language": "english", "review": "Do you like Battle Block Theater and Stategy then this is the game for you! :D", "timestamp_created": 1486510067, "timestamp_updated": 1486510067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29771461": {"recommendationid": "29771461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051919551", "num_games_owned": 546, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 33, "last_played": 1515388663}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "N\u00e3o sei a quantos anos estava com este jogo na minha lista de desejos, tive a sorte de jog\u00e1-lo no closed beta e ainda bem que pelo menos o acesso antecipado saiu antes do apocalipse.\nVoc\u00ea gosta de RPG t\u00e1tico - compre\nvoc\u00ea gosta de um jogo de com\u00e9dia - compre\nVoc\u00ea gosta dos jogos da Bahamut -  compre\nN\u00e3o conhece a Bahamut - Tem castle crashers e battleblock theater, compre os 3\nTem dificuldade com ingl\u00eas - Espere mais um pouco porque ainda est\u00e3o implementando o idioma.", "timestamp_created": 1486510039, "timestamp_updated": 1486510039, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29770424": {"recommendationid": "29770424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198312730990", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 430, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490466510}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Al principio estaba dudando en comprarmelo pues no me gustan mucho los juegos de tipo Ataque por turnos, etc y lueo lo compre por simple curiosidad y me termino Encantando, Lo recomiendo al 100%                                                                                                                  PD: Lo unico malo es que la historia esta incompleta y se entiende pues esta en Early Acess.", "timestamp_created": 1486505310, "timestamp_updated": 1486505310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29770329": {"recommendationid": "29770329", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147367577", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514070977}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting little game.

In other words if you enjoyed the zany comedy of Battleblock Theatre, Castle Crashers or Alien Hominid then you will probably enjoy the style of humour found here. Whether it is the main 'story', multipart quests or the shorter sidequests the dialogue is constistently funny without getting too repetitive.\n\nThe gameplay is a simplistic turn based combat system that takes place over a hexagonal grid. You assemble a team via collecting new units by defeating enemy armies and then customising them with various collectible items, mostly cosmetics but with some offering varied stats or attack styles. While the player's control over their units is limited (you pick where they move but not who they attack) your ability to customise the contents of your team adds a lot of depth to what you can do. Fans of games such as X-Com or Fire Emblem will likely enjoy what the game has to offer but it is also accessible enough for players new to the genre.\n\nMultiplayer operates smoothly with no real connection problems and offers both local and online co-op and versus. While some units may currently be considered suboptimal and others might be considered above average there is no feeling of there being a single perfect team composition in multiplayer, versus matches often featuring relatively varied teams.\n\nAt present the main concern to be had with the game is that it is incomplete. Considering the low price I'd say even in it's unfinished state you will likely get your monies worth, especially as it seems bug free (in my experience at least) but if you are only planning to play the single player content you might want to wait for the full release. At present the storyline  consists of the tutorial content and a single mission, with numerous subquests and 4 quest chains also available.

Yes, THE Behemoth, not just a Behemoth... THE!!! Behemoth, capital E! \nFrom the same guys that brought you the co-op, cat-ertainment and spectacle-puzzle platformer BattleBlock Theatre and ridiculous side-scrolling adventures of CastleCrashers, comes Pit People, a \"baby's first tactical game\" with enough character and humour to finally fill that empty void inside!\nBut what do I mean by \"baby's first tactical game\"? Well, Pit People is a tactical arena fighter wherein you have several pawns with different abilities, strengths and weaknesses, which you move around on a hex grid in a turn-based fashion. Think XCOM.\nBut unlike XCOM you don't really have absolute control over your pawns. You can't really tell them what to do, only move them around (hopefully) \"strategically\". \nThis makes the game somewhat more straightforward and easier than your average, XCOM-like turn-based tactical game. It does however present some difficulties XCOM veterans won't be used to.\nFor one, since you can't tell your pawns what ability to use or which target to attack, you're pretty much left to the mercy of whatever Nuffle-worshiping algorithm decides that. More on that later however.\n\nIn general, the game is pretty easy to grasp, the RPG aspects are limited to mainly just customisation options. While there is a ton of crazy loot, there's no plethora of uniquely different items with different stats- a tall shield is a tall shield, whether a garden fence or a giant beetle. However, within each item category there's the odd \"special item\" that sacrifices some of the normal stats of that category for a particular bonus. Want a shield with some fire resistance? Well, that comes with less blocking power, though not enough to make too much of a difference.\nDifferent character types (Cupcake, Cyclops, Demi-Clops, Human, Pixie etc.) have different proficiencies and characteristics, making them more or less potent with different items and loadouts and in different roles.\nThere's no skill tree or talents (currently, as of Update 1, though that may also be planned), so every level your pawns gain is just a straightforward increase to all their stats, though not a major one. So there's no need to worry whether a 3% crit chance is better than a 1.5% increase to rate of fire. A level 10 character will always be objectively better than a level 9 one from the same type. \nIn fact, the game (again, currently, Update 1 did make some stats clearer) makes very little effort to let you know what the exact stats of your pawns are. There's a bunch of nicely stylised bars - LBS (how much equipment a pawn can carry, since, as you can imagine, a tall shield is heavier than a buckler, which affects their movement and agility), DMG (how much total, maximum damage a pawn does, based on pawn type and equipment), RNG (range, for ranged pawns or ranged abilities like cage-throwing, each level on the bar represents a hex), DEF (defence against melee attacks, usually determined by helmets), BLK (ability to block arrows and other projectiles, usually determined by shields) and DODG (dodge chance, the lighter the equipment a pawn carries, the higher their dodge chance, based on pawn type), that give you some information on how powerful a pawn in a particular loadout is, though, save from the damage value, it's not particularly clear.\nThere's also a range of icons for the different abilities and resistances pawns can inherit based on their type and equipment, though those provide little identification for what they actually stand for (since Update 1, the percentage chance of a particular ability to take effect is displayed below the relative icon, though that doesn't help much). Unfortunately, there's really no indication of a pawn's weaknesses, except maybe a vague footnote in your Recruitment Book (written and kept by the aforementioned Spanish lady).\nThis may be a deal breaker for min-maxing nuts who care only for the most optimal approach to things, but in the spirit of this game, it's a well implemented system that takes little effort to get used to and navigate. Also, if you're one of those nuts, get out of here! This is a casual game, go back to your XCOMs! \nIt also works well with the games' combat mechanics, or really lack thereof. Combat is determined on a rock-paper-scissors basis. A helmet blocks a sword but a mallet trumps a helmet. The UI is quite clear in this regard - if your pawn has an advantage against an enemy, there's a Facebookish \"thumbs up\" over that target, if it's weak or less effective, it's a \"thumbs down\".\nAttacks and order of operations is somewhat weird however. As I said above, the action and target a pawn picks is pretty much random. To a point. You can, and in fact have to, in order to make the most of every encounter, position your pawns in such ways so as to \"guide\" their algorithm.\nFor instance, if there's two or more targets your pawn can reach, it will most likely spread its' attacks between all of them (or several of them, depending on how many attacks the pawn can make). If it has an advantage against one of them, it may favour that target with more attacks, or it may not. Moving your pawn to a hex where it makes contact with only one target makes it attack only that target however, giving it all its' got.\nRanged combat is somewhat trickier however. Pawns with ranged weapons will always attack all enemies within their range for as many attacks they can make. They also attack in melee however and in fact prefer melee if they're \"threatened\" (have an adjacent enemy). They also usually have a \"dead zone\", a range of hexes below which they won't be able to fire at range.\nAll of this makes combat both straightforward and engaging. Yes, all you're doing is moving chess pieces around, but much like actual chess pieces, your pawns have certain rules they follow when attacking/performing actions and you need to think about their order of operations and placement. Movement time is something you also need to consider as pawns that don't move/finish their movement first will attack/do their action while those still moving are still... moving, making for some unexpected results of potential targets getting flung out of reach of that perfect surround you had planned, just because that Hair Troll attacked first. And you can't simply overwhelm your enemies with numbers and brute power. Sure, larger pawns are more powerful, but they also usually take up an extra space on your team, so there's also that to consider. It is in fact you who would most often be outnumbered, since you'll often be engaging groups with more enemies than your team (even in co-op, the game adjusts accordingly).\nThere's also no permanent death in this game, unlike other games of the kind, like XCOM, Darkest Dungeon etc. When a pawn dies in combat, it remains unavailable in your team until you return to town, after which it's as good as new! (scars and PTSD notwithstanding) \n\nAs for the world and story... Oh boy, are you in for one wicked whirl!\n\n(Continue reading in the comments, this is a long one)", "timestamp_created": 1486392023, "timestamp_updated": 1486393446, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4,

They make games. And right now it's 3/3 (4/4 if you include Alien Hominid, who hasn't played that on a school computer?).\n\nI fell in love with the music of Castle Crashers, and I can tell you, this music will not disappoint. Neither will the dialogue or the voice over. And even with the, currently, rather short story, in this early access period it has so much potential. With the side quests there might even be an unlimited potential. The gameplay is simple, but immensely versatile. Controlling your characters is one click per character. You tell them where to go, and they do what they do. If you program a key on your mouse to be the space-key (or if there is a mouse-function in-game that I haven't discovered just yet) you can play this solely with the mouse, or keyboard, or controller, whatever you prefer.\n\nThe game already has an amazing amount of cusomization. I am constantly checking which swords/mallets/shields/helmets/special items to give to which characters. And then we have the amount of different characters. When I tell a friend about which recruit I got this time, or just recently about how I captured a Gorgon and how she is now my Hero, just because of her abilities, he asked me what a Gorgon was. He didn't encounter one just yet. We are still early game, but the range of different characters to capture is already well on its way to become huge.\n\nI understand that this is still Early Access. Some might be thinking \"What if this is all that there is to it?\" Don't. This develepor is known for quality products. I can't tell you how much fun I've had in Castle Crashers. Just on my own, laughing at some moment during some quest, just because of the dialogue or visual representations. This game already has the comedy down. In the first 30 minutes of the \"tutorial\" there were definitely 3 good jokes.\n\nOverall, this game has already proven its worth. Smooth gameplay, smooth dialogue, smooth transitions. You start the game, the game explains you how to play, while you are playing. Then it wishes you good luck, and you are off while some being who doesn't like order narrates your story.\n\nWell worth the 15 euros.", "timestamp_created": 1486352037, "timestamp_updated": 1486352037, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29733882": {"recommendationid": "29733882", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009187272", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 364, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505823020}, "language": "english", "review": "I had to step back a bit when the game opened up to think about how I felt about your units deciding who to attack and that you have to get a Spanish Conquistador to capture enemies in her net to collect more units for your squad pokemon style but I'd say it's pretty special.\n\nI think it'll be worth saving your purchase until after Early Access, but not for the usual reasons. A clean run of the full story from start to finish feels like it's going to be amazing.\n\nSpeaking of which, it's unusually not far along for how long this game's been in development. Can't say I know how things are going internally though, and you've got lots of stuff to play with besides. Some map to explore, side-quests to do, units and items to find, and both co-op and competitive multiplayer, as they are wont to do.

There are tons of side quests though and the Pit where you can do 2v2's or face the AI. You will gain daily rewards for winning in the Pit. \n\nThe best part about Pit People is that it is genuinely funny and has the biggest dick of a narrator that I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. The narrator is a giant bear that tries to ruin your characters lives in the funniest, worst kind of ways. Every third or so time you return to your city, the bear will pick it up and move it somewhere else. Which isn't all bad because it keeps things fresh, but the nerve of some people, am I right?

The gameplay is very easy to figure out. Its a game that you can pick up months later and still know how to play it yet somehow they managed to make it so chalenging it can either be as simple as Mario and yet as challenging as Dark Souls at times but still keeping you hooked and in a great mood while playing it. Every character is completely customizable as far as looks and playability. I highly recomend any game made by Behemoth and this game is no different.

Anyone who has played any of their games will recognize and appreciate it immediately.\n\nThe turn-based combat system is well done.\n\nThe level of unit and squad customization is quite impressive, even though not every unit has the same level of customization.\n\nCooperative and competitive play is solid. I've yet to have any issue either joining, hosting or finding games.\n\n\nBut are there any concerns?\n\nWhile the combat system is well done, the player has very basic options available to them. \nIt seemingly comes down to three things; \n1) Place unit next to one enemy and attack, \n2) Place unit next to 2+ enemies and attack with AoE or rng single target, or\n3) Keep unit x tiles away from hostile units and rng range attack single target.\n\nYou, the player, have no further imput into the units actions, so apart from testing out team comps and looking for synergetic pairings, the game practically plays itself. There's even an autopilot mode that you can enable in combat to allow the computer to play on your behalf.\n\nI would like to stress, however, that the \"autonomous\" nature of the game doesn't necessarily make the game less fun.\n\nIf you are looking for a game in which you have really indepth control over every action that your units take (ex. X-COM) then this game probably shouldn't be at the top of your list.

A lot of people seem to say this game bores them , but for some reason I don't find it that boring, even when I watch other people. I really enjoy the customization options.

I do have some complaints like  how the mercenaries cost 7000 coins eventhough you can just catch some in the overworld(Although I do have, like, 9000 coins, but still). Another complaint I have is that once you leave the secret area, you can't go back which is frustrating because I accidentally left it without getting my prize (I know it was my fault, but I was confused and I didn't know what was happening). Here are the bugs I've encountered so far(I know there's a bug report option, but I think I have to be logged in to their site to report it. Either that or I'm really dumb lol): Invisible objects and entitys in the overworld and in battle, killing or an enemy killing an ivisible entity crashes the game, game crashes whenever I complete the first Moltenasia quest. But this is still early access so obviously they're going to fix these bugs. Other than the bugs the game is great! (There's also lots of stale/dead memes in the game.

You can create your team of idiots with the humans having plenty of customizablity. (unfortunatly the other creature may only have 1-2 customizable options that often are only cosmetic) There is a multiplayer mode but unfortunatly it a little buggy.

Excited he picked it up and chucked me a free copy, and then we tackled the game at the same time.\n\nTo put it simply as the game stands now I definitely recommend it.  When it's a finished product I can only expect it to be significantly more fulfilling than the current rendition, which is already a good time to be had.  Now for a bit more detail...\n\nFirst and foremost this game is in Early Access and as of this review it has very little story missions to progress through.  There are plentiful sidequests on the maps, and a few side missions attached to the Quest Board in town, but Story Missions?  Almost none.  So if you're looking for the full game...wait a bit?\n\nTechnically speaking this game is solid.  I've had zero crashes and almost no glitches to speak of.  I'm currently running Update 1(Beta) and that hasn't even generated any instability.  All in all a good bunch of programming.\nThat isn't to say that the game is without bugs.  I've seen a few others complain about some that have popped up here and there. However...\n\nBehemoth seems to actually pay attention to the players.  I've seen an actual attempt by the staff to try and help those who are having problems with the game.  That's quite refreshing compared to what feels like cold, mechanical assistance from most bigger named and bigger budgeted companies.\n\nSo the game is pretty good overall in terms of stability.  But how is it as a GAME?\nIt's a turn-based strategy game with a plethora of various units and equipments for said units.  Each type of unit you can use has a weakness you can exploit, but you won't always face off against what you might want to which means you need flexibility in your loadout and playstyle.\n\nIn terms of actual difficulty you'll find it to be sitting close to that sweet spot.  You can beat the opponents but they can get quite hard to handle if you're not paying attention.  My favorite thing, however, is that even if you're against something that is designed to beat you you won't automatically lose.  This isn't Rock/Paper/Scissors, and so weaknesses don't cripple you so much as merely hurt you.\n\nIf you like turn-based stategy games you'll probably get a kick out of this.  If you hate them because they're too slow Pit People has a slightly faster pace than you might expect, so maybe check a video of a fight from the game.  If you simply hate strategy games even then this game might interest you due to the humor and art style.\n\nAlso, yes, the music is awesome.", "timestamp_created": 1485644437, "timestamp_updated": 1485644437, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29551664": {"recommendationid": "29551664", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065046011", "num_games_owned": 845, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 804, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499717015}, "language": "english", "review": "+Simple, yet engaging combat\n+Georgious art style\n+Hilarious writing\n+Groovey-ass music\n\n-Not finished (as of 28/01/2017)\n-Levelling system is somewhat pointless\n\nIn it's current state, this game is absolutely worth the price.

However, Pit People is definitely an exeption! So after \"beating\" the early access version, here are my Pro's and Con's:\n\nPros:\n+ Great, colorful artstyle.\n+ Exceptional writing and voice acting.\n+ Very funny dialog and cutscenes.\n+ Fast-paced gameplay.\n+ Working online arena mode.\n+ Expansive world map.\n+ Large amount of character upgrades (armor, weapons, etc).\n\nCons: \n- The game is in early access, so as of now it's lacking in terms of content.\n- While the game stays interesting the entire way though, if you're not open-minded or a fan of this genre, I don't think you'll enjoy it.\n\nNotes:\n* Lack of explaination / tutorial in worldmap and town area. I'm assuming this is due to early access.\n* After finishing the early access story, it seems the only things to do are grind for gear and play arena. \n\n---\n\nWhile Pit People is in early access, I could definitely see myself paying full price for it if I had found it post full release. It's a cute, well-written, adventure that makes me very impatient for the full release.\n\nIf you're unsure about buying this, I would very much say to do so if you're okay with an incomplete story as of now.

Even though this is in early access this is a must buy for any Behemoth fan, and a must buy for any strategy fan. \nAs if Posiedon himself put his hand out in friendship ,and they spat in his mouth!", "timestamp_created": 1485586854, "timestamp_updated": 1485586854, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497565", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29535406": {"recommendationid": "29535406", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070334953", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 3441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486091589}, "language": "english", "review": "It's Behemoth.", "timestamp_created": 1485586847, "timestamp_updated": 1485586847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29534449": {"recommendationid": "29534449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098708706", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 357, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498777056}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth $15 for the soundtrack alone, The game is awesome and all, plus its made by Behemoth and i mean cmon its behemoth but THE SOUNDTRACK IS FUCKIN BUMPIN'", "timestamp_created": 1485581579, "timestamp_updated": 1485581579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29533774": {"recommendationid": "29533774", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044879551", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501296665}, "language": "english", "review": "My nigga yosef has bear hat, log and an upside-down pistol 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1485577954, "timestamp_updated": 1485577954, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29532775": {"recommendationid": "29532775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198325261585", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486872008}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8ddfBBT\u548cCC\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u5f88\u671f\u5f85\u8fd9\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u521b\u610f\u5de5\u574a\u3002\u4e0d\u4f46\u8981\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8d70\u4f4d\u3001\u961f\u5f62\u548c\u9635\u5bb9\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u5bf9\u9762\u7684\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u975e\u5e38\u6025\u5207\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u559c\u6b22\u7528\u82f1\u96c4\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u6307\u6325\u522b\u4eba\u8d70\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f88\u5feb\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u6218\u573a\u4e0a\u5404\u79cd\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5f88\u663e\u7136\u8fd9\u4e0d\u957f\u8fdc\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u6211\u90fd\u662f\u5fc3\u4e0d\u5728\u7109\u5730\u73a9\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u5f88\u60e8\u3002\u5267\u60c5\u633a\u591a\u5f69\u86cb\uff0c\u7b49\u4e3b\u7ebf\u4e86owo", "timestamp_created": 1485572341, "timestamp_updated": 1485572341, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544379", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29532609": {"recommendationid": "29532609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267646945", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508682275}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS GAME IS A MUST-BUY FOR ANY BEHEMOTH LOVER (myself included).

Your supper-popular reviewer Yuu-sama is back on the line! Rejo-o.. ah, mind it.\n\nSo, I took up on a good advice and actually tried out the game. There was a good opportunity, because I\u2019d gifted it to a friend who actually wanted it. Soooo~. \n\nIt\u2019s King Bounty. With customizeable characters instead of just stacks. I mean, the big part of the game is King\u2019s Bounty rewinded on a 1.5 game hours-length map (yet, it\u2019s EA, I know) . Pretty casual in comparison. No, absolutely casual in comparison. Even with 90\u2019s original. \n\nWhat Pokemon are you talking about? I\u2019ve never played it. But, you know, you can capture monsters in the latest KB games, and some of them a predefined on generation to join you anyway. There is no \u201cGonna catch them all\u201d spirit? I guess it is. So, Pit People is just a casual 9\u20ac TBS, like Adventure Manager and others with a sketchy mechanics and things.\n\nWhat about the other, even bigger part? It\u2019s hum-or. And first things first - bleeeh. I can\u2019t start to talk about it without that premise. It\u2019s really sends me back to the phrase that began everything for this review: \u201cIt\u2019s a Behemoth\u2019s game!\u201d. Jokes are passable, generally. But there are pits (in Pit People, yes, *ba dum-tss*). The closest example is Forest scene of Castle Crashers. They didn\u2019t got rid of those funny feces detonations. Meanwhile, the man who anticipated this game and actually enjoyed it for 1.5hrs of the 1st act said, that the only thing bad in this game, currently, is \u201cthe degenerative sense of humor\u201d. And for this part, he is right. But I would suggest there is a reason behind it\u2019s presence. By the way, we never finished CC because of that.\n\nStage change. With the review being locked, my life turned grey. I\u2019ve got no wife, no kids, no warm touch from anyone, but General Vochka himself. That being said, I jumped into another abyss of my useless existence. Aaahh, ok, it was their discord server. I found here two moderator guys joking around about how 2 unicorns could create a Mobius and feces, more of them, of course (strongly reminded me this South Park\u2019s episode, that I did not intend to watch; like the whole title). When I was left alone with one of them, I\u2019ve started to provoke him (I wasn\u2019t picky in the means, why should I?). Silenced, re-entering, watch him playing for a time, They came, me ban. Yes, I was kicked at the end, got yet another invite from Them and one more, too, which I\u2019ve decided to took up. The other side was really irritated, plainly rude, so I\u2019ve got no choice but to report it. Properly, through the ticket. I am an adult and strong-willed male, but there could have been woman, kid, or an elderly person in my place. And yesterday I got a response. This person would be restricted in their ability to communicate with other people through the Steam for some time. And I got 6 downvotes on my long-drown reviews this very Friday. It seems they are downvoting every.\n\nSo, yes, my point is that some part of the \u201colder\u201d community, grown on the best pieces of Behemoth humor is acting, to put it mildly, strange. But yet, they got a special treatment, like \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go and ban that digger\u201d. This very part of community is expecting for Daniel to act in some generally known way (related to this very sense of humor). For example, They would delete Their own posts, setting Their profile to \u201cPrivate\u201d only to anger those, who would dare to doubt them. Childish? It is. But look at the beginning and the list what They already did.\n\nNo, the man this stupid couldn\u2019t possibly create games. I suspect, he do understand he can\u2019t effectively fight some guy with \u201c?\u201d on avatar. It\u2019s like fighting a faceless mob. And I am positive on that he knows it. \n\nBut still, people expecting him to act in this way. Those very people he attracted with his first games, filled with iconic for the Behemoth sense of humor. Of course, it\u2019s just my vision. But if you saw at least a bit of this whole process: wouldn\u2019t you think it seems weird, if 7\\10 of most useful reviews are \u201cBehemoth game, so is good\u201d? Wouldn\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird when some of the negative reviews got very \u2018special\u2019 attention? I guess, there is a reason for that.\n\nSaid, Dan is a businessman. It\u2019s just his model of advertising the games. He got reliable community core, which could beat him some of the tips, like write some positive reviews, for example. No, not injections. He didn\u2019t pay them for that.\n\n\nAnd here we are: this game is in Early Access. It got a single playable act. Apparently, you can participate in the development with your ideas, but I suppose, some of the \u2018closer\u2019 people\u2019s opinions would get priority over yours. If you hope that jokes in future acts would be more of \u201cstraight sense\u201d, your expectations is likely to be futile.\n\nWhat\u2019s left of this game? PvP? It\u2019s casual TBS, any competitive one would beat it. No direct control on units? Dominions, Legion series is better by no means. Instant turns? Oh, boy, you made me remember this one from 2001 - Laser Squad Nemesis.\nThe only reason to grab it is Co-Op. I guess, it\u2019s a good reason. If you are able to withstand the \u201co-ha-ha\u201d part. Or if you want to see a Casual TBS in your hands . Or you\u2019ve already watched complete series of South Park.\n\nI was meant to compare this community with the one Klei\u2019s got, but I\u2019ve decided it would be malicious to compare 2 indie games by their \u201cfeel\u201d (actually, I\u2019ve asked them on occasion when their Barbie House is going to get build).\n\nNo hard feelings, Dan. I\u2019m not a developer and I can\u2019t possibly judge you on the way you\u2019re advertising your game. I know you\u2019re going to lock this review, I\u2019m going to see your waiting Tail in the comments soon (he\u2019s such a coward in a real-time chat), but that is my opinion about your game. I\u2019m not aiming to win this, I just wanted to understand the cause, the matter of why did it even start. By the way, I though you were panicking first, so this accusations of the guy, who likely laughed his guts off from the whole situation, must had been true. It seems like a total misunderstanding. I should thank those minions for letting me know. From now on, I\u2019m going to go easy on my reviews (anyway, they are about to get downvoted to the Mariana Trench soon).\n\nI have to remove the original review, it would be there http://imgur.com/a/tDDri", "timestamp_created": 1485540169, "timestamp_updated": 1487389719, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.233082", "comment_count": "62", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1487406109, "developer_response": "The majority of this was a response to the author's 2nd or 3rd edit to their post.

There are no paid perks and after a short time of yomping around the map I'd picked up a few characters to play with. I'm not sure the balancing is quite right, and the leaderboard is very basic and does nothing to encourage participation.\n\nBut the real strength of Pit People is in the actual battle gameplay, which is very straightforward and easy to get to grips with.

You've gotta catch all the fighters, level them up, and complete the story mode.\n\nIt's superior because it's both simpler to learn and harder to master. Instead of choosing from a menu of options, you just decide where your fighters stand. Next turn, you can have them stand somewhere else. Then somewhere else. Then somewhere else. Then, depending on how good your choice of location for them, you'll either win or lose.\n\nThe spatial aspect of it means you cannot memorise and execute a standard strategy like you can in Pokemon. Here, you must react to whatever situation you're put in, so even the exact same battle won't play exactly the same twice. This adds so much depth to the strategy, as you need a contingency for everything.\n\nHowever, it's much quicker to pick up, as your options are \"stand here\" or \"stand somewhere else\". You don't have to learn what a list of items or attack types do. Although a detailed working understanding of the game is a big help, it's not essential to gain the experience of actually playing it.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game (though Pokemon and most other games are equally guilty) is that it provides no detailed guide or wiki to help me fully understand what I'm looking at. What does it mean if a tile is on fire? What does it mean if my fighter is glowing purple? What does and does not count as a helmet? How is damage calculated?

I don't like the turn based genre. After seeing YouTubers playing it, I decided to give it a try. I fell in LOVE! Behemoth turned the genre into a more simpler, less complicated game (which I love). This game is another masterpiece from Behemoth. The quests are fun, the narrator (I'm so happy they brought him into this game) is hilariously dark, and 'The Pit' is the cherry on top. Battleing 2v2 is so much fun! I'm so glad they made it 2v2 instead of just 1v1 because then I can blame my failures on my team mate. But seriously, it is much better working together than grinding on your own. The last game I played (in the pit), I was going to keep one of my characters where they were and didn't realize there was a way better spot, but my teammate shook his cursor in the direction of where I should move my character and I avoided a careless mistake. I can't wait to tell my friends to buy this game and play 2v2 with them!\n\nAnother feature I like is the \"pokemon\" feel when I recruit an enemy that looks super cool and then being able to customize them. I LOVE the ability to customize my team. I LOVE even more the crazy weapons and hats you can equip to make your characters look like whatever you want them to look like! I made my cyclops have Sofia's head. (looks so weird).\n\nBehemoth, my hat's off to you for making another amazing, extremely customizable, and simple/fast to play. I spent only 28 minutes each doing two games in the pit and managed to get up to the top of the leaderboard. (I'm not trying to brag BTW). People are probably passing me right now :(. Anyways, I can't express how much joy this game has brought me! The gameplay is fun, interesting, and does require skill. (and good characters. obviously).\n\nVERDICT:\n\nTotally worth the $15! Buy right now! Even if you don't like the genre, you will like it after playing this game! Behemoth always turns an ordinary genre of games into an amazing, totally wacky, and hilarious one! Castle Crashers, Battleblock Theater, and especially Pit People are all examples of the genius of Behemoth!

Anyway, heres the review :\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n\n  +Very strategic team building. If you're into that kinda strategy games, then you will like this game for sure. You have a whole lot of weapons to choose from, a lot of races ( Cyclopses, robots, zombies etc. ) that each have different abilities or bonusses to stuff.\n\n +A lot of customisation. This is pretty much the base of the game. There are over 1300 collectibles, ranging from bows to hats for your cute but at the same time terrifying hair troll.\n\n +Balanced Difficulty. If you don't suck a lot at strategy games or if you don't accept a 5 skull difficulty quest ( You won't be seeing those at the start anyways but still. ) right away with only 4 members, you won't be overwhelmed or underwhelmed by the difficulty. If you somehow feel underwhelmed then there is an insane mode in the town.\n\n +Co-Op. Now, i won't get into this much because i have not been able to try it yet but from my experiences with co-op on other Behemoth games, i am sure that this game has a really fun co-op too. Also there is online co-op too so yeah, that is cool.\n\n +Cool soundtrack. The soundtrack of the game feels really in place, in fights, in menu, in town... You would know if you played other Behemoth games, that funky but catchy music.\n\n +Big World. Although the biomes are not that diverse, i found it quite entertaining to explore the world and find new races ( You won't keep seeing new ones, you will probably find them all after a few hours of gameplay if you explore around the map. ) . There are also over 100 biomes. Honestly i wouldn't really call them ''biomes''. They are more like places, ranging from a robot city to a grasslands filled with fruits and sweets.\n\n +Pokemon. If you like catching pokemon, then you will like this aspect of the game. As long as you buy cages from the shop at the town before you leave, you will be able to catch anything or anyone you can fight. After you catch them you can use their equipment, you can use them for fighting, or you can just keep them with other 127 fighters that have lost to you and you have either caught them because you liked their clothing or your catcher just had to be next to it and you caught it by a mistake.\n\n +Overall great srategy game. The team building aspect combined with the soundtrack, the funky graphics, the funny voices and the dope turn-based combat, the game becomes fun to play but strategic and sometimes hard at the same time.\n\n +Also gives you cool stuff if you own Battle Block Theater and Castle Crashers.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n\n - Progressing feels so... [b]dull[/b]. While playing the game, it will start to feel like you are stuck in a loop, go to town, look through your loot ( Which generally isn't anything more or stronger than cosmetics. ) , buy more cages just in case you see something cool, choose a quest, get out of the town, kill stuff, catch stuff, do your quest or just return to town without doing it because either your inventory is full or your party has a few people dead and a few people low on health, go back to town anyways, check your loot, and repeat. Yes, a lot of stuff you can get - but after a while that also starts to feel boring, because most of the time you will just find stuff either you don't use or don't look good enough. Also they could be weaker, nobody knows because there is not really a place where you could get better loot, you just revolve around the same place and kill the same enemies with different clothing. Yes, there is levelling - but levelling... Oh boy, you don't get [b]anything[/b] for levelling, well you do get that sometimes really helpful boost to full health, but other than that you don't get anything other than numbers that show you your level. No health boost, no damage boost... No nothin' . Well you do have the main storyline quests but meh...\n\n - UI. It feels like the UI is kind of hard to use. At the start it will be hard to understand what does what while you work through your team. But that is a really small con because you get used to it quickly.\n\n - How limited you are. This is the second biggest con after progressing, you want to carry more loot before going back near the town to empty your wagon? Too bad! You can't upgrade it! You just got a reaaally cool looking weapon but it's too heavy? Yeah, sorry but you can't change how much you carry. You want to have a cyclops in your team to carry that? Cyclopses take 2 places in your team so it is not worth it. To clear some misunderstandings, i am not saying that cyclopses taking 2 spaces is bad, i think that is completely balanced because they are pretty strong and tanky compared to humans.\n\n -Body armor. Although this might not matter much, in my opinion it does for a game that heavly depends on customisation. You can't change what your team wears. You can only change their helmets. This kind of sucks. I don't like having a giant cyclops with a Dat Boi head ( Yup, there is a Dat Boi head, and also a lot of other memes and references so that's cool. ) but with a white body. I don't want a human with a badass knight helmet but with only a gray casual shirt on.\n\nI know I listed too many cons, but honestly, the pros overwhelm them. \n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] The game is fun and challenging at the same time. You got over 1300 collectibles. Over 100 places to see - I wouldn't suggest getting too excited over this as those places are just different looking squares that you will get from side to side in only 30 seconds but it's still cool seeing new stuff. A lot of detail into team building. Although the progressing feels kinda dull it is still really fun to collect stuff. Overall great game that is fun but srategical, i would suggest buying it.\n\nAnother great game by Behemoth.\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1485483992, "timestamp_updated": 1485485112, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29513165": {"recommendationid": "29513165", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077365385", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485531676}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Juego: Pit People\nObjetivos, Conflictos: Vencer a todos los contrincantes bajo estrategias por turno, explorar, cumplir con las Quests adicionales (opcional) acabar la historia y aventura que el creador tiene preparada para el jugador.

This may just be because I live in South Africa, but I dont see why lag would be an issue in a turn based game. \n", "timestamp_created": 1485463503, "timestamp_updated": 1485463503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717481", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29508382": {"recommendationid": "29508382", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046927307", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1056, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 205, "last_played": 1516500129}, "language": "english", "review": "Buy it now!", "timestamp_created": 1485461448, "timestamp_updated": 1485461448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29508303": {"recommendationid": "29508303", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211947004", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1244, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490239558}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u4e0b\u6765\u4e4b\u540e\u7ed9\u6211\u4e00\u79cd\u5f88\u8fc7\u763e\u7684\u611f\u89c9 \u723d\u8fc7\u5438\u5927\u9ebb\n\u9996\u5148\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u7684bgm \u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u4eba\u611f\u89c9\u51fa\u5236\u4f5c\u7ec4\u6709\u5f88\u7528\u5fc3\u7684\u53bb\u5236\u4f5c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\n\u6700\u8ba9\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u7684\u662f\u73a9\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u65c1\u767d\u7684\u58f0\u97f3,\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u8d31\u8d31\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u6709\u79cd\u60f3\u4e0d\u505c\u7684\u542c\u65c1\u767d\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8033\u8fb9\u8bdd\u75e8\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5..\n\u867d\u7136\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u6d41\u7a0b\u8f83\u77ed,\u6709\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u8fd8\u6709\u4e9b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u5c31\u662f\u6709\u6bd2\n", "timestamp_created": 1485461144, "timestamp_updated": 1485461144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29508246": {"recommendationid": "29508246", "author": {"steamid": "76561198264191413", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485482124}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 buy asap.

Opinions herein are subject to change upon advancements in the games development. This review will be updated as each new patch rolls out for the game.\n\nPit People.. Pit People.. This game is absolutely bonkers, and I adore it so for such. Whilst the storyline is nowhere near finished (Early Access) there are a plethora of missions and so on to embark on, as well as countless enemies to \"Recruit\" (Kidnap) into your party. My current party is a Hairball which regenerates health per turn, and hits for massive damage, a cupcake which heals my party members by slowly killing itself, your typical knightly party member but with an Elvis haircut, a Unicorn that fires exploding rainbow artillery horns, and a recruitment person. Party diversity is key.\n\nPros:\n\n- Fantastic Soundtrack, which I've listened to outside of the game for hours.\n\n- Easy to understand movement system, as well as targetting.\n\n- Diverse enemies available to be recruited. From Mushrooms that fart on you and flip you off, to frogs that explode.\n\n- Hilarious questlines, which take an hour or so to complete if focused on completing the entire quest line.\n\n- Difficulty scaling is quite fair, with the ability to set the difficulty to \"Insane\" at any point.\n\n- Easily organized co-op, as well as split screen co-op using Mouse+KB and a controller.\n\n- Humorous \"language\" spoken by the characters within the game.\n\n- Exploration where you can ignore any/all enemies if you like.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Minor Framerate issues whilst exploring (Though, once more as stated above, it is an Early Access title, and this is subject to change).\n\n- Rather boring equipment system, where each weapon is generally cosmetic depending on their grouping.\n\n- Lack of Micromanagement aside from moving characters to an area, without the ability to designate specific targets, though this is most likely intentional.\n\n\nOverall: I'd rate the game an 8, however relatively close to being a 9. It lacks polish, as it is an Early Access game, however I am extremely excited to see what the future holds in regards to this game.", "timestamp_created": 1485423680, "timestamp_updated": 1485519700,

Ok, if your reading this and debating to buy this game, I have a couple things to tell you that will explain the beauty of this game.  First off, if you have ever seen Battleblock Theater, or Castle Crashers, you know that this should be a funny game, and it is. This game has some very good humor.\n\nGameplay:\nThis game plays like Fire Emblem, but much more fun. I'm not that good at Fire Emblem (Im terrible at it) When I was going to buy this game, I was debating on if it was worth it because of the gameplay, and it was. I enjoy playing this and can feel myself improving! The gameplay is polished and clean. There are side quests and the main story line. Sence this is early access, the story line isn't complete yet, but there are 1000s of sidequests while you wait for the game to update!\n\n\n~SUMMERY~\nPit People\u00ae is worth buying. If your a fan of the Fire Emblem series and love the humor in Battleblock Theater or Castle Crashers, this is perfect for you. If your like me and isn't the best at this type of gameplay, give it a try, If you don't enjoy it, you can get a refund, but I strongly recommend trying to get to the part where you have a full team. Then you can experience the beauty of this game. 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1485405715, "timestamp_updated": 1485405715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29495429": {"recommendationid": "29495429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171199790", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509682501}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0447))))", "timestamp_created": 1485405578, "timestamp_updated": 1485405578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29495213": {"recommendationid": "29495213", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286723598", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493374264}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u67d0\u5929\u5403\u5b8c\u665a\u996d\u5f00\u59cb\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u8fd9\u641e\u7b11\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u771f\u7684\u9017\u4e50\u4e86\u6211\uff08\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6211\u7ed910\u5206\uff09\u8d8a\u73a9\u8d8a\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff01\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u62a2\u5148\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u6211\u4e5f\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u77ee\u6cb9\uff1f\u600e\u4e48\u592a\u9633\u5347\u8d77\u6765\u4e86\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1485404350, "timestamp_updated": 1485404350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29495195": {"recommendationid": "29495195", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069323250", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 743, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486014028}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simply fantastic.

A new refreshing game with great art and fun gameplay, Pit People is just like Behemoth's other classic games with the humor, voice acting, and ridiculous weapons and cosemetics to match. :) I usually don't get into strategy and turn based games, but Pit People makes those who aren't interested in that genre love it. Such a weird combination of genres comes together in Pit People, and it's great. There is so much to do in Pit People, and I can't wait to see what Behemoth has in store for the full release of this game. Since it is still in development, some things are not complete(like the story), but there is much to explore. They are very attentive to the community as many major improvements from Beta recommended from the community and I love that. Tutorial is much better now and so are the animations since beta. Current early access price of $15 is a good deal, considering how well developed and different this game is from other mainstream games. (After early access the price will go up to $20). \n\nSome cons to the game are the controls for mouse+keyboard. The game was designed for Xbox, and is best played on a controller. It's still ok though, but if you don't have a controller, you may find it annoying. There is also no world map, and the screen makes it hard to see sometimes while traveling. It is different and a cool idea, but can be frustrating.\n\nP.S there is a LOT of grinding(it is part RPG). If that's not your thing, then don't get this game.\n\nThank you for another wonderful game, Behemoth <3", "timestamp_created": 1485330050, "timestamp_updated": 1485330050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29477877": {"recommendationid": "29477877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045733456", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499110745}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played all of the Behemoth games.

You can't plan for any battle, you can't choose who you attack, weapons are often just reskins and stats don't really matter too much. I know no one really cares about my opinion, so I'll just be brief. I find it hilarious, like the portion that is done was really funny as Stamper always is.

The offered missions & stories are good enough at the moment to already play the game for several hours. Although it felt to me like a demo that they could've given out for free to promote the game when it's finished.\nThe gameplay is fun with the RNG implemented, as you only control their movement, not their actions. Which gives it a fun luck-factor where you could have a fun rage-moment when they hit the wrong target for the 5th time.\n\nThe local co-op is really clunky atm unfortunately, the camera moves too much since it tries to focus on 2 moving cursors at the same time, which sortof forces you to do your movements 1 person at a time. Basically you could play for 2 people on your own, if you have 2 seperate controllers that is. \n\nI wasn't able to test the online co-op yet & will propably update my review after I tested that.\n\nSomething negative I noticed is that currently, being in Early Access, it feels like the characters their stats don't go up after a while anymore, having a lvl 30 character feels the same as having a level 10. The damage seems to lock at a certain point, even if the game assured that the stats would keep going up.\nThis does give an advantage on enjoying the 'demo' to its full extend, since else the level 5 missions would become too easy, thus ruining the gameplay.\n\nI strongly suggest this 'demo' to everyone who enjoyed Behemoth's previous games & people who like comedic strategy games.

As you progress you are able to capture enemies and collect gear to add to your armory, giving you the chance to fine tune your party into a ruthless quad-killing machine.\n\nAfter completing what's available of the main story line you and your party are given free reign of the world. As you grab more fighters and gear you're encouraged to put them to the test in the pit where your party is pitted against \"unfair AI\" or other players online.\n\nThe campaign and side quests are brimming with moxie. This whole game is just full of it, even the environment dances to the upbeat soundtrack.\n\nPROS:\n-Local and online CO-OP\n-Online multiplayer VS\n-Fantastic hex turn-based combat\n-AI brawling\n-Easy to access, difficult to master\n-HIlarious\n-RPG-ish elements that get the \"ooo! numbers going up!\" part of your brain tingling\n-Lots of stuff to collect\n-Lots of stuff to explore\n-Insane difficult mode\n-Ability to refuse space-bear's commands and not die\n\nCONS:\n-It's in early access, but some minor UI issues.\n-At this point in time the campaign is very short, but you're getting it for cheap and there is so much more to do than the campaign.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\nIf you love Behemoth games and want to play it now, get it, it's worth it and in a completely playable state.

Its fun i would rate this game 9/10 cuz campaign is kinda short but its almost perfect game!", "timestamp_created": 1485197726, "timestamp_updated": 1485197726, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29446590": {"recommendationid": "29446590", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016041048", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485106544}, "language": "english", "review": "The Music is already worth the 15\u20ac\n\n-Great Gameplay\n-Stamper\n-Music\n-soooo funny\n\nits a Behemoth Game.

However I played this to see what it was like yesterday with my girlfriend and we loved it so much I bought it.  It reminds me a little of Dokepon Kingdom on the wii.  I'm happy to purchase it and contribute towards its developement.   If you have a girlfriend that isn't so good with controllers or real-time games I recommend this to you.  I hope it has a lot of work and lots of improvement.  I still don't understand the leveling up or stats of each weapon (There are three types which are different) but I think the rest is just cosmetic.\n\nEdit 1 (Feb 11) :  Still extremely enjoying this game.  I understand now that the levelling up each time gives a toon 0.25% more stats.  Update two is also going to bring a lot of information regarding the weapons.  This game is awesome and I can't stop playing it with my girlfriend. It has got her into games so much I am out to buy a newer laptop so we can play more coop games like divinity etc.  Thanks behemoth! I will keep this girlfriend now!\n\nEdit 2 (March 29) : After the third update (Emperor's orders) I have to say this game is easily becoming one of my favourite games of all times.  I think I'll always remember it, kind of like, Borderlands 2 or WoW.  It has truly earned a place in my blackened heart.   We still play local coop and completely rip s*** up.  Mostly people are nice, but occasionally you'll find a bitter loser you'll tell you to suck some ****,  and you know, where else can you have a little cupcake wearing a robin hood hat tell you to suck his frosted candy pole?  It even uses his cute little voice while trying to portray his apocalyptic rage (since our tactics are flawless).  \n\nEdit 3 (May 5):  Still no updates and online has a waiting time of over an hour, and even then it's the same people we've been playing with.  I recommend anyone considering this game to wait until early access has finished since once you've finished the fast story, captured three of every character, you may find yourself a little bored if you don't have someone to play with.\n\nEdit 4: (June 5): Hello darkness my old friend... apparently an update is coming, but we've started playing other games since PVP is dead and we have completed everything else.", "timestamp_created": 1485170819, "timestamp_updated": 1496655305, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624955", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29440646": {"recommendationid": "29440646", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991435059", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 1582, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502217587}, "language": "english", "review": "Funny as hell, gameplay is fun, nice visuals and customization makes you laugh (long neck derpy face), turn based system is rather nice once you set out your plan and watch it in motion as arrows/axes/sawbales fly all over. wielding lollypops that freeze people and shields bouncing all sorts of flying objects.\n\nCapturing enemys and adding them to your lineup of fighters is a cool design, some having unique traits too!

This game is amazing! Despite it being early access and in reality there is very little to it right now, I've had a lot of fun with it.\n\nIF YOU BUY THIS EARLY, DO KNOW THAT THERE IS ONLY THE GENERAL SET OF TUTORIAL QUESTS AND WHAT FEELS LIKE ONLY 1 REAL STORY QUEST. \n\nMost of my time playing has been spent just grinding out battles in order to level up my team, otherwise there really isn't much else to do other than the Unfair Pit and repeatable bonus missions. The Unfair Pit seems quite fun, but even with a full team of above level 20's I barely made it past round 1 and it could also be noted that I'm probably not amazing at the game anyway. \n\nAs far as random encounters go, I feel like it would be nice to see even more variety in some of the enemies. There are a few different races you encounter throughout the game, but the only difference between characters of the same race are there helmets mostly and even then it really isn't all that crazy.

Xcom and Civ are my only exceptions honestly, and I'm not very good at either of them. I do enjoy them nonethless. Pit People was hanging on the edge for me; I love Behemoth and their games and humour, but the whole turn-taking thing was a bit of a step away from their usual slash-fest style. However, I had some money and time to spare so I thought I'd give their new game a real chance, and man, am I thankful I did. Pit People is a wonder (even in early access) to play. The usual from Behemoth can be expected: a crazy and cartoonish art style, over-the-top humour and stupidity, but the new direction this game takes is suprisingly well done and very simple yet fun to play. It doesn't require a whole lot of planning and thought like other turn-based games do. Simply move your characters to where you want them to go and they will attack who they think is the best, provided that they can. You can't target specific enemies, which I thought was awful at first, until I realised that all-in-all, it works very well. Depending on your weapon depends on how you attack. For example, melee weapons such as swords will be just one tile away for an attack to occur, but if a character say throws axes, you need to position them two tiles away instead so they can throw the axes towards an enemy. If they can target multiple enemies at once, they may split the damage if the AI deems it necessary to, or just attack one enemy for more damage. I like this simple formula that avoids the player themselves setting up positioning as well as attacks, and it's very easy once you get the hang of it. The combat isn't the most in-depth ever seen in a turn-based game, but in my opinion, it succeeds because of this. It creates a fast-paced action game where good positioning will win you the game, sort of like chess in a way. The other section is a pokemon styled run-around a map and find things game. You can seek out enemies that then take you into a more focused battle, and the best part is the quests, which allow for a lot of freedom to do what you want to do instead of sectioned levels. The story is crazy just like all of Behemoth's games, and I won't spoil it (even though there is only a certain amount of these story quests available currently) but there's a giant teddy bear that has crashed into the Earth. The narrator as always is ridiculous and funny. Customisation is plentiful and once again, outrageous. The hub town holds a market place for new fighters and weapons, an arena named the pit sort of like a colosseum as well as a home for you to mess with your characters and team. \n\nOverall, awesome game and a real treat to play. Simple, elegant, funny and over-the-top turn-based action with what seems to be a mind-boggling but intriguing story that never lets up on quick remarks, twists and plot.

Everything you want from a tactical turn-based party battle management game is pretty much here. Lots of collectibles, both functional and cosmetic. Definately has a good chunk of different kinds of units (the deep customization really helps here in making it feel even more extensive). The online play is off to a great start - they are doing it right.\n\nOne thing I'll say right up front is that I'm thoroughly confused about people complaining about the short 'main story line' right now. First off, that's the tutorial folks - there is more coming. Secondly, there are over 100 missions WITH storyline dialogue that will certainly take you over a dozen hours to complete. Thats a conservative estimate, too.\n\n[b]You can read about all the good stuff in, well, like every other review. What are the negative points?[/b]\n\nFirst off, the camera desperately needs work with local co-op. They already said they would fix this as a high priority, so fine. Secondly, while the map is [i]huge[/i], it sort of, well, lacks a strong flavor. I think it feels very flat, and simply uniformly dotted with either small buildings or landscape chunks. While the map artwork is good and that is set, I'd like to see a bit of TLC go into making the terrain feel better in general. I hear keyboard and mouse controls are abismal, so be warned (I didn't try them because of this warning). Lastly, I think the music is fantastic, although it is not very artistically cohesive. One minute it is high fantasy classical-esque, then it's western cowboy music, and yet another it is techno-ish. Don't get me wrong, it is all [i]very[/i] good, but sometimes this difference made me wonder about how it was all chosen and put together.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is the difficulty. In five hours, I had never lost. Mind you, I didn't play on 'insane' difficulty, but still. I finished the 'main story', which is just a tutorial or prequal to the actual story (this version ends where it appears the real story begins). I finished 11 quests and a few other things. [b]After a while, I got lazy and stopped really strategizing and just kept throwing units in haphazardly - and I still won.[/b] With only a few hours in, I'm going to chalk this up to early game build-up. Plus, I think online play will likely be a different story. I did play online, but only very briefly.\n\nLastly, I felt that single player mode felt much better than local co-op.

Well, I'll go ahead and let you sort out your own opinion and you can decide for yourself. PLEASE NOTE: This game is in Early Access, so don't let this review effect your views on the actual game when it comes out. Thanks!\n\nPros:\n\nGreat Team-Builder type game. If you love the type of game where it's critical to build your own team, this one is for you The units I've discovered thus far are as follows: Tank, short ranged but fast archers, long ranged but slow morters, healers, heavy hitter, DPS, and self-sufficient. All characters spare Healer and self-sufficent are interchangable. You may equip them with items varying from a rainbow.. bow to a chalk board with Einstine's \"E=MC2\". Though beware, as weight limits may prohibit you from reaching your characters full potential!\n\nIn the world, you may fight to get loot. Beware though! If you lose a fight or flee you may lose your items! You must make the difficult decision of staying outside and battling for more loot as you complete quests, or you can venture back home and attempt to drop off your loot. Very good system!\n\nWonderful balance. The game does a great job of making you feel challenged but not overwhelmed. Never before in this game have I desired to quit the game because a level was brutally unfair to me. It gives me a great challenge, even if playing with a friend, but if it gets too easy for you INSANE MODE is already implimented in the game and ready to use. Turning it on is as easy as completing the tutorial level.\n\nThe game becomes self-aware.. mostly. The game only makes you complete its lengthy tutorial once, and after that you can jump right into your 5 out of 6 starting group and play away the day. It also holds nice polishes as to changes in the HUB city. Incuding little changes you might see after completing a quest.. \n\nThe characters and personalitys are diverse. Going into this I was scared that all of the characters might be static and comedy-esq where I know they only joke. While yes this game has an AMAZING sense of humor, it is very careful to pick and choose when to be full on comedy and when to dawn the garb of light hearted seriousness.\n\nMany refrences. If you're a proud owner of BattleBlock or Castle Crashers like I am, you are rewarded with headwear for your characters that have.. actually pretty reasonable stats. Long live Hatty Hattington, The Tearful Warrior!\n\nCons:\n\nThe interface for equiping weapons and armor is... foreign to say the least. Things don't add up. There are three kinds of swords: Short, Medium, and Large (Forgive me if the names are wrong, but that's the jist). Good mechanic overall, but the swords vary in damage only slightly while other stats such as DODGE and DEF. may suffer or benefit greatly. I found myself unable to equip items that may have looked amazing, or that I got from the games Early Access finale. Worst of all is that the swords add to your weight, so I find myself using almost only the starting weapons since they have the most balance.\n\nLeveling is broken. A big part of the appeal to this game was the Leveling system.. only to find out it does nothing. Amidst the wilds of the map you might discover a wild band of raiders you wish to attack. You kill one and a beam of purple erupts from your character while the letters, \"LVL UP!\" appear briefly. Is it noticable? No, the ATK, DEF, Ect buff is so small you'd have to level up quite a few times. I'm talking 20+ times, and leveling up does get progressively harder.\n\nArmor eye appeal. There is said to be 1300+ items in the game to equip, and the majority look pretty cool. Be it a cup of joe to a Doge refrence. However... don't expect your people to look cool if you favor stats. As unbalanced as the items are currently, you are ALWAYS stuck with the default \"T-shirt\" so to speak. Cool helmet? Great. B.A. Sword? Even Better. I just hope those things look cool on your plain white shirt or furry black hair troll.\n\n\nOverall:\n\nThis game is a wonderful game in my eyes, and I hate turn based combat spare Pokemon. It will take you on a few laughs and possibly make you wonder if Stamper's voice hurts after hearing his strange diologue where he occasionally yells. I feel this game is a wonderful addition to the Behemoth family and is on the forefront of breaking the bad trend of video game companies pumping out reskin sequels.\n\nFor only the price of 15$ I would reccomend this game if it had a few more fixes onto it. It has a nice touch to it and great replay value to those who enjoy playing with team building options.\n\n\nWhat could be fixed/changed:\n\nWagon upgrades, something to spend the money you'll accumulate as you progress. Something that's not needed nessesaraly, but something that would make the journey more enjoyable if you could customize your ride with cool looking cannons or an alternate horse type.\n\nBiome types. The game is very scattered and geographically makes utterly no sense. While yes, it is the Bear-apocalypse that doesn't mean the world should be as mixed as it is. I feel as if the map should have started with plains at least, expanding into a mountain zone to the west and a lake/island region to the east. Something to help pinpoint where the player is at. Something where the player could say: \"To get to the Desert, go North onto the flaming fields, once you've reached the volcano zone stop and head east towards the island region. Follow along this route North-east until the islands begin to clump together and you'll see the desert. Enjoy!\" \n\nBiome types. The characters are diverse in this game, but you take no advantage of it. Keep the little bandits in the fields, and the massive cyclopse men in the farther out areas so the player FEELs threatened. Am I saying exclude them from the lower levels? No, but I would suggest making them more frequent and powerful the farther they are from the current location of your Town is.\n\nTown/HUB Movement. It's a good idea, but if you went off of the Biome type idea I mentioned previously you might see an oppertinuty. This town movement instills adventure out of your comfort zone, but having the biome types could help the player navigate the landscape and perhaps even feel a bit more comfortable dodging the raining bear blood on their next quest.\n\nThe Pit. Give the player the choice to \"Descend\" the pit. It would eliminate part of the feel of grinding enemies outside, but here's the twist. The pit only gives EXP and little gold. The real incentive is if you can make it to X floor then you get a reward. However, to make it a challenge for your team you have to get down to X floor in one go. Perhaps a checkpoint at every 5th, 20th, or 50th floor depending on difficulty of individual floors? This pit idea would make the overworld seem less comforting as you'd be spending less time there, and the game would seem bigger as there's another objective for the player to do.\n\nADD TORSO EQUIPMENT. I've already said this in my review, but PLEASE add this. My team looks really sad-sack. I know the game is in the apocalypse, but the fact they never change shirts shouldn't hold in that situation either..\n\nLeveling. Perhaps if you got your character to say... LVL 100. There should be some kind of choice you can make. Here's what I think that choice should be. Getting to LVL 100 unlocks a quest where you BLAH BLAH BLAH you're left with the option to keep them at 100, split the 100 with the other team members on your team, or spend the levels on unlockables NOT NESSESARY TO THE GAME. Ex) Rare music disc's, unused Stamper audio, paints to re-color your items to make them match. Things a perfectionist, most people who reach 100 would be this, would crave.\n\n\n\nThat's about it for now, as I'd hate to waste anyones time who's still reading this. I hope this review helped!

Even the beastiary leaves you with a smirk after seing the illustrations.\n\nI will say though that the game feels built more for controllers. M+kb navigation of menues can be irritating at times. \n\nGiven its current state I still can boast that it is more than worth the 15 USD price tag and honestly in hindsight I would have paid twice that. It already has over 1000 items and 100 quests leaving so much to be discovered beneath the surface. The one main drawback is the fact is only has a few story missions [b] currently [/b]. \n\n[h1] Items [/h1]\n\nCurrently items of the same type act uniformly aside from elemental damage and resistance. There are a couple items that have interesting effects like slow and knockback but generally you are choosing between lightwight with high damage/movement/dodge or heavy that are more survivable. The non human characters have less customization but I have yet to see an item that I felt was not thoughtfully made and memorable. \n\n[h1] Quests [/h1]\n\nThe quests are absolutely bonkers. There are some delivery missions and find this missions but even something you would intitially dismiss in other games turns out to be comedic. For instance [spoiler] in one side quest you find a lizard and are tasked with taking it to its owner. The owner immediatly says he is going to eat it when you find him. You find out the lizard is sentient and blows up his owner telepathically. [/spoiler] \n\n[h1] Characters  [/h1]\n\nAll of the characters names are procedurally generated with a huge pool to choose from. There are a decent amount of types of enemies and even the worst of them is still viable with the right team. There is some balanceing that needs to be done still. One of the ways they balance currently is by making larger units take up more space on your roster. For example you have 6 slots after unlocking the final ones with in game currency. These can be filled in the following ways.\n\nHuge Unit = 3 slots\nLarge Unit = 2 slots\nRegular Unit = 1 slots\nPair of Small Units = 1 slot\nSome units can spawn up to 6 spawn units during each fight.\n\nIn this way a 2v2 arena fight could theoretically have 8 entities on the field or 84. \n[spoiler] 8 massive troll moms without thier spawn/ 12 gorgons and up to 72 spawn [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Difficulty  [/h1]\n\nOverall the game is not incredibly difficult after learning the basics but with the inclusion of Insane mode and elite enemies you will be pulling your hair out.\n\n[h1] Conclusion  [/h1]\n\nRemembering that this is an early access game and everything is subject to change, I give it a perfect 5/7 stars. \n\n[h1] Look forward to seeing you in the PIT.

Castle Crashers was amazing for unlocks and playing through multiple times to find all of the nuances and secrets lying underneath, but after 30-40 hours you have done and seen most of what the game has to offer. Pit People is so different in that aspect, as there are literally 1,000+ items to unlock, a multitude of different characters and species to \"recruit\", and a billion reasons to sink your time into this game.\n\nAs Early Access, the game gives you a very limited view of what is in store for the main story experience, but it vastly makes up for this with an addictive but accessible PVP and super-hard Co-Op pit mode. Not to mention the huge open world that seems to have a lot to discover, and plenty of creatures to add to your team as mentioned before.\n\nThere are a few noticable and jarring UI problems with this game. For one, a lot of the stat management and overviews for characters are incredibly subtle. At first, I had no idea that leveling your recruits mattered. There's no representation of your stats growing or what the growth per individual species would be. You'll especially notice this once you recruit a Mascot species type, as their attack damage on the stats page reads a huge number above all other species, but they merely buff other characters and don't do the damage stated on their page. There needs to be more ways to differenciate between the different Clops or Humans you recruit, as well as stat comparison to someone you're wanting to swap in on your team before taking on PvP or the World Map. \n\nThe UI is also very difficult to manage with a mouse + keyboard. I have been playing most of this game with the Steam Controller, and I find that method of play to be a lot more enjoyable. Playing on my laptop with a mouse and keyboard, or even my main PC, was a challenge. There's no visual feedback when you're nearing the edge of the screen in the main hub for bulding selections other than a \"click your mouse\" prompt, and you usually find yourself running between buildings often trying to make a simple selection. There are plenty of other examples of the UI being incredibly clunky and vague, like the Quest Selection page before you depart to the world. I had to take a few moments to grasp what they wanted me to do.\n\nI've put a good amount of hours into this game so far, and I cannot wait to see what they bring to the table with it. Definitely one of the better Early Access titles I have ever played. I see this game having such potential for updates, maybe little DLC packs for new character stories or mission packs. Hell, maybe even release these quarterly for free. I can also see a potential competitive scene emerging from this game once all the balancing has been ironed out, and most of the gameplay has been tweaked a bit.\n\nI will update this review when the game goes live, but I would highly recommend you buy this if you are on the fence about it. I would say 80% of the game is there, and what is included is well worth the $15 asking price.\n\nTo the Pits!", "timestamp_created": 1485075243, "timestamp_updated": 1485075243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29416194": {"recommendationid": "29416194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119821717", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514518098}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ud55c\uae00\ud654\uac00 \uc81c\ub300\ub85c \uc548\ub418\uc788\uc74c \uba87\uba87 \uae00\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 ?

The humor is perfect, and the art is fantastic. There are so many different weapons and units to delve into and figure out; However, this is part of the problem. The game throws you in with a minimal tutorial and trying to figure out the game can be quite overwhelming.\n\nMy first complaint is the way the team customization menu is set up. When trying to choose new swords or helmets for my characters, I often feel its very clunky and uninformative, and the lack of individual statistics for each piece of equipment, trying to figure out the balance of the game is hell. There is also no point in really equiping a sword over a mace because mace's can bash helmets. Swords cant and they both deal around the same damage.\n\nMy second complaint is the different races and what they're good against and weak against. It simply gives symbols without telling me what exactly those symbols mean. I wish there was more direction in what these mean and more explanation in the Surival Journal. Traveling around the map seems like a mess because I see all these monuments that I just discovered, but it's just very confusing and nothing is truly recognizable. Unlike in Castle Crashers where there were different and recognizable districts with different enemies. Here, the map is just a cluster of different biomes clashed together in no recognizable structure and generic monuments that I cant really tell apart.\n\nAlso, what even does leveling up do to my character other than refill their health?\n\nSorry if this review seems like a mess, I wrote it quickly.

While this game is Early Access, it is not riddled with bugs that create huge problems. I believe it is more of a feature skinny Early Access, and the way the game is, the coding should not be difficult, and a below average dev woul be able to create it without gamebreaking bugs, so that is not a big shock. To me, the game is very boring, too slow, and doesnt bring anything new to the tactics based RPG. I actually think it takes away a lot of things that make for a good tactical RPG. \n\n The equipment diversiity is made in a way that they are only for looks. Getting new weapons and whatnot, just change what they look like, but all swords do the same thing, and all bows and so forth. I hate this, and really think it detracts from the replayability of a game like this. Games like Final Fantasy Tactics did this genre so well, and other games go and create something similar, remove some things, and change some things and add some things, but devs seem to constantly change the WRONG things, and make for a worse playing experience than what would otherwise be here.\n\nALL that being said, this game is NOT bad, and is actually something that could be worth playing, if it were priced right. This is $5 game, when completed. Right now it should be on sale for $3 or $4, and never be more than $5 when done. Unfortunately devs don't know how to price games, and think their game is worth more than it is. Selling 1000 copies at $15, is far worse than selling 10000 copies at $5, and everything about this game screams under $10 game.

As with these games, though, the patented wacky Behemoth humor is definitely present and possibly at its best, with silliness around every corner, craziness that will leave you confused yet smiling like an idiot, and references to past games hidden (or not so much) in every nook and cranny. Stamper as the voice of an omnipresent narrator is particularly on cue with his side-splitting spiteful commentary and nefarious interactions with the game characters and world that can happen at seemingly unexpected moments as he looks to kill his boredom at your expense.\n\nFor being in Early Access, the game looks and plays great, with solid controls and crisp, styled 2D sprites, though some of the UI could perhaps be cleaned up a bit or better explained. Your house in town where you can change out your team initially felt a bit overwhelming, requiring a lot of clicks to change out equipment and lack of button cues leading to a team member almost getting sold. Likewise, we received no warning that a quest would receive an F for Failure by returning back to town before we completed it, leading to an awkward visit with the local principal. Battles, meanwhile, could begin to get cluttered and claustrophobic, especially with the extra bodies and input in co-op, with allies and enemies having similar color and designs bunched up together on screen at once; there was often confusion on which character was currently selected and who was moving where. Our gripes are minor compared to the refined edges, though, and once you get things down, battles can feel intuitive while still retaining strategic complexity, allowing fights to be as fast-paced or as slow and methodical as you wish them to be. With a discount while in Early Access, Pit People appears to be another great game by The Behemoth that is worth a pick up and play, and we are excited to see the rest of the crazy content and wacky adventure that will be in the finished game.\n\n[u]Catalyst Players/Reviewers[/u]: Jacob and Murphy\n[u]Version[/u]: [b]Early Access[/b] - Jan. 18, 2017\n[u]Played[/u]: Co-Op Campaign (3hrs)", "timestamp_created": 1485040421, "timestamp_updated": 1485040537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504951", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29409545": {"recommendationid": "29409545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126242995", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 519, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487431792}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu m\u00e9rite r\u00e9ellement que l'on s'y attarde. \n\nQuel d\u00e9chirement lorsque l'on se rend compte que l'histoire s'arr\u00eate d\u00e9j\u00e0.

Behemoth's games always find a way to create completely hystarocal and mind blowingly comedic games.

My favorite aspect of Pit People is the sound track, fast paced and unique like the game. The game gives you a ton of options on how you would like to play. For example my first team were all using explosive weapons with bandit like apparel. If you find yourself usually not liking turn based games I highly recommend you give this a try.

Then I found out about alien hominid, and I absolutely loved that too (even though it was hard as all hell). When Battle Block theatre was announced I couldn't wait (but I had some how managed). Bought it the day it game out and enjoyed the living shit out of that game, the reason I didn't buy it on steam was that I managed to unlock nearly head for the prisoner. The second I found out about game number four (now Pit People) I shit bricks. I had just played through games like XCOM and Fire emblem (WaifuWars:Awakening) and really started to like the turn based strategy genre so I felt like fate had delivered the dream game. Little did I know that this dream game would also be early access. Mow lets get into the pros and cons (so far).\n\nPROS\n+The signiture Behemoth artstyle, the very reason I love the brush tool in Adobe Flash (By the time I typed Flash it \n  crashed)\n+Wonderful soundtrack I walready wish I could buy.\n+Lots of customization.\n+Instead of moving units one by one they all move at once.\n+A unique system of instead targetting an any, a charater will instead attack one enemy withen thier range prioritizing\n  melee attacks over ranged attacks.\n+A simple armor system.\n+The randomly generated enemies and names (as far as I know though the character types and positions do not change \n  for scenarios which is awesome)\n+The \"class/races\" as far as I can tell play pretty differently and uniquely. I couldn't imainge what game would have a \n  cupcake that mutilates itself to heal others, though its probably hidden somewhere in some DnD story.\n+The humor. I'm always one for a good fart joke, but when voiced by Will Stamper, I love a good fart joke,\n+Will stamper is the one voice that isn't in the parody of simish that the characters speak in. I love it.\n\nCONS\n-No name customization, though I do like the random names I wanna name a party after a few friends and I then place \n  bets on who dies in what order in the pit.\n-The game explains how to play it, but not how the character building works which you kinda just learn on your own.\n-Catchin- errr \"recruiting\" a unit always seems to give me two stars instead of three after each battle, but it makes sense \n  considering Will Stamper praises you for as murdering as many people in a turn as you can.\n-Never seem to get a toon gold, but not too much of a con unless you really want to buy a 7K gold unit.\n-Not enough content... yet.\n\nFor dedicated Behemoth fans you should buy this after reading this, it has a fairly short download time too so you won't die from getting hyped. \nFor people who have played a Behemoth game I would wait a week or so then check on the updates.\nFor people who are interested in this you should wait a month, then check on the updates.\n\nIf Dan Palidan and Tom Fulp are reading this, thank you for work and time. I really hope you enjoy your work as much as I do. I really hope you guys flesh this game out. You already have 1,300+ ITEMS, each one unique and quirky! I don't know how you manage to do it but you guys really buckle some pants when it comes down to making video games.

The animation is wonderful, the art style awesome, the humor hilarious and off the wall, the gameplay is super solid, the story is so far, priceless. I love the narrator. The game does kind of fail to explain its self very well, luckily I'm familiar with turn based, grid based, rpg games. The fact that it IS LOCAL CO-OP, makes it awesome for me and the wife.  To be to the point, thus far it's a 8/10 easy. It could very well be as good as castle crashers in a lot of ways. We could have an award winner here.\n\nPROS\n-Great Behemoth style game just like Castle Crasher and Battle Block Theater.\n-Wonderful humor/art style\n-Solid turn based RPG gameplay, great animations\n-Local Co-Op (as well as online, so far though it seems to be invite co-op only)\n-Online Competitive play, if you're into that sorta... thing...\n-Absolutely mind blowing soundtrack\n\n\nCONS\n-The tutorial is rather haphazard. While I slid right into playing, I didn't feel like how the game worked was very well explained, it just felt familiar enough to pick up and play.\n-The quest system didn't seem to be explained at all, I didn't even realize I had \"quests\" outside of what the story narrative covered as the general 'story' quest. I didn't realize there were quests in a sort of quest log format that could be turned in for rewards until I saw my first quest complete pop up. \n- Your \"Home base\" i.e the town you return to during your adventures to rest and upgrade party members, gets randomly moved about every 3 returns to it or so. It is only ever moved when you are in it, so you don't have to worry about it moving while you're gone, but you can't really make any exploration progress this way because you're continously being moved to new places you don't know.\n-You have a limit to the amount of loot you can carry, you must return to town to deposit your booty and then head back out. \n-Trading is not explained in co-op, at least not in local. When you return home in co-op you'll get a screen of loot between you and your partner, the left and right represent players 1 and 2 respectively. From the start nothing is 'selected', anything selected is automatically given to the other player. I say given, instead of trade, because if the other player doesn't select anything, they still get everything you clicked anyway for free. This isn't a problem, especially in co-op where maybe someone got something they don't need but the other does. The point is, what this screen even meant let alone how it worked, was not explained at all. \n-So far no luck match making. I'm not saying it doesn't work, I just am saying I've tried to find someone to do the Pit Co-Op with and gotten nothing three times over two days.", "timestamp_created": 1485002474,

I come back to it and there is more content and you can see how much the Developers care about there game, they take time for well made, content filled updates. The game has many characters that you can capture and get onto your team, if you want a healer that is good, get the penguin with the tuba, if you want long rang attacks get a unicorn. The game also has a lot of customization, you can change your characters to your deight making the game feel like you are controlling it. What I have played of the story so far is amazing, it tells it in a great way but doesn't take long before you are jumping around killing things.

I took a leap (with my credit card that's no unheard of) and I do not regret my decision for one second! The game isn't perfect but it's great for me. I'll list pros and cons and depending on your taste in games you might have a different experience.\n\nPros\n- Simple to learn system. You move your character to where you want and if they can do an action in that space they will. \n- Character customization: You have your stock plot characters but you can also recruit any of the denizens of the world. You can't change their name or \"class\" if they're a monster, but you can collect literally 1000 different helmets, (which are somtimes hair styles) weapons, armor etc. Getting a character with a funny name is many a player's goal.\n- No bugs for me. I haven't found any bugs yet, or graphical or sound problems.\n- I love the music, it wavers between this weird techno to silly haphazard metal.\n- The animation is smooth and I like the simple style.\n\nCons\n-The game itself is not complete and that's ok for me, it tells you and you can keep playing after that part in the plot. Technically a con but it's out there in plain site for us to see befor we purchase.\n-Atmosphere. I enjoy the abstract and comedic design of the game's world, some people might not. This isn't a dark and brooding tactical rpg clearly. \n- Interface! I DID have trouble figuring out what buttons do what in some cases because they are simpily a graphic, not actually labeled. I don't like how if you hover to another character by accident or another equipment (like from helmets to weapons tab) you go to that field as if you clicked.

A deceptively simple turn-based strategy game with all the cartoonish charm and humour of Behemoth's other games. \n\nWhilst it is by no means flawless in the current state, you can feel a sense of polish and care that gives hope for future development. The game centers around you taking control of a small team of heroes/monsters/mushrooms/cupcakes and taking on other teams of either AI or player controlled enemies in beautiful hex-tile maps. Despite the depth of the damage and weapon types, the healing, debuffing and buffing, counters and weaknesses; your only function as a player is to move your characters. That's it. Whilst that seems uninteresting at first, you quickly find how complex it really is.\n\nYou start your game with three characters and must capture individual enemies in order to recruit them to your hero locker-room to be mixed and matched in order to form an ideal team. \n\nPros:\n- Recognisable and enjoyable art style\n- Fantastic soundtrack and SFX\n- Simple yet deep combat\n- MASSIVE array of cosmetics\n- Hilarious writing\n\nCons:\n- Lacking a real vision in what the game wants you to achieve\n- Not much character development (Levels seem arbitrary, all gear of the same type have the same stats)\n- Will end up being repetitive if turn based strats aren't your genre\n\nMy hope for the future is in the developers implementing some kind of (possibly Castle Crashers-esque) character development system. Right now, once you capture a character to use on your team - there is no sense of growth or power. Stat increases from levelling are apparently negligible.

Got into the PC Beta and was happy to see that all the progress we had there was moved onwards to the early access. As The Behemoth mentioned, the early access period is only because they realized the game was in a fun playable state. It feels extremely polished from a gameplay standpoint and only really a few gripes I could notice. \n\nIn co-op, if playing with controller, the only to even begin playing is to hit the F2 button which is a little unintuitive, especially if you're away from the keyboard.

Pit People is a different genre of game than their previous games, but the character style and sense of humour is consistent in Pit People as well.\n\nYou create a team to with up to 6 characters on it, and battle against the enemies in turn based combat until one team is defeated or your objective is accomplished. I\u2019ve been playing mostly on normal difficulty. I always heal to full health before each encounter, and so far I haven\u2019t found the fights too challenging. I tried a mission on the insane difficulty, and if it wasn\u2019t for my characters leveling up (to restore them to full hp) mid-combat, I would have died for sure. You can bring more than one of the same character type at a time, but the cupcakes don\u2019t heal other cupcakes. If all of your characters die, you lose some gold and maybe some items, but there is no perma-death, so the game is forgiving in that sense.\n\nDuring your turn you lock in all of your moves at once before ending the turn. If you make a mistake with the move, you can always change it before you end your turn. You are given plenty of time to lock in your moves. The combat has some random factors, like dodging, crits, and most notably which target you actually hit. You have control over your team\u2019s movement, but you have no say as to which target you will actually attack. For example: if you place a character in a hex that\u2019s adjacent to multiple targets, your character can attack any of the available targets, and not necessarily the target you want. There is friendly fire with AE abilities, and you can accidentally heal enemies as well. \n\nYou journey out from town to explore, or complete missions by driving around the map in a nitro-boosted wagon...that poops. There are enemies everywhere, but it\u2019s nice that you can easily avoid combat by stunning them and running past if you want to. It\u2019s a lot better than having to flee combat, since fleeing makes all of your characters take damage, and drops your items on the ground. \n\nYou can play by yourself against the AI, or in two player co-op either online or locally. There is voice and text chat In co-op, so you can coordinate easier. Both you and your ally take your turns at the same time, and there are a lot more enemies to compensate for there being a second player. There is also an arena where you can battle against other players in 2v2 battles or compete for scores on the leaderboard against AI.\n\nIn almost every battle, you have the option to recruit the last remaining enemy by capturing them with a net and cage. I think it\u2019s awesome that you can capture any enemy you come across, and that it never fails to capture. It\u2019s also neat that you get to keep all of the equipment that they are wearing when you are recruit them. Sometimes I wish I could capture more than one enemy per battle though. There are different species that have special abilities, and other species that can be equipped with gear. There are no skill points to allocate, but the equipment let\u2019s you customize each character.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list][*]the same Behemoth style and humour\n[*]lots of side quests to do, and some have their own mini stories to go with them\n[*]TONS of collectible items to find - most are purely cosmetic, while others have various combat stats, and you can also trade items with other players (I played for about 10 hours, and only got 9% complete)\n[*]the gameplay is fun, but can get repetitive after a while (I still got my money's worth)\n[*]voice acting for the narrative (Will Stamper, from BattleBlock Theater) is amazing, and the goofy made-up language with voice acting is rather entertaining at times\n[*]most of the sound effects are decent, and soundtrack is good, but it won\u2019t appeal to everyone.\n[*]good looking unique and colourful environments that are all designed with hexes\n[*]awesome animations, and fantastic character customizations\n[*]keybindings are fully customizable, and there is full controller support[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list][*]the game lacks a full-sized map that shows all the areas you\u2019ve explored - since you can only have 2 active quests at a time, it would be nice to have a large map marking points of interest you\u2019ve seen, but not yet completed\n[*]not much of the main story it available yet as expected in early access (but at least there are a lot of side quests available)\n[*](nitpick) the clouds everywhere blocking vision while driving around is annoying\n[*](nitpick) the randomness of which targets you actually hit can be a pain sometimes\n[*](nitpick) it can sometimes be hard to tell which hexes you can\u2019t walk on\n[*](nitpick) when you are running through enemies avoiding combat the aggro sound is quite irritating (they should lower the radius that prompts the sound)[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nIf you\u2019re hoping for story, there isn\u2019t much in the way of a story campaign just yet, but there are still plenty of quests to do.  Playing against the AI as single player is fun, but it feels repetitive after a while. The co-op is enjoyable, but I wasn\u2019t able to try the PvP since I got impatient waiting for it to pop. Overall, it\u2019s a nicely polished turn-based strategy game that\u2019s not too punishing, and it has an abundance of collectibles, and the sense of humour you would expect from a Behemoth title. I have no regrets with the purchase, and I look forward to more of the story being added.\n\nIf you like my reviews, please feel free to join my Steam group, and follow my curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/AzralynnReviews#curation]here.[/url]\nYou can also view this review on my website [url=http://www.azralynn.com/review-pit-people-game-early-access/]here.[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1484851759, "timestamp_updated": 1491777403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.761443", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29360839": {"recommendationid": "29360839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096518878", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485677804}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Otro gran juego por parte de behemoth!", "timestamp_created": 1484850532, "timestamp_updated": 1484850532, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29360818": {"recommendationid": "29360818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178871515", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514417460}, "language": "english", "review": "I myself do not like turn based games.

Then, i saw that pit people will be releasing on 13th January. \n\nAfter watching a few gameplay videos, I bought the game on that day and knowing that it is release as early access. i have played turn based strategy like ff tactics and tactics ogre. This game definately attract my interest. For me, i really like the humor that resembles rick and morty. The animation that resembles adventure time and catchy soundtrack. The gameplay is quite simple and the difficulty level is okay. They also provide insane difficulty level. Loots are basically reskin of equipable item and only few provide different attributes such as elemental resistance or damage. It is understandable due to there are too many items. Maybe different stats for items will be implement by dev or not. I am okay with that.\n\nThe game is still at early access stage. Some people are complainig about the short main story. But it is not a problem for me. Within 11 hours of playing this game, i did not touch the main story. I only played side quest, explore the map, catching units and played pvp. PVP is quite interesting because of the leaderboard motivates me to get a better position on it. It is understandable that finding people on online match is quite hard for sea server. But it is easy to find people in online coop for me.\n\nThis is my opinion. I recommend this to people who like this kind of game. You could watch youtube for gameplay.

If you enjoy games like Final Fantasy Tatics you'll love this game.  Although this is still early access the game is very much complete although some of the story is missing.  Not only is it hilarious but the game is very fullfilling to play.  \n\nThe reason I've already played 24+ hours of this game is because of the pit.  The Pit is a place you can use the characters you've developed to fight other people in 1v1 or 2v2.  There are countless classes, weapons, armor and tatics on how you can win your next battle.\n\nAfter each battle if you keep 1 person alive you can capture him/her/it and it will join your team.  Any battle you encounter you can capture 1 of the enemies no matter how large they may be.  You then can use its armor/weapons to put on your other characters or keep them whole.  \n\nI'd easily pay $50 for the game as it is right now.  One of the best games i've played in a long time.  If your on the fence, buy it, you won't regret it.\n\nMuch love and life!\n", "timestamp_created": 1484768079, "timestamp_updated": 1484768079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617150", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29342854": {"recommendationid": "29342854", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165716665", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1448, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509741937}, "language": "english", "review": "Very exciting game.

The Behemoth, the creators of my favorite beat-em-up and one of my favorite platformers, made a turn-based game? Sign me up!\n\nI'm a fan of turn-based games with RPG elements: the Fallout games by Interplay, Wasteland, Fire Emblem, the works. Seeing this game annouced, I was a little skeptical. Specifically, about the co-op features. Many turn-based games with co-op have each player move individually. But I'll be beaten down with a rubber hose filled with frozen custard if The Behemoth didn't make it work.\n\nI can easily compare the gameplay to Fire Emblem, but boiled down to what's important. No faffing about with the weapon triangle for Pit People! Bigger weapons do more damage but weigh more. Archers aren't effective at close range. Maces work better on armored foes. Ultimately, the secret to success is how you position your soldiers on the field. Different squads can mesh together in different ways, allowing for interesting stratigies that work for you.\n\nThe humor is nothing new if you've played Behemoth's previous, with the glorious glorious voice of Stamper, the narrator in Battleblock Theatre, making a return as the narrator. This time around he's made out to be super sarcastic and passive-aggressive towards the protagonists. It's truly a joy to behold the dialouge. But as they say, the devil's in the details. Pit People has a lot of tiny details that make it much more enjoyable. For example, each unit type has a special entry corralating to them. And the entries are just an absolute joy.\n\nThis game is a-okay in my book!", "timestamp_created": 1484725371, "timestamp_updated": 1484725555, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29331767": {"recommendationid": "29331767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089766135", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 659, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503713160}, "language": "english", "review": "best early access investment ive ever made", "timestamp_created": 1484723125, "timestamp_updated": 1484723125, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29331563": {"recommendationid": "29331563", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101373698", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484843996}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f88\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u6c49\u5316\u8c8c\u4f3c\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\uff1f\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u5730\u65b9\u5f04\u4e0d\u61c2\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7b49\u7ea7\u5c5e\u6027\u554a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7684\u3002\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d", "timestamp_created": 1484721806, "timestamp_updated": 1484721806, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29331518": {"recommendationid": "29331518", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100335545", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486182619}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so goofy and is very entertaining.

Il y a tout ce qu'il manque \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie FE selon moi (bien que n'ayant pas jou\u00e9 aux plus r\u00e9cents \u00e0 savoir \u00e0 partir de FE:Awakening) : une map \u00e0 naviguer librement, des objets cosm\u00e9tiques \u00e0 collectionner, des succ\u00e8s ...\n\nPit People est tr\u00e8s original pour les classes de personnage qu'il propose : il offre un gameplay int\u00e9ressant et tr\u00e8s vari\u00e9, chacun joue \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re avec sa team, qu'on peut custom de milles et une fa\u00e7on. J'ai un coup de coeur pour les pixies qui sont trop mimi et puissantes, mais aussi les mascottes qui servent \u00e0 booster votre \u00e9quipe, et qui en cas de coup dur peuvent servir de kamikazes !\n\nQuelques b\u00e9mols cependant :\n- musiques pas top top, je trouve que celles de Battleblock Theater et Castle Crashers sont bien plus accrochantes, entra\u00eenantes (bien que je n'ai pas encore tous les vinyles) : surtout celles des combats qui doivent former une boucle et dont on ne se lasse pas !

This game moves quickly by giving the player only one important choice of where to move their units. Each unit then moves to a point and performs their ability/attack. Games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem can take 30-60 minutes to complete a single mission while you can finish a battle in Pit People in like 10-20 minutes.\n\nEach character in the game has a race and equipment that you can customize. You can even recruit new party members by capturing them in battle. This offers huge replay value and the ability to create all sorts of combinations. I love how there is plenty of cosmetic variations as well.\n\nThis is Behemoth's best game. A great game with high replay value. The best part is this completely a co-op game in all features.

battle against, preventing the annoyances in most of the rpgs of this type (looking at you, zubat caves <.<).

A warning: the Story content is limited at the moment, with most of the gameplay coming from building your team, working out strong team compositions and side questing/exploring. There's a good few hours of gameplay here and battling in the pit is very addictive.\n\nThe game works great on a keyboard and mouse, but there's a confusing mix of KB/M specific interface icons and Controller Icons currently. In some cases it's unclear which button I need to be pressing. Additionally, combat can also feel clunky when it comes to selecting the correct character and it would be nice if the game could be played without needing to use the keyboard - a clickable end turn button etc would probably do the trick.\n\nThe game's also rather obtuse in a number of areas. There doesn't appear to be an in-game explanation of a number of the attribute icons as yet. Many are obvious (breaks helmets, inflicts fire damage, blocks ranged attacks) yet some aren't clear at all. The equip menu itself is also pretty clunky and unintuitive initially.\n\nWorth checking out now if you're a fan of the Behemoth, otherwise perhaps wait a little while.", "timestamp_created":

This allows for the best and most tactical disicions possible, and give the player all the info they need without hassle.\nIn this game, your constantly looking through bonoculars magnetically taped to your forehead by Stamper with no way of taking them off because of that metal plate you goit in your head.\nSeriosuly, why did you think that was a good idea?\n\n-Not many Varried objectives\nMost maps boil down to \"Kill the enemy\". While this is a fine, morally Upstanding goal, it can get a tad boring at times. The few defend and seiges maps work greatat showing the strengths and weaknesses of each race, class, unit, and otherwise.\nHowever, when the Maps are almost entirly \"Kill these guys\", it makes some units undeniably better then others, such as Fredrick.\nSpeaking of which...\n\n-Fredrick is too Powerful\nI though I was done with him when I was finshed with Awakening for the 7th time.\nI though I had found a game without a ludicrusly Overpowered unit.\nI was wrong.\nFredrick the Cyclops, with his long flowing Magenta hair, Tiny turtle shell sheild, and Nucular Bomb Club, was far too powerful for the rest of my units too keep up. Even taking up two slots wasn't enough to stop this deminsiopn hopping monstrosity. His two move seemd like a reasonable nerf.\nHA.\nThat was only so the enemies could pickl a god and pray one last time before their inevitable demise.\nThe only map he ever struggled with was the Lumberjack one, and that's 'cuse he hate's lumberjacks and long distances.\nNothing could stand up to him, not even other cyclopses.\nWhen the undead came crawling, he put them back in the grave. He wasn't afraid to kil. Again and again.\nIt didn't matter that he took damage from his bomb.\nIt didn't even mater that we lacked a healer for most of the game.\nFredrick could not be killed.\nFredrick could not be stopped.\nFredrick was a force of nature.\n\nAnd it wasn't enough he was that strong, he was ALWAYS the one talking too. He was the leader of this rag tag group he called a team. Sure, his ego was about as through the roof as his strength, but he had twice as much bite for every bark you'd even THINK he had.\n\nBut, as amazing as he is, all good things must end. Fredrick is too overpowered. I'd be happy to see him nerfed, in exchange for seeing him more in the story, with his FLowing purple, deep, muscly voice and suprisingly sensable values.\n\n-The terrain sometimes black the veiw of the units\nDespite how massive Fredick is even compared to other cyclopses, there were times where the terrain even obscured HIM. Just making the terrain a unit is standing behind less opaque would solve this issue immediately.\n\n-The healers don't heal enough\n'nuff said. You need two to make them even think about being useful, and even then, that's a slot that could be used to bring ANOTHER cyclops to use with Fredrick.\n\n-More unique weapons\nI want more weapons that DO things.\nI love re-skins as much as the next guy, but it can make it hard to tell what some enemies are capable of, and that can SUCK. Besides, it would make getting a new weapon exciting rathen then \"Oh, what's this reskin?\"\n\n-Sopfia Sucks\nI understand that the \"Capture\" unit shouldn't be a godess. But COME ON, she is SO WEAK compared to everyone else. If she had visable utility outside of capturing, like maybe some abilities to help with defend of seige maps, that might make her useful. But, since every map is \"Kil, Kill, KILL\" she's an active detriment. \nBesides, once you capture Fredrick, there is no need to capture anyone else, so she becomes useless.\n\n-Status effects Suck\nTheres no point to avaoiding them because they suck so much.\n\n-More unique characters\nI like how Gluten got his own side quest. I want more units like him, who get some soft of quest to go along with them.\nI would say restrict the quests so you HAVE to have them in your party, though. For story reasons.\n\n-Show more of the other main characters in the story\nHoratio and Pimpstella are suprisingly engaging characters, but I felt myself wondering during some of these scenes \"Where's Yslove? Where's Sofia? Where's Glutan? Where's Fredrick?\"\nThese are all characters introduced in the main story, but never get any appearences in the main story, and rarely appear in sidequests (Aside from Yslove). Even if they are not present, they should have at least a little more of an impact.\n\n\n-PVP's kinda crap\nWhen your losing, there's not many ways to \"Win\".

Ok.\n\nTake the art style and humor of Castle Crashers with 100% less poop jokes thank the heavens. Weave said elements into Fire Emblem; and you have Pit People. \n\nThe game wastes no time thrusting you into the plot; which is fairly straightforward, and cliched in nature but hey. You're not actually here for the plot, lets be alarmingly real with ourselves.\n\nYou're here for the sense of humor, and it delievers. \nThe gameplay is b a s i c a l l y older Fire Emblem. Grid based chess with everyone usually having a weakness; but unlike FE; they don't throw a bunch of numbers and stats at you (To take words from Konjin; attacks don't really enter double digits much so when you get slapped down the map for 15, it has a legit impact, so yeah you're not hit with tons of numbers) and more importantly; planning isn't really needed.\nYou don't know how much damage any shot is gonna do, nor if it'll even hit (if you're running an archer or similar for example)\nYou don't know how far each dude can move.\nYou don't really know what the items dude have can do until you get hit by it and see you're poisoned suddenly.\nYou don't even know how many life points you have. You just kinda exist in a limbo of not being too sure.\n\nThe AI isn't great here. If you're running a pegasus knigh in FE; you main focus is gonna be where the archers are; and all that, ranges, and the best way to stab them. Here; you don't know how far dudes can move, you can see the archers but as for their range; you really don't know. You can only guess. And even if you guess wrong there is no risk. Here, Vampiress' are damaged more by arrows but they don't get targeted?\nAt least it doesn't seem like they do? Maybe I'm wrong. I likely am. \n\nNonetheless; in FE if you threw a flying horse anywhere close to the range of an archer; the thing will get shot right out of the sky. \nthe AI I guess doesn't want to target weaknesses; and it barely targets more hurt dudes. Heck, fellows with swords will go after helmeted protags despite the fact that they're at a disadvantage whilst doing so.\n\nI think the thing I dislike the most about this entire game is the fact that the fighters you control will choose who to fight.\nYes. That not-good AI basically rolls a dice and smacks around how it wishes. This was done, I know, so that the squids will have an actual purpose, but that gimmick is only ever ok. Its hilarious to see it work, but its only ok. The AI needs fixed for this effect to mean anything more really, and its only useful against the AI, since all you need to do is force the afflicted dude away. So; I have two ideas: remove squids, and let us have full control over our fighters. Let us decide who dies. \n\n\nAnother bothersome flaw with this here game is relocating the city. Why, exactly? So that you don't get used to the map? To present the illusion of having a limited amount of time to captures dudes to your cause? I haven't the foggiest. (inspired by another review)\n\n\nEach mission is super FE. Its all the same and thats only a bad thing if you see it that way. Let me channel my innter Yahtzee: You effectively go to the place and stab the lads.\nLets be clear. 3/4ths of the game is exactly that.\nEach quest provides a funny reason as to why you went to the place and stab the lads, but in the end, you're still just going to the place to stab the lads.\nYou can save one lad to live to be captured to your side if you have a cage and you will because they're cheap.\nThis mechanic is awesome and I really enjoy it.\nThe lads that you can play as, are a varied as they come. From Gorons, to vampiress, to your run of the mill swordsmen and archers, to cyclops with big ol mallets, to wraths (a personal favorite) that offer debuffs at a range; to cupcakes that fling themselves to heal others.\n\nThe cosmetics they have are staggering an amusing in their own right, the weapons you get are in their own classes and are wildly creative and also funny, and each dude you kill has a random name. \nGenerally you choose weapons based off of what they look like. No joke. Execpt that i s a joke.\nI can say whatever I want about anything, right?\n\nBut time, effort, and love was pouring into each line of code of this game. \nSome of the items and cosmetics are named after the long gone memes of yesteryear but irony is alive and well.\nI will wear the hat that looks like a Shiba Inu, which flashes the word 'wow' around itself and dang nabbit I will stab the lads.\n\nearly access/10", "timestamp_created": 1484623683, "timestamp_updated": 1510166956, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525547", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29309044": {"recommendationid": "29309044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198301143308", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 878, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489881494}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as amazing and the other two games", "timestamp_created": 1484623071, "timestamp_updated": 1484623071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29308983": {"recommendationid": "29308983", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063767491", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2299, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507661484}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is simple to pick up and understand and offers hours of laughter and fun!

The meat of the game is doing battle with teams of bad guys with your very own squad that you find through the story mode until you find Sophia the Recruitador (a lot of characters in this game have funny names). Then, the game branches into another way of playing it. You can capture any unit you fight on the battlefield when you leave it as the last one alive. There are several character classes from the human fighters to the penguins to the beefy giants to the cupcake healer class. Every character has their own name from Gluten to Pipistrella.\n\nThis is an early access title as of January, and it shows only in the story mode. The rest of the game is polished and balanced with each weapon type and class, but the story mode is farly short. What it lacks in length it makes up in character and gameplay. The narrator Stamper was present in their previous game Battleblock Theater as well but he takes the role of a godlike bear that overlooks the story as a sort of meta-narrator, talking to the characters and talking to the player. Apart from the short story quests, there are a few side quests that are all five parts incrasing in difficulty. These serve the same purpose as side quests in different games, to give you some more gold and flesh out the characters. These side quests take a bit longer than the story. \n\nApart from the insanely fun singleplayer, there exists an in-universe multiplayer PvP called the Pit, which is pretty much the only reference to the title of the game. You and a partner control your squads to defeat two other people's squads. It's a very satisfying game mode as you can learn from the other people's squad composition to increase chances of success. Think XCOM PvP. You get story rewards as well depending on how many games you win per day. As it is now, Pit People is very fun and well balanced even though the story mode was short and as sweet as the cupcake healer class.", "timestamp_created": 1484620485, "timestamp_updated": 1486928117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 208, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.924790", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29308374": {"recommendationid": "29308374", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998881490", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486869030}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so absurd and entertaining...I usually hate stuff like this, but I just love this game! \nSkip the long winded exaltations and spend a value menu lunch worth of money buying it.

Trop simple. Au point que cet aspect va purement et simplement s'av\u00e9rer ennuyant. Jetez vos personnages dans la m\u00e9l\u00e9e, et spammez espace jusqu'\u00e0 ce vous ayez gagn\u00e9, et vous passerez sans encombre l'ensemble des niveaux. \n\nLe jeu propose cependant un aspect \"Pleins de trucs \u00e0 r\u00e9colter\" plut\u00f4t sympa, mais l'absence de diff\u00e9rence en dehors de l'apparence de la plupart des armes est plut\u00f4t decevante. Chaque item appartient \u00e0 une \"cat\u00e9gorie\" (Arme l\u00e9g\u00e8re, lourde, moyenne, massue) et chacune de ces cat\u00e9gories aura des stats d'attaque bien pr\u00e9cises, cependant les armes au sein d'une m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie ne seront pas diff\u00e9rentes en terme de stats. Certaines apporteront de petits bonus (Saignements, repousse, d\u00e9gats \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires) mais rien de suffisant pour encourager la r\u00e9colte d'arme.\nDe la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, vous pourrez recruter de nombreux types de personnages diff\u00e9rents disposants chacuns de capacit\u00e9s propres, cependant vous en faites vite le tour et le manque d'information par rapport \u00e0 certaines unit\u00e9s peut s'av\u00e9rer handicapant. (Impossible de savoir la port\u00e9e d'une unit\u00e9 \u00e0 longue distance)\n\nSur une note plus positive, c'est du Behemoth. Les musiques sont sympas, le style graphique est absolument g\u00e9nial et l'humour est pr\u00e9sent. L'humour est cependant plus cynique qu'absurde, notamment si on le compare avec celui de Battleblock Theater. Donc oui c'est toujours un peu absurde, mais moins. \n\nMalgr\u00e9 cela, l'ennui ressenti lors des phases de strat\u00e9gie m'emp\u00eache purement et simplement de profiter de ce jeu. \nJe ne recommanderais donc pas Pit People \u00e0 l'heure actuelle, \u00e0 cause de son manque de profondeur au niveau du gameplay. Si vous aimez les jeux de strat\u00e9gie sans prise de t\u00eate et plut\u00f4t simples, pourquoi pas. Si vous \u00eates fan de The Behemoth, \u00e0 essayer.\n\n\nJe tiens \u00e9galement \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que cet avis tient compte du jeu lorsque celui ci est devenu disponible, quand aucune m\u00e0j n'\u00e9tait dispo. Donc peut-\u00eatre que certains points sont \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent corrig\u00e9s.", "timestamp_created": 1484597184, "timestamp_updated": 1488577255, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 4,

Honestly I'm going to rack up my Characters to level 99 and completely MELT the Pit! Oh you're thinking of the 1000 Degree knife?\nThe story adds on to the \"Behemoth\" Timeline. If you're wondering what game this is going off of, it's going off of Battleblock Theater. If you don't believe me, buy the game and beat it.\nMechanics in the game are well-executed (personally, in my opinion). It introduces a Hexagonal Turn-base mechanic where you have to use Geometry to make any sense out of this.. (Note, you don't have to have that much knowledge).\nWill Stamper, there's Will Stamper. They got the legendary comedian Will Stamper.

The game is set in a colorful, cartoonish fantasy world that has some elements of the modern world (and also takes place after the apocalypse). The main character is just a normal guy who suddenly becomes a hero and meets all kinds of crazy characters, fights monsters and hangs out with 3 friends: a princess, a sexy Spanish lady and his cyclops bro. The game also mixes random humor and serious moments like the show.\n\nXCOM: Eeeeeeh. Apparently every turn based RPG game is going to be compared to XCOM 2012 these days. I'm just going to say that this is bullshit. There's no permadeath or saving the world from the alien invasion (not yet at least) but you can create your 6 member team from randomly generated characters, but honestly I would rather compare this game to Final Fantasy Tactics series and other games from the Turn Based Strategy RPG gentre.\n\nPokemon: now that may sound weird, but let me explain. You can recruit all sorts of characters and creatures with different abilities to your team, but it works in a different way than you would expect. When you're fighting someone and see a character you want in your team, you need to leave that unit alone and kill everyone else, then you can make someone drop a cage on this unit and BAM: now it's yours. There's a ton of different units you can find, and also all of them have strenghts and weaknesses against others.\n\nOther Behemoth games: IMO it might be the best game they ever made. The gameplay is super cool, the humor is fantastic and the artstyle is really good as well.\n\n\n\nNow you might think two different things depending of what kind of person you are.\n\n\n1. \"Ham Man, I don't play turn based RPG's that much/I never played a turn based RPG in my life, will I enjoy this?\"\n\nIt's not as complicated as for example Final Fantasy Tactics on PS1, the rules are pretty simple and you should learn how to play quickly.\n\n2.\"Ham Man, I played turn based RPG's all my life, will this game challenge my genius mind and allow me to destroy powerful enemies with flawless tactics?\"\n\nI know that I said that the game is simple literally 30 seconds ago, but don't be alarmed. The game can offer a fair amount of challenge as well. There's Insane Mode that greatly increases the difficulty, Unfair Challenge that makes you fight 3 battles in one go (yes, there is Insane Unfair Challenge), you can also fight other players. There's a ton of different ways you can build your team and some characters have good synergy with others. Tactical planning and using the abilities of your heroes well is important in PVP and harder challenges.\n\n\n\n\nWell, I think that's it.\n\n\nThe game is cool, buy it.\n\n\n\nBye.", "timestamp_created": 1484559807, "timestamp_updated": 1484559807, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495345", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29292487": {"recommendationid": "29292487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207136009", "num_games_owned": 930, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484884523}, "language": "schinese", "review": "BGM\u6709\u6bd2", "timestamp_created": 1484558887, "timestamp_updated": 1484558887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29292264": {"recommendationid": "29292264", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994572486", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 399, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484767572}, "language": "english", "review": "Like all Behemoth's games, Pit People is very polished and it brings something interesting (and funny) to the table. If you have played Castle Crashers or BattleBlock Theater, there are a lot of familiar things you will encounter - art style, humor and the narrator to mention a few.\n\nPit People does not necessarily innovate something new. Rather, it combines mechanics from many popular games and ends up creating quite an interesting result. You will feel the presence of XCOM, Fire Emblem, Skulls of the Shogun or damn, even Pokemon. Most of the time games mixing that many ideas would end up being bad. This is not the case with Pit People - it feels truly original.\n\nThe combat is plain simple but vast collection of different unit types and items make this game quite strategical. There are endless amount of combos to test and new interesting characters to find.\n\nLastly, I wouldn't be too worried about the Early Access tag on this game. Sure, most of the main story is missing (you can only complete about 5% of it) but there is still a lot to do in this version. There are multiple plot driven side quests to do, units to catch and other players to crush (in online mode). \n\nHighly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1484557724, "timestamp_updated": 1484557724,

I'm going to highlight what I feel is wrong/needs to be improved, in hopes the devs see it and consider it. For a review, I'll keep  it short. A very interesting world, full of LOTS of stuff, like LOTS, complete with music, great sound, and mostly good controls The music is amazing, I'll have it stuck in my head for days. Behemoth has yet another wonderful game out on the market. On to some gripes about the game.\n\nThe PC controls are mostly good, but could use some fine tuning to make them not so wonky when selecting loadouts, the default controls are questionable, but rebindable so that's not that big of a deal. Also, in the intro, the load out screen and differences between \"tiers\" of items (i.e. cosmetics, light helmets, heavy helmets) isn't at all explained. It was super super confusing because I had no clue what I was doing. So the tutorial could use some more fine tuning as well. \n\nThere are other things not very well explained, like what's on the HUD, I didn't know what I was looking at, or what it meant for a while. The items, such as campfires, and how to buy them isn't at all explained. I think my #1 glaring problem was the lack of explanation, so if you're reading this, Behemoth, it would be good to look into that.\n\nThese are the most notable issues I saw, but damn this game is freaking fun. Doing Coop is sooooo much fun, but online is a mess. The biggest thing this game could benefit from is more flushed out tutorials, really explaining what everythng is. Keep it up Behemoth, it's a damn good game. Also, put people queued together on the same team.

As of early access, they still deliever with their signature style. \nThe art of Dan Paladin is ever present. Simple, humorous, delightful. There were a few times the art was pixelated but I'm sure that'll be fixed. Some of it (art, map, UI) feels a bit overly busy. \nAs far as content, UI, and fighting system, alot needs to be worked on. The fighting system is simple but shallow and there's two story missions along with a few side quests. I imagine over the next year (in which Behemoth works towards release) mechanics and story will be built upon. \nSo if you're buying it now, know you're only going to get a few hours of enjoyment at first.

Unlike anything the Behemoth has done yet, the gameplay is layered, but easy to pick up, about as time consuming as you'd like it to be. The trailers speak for themselves, but the voicework from Stamper, the animation from Dan, the coding of a team that wrangles the madness together know what they are doing-if the early access tag has you 2spook'd. Cmon. It's the Behemoth, so for what I was anticipating, I was not at all let down. I say fifteen is a steal, and with all the art and animation and style and humor in here, you're not likely to find a game that has the kind of charm and wit with gameplay to match.

But, as this is in Early Access, I can excuse it. 9.75/10", "timestamp_created": 1484531965, "timestamp_updated": 1484531965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29287455": {"recommendationid": "29287455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170689503", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 339, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488052390}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty good.", "timestamp_created": 1484531627, "timestamp_updated": 1497934579, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29287194": {"recommendationid": "29287194", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044965045", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485641698}, "language": "english", "review": "Early Access done Just Right...\n\n++Online matchmaking 2v2 arena pvp(hats off for pulling this off)\n\n+Crisp menu navigation(EXCEPT: the character armory is still buggy)\n\n+A nice taste of the main story mode.\n\n+Pokemon-ish recruiting (feelsgoodman)\n\n+The Behemoth humour.\n\n-Character armory navigation\n\n- no way to sell items not that i found at least in the little time i had on the game.\n\n-Feels like everyone's tanking way too much.\n(+++altho on the other had this makes pvp much less random, and strategy/position based which is very good +++)\n\nThis early access is the money worth for any Behemoth fan!", "timestamp_created": 1484530330, "timestamp_updated": 1484530455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29287159": {"recommendationid": "29287159", "author": {"steamid": "76561198327584610", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486838518}, "language": "english", "review": "So, this is one of the first reviews I've written, so if you disagree with what I say that's fine!\n\nTo start off with I will just list some of the basic pros and cons\n\n-Pros\nBy The Behemoth\nNo microtransactions\nf2p, f2w.\nA vast variety of customizations, from characters to weapons to... to... HATS!!!\nEasy to learn, easy to master (but hard to battle other people who have mastered the game 20/10)\nVery addictive and fun.\n\n~Cons\nPaid (although this isn't very much an issue, most games are paid and it is quite cheap compared to other games which are lesser of Pit People... im talking to you, Overwatch)\nThere is a bit of grinding (not too much though)\nIt is in early access still, so there will be some unwelcome glitches and, unfortunately, exploits (although i have not heard of any exploits)\nIt is addictive (yes this can be a bad thing)\n\nNow to describe what the game is like!\n\nThe game itself is very simple, a team crafting, (slightly) strategized turn-based 2d game. The graphics are top-notch (3D isn't necessary for every game that exists). You can have at maximum 6 fighters in your team, although you may find that you have to have less, as some characters take up more than 1 slot due to sheer awesomeness. There is a wide variety of different species that you can collect, and lots of items to customize them with. If there is something you dont want, ring up a friend in the oversized phonebox to the far left of the city, and you can easily swap items instantly. You can hold up to 500 recruits in this game. Also, some of the species would be the demi-clops, rainbow unicorn and pixie.\n\nNow to the actual game mechanics!\n\nAs you are in a battle, you take it in turns to move your team to your desired positons. But, beware, all species have weaknesses. While crafting your team, you can see their health, move points, defense, dodge chance, heal, special abilities and defenses (like freeze resistance). All characters have up to 5 move points. Characters can become the hero to have stat boosts, like health, damage, and usually move points. Now, back to fighting itself! In a battle, each tile is a hexagon. Each hexagon you move costs 1 move point. Some hexagons are different, and damage your team or cost 2 move points, or just can't be moved onto. Some flying creatures, like the pixie, can fly over gaps and water no problem (water is what costs 2 move points). You can have 2 main types of attackers - melee and ranged. But, if you choose so, you can have a troop with melee and range! But the range will not be very powerful, or, if you are a mortar or ranger, the melee will not be very powerful. If your troops can target multiple enemies, they decide which they will attack. This means you really need to make sure you move your character to the exact spot you want them to be, so that you attack the enemy you need to be dead.\n\nIf you are lazy, or not exactly the best at the game, or have a team that is too big to control (some characters come with 2 people in only 1 space, so the max amount of characters you can have is 12) you can turn on the Auto Battler! This will move your characters instantly, although it may not always be very reliable. Only use it if you know that it will work well with your team.\n\nThat's all for now...\n\n     -ProNub", "timestamp_created": 1484530152, "timestamp_updated": 1484530152, "voted_up": true,

Behemoth the developer does amazing work and their games are some of my favorites of all time. Customization is endless with over 1000 different items to collect to pimp out your team. Lots of different classes and diversity. Difficulty is meh, it seems to not be very hard so i reccomend actually going into insane mode ASAP. CO-OP is awesome so if you have friends GET THIS. The humor in this game is like all their other games, immature and hilarious. Anything from poop jokes to funny fraises this game is definitatly a great choice for younger and older audiances who love that kind of stuff. Voice acting is probably at its best in this game above all of their previous games, the narrator is just amazing. Campaign is pretty short for an early access game but it has plenty of incredibly fun and unique side-quests that all feel different. I've got about 10 hours on XB1 and 3 hours on PC. If you have a console i reccomend getting it on that, it's just simply better in my opinion. The PvP is good but can be annoying to find a game, that also is valid with CO-OP. I wish there was a gamechat so you could maybe talk to the person you're fighting with or against. With 15$ you'll get on average 15 hours-20 hours before it becomes kind of a numb loot grind if you're trying to get all the customizables. There is one aspect I have not treaded and that is the 3v1 unfair mode which seems fun. I tried it in the beta and boy did it kick my pooper until it was bruised and bloody, not much has changed since the beta besides more side-quests and better connection. For early access I would give it a solid 9/10 because the campaign's length, low difficulty setting, and lack of gamechat.\n\nI tried to be un-biased as possible in this review, so don't take anything with a grain of salt!", "timestamp_created": 1484516897, "timestamp_updated": 1484517183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29283746": {"recommendationid": "29283746", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249189190", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513543453}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic, recruit the same enemys you face to added to your army. the game is awesome", "timestamp_created": 1484515831, "timestamp_updated": 1484515831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29283461": {"recommendationid": "29283461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198203064985", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491625155}, "language": "english", "review": "Waited for a while, started internally screaming the moment I saw this was out. \n10/10 behemoth.

But it also ensures that this game, even in Early Access, has some bars to reach, or at least start showing the work it's wanting to make to get there. It's an interesting situation, with high potential, but high needs and desires.\n\nWhich is why, after the first hour of the game, I can honestly tell you that the promise it shows is magnificent, and the game itself so far is quite enjoyable. Between the artstyle coming together quite well with this sort of genre and gameplay, giving the game a life and enjoyability that's present even when wandering the plains of the game, to the gameplay being simple enough to pick up after the initial tutorial, yet intricate enough to ensure it isn't a \"Click to win\" situation.\n\nOf course, it does have a few issues. In the beginning, there wasn't a large amount of explanation as to how certain gear works and what some of those stats change, or increase or decrease the chance thereof, and will little explanation as to the nature of whether or not weapons were simply reskins, or have their own stats. I found myself struggling through this sort of issue in the beginning, but had it settle out quite well when you find drops that do infact have stats of their own, albeit rather small and specific, but nonetheless. So while it DOES try to enlighten the player through the tips given while traversing, I found the character loadout designing to be a bit of a beast to understand at first, but as above stated, this is easily remedied with a bit of time in the game. Just a slight warning for anyone who may be turned off because of such.\n\nUltimately, I'd recommend the game. While it is a bit lacking in content outside of the story (this being in Early Access, that should be obvious), I do feel that it brings enough entertainment and interest in it's state right now, even if you don't find an interest in the online/offline multiplayer.

So far in my playthrough, the game itself is bug-free and performs without any hitches, much to Behemoth's credit as a respectable developer. However, the controls in menus are just a step above abysmal, clearly being designed to be navigated with a controller. Selections stick and feel imprecise, and at times I feel a need to be extra cautious should I accidentally sell or buy something I don't intend to. The gameplay handles well enough, but when panning the camera via WASD or arrow key the scroll speed is sluggish, and input icons switch to Xbox inputs for whatever reason.\n\nGameplay itself is deceptively deep, with an easy learning curve and intuitive mechanics leading into a variety of new weapon variants, effects and troop selections once you get a handle on the basics. However, issues again arise in the menus, with visual cues for stats and weapon status effect icons being at best a vague suggestion on how they work. I shouldn't have to play 20 questions worth of guesswork to figure out what exactly something does or how it's implemented, and a lack of a clear-cut glossary or tooltips only serve to frustrate when introduced to what up to that point was a very intuitive and enjoyable experience. Experimenting with different combinations is fun, but not as fun as it could be when I'm left wondering things such as \"can I do anything to unfreeze friendly units, or do I have to wait out the effect?\"\n\nThe story and atmosphere is enjoyable, with the antagonistic narrator that I personally find much more entertaining than Battleblock Theatre, and an experience more in line with what we've seen in the past with Castle Crashers and Alien Hominid. Behemoth's simple, charming signature style works to the game's benefit, with the game boasting a variety of weapons, enemies and recruitable troops that I've only begun to scratch the surface of.\n\nI have yet to touch the MP, but I'll probably write about it later on. Who knows.\n\nOverall a very solid early access title, but not without some glaring issues that I hope to see resolved in the future.\n\nspacebear blood got in my eye christ help me / 10", "timestamp_created": 1484501467, "timestamp_updated": 1484501467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29278827": {"recommendationid": "29278827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198159406015", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509295785}, "language": "english", "review": "Goes into pit on the 2nd day, gets 3rd place in the world.", "timestamp_created": 1484501325, "timestamp_updated": 1484501325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490136", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29278562": {"recommendationid": "29278562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094426470", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509744657}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a really good game!

I mean, really, so far the combat is fun. \n\nHowever...\n\n- This game's controls are fucking infuriating.  It was clearly made for consoles.  The responsiveness and way the mouse works in this game is just bonkers.\n\n- Related to controls: specifically, navigating the fighter inventory area is clumsy and cumbersome.\n\n- Related to controls: the whole game is built upon \"Left Mouse Button selects,  RMB cancels\".  It's just not user-friendly for PC.\n\n- The amount of feedback/information about stats, items, etc. is killing me.  The number of times I stared at the screen asking myself \"what does this mean?\" tells me that they did not get enough feedback on the useability/UX side. \n\n- During combat: the art style, colors, animations during the planning phase makes it really hard to see what you're doing.  I've made a number of mistakes moving my players around and stuff because the way they display the planning phase is confusing.  There needs to be more of a clear delineation between characters, and a better way to give you a \"high-level\" overview of the battle during this phase.\n\n- The size of everything is like 300% too big.  It was clearly made for a TV sitting 8 feet away from you rather than a monitor 2 feet away.\n\nTL;DR it feels like a bad port.

Gameplay is finished, and there's a lot a of quests (which vary a lot) and stuff to do, including PvP mode, and extra difficulty. However, expect that after 2 hours, you'll have finished the story in it, which doesn't mean the game ends.\n\nI loved the presentation of the game. classic Behemoth style, with a lot of humor, the same hilarious narrator from Battleblock Theater, and a lot personality behind it. Great music, with a lot of variety. For me, one of the selling points.\n\nThe gameplay is also great, however, is much simpler than your average turn based grid strategy game. Your characters attack on their own if they are on range of an enemy, for example. If you're looking for \"hardcore gameplay\", you might be disappointed with it. But I think that it goes in the right direction and if fits the game, while being very accesible for people not so into the genre. This is neat because the game has local and online co-op, so you can play this with a lot of people, not just hardcore turn based gamers.\n\nOverall, i really liked the game. I would recommend it if you like the presentation, and you want to be playing it just to explore the world that the Behemoth people hace created.

I don't think this game is good. I think this game is OK and got too many positive reviews, which try to push nonsence that if devs made 2 good games all their games will be good. Also I felt like those reviews aren't helpful, so this is my attempt to write helpful review. Next, this is early access, and I think criticism will help devs to create better game. And finally dev said that he not promises to add new units. So here what I think:[/i]\n\nGood:\n+A lot of customization options\n+Music\n+Artstyle could be better, but I like it\n+Interesting recruiting mechanic, where you should kill everyone except your target and put him in cage.\n\nBad:\n-You can't choose target for attacking. You just come in attack range and when turn ends your troops choose targets from those that they have in attack reach. In theory this is interesting, but in some places it just becomes annoying. For example on quest to kill Necroduke your troops will attack anyone except of Necroduke itself.\n-Next, it lacks tactic. Your troops can: attack, heal, summon allies and throw nets. I believe that's all. And you can't even chose target, you just move them and they act by themselves. \n-And to previous point, it lacks variety as whole. You can see all units in first 1-2 hours. It could be interesting pokemon-like game if it had more variety and dangerous monsters, but there like 18 monsters. And developer said that they won't promise to add new monsters.\n-And so it quickly becomes boring. Battles are mostly the same where you dance around trying to cover ranged units and healers.\n-I felt like battle result depends from party composition too much. And you can't see enemy party composition before actual battle.\n-It has difficulty settings, but no actual reward for playing on insane difficulty. I expected special hats, monsters or at least achievements. I get it, older games had no rewards for hard difficulty, but now I'm so spoiled that want rewards for playing harder difficulty than everyone.\n-No actual explanation what soldier stats mean, just some confusing graphs. Same for attack types and moves.\n-Level up just refills your HP. I haven't noticed anything else. So low level troops with fast levelling much better than useless veterans with long levelling.\n-Sometimes scenery blocks view, for example, again, castle of Necroduke has walls that won't let you see what happens in hexes behind them.\n\nUgly:\n*Humour is not for everyone. I had a giggle in the beginning, but that's all. That's fine I guess, not everyone has same sence of humour.\n*Narrator is not that good. I found him not funny, just plain annoying. But again, this is subjective.\n\n\n\nFeel free to add your points in comments, but be constructive.", "timestamp_created": 1484481631, "timestamp_updated": 1484489345, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519469", "comment_count": "33", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29270970": {"recommendationid": "29270970", "author": {"steamid": "76561198000226640", "num_games_owned": 288, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484423056}, "language": "english", "review": "The Behemoth.", "timestamp_created": 1484481475, "timestamp_updated": 1484481475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496040", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29270862": {"recommendationid": "29270862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029090216", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4092, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7, "last_played": 1515981785}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b9e\u81f3\u540d\u5f52", "timestamp_created": 1484481152, "timestamp_updated": 1484481152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29270771": {"recommendationid": "29270771", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022472217", "num_games_owned": 1247, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491148374}, "language": "schinese", "review": "We make games .\n\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u4e0d\u8bf7\u7f8e\u5de5\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff1f\n\u62db\u52df\u597d\u8bc4\uff1b\n\u5267\u60c5\u597d\u8bc4\uff1b\nBGM\u597d\u8bc4\uff1b\n\u592a\u7a7a\u718a\u597d\u8bc4\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1484480855, "timestamp_updated": 1484542748, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580580", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29270698": {"recommendationid": "29270698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036515969", "num_games_owned": 1747, "num_reviews": 62, "playtime_forever": 801, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499537296}, "language": "english", "review": "WARNING - If you player during the beta, there isn't more to the story yet.

The art is great, the soundtrack is fucking magnificent (!!), the writing is just as quirky, irreverent, and genuinely funny as one would come to expect from Behemoth. The actual gameplay is where a few niggles come in. The combat system is simplified in a fairly clever manner, and the way the game is able to make absurd, impossible units manageable is commendable, but the UI isn't the best. The controls were clearly designed with controllers in mind, producing some occasional jankiness when it comes to movement and onscreen prompts. The equipment screen in particular is VERY cumbersome (so I left click the character I want to select, left click the space I want them to occupy, then I have to left click again to confirm, despite the lack of any dialogue box... for some reason?).\nApparently the story isn't complete as of writing, but I haven't gone nearly far enough to have anything to say about that, besides the observation that there is a ton of non story content here.

But once you settle into it becomes really fun. The combat becomes strategic (especially if you play on insane mode), its not that strategic that you need to take ages to cotemplate strategies each turn, it just forces you to be smart with every move (perfect for PvP). The world expands into a difficult and large open world, jam packed with content (very strange content). After getting through a weak start the game becomes amazing.\n\nMy only dissapointment are the choices of weapons and armour, I was expecting a more RPG type weapon system how every individual item has their own stats, but the game only has set 5 weapons with different stats for each type of weapon (e.g. sheild, sword, ranged). However, this is redeemed by the wide array of characters that you can have in your party. This can vary your strategies depending on the set of character you captured. \n\nI'm honetly suprised how this game isn't on the \"top seller\" or \"popular new releases\" section on steam. It might be early access but I havent come across any bugs.\n\nI think this game is a 9/10, would be 10/10 if the beggining was more engaging.", "timestamp_created": 1484451029, "timestamp_updated": 1484451367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29263345": {"recommendationid": "29263345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198254664063", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484716184}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u901a\u5e38\u96e3\u6613\u5ea6\u3067\u306f\u6226\u3044\u3067\u82e6\u6226\u3059\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3082\u3042\u307e\u308a\u306a\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059\n\u79c1\u306f\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u3068\u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3057\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u554f\u984c\u306a\u304f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3001\u30de\u30a6\u30b9\u306e\u307f\u3067\u64cd\u4f5c\u3067\u304d\u308bUI\u306a\u3089\u306a\u304a\u826f\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3059\u304c\n\n\u591a\u304f\u306e\u7a2e\u65cf\u3068\u88c5\u5099\u3067\u4eba\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u3055\u307e\u3056\u307e\u306a\u6226\u3044\u65b9\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u304c\u826f\u3044\u3068\u3053\u308d\n\u305f\u3060\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u7279\u6027\u304c\u3069\u3093\u306a\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3042\u308b\u304b\u306e\u78ba\u8a8d\u306e\u4ed5\u65b9\u304c\u308f\u304b\u3089\u305a\u4eca\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306a\u3093\u3068\u306a\u304f\u3067\u3057\u304b\u4f7f\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3001\u904a\u3073\u65b9\u306e\u8aac\u660e\u306e\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3067\u3042\u308b\u7a0b\u5ea6\u306f\u78ba\u8a8d\u3067\u304d\u307e\u3059\n\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3059\u308b\u3068\u30c0\u30e1\u30fc\u30b8\u3001\uff28\uff30\u3001\u9632\u5fa1\u304c\u3042\u304c\u3088\u3046\u3067\u3059\u304c\u5fae\u3005\u305f\u308b\u3082\u306e\u306b\u611f\u3058\u307e\u3059\n\n\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u3076\u3093\u306b\u306f\u3068\u304f\u306b\u56f0\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u304c\u8aac\u660e\u3092\u3082\u3063\u3068\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3046\u3068\u3053\u308d\u304c\u591a\u304f\n\u307b\u304b\u306e\u65b9\u306e\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\u306b\u3082\u3042\u308b\u3088\u3046\u306b\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u306f\u307b\u3093\u306e\u5c11\u3057\u3057\u304b\u5b9f\u88c5\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3057\u30a2\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u3092\u8a31\u5bb9\u3067\u304d\u308b\u4eba\u306a\u3089\u8cfc\u5165\u3057\u3066\u3088\u3044\u304b\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1484449921, "timestamp_updated": 1484611302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592011", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29263304": {"recommendationid": "29263304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116127572", "num_games_owned": 469, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484449589}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53bb\u6210\u4e3a\u795e\u5947\u5b9d\u8d1d\u5927\u5e08\uff0c\u6536\u670d\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5c0f\u7cbe\u7075\u5427\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1484449752, "timestamp_updated": 1484449752, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29263133": {"recommendationid": "29263133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007884644", "num_games_owned": 919, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1086, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1515875812}, "language": "english", "review": "Castle Crashers meets XCOM, this game is brilliant.

I highlight that, because the game is considerably deep when it comes to the mechanics, and I believe it is streamlined, but a moderate extent. The items and features are many, and that allows you to deploy a wide array of tactics, depending on your taste and personal strategy. \n\nFor instance, there are not just shields, swords, maces or raw damage: There are currently 3 types of shields which work differently from each other. The way items work is somewhat based on real life combat (i.e. The massive pavise-like ones provide no protection in melee but great coverage from ranged damage), but there are also illogical details added for the sake of balance: small and medium shields offer no melee protection, bucklers especially were actually good for melee defence and not for small protection from projectiles.\nHowever, overall the positive connotations largely outweigh the negative or unpleasant ones: There is also the concept of pierce and blunt damage, accuracy, and light and heavy armour with their related bonuses and maluses. About that, I don't appreciate that heavy armour decreases so much the attack of a fighter, but that is another story.\n\nApart from unit customisation, there are also different races you can pick from. Aside from humans you get: arachno-humanoids called spidaurs which are tanky and can be mounted by some fighter types, robots, vampires, trolls, cyclops, mushrooms (yes lol), small jawa like lads that come in 2 for each slot*, fire-shooting fairies called pixies, cupcakes (yeah), wraiths and zombies.\n\n*Slots are what determines how many fighters you can have in your team. You start with 4 open slots and can unlock 2 more easily enough early in the game. Not all races take the same amount of slots. Cyclops and trolls take 2 slots each, the jawa-like gnomes take 1 but come in a couple. Of course, that means that the unit is as strong as the number of slots it takes. \n\nMy general interest with gaming is confined to a few genres, the same to which the following titles belong: Total War's, Heroes of Might and Magic, Age of Empires, etc... Compared to HoMM especially, I can't say there is an abyss in-between. I'm actually very satisfied of the diversity that they put into the game. \n\nThe humour is very likeable, and so is the story. I put these two last because I care much more about the playability of a title and how many hours of entertainment and variety it might offer.\n\nReview updated between 08.01 and 09.01.18, nearing the launch of the game. Little actually changed in the mechanics, so my review is still valid. If I had to say something 'bad' about the game, it would be the following:\n-I would have liked a mode to allow a larger team composition. This may allow for units which have little use in a small team to fill their niche in larger 'armies'. A 18 large squad would be very interesting to arm and deploy.\n-Some more character and weapon types would be nice for some extra variety, i.e. spears which can hit from 1 tile away. Also allowing for more customisation in non-human units, not to their same extent, but greater than now. Like I suggested during the development, a type of body armor for monsters which can't carry a shield would have been very interesting\n-Modding tools in order to allow easy modification of the game values. This would potentially interest me because it would be possible to make a \"Realism Mod\".\n\nOverall vote: 7.5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1484424420, "timestamp_updated": 1515458965, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470779", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29255768": {"recommendationid": "29255768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165733551", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484365487}, "language": "english", "review": "good.", "timestamp_created": 1484423559, "timestamp_updated": 1484423559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29255468": {"recommendationid": "29255468", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030982669", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 156, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488668544}, "language": "english", "review": "Pit People is an amazing, sarcastic turned based strategy game from the creators of Castle Crashers and Battleblock Theater.

[/h1]\n\nIch habe die Closed Beta von Pit People ca 20 Stunden gespielt und mir jetzt, kurz nach Early Access release auch das eigentliche Spiel geholt, und ich muss echt sagen: Es hat sich gelohnt!\n\nPit People ist ein Strategiespiel/RPG mit vielen Fassetten, voller krudem Humor und Anspielungen auf die Realit\u00e4t. Es kn\u00fcpft unmittelbar an die Handlung von BattleBlock Theatre an, aber es ist nicht n\u00f6tig das vorgegangene Spiel gespielt zu haben um die Handlung zu verstehen: \n\nDie Welt von Pit People befindet sich in einem komplett abgedrehten postapokalyptischen Zustand!

[/spoiler] auf die Erde st\u00fcrzte sind \u00fcberall Monster am rumlaufen und der Gro\u00dfteil der Zivilisation ist zerfallen... Du schl\u00fcpfst in die Rolle von Horatio, dem bescheidenen Blaubeerfarmer - und verstrickst dich Hals \u00fcber Kopf in eine extrem lustige Hauptquest, die ich nicht weiter spoilern will.\n\nIch finde das der Comiclook gut zum Spiel passt, Cutszenes sind fl\u00fcssig gezeichnet, und die Dialogbilder k\u00f6nnen einen auch \u00f6fter mal zum lachen bringen weil sie einfach so stimmig gezeichnet sind! Die Musik ist wie in den anderen Behemoth-Games auch sehr greifend und passend!\n\nZum Gameplay gibt es noch zu sagen, dass sich das Spiel ein bisschen wie Pokemon mit \"Dress Up- Funktion\" spielt - Man f\u00e4ngt Monster die \u00fcber die Map laufen ein und kann ihnen dann gefundene Ausr\u00fcstung anziehen um St\u00e4rken und schw\u00e4chen zu beeinflussen. Im aktuellen Stand des Spiels gibt es bereits eine ansehnliche Anzahl Monster (zB Zyklopen, Einh\u00f6rner oder Vampire, nur alle in nem eigenen Stil und etwas \"trippy\"), aus denen man sich sehr coole taktische Teams kombinieren kann - Ich hoffe jedoch, dass die Menge der Monstersorten noch weiter wachsen wird!\nDie K\u00e4mpfe f\u00fchlen sich f\u00fcr mich immer sehr fair und ausgewogen an, gerade bei sp\u00e4teren und h\u00e4rteren Quests, und das taktische Element greift wirklich tief! - Und f\u00fcr Leute dies \u00fcbel m\u00f6gen gibt es den knallharten \"Insane-Mode\", der die Gegner nochmals um einiges bufft!)\n\nCo-optechnisch gl\u00e4nzt das Spiel auch durch einen reibungslos funktionierenden local- sowie Online-Partnermodus, es ist bisher alles gut ausgewogen und spa\u00dfig - und in Onlineduellen kann man sein taktisches K\u00f6nnen gegen Freunde oder Fremde pr\u00fcfen und coole Belohnugen sammeln!\n\nAlles in allem kann ich Pit People also ohne schlechtes Gewissen Liebhabern von Taktik, Co-Op und abgedrehtem Humor/Stories die sich selbst nicht so 100%ig ernst nehmen vollstens ans Herz legen - 15\u20ac ist wie ich finde ein wirklich guter Preis f\u00fcr ein so gutes, noch wachsendes Spiel!\n\nWenn euch das Gelesene gefallen hat, dann h\u00f6rt doch mal bei unserem Podcast-Channel rein!

Pit People is a hilarious game with great artwork, which is fun to play and does not take itself very seriously. It is very self aware while still delivering an, this far interesting story (I say this far since the Early Access does not contain much of the story, but the little it contains is great).\n\nThe gameplay itself is great. It is a fun, casual strategy game. You do not have to be particularly skilled to enjoy it and play it, but you can still apply quite a bit of strategy into it if you are more competetive.\n\nThe world map is fun and interesting, and it is great to see all the creative places that the developers have made on said map.\n\nYou have loads of customisation for your characters which is also great. It is also worth to note that this is probably the first Behemoth game where playing with controller is not better than playing with mouse and keyboard. You can still play with controller if you prefer that, which is fantastic. It just means more options for the player.\n\nI am looking forward to see the finished product.

Everything works, yes, but it's just the bones with basic strats and counters. There's nothing really special put in yet. You can feel the artwork's funk, that Behemoth style of doing things. Whoever's been working with this has put heart into it.\n\n\nThe world is appealing, it calls for adventure. I could vision theories of what I'm about to face in this game. will there be random or conditionally spawning legendary/unique monsters, can I recruit them as well, will there be hunt quests for them, can I get fat loot out of some rare or secret quests, what will happen in the main storyline as it gets done and so forth. It's a vast land in there and I want to search it's nooks 'n crannies for every conceivable piece of equipment and lore I can find. Or, you know... that's just how it feels in the game's open world.\n\nAh, the story... the story is left undone. There's literally one main story quest after you get to free exploring. Not only that, so far it took some odd turns before it's unprecedented end. It was a disappointment, to say the least. \"Hey the main story ends here but you can still grind for exp... right?\" There WERE big warning signs about it though, so it's not like it came as a surprise. It just surprised how little there was.\n\nI get the feel there was multiple ways to do this and none was clearly chosen, every road that could've been taken was as much fun and rewarding for the producer and the consumer so almost none was scrapped. It's still too open to say anything else. I can imagine though. I would very much like an endgame battle where I could slap the antagonist's space nipples with swords and maces. I would like to see the characters grow a bit, y'know a little backstory for them so they won't feel like they're just slapped in. I'd love to see some stuff even after the main story is finished, that's like giving diamonds to me. (or you can just give the 'mondz, man. Give 'em. Come on, gib. Gib!)\n\nYes, much is to be done. I'm still recommending it, but don't get your hopes up. Buy it now if you feel like supporting Behemoth, but for those who don't care about that: it's not worth yet.

Granted they've only had 4 games, Alien Hominid, Castle Crashers, Battleblock Theater, and now Pit People. The humor is like those games but at its best. The narrator brings so much to the game surprisingly. The art style is the typical Behemoth artstyle and looks great as usual. Now, this is Early Access as of this review and the main story is not complete. It'll take you only about an hour an a half, maybe 2, to complete. However it takes a lot of different gameplay mechanics from other games that greatly increase the game's life outside of the story. The combat is like Fire Emblem or Xcom (more like Fire Emblem) where it's turnbased strategy, a sort of rock-paper-scissors mechanic of maces good against helmets, etc. Similar to many classic JRPG's there is a world map to roam and explore, where you can encounter many different types of enemy parties. Like Darkest Dungeon and Xcom, there is a base and like Darkest Dungeon, you have a choice of different, random missions that you can buy provisions for before setting out on the mission. And lastly, like Pokemon, you can capture and collect enemies and use them in your party. Now, many of these mechanics are like those of some Rogue-likes however this is not a rogue-like. If a character dies, they go back to town instead of perma-death. Along the early access path it would be nice to see a hardcore mode with permadeath in it.

Sure, the story is far from complete, but the side-quest lines take a while and are balanced to your level (at least from my personal experience). Essentially, the game is Fire Emblem meets Pokemon meets The Behemoth. As prior stated, moving units is the extent of your turn, which makes strategizing both a breeze and maddening at once. Because the battles take place on hexes, if a single enemy unit has enemies on two opposite sides, you only have about a 33% chance of hitting them, as the other two enemies to either side will also be in range. This is both good and bad, as you can also exploit this strategy. The Pit is a gladiatorial arena, which has an \"Unfair\" game mode. It's three back to back fights with unit death carrying over between rounds. This at first seems like a fun challenge for late game, but as it turns out, it's a totally exploitable experience farm. The day the early access started, I was at the top of the leaderboard, not because I deserved it, but because I was grinding experience and in the process got unique loot that can only be acquired by placing well in The Pit. The game needs some polishing in some areas, but I was happy to take the dive, and The Behemoth delivers once again. \n\nOn the funny scale:\nBattleblock Theatre > Pit People > Castle Crashers", "timestamp_created": 1484388277, "timestamp_updated": 1484388277, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29243606": {"recommendationid": "29243606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135463183", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4795, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498211432}, "language": "english", "review": "I can make a team out of memes. 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1484387889, "timestamp_updated": 1484387889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29243494": {"recommendationid": "29243494", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047059860", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 1833, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506968817}, "language": "schinese", "review": "bgm\u597d\u8d5e", "timestamp_created": 1484387540, "timestamp_updated": 1484387540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501247", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29243480": {"recommendationid": "29243480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062346831", "num_games_owned": 168, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 151, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484432343}, "language": "english", "review": "Good game, but the driving element is pure garbage", "timestamp_created": 1484387475, "timestamp_updated": 1484387475, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29243370": {"recommendationid": "29243370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109302356", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1295, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491591520}, "language": "english", "review": "I've played for roughly 2 hours and so far it's extordinary.

It's a Behemoth game, after all. The humor is on point, the artstyle is extremely pleasing, the pure amount of character and party customization is almost overwhelming, and the combat system (which I at first thought was as convoluted as the Undertale path minigame) turned out to be pretty well understood.\n\nSadly, this is also an Early Access game. And while I should not be expecting THAT much from an Early Access game directly on release, I find myself doing so anyways.\n\nYou will almost always be outnumbered, outdamaged, and outplayed in every scenario \"3 skulls and above\". Now in another RPG this would be fine. But due to just how much damage and random chance (not just crits but location of hits, location of AoEs, who gets healed, etc.) there is, it can be extraordinarily frustrating to set up a team around a point. As there is no permadeath in the game, this is simply a setback and puts you back at the city to do it again. But the fact that most encounters are very focused on luck can be frustrating when you start taking longer routes.\n\nThe game is also extremely lacking right now in main content if you don't want to either A. Explore and complete all the mini-quests, B. Complete your customization collection, or C. Fight your friends in the PvP arena. Now I know that the non-story portion is almost the complete focus of the game, but the thing I like most about Behemoth games is that I can run through the story (acquiring collectibles along the way) and basically play through everything. I don't have any incentive to go out and collect customizations (because most customizations are exactly the same stat-wise, with a select few being either elemental or slightly more powerful). I don't have any incentive to go out and capture more recruits (because this is just used to get more customizations and all characters of a class have the same stats). And while I played the single story mission (which you can clear in about 10 minutes) and enjoyed it, I do wish the focus of the game was a bit more linear as the open-world nature of the game let the monotony set in once I realized the above.\n\nThis should be a game I enjoy, as \"turn-based hex-RPGs\" are a favorite of mine (Civ, Fire Emblem, etc.). But the freeform nature of it makes it it hard to recommend right now as anything more than a collectathon. If a friend has is, by all means take a swing. It doesn't take long to get caught up to another person gear-wise, and it's enjoyable for the time I spent on it. But if you're looking for an extreme amount of substance ala Battleblock or Castle Crashers, you won't find that here (yet).", "timestamp_created": 1484368265, "timestamp_updated": 1484368411, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.350239", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29239304": {"recommendationid": "29239304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114451328", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486495809}, "language": "english", "review": "Dedicated poop button, 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1484368183, "timestamp_updated": 1484368183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29239293": {"recommendationid": "29239293", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175009510", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486238887}, "language": "english", "review": "Great emmersive gameplay, not much content atm but is somthing you can come back to even after completeing the main story, overall it wasnt too challenging but challenging enough to keep you entertained.", "timestamp_created": 1484368132, "timestamp_updated": 1484368132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29239259": {"recommendationid": "29239259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076372360", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484399389}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7ec8\u4e8e\u7b49\u5230beta\u4e86\uff0cgameplay\u662f\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u7684\u6218\u65d7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u723d\u70b9\u5c31\u662f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u9053\u5177\u4e0e\u4eba\u7269\u517b\u6210\u4e86\uff0c\u5b98\u65b9\u8bf4\u67091300\u591a\u79cd\u9053\u5177\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4e5f\u6709\u6d77\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u6355\u6349\u602a\u7269\u3002\n\n\u5f53\u7136\uff0cThe Behemoth\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6211\u53ea\u60f3\u8bf4\uff1a\u6765\u5440\uff0c\u5e26\u7740\u4f60\u7684\u597d\u53cb\uff0c\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u5feb\u6d3b\u5440\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1484367955, "timestamp_updated": 1484367955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29239011": {"recommendationid": "29239011", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993514382", "num_games_owned": 675, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 150, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484616232}, "language": "english", "review": "Today is rapture!

My review is based mostly upon the mechanics and what is here, rather than a story that has yet to unfold.\n\nBehemoth once again delivers a class A experience with their one of a kind over the top humor. A robust and expansive world, a myriad of memorable characters, and enough loot to make your butt fall off.  Pit People has a diverse and simplistic combat style accessible to players new to the strategy RPG format. Yet still it goes so much deeper than that to the true strategist. Offering near limitless customization this game allows for any playstyle. From people who like to hide behind ponies, to those who crave the boom boom, to those who simply love rainbows. Whether you are a tried and true fan of Behemoth and their past works, or a newcomer to the party, I do believe this is shaping up to be one of the best games of the coming year. \n\nThat being said, if you are looking strictly to play a large story filled with conquest, glory, and pain, Pit People may not be the title you want...YET. As it sits you will not run short of things to do, amongst them being PVP, Co-Op shenanigans, loot hunting, side quests, and dying with laughter. This is not a typical gotcha early access. What you get right now, without the story, is well beyond the price value.

Your home is always visible on the world map; it's where you find the online/single-player arena, and a market to buy even more characters, and weapons.\n\n- Characters of your team are customizable: the appearance changes by equipping different items, and different items may have passive bonus (like a chance to freeze your enemy, for example); also, items are divided in something like \"light\", \"medium\", \"hard\", so if you choose an item that increase your defense, you are slower because of weight and you can't move as much as another character with a light armor. The same is for weapons.\n\n- You level up every single character, so it's already enough to play thousands of hours.\n\n- Friendly fire based on positioning or area damage.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Personally, i find that graphics is horrible, and not because it's minimal, but because i don't like the style.

This is based on what I\u2019ve experienced in the game so far playing three hours on my Xbox One and on Steam altogether.\n\nA turn-based strategy game, you can build a team of up to six characters with their own customized equipment. Everyone can have different weapons, some with effects and some that are strong against enemies wearing particular equipment. An example of this is that swords will be weak against people with helmets but maces will be strong against them. While customizing you character, you will see a bar graph which tells you their equip load, damage, range, defense, and dodge. Going above 100% equip load will reduce the character\u2019s move points by one, and staying below 50% grants an additional move point. You can designate one person on your team as the hero. Doing so gives them more health, damage, and greater equip load.\n\nThe combat is fairly simple. Move your melee team members adjacent to enemies, and they will attack them. Ranged team members supposedly need at least one empty space between the enemy and themselves. If there are multiple enemies that can be targeted within the vicinity, that unit will seemingly choose a random enemy to strike. Some of the fights can take a few minutes depending on how fast your thinking is when it comes to moving your team.\n\nEarly in the game, you will find a city where you will be buying some of your items, fighting in the pit against A.I. or other people online for gold, and customizing your characters or changing your team members as you obtain equipment and people throughout the game. Gold and items can be obtained outside of this place, but you are limited to how many items you can carry. Two important items I\u2019ve come across are campfires, which allow you to heal your team outside of combat, and recruit cages, which allows you to recruit enemies to join your team. Mind that you will need to unlock the recruit cages through meeting a certain character first. I would recommend not fighting in the pit early in the game against A.I.'s beyond story mode. Three consecutive rounds can be difficult to finish.\n\nStory mode is not finished yet, but there are many battles across the map you travel through outside of combat. Alongside the story mode quests, there are other quests you can choose from. You can also encounter optional quests while exploring the map. The game will point you to the objective once you\u2019ve accepted a quest.\n\nThe art and music are reminiscent of previous titles, but they feel updated as well. The narration is just as funny as it was in Battleblock Theater. Castle crasher players will recognize the combat style immediately. Battleblock Theater players will know how this game is loosely connected to it.\n\nI've recently tried co-op. Pretty much the second person you play with will have the same stuff as you from the very beginning. When you unlock a character, they get a variation of them as well. They will also have the main characters in character selection when they have the chance to change team members.\n\nI have not tried PvP yet, so I can\u2019t say anything about them.

Not great, but certainly not bad.  Though some of the game design choices were not my cup of tea. \n\nPros:\n- The game has a uniqe cast of characters that you will come to enjoy. Especially the bear, his commentary through the battles adds some humor that I find delightful.\n\n- I like how all of the equipment is silly and over the top. I mean, going into battle with a toilet scrubber and a bear shield is something I thought I'd never do.\n\n- The side quests give you a good reason to explore the area.  I hated the idea of going through the main quest so fast, so I was thankful to learn that there was over 100 side-quests in here, and plenty more characters to find.\n\n-  The battles are very simple and easy to understand, though there are certain issues with stats, but I'll talk about that in the CON section.\n\n- Though I'm not a fan of  multiplayer, it's nice to know that their's an options for you to fight random people online while you're in the pit. So if you wanna try some random battles between a Kobold army vs Cup cakes, then by all means, join and go crazy.\n\nCons:\n\n-  I am not a fan of games where the enemy matches you in levels.  I know this was done so that the game wouldn't be a cake walk for the average player, but for a \"filthy' casual like me, it does  grate my nerves to see minimal progress be made. Watching  my beefed up level 40  tank Horitao  be taken out by a bunch of kobolds is not amusing.  \n\n- While its fun to see multiple types of weapons and hats I can put on my character. It is annoying that  a lot of them are pretty much the same stats wise.  The only ones with any stats on them are either useless when it comes to damage  OR they make my character too heavy to be used properly, so I'm stuck with a specific set of armor/weapons until something better comes along the way. ( Though I do love my shiney new swordfish.)\n\n- Is there a way to see an HP points rather  than the bar itself ?  I always  make the mistake of spotting a weak opponent with almost no HP and leaving my weaker ally to finish him off, only to find them surviving another turn or two, while damaging or even killing my ally.  Actual number would really fix this.\n\n-  I REALLY hate the idea of allies hitting each other. I guess this was to help promote better planning, but because of that, I find myself relunctant to use any monsters other than kobolds or zombies, since they only attack the enemy without getting an ally caught in the crossfire.  I still use bows of course, but it irks me to see Yosef accidentally shoot Pip in the back of the head.\n\n\nIt's hard to think of anything else at this point.  But these are my main points that I find fun/unfun about the game.  Is it a perfect game? No, but  I still find myself going back to play it, so it's certainly doing something right.", "timestamp_created": 1521681383, "timestamp_updated": 1521702614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40963990": {"recommendationid": "40963990", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246948694", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "last_played": 1521751124}, "language": "english", "review": "The behemoth has, once again, constructed both a timeless classic, and a hilariously wacky adventure, wrapped up in a single, affordable game!

I got a ton of time out of the game trying to experiment, accidentally leaving it open once, trying to top the charts in the pit, and playing co-op with two other friends separately. I don't know that this is enough time to actually speak on the game's balance or whatever, but I have 100%'d the game's sidequests and bonus missions(even the boring 'capture this dude' ones for Whisper), and have completed the game through once to see one of the endings. I was also there to talk about a couple of bugfixes, and was there the first day to try every new update, because I was certain that the game would only improve from what was a solid, if flawed, core.\n\nWhile I don't necessarily believe that it's made that many significant improvements on the core gameplay, the character balance is pretty decent, and it's still satisfying to play. I still don't think some units have much appreciable value over others(mushrooms are too slow to flank and too soft to linger near multiple units, the octoclops has like a 40% chance to be useful every turn since the confusion isn't that useful, etc), and I would have actually liked to have seen another unit or two on release, but overall it's a decent roster, and they all serve some interesting purpose. I appreciate that the devs were extremely active in getting things out to their community, and trying to offer a ton of playstyle additions to get people thinking about their deceptively complex systems.\n\nThe music and visuals are both excellent - there's both a comical slapstick and a visceral crunch to fighting, and time spent in town or on the map can be pretty satisfying for a while, too, because of just how weird and interesting it all is. The cutscenes and voice acting for the first half of the game was all well done, too - it's clear a lot of love went into the presentation, and some of the lines still make me smile even after all this time.\n\nThe story is, in my opinion, perhaps the worst thing about the game by a significant margin. I can't even imagine what it must look like to someone who bought the game on release to see the animation quality drop this hard. I don't fault the devs for it, of course - whatever happened, happened, and they did what they could. The fact that it's only a few hours, and that the actual story doesn't go anywhere, only for it to end with an asspull...well, it's a little more unfortunate. The big 'twist' at the end was something they made pretty clear in the first cutscene, especially if you played their prior game. It also had very little to do with Horatio, and I wasn't quite certain by the end of things why the protagonist had been getting specifically bullied the whole game, or what one of the antagonists' purposes was beyond 'prolong the plot'. None of it seemed to have really mattered, and I won't say i'm upset about it - just kinda disappointed after all this time.\n\nThe stronger point, then, should be the sidequests and bonus missions, and for a while i'd have agreed. There's a lot of charm to some of the earlier stories, like a troll detective, or a vampire you have to quell with a sword from the sun. These were multiple phase quests, that required a few trips between story beats, and ended up being the more engaging portion of the game. There are only a handfull of these, however, and they were all added fairly early into the development cycle, so when the game released with ZERO new ones, you can imagine I was a little heartbroken. Bonus missions were added, but the writing and quality of these fluctuates a lot. These started out very promising on earlier maps, but I had to force myself to finish the last section. One of them doesn't even let you use the team you're traveling with, for seemingly no reason, and has absolutely no bearing on the protagonist or his friends at all. A trifle confusing.\n\nI also think it's a little bit disingenuous to have made the vague claim of '200 regions' to explore. This is technically true, but there are only 5-6 maps with these regions in them, and they're all extremely small clusters of random encounters and useless money. Exploration is made a trifle slower because of a fog of war that never disappears, even in areas you HAVE explored, and the major rewards for the exploring are finding the hidden switches on every map and the bonus missions. The former unlocks a quick joke(? Sometimes.) and a cosmetic or two. The latter is purely for completion's sake and maybe a unique item/character.\n\nThe problem I ran into, that I haven't seen many others discuss, is the fact that you can't choose which map to explore - it's based entirely on the whim of the bear. Every time you return to town, there's a chance he picks up the town and places it in another map. This doesn't add anything to the gameplay. Again, maybe not a problem if you just bought the game when it was completed, but for us early access folks who did most of the content prior to release, actually getting to enjoy the new content was a chore. You have to keep leaving and re-entering town in order to get the bear to RNG the map to another area, and at first I thought it was a cycle - but at one point I had the bear take me from one map to the next, back to the first map. This was one of the most frustrating things coming back to the game, and it was made double frustrating by a story element later providing a potential workaround for this(A ship that could take you from place to place, that is.), only for it to crash in the next cutscene and never be brought up again. Even if I were newer to the game, I feel like this would be a pointless exercise in tedium. I don't know how this is still a feature.\n\n\nWith all of this in mind, though, I have over 100 hours in the game, so clearly it's doing a lot right. While I think the latest update, the one that officially launched the game, was extremely disappointing, the core and everything prior was so good that I kept coming back to it. It was enough that I felt like completing it and seeing ostensibly all it had to offer. I hear there's another update coming, and I am hopeful for an excuse to open the game again, because i'm still not quite tired of it.", "timestamp_created": 1521565264, "timestamp_updated": 1521565559, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40935733": {"recommendationid": "40935733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002598009", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1058, "last_played": 1521751702}, "language": "english", "review": "Was looking for a co-op tactics game and this is it. 5 hours in, can't wait to play more.", "timestamp_created": 1521540904, "timestamp_updated": 1521540904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40931842": {"recommendationid": "40931842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063380844", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1012, "last_played": 1521731823}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is phenominal for the reasons of it being made by the people who made Castle Crashers", "timestamp_created": 1521516611, "timestamp_updated": 1521516611, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40912698": {"recommendationid": "40912698", "author": {"steamid": "76561198807324731", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 579, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "last_played": 1521429581}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u867d\u7136\u753b\u98ce\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u624b\u6cd5\u5f88\u6709\u8da3\uff0c\u4f46\u66f4\u65b0\u5b9e\u5728\u6162\u5f97\u611f\u4eba\u3002\u5347\u7ea7\u6ca1\u6709\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u8fd9\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u65b0\u5267\u60c5\u96be\u5ea6\u592a\u5927\u4e86\uff0c\u597d\u60f3\u8981\u81ea\u5e26\u4f5c\u5f0a\u7801\u554a\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1521430688, "timestamp_updated": 1521430688, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474453", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40910605": {"recommendationid": "40910605", "author": {"steamid": "76561198316229541", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520003436}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u633a\u597d\u73a9\u7684\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u4e5f\u6709\u610f\u601d\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u6218\u6597\u8282\u594f\u7565\u6162\u800c\u4e14\u5347\u7ea7\u6210\u957f\u4e0d\u5927\uff0c\u6709\u4e9b\u6b66\u5668\u5c5e\u6027\u91cd\u53e0\u53ea\u662f\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1521419131, "timestamp_updated": 1521419131, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40909848": {"recommendationid": "40909848", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157315507", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 157, "last_played": 1521414488}, "language": "english", "review": "I got this when it was early access because I've always been a fan of behemoths games.

this game for almost two hours and I couldn't get really into it. Sure the beginning is simple and the narritive is hilarious, but it soon transformed into a game where I didn't really know what was happening or were I was going. At first I thought this would be a turned based strategy in the likes of Fire Emblem or Advance Wars. As it progressed you notice there are a lot of random elements, like your fighter chosing who to attack randomly, and your archer shooting at random people. You get a feeling you're not in control of the game and it almost playes automatically. Maybe this is what the creators wanted? Maybe thats the point of the game? I don't know.

Vous ne comprenez rien\u00a0? \u00e7a n\u2019a aucun sens\u00a0? Tout \u00e0 fait normal. \n\nC\u2019est du d\u00e9lire total, fa\u00e7on Castle Crasher, avec la patte graphique typique de Behemot\u00a0: graphismes cartoon ma\u00eetris\u00e9s de bout en bout sans faillir avec une bande son entra\u00eenante qui vous reste dans la t\u00eate, qui se paye le luxe de varier les tons\u00a0: musique \u00e9lectro, un peu rock, musique absurde, musique \u00e9pique, on y entend de tout mais dans une certaine coh\u00e9rence\n\nSi tout ceci est facilement explicable, le gameplay est un peu plus complexe. \n\nPour faire simple\u00a0: vous dirigez un groupe de personnages (de Sofia d\u2019Espagne \u00e0 un cupcake, cherchez pas\u00a0!) se baladant sur une carte du monde parsem\u00e9e d\u2019ennemis pour y accomplir des qu\u00eates. Ainsi, il vous sera demand\u00e9 d\u2019aller escorter un mec qui doit se rendre \u00e0 urina town par exemple\u00a0: la fin de la qu\u00eate se terminant par un combat.\u00a0\n\nAlors les combats\u00a0: en soit, ils sont simple\u00a0: vous devez d\u00e9signer le lieu d\u2019arriv\u00e9e de vos personnages et en fonction de l\u2019endroit, ils agissent ou non. Pour prendre un exemple\u00a0: vous placez un de vos personnage autour de 3 ennemis, c\u2019est l\u2019IA qui choisira l\u2019ennemi qu\u2019elle d\u00e9sire attaquer. Si vous souhaitez qu\u2019elle attaque un ennemi en particulier, vous devrez placer votre personnage de sorte \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il n\u2019ai le choix que d\u2019attaquer la cible que vous souhaitez. Vous n\u2019avez donc aucune action directe sur ce qu\u2019ils vont faire, par contre, vous avez une influence indirecte par le placement. Si vous placez Sofia a deux cases d\u2019un ennemi, elle lancera son filet, si elle est plac\u00e9e au corps \u00e0 corps, elle attaquera avec son arme. Chaque monstre a des caract\u00e9ristiques propres : volant, magique, a distance, arme \u00e0 feu, artillerie, magique, ..., c'est la foire \u00e0 la diversit\u00e9.\n\nViens ensuite la capture\u00a0: chaque cr\u00e9ature peut \u00eatre captur\u00e9e pour \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e dans son \u00e9quipe.

I would imagine it to go down: bright, colourful, full of bizarre encounters and even more bizarre messages to take home, that would all make perfect sense in the end. We`re talking a good trip, of course, the kind of one where a flying giraffe would tell you that you`re a good person no matter what.\n\nPit People is a turn-based strategy game that just came out of a year Early Access. Unlike a lot of games of the genre the battle is presented in an attrition-like manner where it would take at least 4 turns of good pounding until the fighter would yield. This considerably lengthens the matches as the player has only up to 5 fighters at a time. However, the fighters are very versatile with a huge number of races (full of perks and weaknesses) and customization options available.\n\nIf you have been following the Behemoth`s games you`ll know exactly how it all looks. They always had a kink for visual gags and most of the time this would work really well. PP is no exception, but rather their magnum opus of visual gags thus far.\n\nGameplay-wise there is a potential turn-off for seasoned strategy players. During the battles the player doesn`t choose who gets hit by your unit. The attack is conducted at random at anybody (or thing) that is within range. A questionable simplification, perhaps the game is targeted at a wider audience, not just TBS lovers?\n\nRecruiting system in the game is somewhat innovative, drawing inspiration from Pokemon. Aside from purchasing at the market, people and creatures are captured during battle encounters by throwing nets and placing them in cages that are bought before in the town. Now the problem with it all is that the target has to the last thing standing which sometimes can be difficult given the random attack \u2018feature\u2019.\n\nThe game tends to push the player into acknowledging \u2018the unfairness\u2019: the home base is regularly moved by the bear, some battles being a spike on the learning curve when you are pitched against 3 absolutely waves (looking at you, Jerkimedes), and some battles even acknowledging the fact that they are unfair, i.e. the \u2018Unfair challenge\u2019 in the pit. Hence, the game presents with a somewhat of an identity crisis, it wants to be fun and colourful, but then smash your face into the dirt if you\u2019re getting all cosy and casual about it.\n\nIn the end PP leaves a good impression. It is something I plan to get back every now and then to try that unfair challenge or just wonder around doing some wacky side-quest I will eventually stumble upon.\n\nThis review is shortened.

The central mechanics involve assembling a team of fighters from 19 different creatures, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The primary strategy is the creation of your team and their loadout. The secondary part is moving them around the battlefield. You don\u2019t tell them who to attack, just moving them within range will cause them to attack that target. However, if there are multiple targets it\u2019s pretty ambiguous and possibly random as to how those are chosen, meaning you have to position your units carefully if you want to target a specific threat.  \nJudging by how short the story is the game seems to put most of its replay-ability and last-ability into PVP and side quests, and personally competitive play isn't my thing. There is a myriad of side missions, which (aside from a few escalating difficulty mini-campaigns) are often just one battle. These are pretty diverse in their objectives (given the limitations of a turn-based fighter), so it\u2019s clear the developers have taken time to keep these missions fresh and plentiful. \nThe game provided some challenge, but nothing I wasn\u2019t able to overcome the second, or third time trying. Either from foresight or a team re-build. There is an insane mode available which significantly increases the difficulty for those that find it too easy. \n\nThe stagnation of this game comes from reaching a point in the game where your loadout combination of Pit People and equipment allows you to pretty much take on every mission the first time. You constantly unlock new items, but these are almost entirely cosmetic. Which means you end up scrolling though a lot of reskinned weapons and armour in an attempt to find the ones with different stats and even they are often worse or comparable to what you currently have. Which is another reason why I feel the game is heavily geared towards PVP. The game is very limited in its progressive ability. It\u2019s very much a game of \u201clearn and master\u201d, rather than \u201cinvest and progress\u201d. Which for a PVP game it has to be, in order to be balanced and give each player a level playing field. \n\nI personally cannot see the appeal of this type of PVP. Sure, there are 19 different pit people you can use in a 6-fighter team, and about half of those can use equipment. So, the variety for strategy is relatively high, but with RNG aspects thrown in, and a distinct lack of strategy other than the placement of your characters, I cannot see how the competitive scene will stay alive without a continuous stream of new competitive players. \n\nI may seem critical of the flaws in this game, and I want to clarify that this game was a blast. It\u2019s charming, it looks great, it made me laugh, it kept me engaged and I wanted to play more, but it was over before it began for me. Regardless for \u00a310 you get a solid slice of the fun cake. \n\nOverall, I feel like, if this game had more progression it would be SPOT ON. Where gear and enemies were not all just reskinned, recoloured identical copies of the 30 before it. I would want to see more of a \u201cworking your way up a ladder\u201d approach as opposed to nailing down the mechanics and exploiting them. Although there are 19 creatures, because there is no progression they are all added to the pool of enemies from the very beginning, so they get samey quickly, in other words it FEELS like there is a lot less. I understand that this isn\u2019t a triple A development studio, and their resources are limited and progression takes a lot more balance. Currently the game sits around a 7-8/10, because it\u2019s a beautiful, heart filled game I would recommend, but lacks lastability. \n", "timestamp_created": 1520879147, "timestamp_updated": 1520879147, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40770178": {"recommendationid": "40770178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008567039", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 919, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 500, "last_played": 1521427574}, "language": "spanish", "review": "10/10 \"La tonta aventura tactica que siempre buscaste\"\n- Gran historia, la narracion de esta es impecable, imposible no amar al malo!\n- Super gracioso, los chistes tienen chistes!\n- Variedad de clases y razas, podes armar tu team con todo lo que captures!\n- Customizable, Cada personaje tiene armas, equipos o items unicos!\n- Quest, alrededor de 200+ quest aparte de la historia principal\n- 2 jugadores, podes jugarlo con tu amigo ambos en tu casa o online!\n\nSolo que queda aplaudir a los devs!

Though I will say this; Pit People is an insanely good game. At first I was skeptical during early access, a lot of the battles just felt way too simplified and it felt almost boring to me. After the full release those problems were quickly disperesed and even more so I got to play the game from start to finish.\n\nPit people is like any other TRPG I feel like- marked on a grid and having 6 characters at your disposal. These characters can be a complete mix to your liking, and I would even go so far to say you customize them into your own classes, and even more so being locked to 6 only characters and some even taking up 2 spaces in that roster can lead up to some interesting unit combinations. You can go with a fair and balanced team, and or a team that's all over the place and used just for fun. The game is simple yet so complex I feel at a huge amount of times. Not to mention having a Narrator over the game brings me joy as I bash my opponents too and fro. (I also want to point out that 1000+ items of customization- and how all the items are balanced and made for unique playstyles and things you can test out)\n\nNot to mention the comedy and art style is always top notch. I haven't laughed that hard in a long period of time- the sense of humor these guys at Behemoth make is always something to quote even. The art style is something I also enjoy- so simple yet unique.. Not to mention the soundtrack is something to behold. It's so much to behold that I have to turn my music up and just listen to those amazing tunes. Now, of course no game is perfect, and I do have some slight complaints even if minor.. I noticed something odd with the cutscene quality from early access to what we have now. The bear cutscene remains in tact, but every cutscene has it's own style almost and it just feels.. off maybe? I'm not quite sure..\n\nAnd that's the only complaint I can really think of? Either way if you enjoyed final fatnasy tactics, tactics orgre, fire emblem, hell even xcom then I would full on reccomend pit people-- and even if you don't like tactic games- do it for the comedy alone along with it's amazing world", "timestamp_created": 1520725183, "timestamp_updated": 1520725183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40723927": {"recommendationid": "40723927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007866241", "num_games_owned": 2472, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 225, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 214, "last_played": 1521416861}, "language": "english", "review": "A Turn-Based adventure game OOZING personality and that is as fun as playing it alone or with your Squad, the game has now been out of Early Access and it currently owns an Overwhelmingly Positive rating with authority, just like their two previous games.\n\nAfter Castle Crashers and BattleBlock Theater, comes another success for The Behemoth.

Os dejo mi an\u00e1lisis.\n\nBehemoth lo ha vuelto a hacer. Y s\u00ed, admito que no he jugado ninguno de sus antecesores juegos pero he pasado horas viendo videos y videos de sus desenfadados juegos y una vez m\u00e1s, Pit People no se escapa de ese estilo tan propio de la marca. Antes que nada tengo que decir algo y es que NO es un juego para todo el mundo. Como propio jugador de rpgs de forma habitual creo que coincidemos todos en que Pit People es un juego que lleva el sistema de estrategia a la simpleza m\u00e1s b\u00e1sica concediendo un automatismo a los personajes determinado de como los posicionemos en el combate. Esto hace que reste un poco parte de la gracia del combate, pero lejos de ello hace que sea un mal juego pues aunque haya esta automatizaci\u00f3n, a mi personalmente me ha encantado y lo he disfrutado, y seguir\u00e9 con ello.\n\nSi es verdad que la historia principal es corta, bastante corta, teniendo sobre 8 misiones para finalizarla. Si es cierto que me la tom\u00e9 con calma para no terminarme el juego r\u00e1pido pensando que durar\u00eda m\u00e1s, pero tras varias secundarias muy divertidas opt\u00e9 por lanzarme a por la historia y guau, que r\u00e1pido, intenso y divertido se hace. No tengo queja ninguna con la trama, a la altura del descoloque mental que te presenta Pit People de base, con su oso y todo lo que envuelve a esta aventura con el bueno \u201cy tonto\u201d de Horatio, m\u00e1s al contrario me he re\u00eddo tanto que me parece digna de disfrutar cualquiera que tenga la oportunidad.\n\nMe ha gustado mucho ver una buena variedad de personajes, con sus nombres absurdos y todo ese set de equipamiento de lo m\u00e1s loco de la cabeza, desde cascos con la cabeza de Doge, pasando por escudos que son el cuadro de la Mona Lisa o armas tan locas como probetas qu\u00edmicas, ojos o aviones de papel como armas a distancia. Simplemente, super divertido. La posibilidad de llevar un equipo donde kobolds,zombies, trols peludos y humanos trabajen juntos es digna de admirar, pero lo bello de todo esto es que cada quien tiene su \u201cventaja\u201d y con un equipo combinado puedes dar much\u00edsima guerra a quien se te ponga por delante.\n\nCon respecto al mapa solo te dir\u00e9 que cada sitio te har\u00e1 re\u00edr con el nombre, que podr\u00e1s pasar por un v\u00e1ter gigante, recorrer una zona de caramelos o pasar por una ciudad completamente en llamas. Y eso es solo un fragmento. El mapa estar\u00e1 lleno de personas que te contar\u00e1n su vida y sus problemas, y que podr\u00e1s ayudarles (a modo de secundaria) a resolverlos, ech\u00e1ndote de nuevo las risas porque sus \u201cproblemillas\u201d son para echarte la mano a la cara y decir, \u00bfde verdad?.. S\u00fablime. \n\nSi te has le\u00eddo todo esto, querido lector, eres un m\u00e1quina. \u00bfTe recomiendo este juego? Si te gustaron anteriores trabajos de Behemoth, ni te lo pienses y compralo. \u00bfQuieres un juego para re\u00edrte todo el tiempo? Dale al bot\u00f3n de comprar y disfruta como el que m\u00e1s. Calculo que con las secundarias, f\u00e1cilmente pasar\u00e1s las 50h de juego, as\u00ed que cada euro invertido se ver\u00e1 m\u00e1s que amortizado. Si buscas un reto como tantos rpgs, no te lo compres porque su sencillez es clara.\n\nPoco m\u00e1s puedo a\u00f1adir salvo\u2026 \u00a1Reclamo estas tierras en el nombre de Espa\u00f1a!",

"review": "Ich w\u00fcrde dieses Spiel gerne m\u00f6gen, es hat eine tolle Grafik, einen witzigen Humor und eine lustige Geschichte. Mehr aber leider auch nicht. Die K\u00e4mpfe sind viel zu lang, bestehen aus zu vielen Gegnern und sind irgendwie immer gleich. Wenn man mit einem Freund zusammen spielt, hat man das Gef\u00fchl, dass die Anzahl der Gegner einfach verdoppelt wurde. Es gibt au\u00dferdem null taktische Tiefe. Was bringt es einem denn, wenn man einen Charakter mit einem Hammer hat, der mehr Schaden an Einheiten mit Helmen macht, wenn man nicht einmal vern\u00fcnftig seine Gegner ausw\u00e4hlen kann. Ich habe mal als Test den Automatikkampf eingeschaltet, um zu kucken, ob ich irgendetwas falsch mache. Aber nein, die K\u00e4mpfe waren gleich, nur mit dem Unterschied, dass der Automatikkampf nicht so lange zum Positionieren brauchte und den rng Gott auf seiner Seite hatte. Jetzt grinde ich also mit dem Autokampf weiter in der Hoffnung, das Spiel m\u00f6ge besser werden. Zum Thema Ausr\u00fcstung k\u00f6nnte man sagen, dass es wahnsinnig viele Ausr\u00fcstungsgegenst\u00e4nde gibt, mit denen man seinen Charakter aufmotzen kann. Man kann aber auch sagen, dass sie sich, abgesehen vom Visuellen, kaum bis gar nicht voneinander unterscheiden.\n\nVerbesserungsvorschl\u00e4ge:\n\nK\u00e4mpfe: Die K\u00e4mpfe bstehen aus weniger Gegnern, sind k\u00fcrzer, man kann richtig ausw\u00e4hlen, wen man angreift, und auch als healer, wen man heilt. Man kann selbst ausw\u00e4hlen, in welcher Reihenfolge die einzelnen Charaktere angreifen (was bisher \u00fcbrigens an den gegangenen Feldern gemessen wurde). Es gibt verschiedene Attacken oder F\u00e4higkeiten von einzelnen Charakteren (bitte nicht gl\u00fccksabh\u00e4ngig) und die Map nimmt einen gr\u00f6\u00dferen Einfluss auf die K\u00e4mpfe.\n\nAusr\u00fcstung: Die Ausr\u00fcstungen unterscheiden sich mehr voneinander, so gibt es bisher vier verschiedene Arten von \"Kopfbedeckungen\", die eines Types unterscheiden sich aber nur visuell. Ich f\u00e4nde es auch sch\u00f6n, wenn man seinen Charakter mit verschiedenen Schuhen bearbeiten k\u00f6nnte. Die Idee mit dem Gewicht finde ich zwar gut, ich f\u00e4nde es aber noch besser, wenn man z.B. einen Geschwindigkeitsbonus kriegen w\u00fcrde, wenn das Gewicht weit unter 100 % liegt.\n\nIm Gro\u00dfen und Ganzen kann man sagen, dass das Spiel sehr viel verschenktes Potenzial hat und sich gerade im Strategiegenre nicht mit den gr\u00f6\u00dferen Spielen messen kann.", "timestamp_created": 1520680678, "timestamp_updated": 1520681210, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40706075": {"recommendationid": "40706075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131697071", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 360, "last_played": 1521388566}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros :\nGreat soundtrack\nUnique artstyle\nCO-OP story and arena mode .\nOnline PVP .\nCons : \nMay get repetitive after some time .\n\n8/10", "timestamp_created": 1520674725, "timestamp_updated": 1520674725, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40700248": {"recommendationid": "40700248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143286362", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1041, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 346, "last_played": 1520654398}, "language": "english", "review": "Let me get this straight I don't hate this game, but I don't like tatical rpgs and this is one.

At the time the game was enjoyable, new, fresh, but its problems came to light after nearly an hour of playtime. There was no depth to the game plain and simple. I had hoped that development through early access would improve conditions, but now nearly a year after my purchase the game is fully released and the problems that it had in early access still plague it to this day.\n\nThe battle mechanics that you experience in the tutorial levels will be the same that you encouter throughout the game. You move your characters, end your turn, deal damage, tank damage, rinse and repeat ALL GAME LONG.  The only thing you control in battle is where you position your units and even that mechanic is surrounded with RNG as you cannot target enemies, your units simply roll on which units they will attack. Your units will level a lot as you play and there is no significant difference between a level 1 unit and a level 100 unit. Both will deal roughly the same damage and have the same HP. Unless you are trying to collect every item in game, there is no sense of progress.\n\nSure there are many unlocks and different unit types to control that add some levels of uniqueness to each battle, but the vast majority, I'm talking 85% of all items are simply cosmetic and offer nothing new. \n\nThe majority of my in-game hours came from the multiplayer versus mode the game has. I was hoping for this \"Strategy\" and \"Turn-Based Combat\" game to actually offer some options to outplay your opponent. To my dissapointment multiplayer is as lackluster as singleplayer. There are zero ways to outplay your oppenent other than them moving their units close to yours and giving you the opportunity to hit them first. With the lack of targetting control and the RNG involved in attacking units, the multiplayer rounds became as stale as singleplayer.\n\nI waited for the game to come out of early access in hopes that these problems would be addressed by the developer. Sadly I was  greeted with more useless cosmeetic items and rushed cutscenes. Looks like I wont be touching this game again.\n\n[b]DO NOT make the same mistakes that I made. DO NOT purchase early access games even if you liked the developers previous games.

What you are able to control in this strategy game is to set up your favorite team with ABSURD creatures you catch with Pokeball, and equip them with ABSURD weapons to make them look sillier and deadier (seriously I've been smashing helmets with a sunflower and hitting ennemies with ice cream). Rainbow Horses? 10/10\n\nOh well, the combat itself is really well done as you have to take into account the randomness of your troops and get the most out of them. The AI in this game is rather smart, and with proper management RNG isn't an issue at all. Multiplayer is also insanely fun as you and somebody else team up and work your way towards victory using chat and pins. The sense of accomplishment once you win a match feels SO GOOD OMG :D\n\nThe only issue is that the combat can sometimes be hard to understand. Even when the controls are super simple to get, the actual combat scenes can, well, become a mess of explosions real fast... don't expect anything better when over 20 little guys with swords explosives tootbrush flowers bugs unicornpowa and snakes are literally hitting each other at the same time.

Therefore, if you're trying to take out a specific target, you'll need to move your party members so that this enemy is the only one they could possibly attack. This was a strategic layer that was new for me, and it was interesting to learn how to best navigate within this system. However, after a while, many of the battles seemed to play out similarly. Although there is a difference between the static abilities party members have, each party member still basically only does one thing (although it's neat to mount a party member on the back of your Spidaur and carry them around).\n\nThe customization comes in when you create your party composition and outfit each member with items. Although you'll pick up certain \"human\" characters progressing through the story, you'll need to go out and capture enemies to create a diverse crew. To do so, you'll need to take a cage and a character with a net. If you kill all enemies but the one you want to capture and you move your party member with the net in range, you'll snag a new potential party member. For the majority of the game, my party consisted of a cyclops, a tank (Josef), 2 vampiresses (vampiri?), and a fairy. The vampiress gains life through dealing damage, and deals extra damage to bleeding (heavily damaged) enemies. The fairy burns enemies with fire from a couple hexes away, while the cyclops takes up two party slots but hits especially hard. \n\nUnfortunately, the item system in the game was the most baffling thing to me. You can acquire items through completing quests or you can buy them in the marketplace, but it doesn't seem possible to see the statistics of an item before you buy it. On your party outfitting screen there are some bar graphs that are supposed to represent statistics, but it was hard to really understand what I was looking at. The only item that I knew for sure was making a difference was the \"Alpaca Lips,\" a mallet used by my cyclops that dealt extra fire damage to all characters (including both himself and allies) in the vicinity. The marketplace also contains outfitted party members that you can buy for a somewhat steep price.\n\nThe main draw of the title, in my opinion, is the humor. Certainly, Pit People retains the humor that has earned The Behemoth such a following. Many of the items are hilarious - some of my favorites include a ballcap that says \"Mom\" for the Troll Mom, a stack of pancakes that I used as a shield with my cyclops, and a space helmet and gyroscope wings for my fairy. The character designs are absurd, with the gnomes being a highlight sitting in their floating armchairs. I also cracked up often at the voices, especially my fairy that screamed every line or my co-op partner's cupcake that sounding like a babbling baby. Who wouldn't want some little iced creams?\n\nI had a good time with Pit People, although all the fights felt similar late game. However, I have to give The Behemoth credit for changing the pace a little during a main mission towards the end. I can't say I enjoyed it as much as any of the games I mention up at the top of the review, but it's definitely a pretty good time with a pal.

There is a New Game+ if you decide to also complete the monsters and quests\n\nThough this is in the same universe as battleblock and Castle Crashers it doesnt continue their storyline at all(bummer) but you can still get their cosmetics as freebies for owning and supporting them +\n\nGameplay is Hex Grid tactic\\turn based RPG though it differs from most due ot the fact that you are unable to control which target you are able to hit UNLESS you position your characters correctly. It also relies hits on RNG than the others.

The first hour or so contains some amazing animation and acting that rivals the best cartoons of today.  Unfortately this outstanding presentation is paired with some of the shallowest and dullest combat I've encountered. It bored me to tears as each fight can last upwards of 10 minutes and it never really gets more complicated than your first battle.  Other than some boss fights or quest mobs which may require you to break through a door or a wall, or face a swarm of spawning enemies, it's the same.  You simply try to position your guys and click end turn and hope that the round goes well.  You're bombarded with EXP gains and LVL UP fanfare in combat yet your heroes don't seem to develop or progress.  They don't unlock interesting abilities as far as I'm aware, at least not in my time with the game.  The map appears to be packed with interesting locations yet they remain useless window dressing.  You gather a metric butt-tonne of loot from completing quests and fighting map mobs, and while it seems like there are many items, there aren't many different items other than the visual gag of it being a fence post or a lolly pop.  There are plenty of entertaining cosmetics which have no effect and I believe you need to sacrifice valuable armor in order to wear them.\n\nI was bored to death after around 5 hours.  The combat is so shallow and directionless, and is presented in a frustratingly clunky manner making it confusing when shuffling around 6 heroes.  An auto-battler is available in options allowing the cpu to take your turns for you.  It seems more efficient to just allow the AI to do it's thing unless you need to take over to perform a specific activity such as capturing an enemy. You can enable or disable it whenever at will, so that's a good thing? It's the only reason I played more than two hours.\n\nIf there were a tonne more quests and a... I was gonna say a fleshed out combat system, but [i]a[/i] combat system would be better than this.  I'm reminded of how Endless Legend played out it's manual battles, except there you could actually direct which unit to try to attack, and I still ended up automising them because of how shallow it felt.\n\nPerhaps it's more enjoyable in co-op or pvp.  I could see this working well on the Switch or on the sofa with a partner for some mindless banter. If they can vibe with the at-times crass humor, then I'd particularly recommend for players completely new or unfamiliar to gaming.  But if you were hoping for an evenly weighted, hilarious strategy game, then Pit People feels like it's missing a leg.\n\nWas it blown off in to space by a giant space bear?

The Behemoth is known for making \"pick up and play\" style games with simplistic controls and mechanics so as not to bog the player down and let them get right into playing.  They tried to combine this style of design with a tactics RPG and while I think they pulled it off about as well as they could have, I can't help but feel like that design decision ended up holding the game back.\n\n\tYour only control over your units is their positioning, so you can't choose different kinds of attacks, target specific enemies in a group, or use various abilities.  This does create an interesting dynamic where you have to position your units in places that guarantee you'll hit who you want to hit while also making it difficult for the enemy to isolate your units, but ultimately it leads to a shallow strategy system that doesn't give you many options for combat.\n\n\tWhere the game tries to add variety and offer different approaches to combat is in the team building and RPG elements.  You can recruit many different types of units from humans to cyclopes to hair trolls, however this ends up falling a bit flat as most of the monster species are just too difficult to use effectively.  The inability to know what kind of battle you're walking into and prepare for it makes niche strategies unreliable, and there's very little advantage to pulling off a niche strategy anyways.  You CAN roll into battle with a hair troll, 2 robots, and 4 zombies, but you'll have a hard time finding a more effective team than a cyclops, 3 humans, and a cupcake.  This is made worse by the fact that non-human species (other than cyclops) have little to no access to gameplay-affecting equipment.  For example, while a human can equp many different types of melee weapons, ranged weapons, offhand throwing weapons, shields, and helmets, a hair troll can only change what cosmetic hat it wears.  This ends up making the monster classes just less fun to use overall after the initial novelty that comes from finding out you can capture and use them.\n\n\tIt also doesn't help that there's no real individuality between units of the same species.  Even the 3 story characters are basically interchangable blank slates due to a lack of a class system or individualized stats between units.  For instance, Horatio is presented as a tanky shield user, but is equally as effective as an archer or mallet user; Yosef is presented as a throwing weapons user, but you can take away his throwing axes and hand him a sword and shield and he'll use them just as effectively as anyone else.  While it is nice that you don't have to hunt down and capture units until you have an ideal one with the right class/stats, it also means you have no reason to capture units after you have as many of that type as you want.  For most monster units I doubt you'll even capture more than one of each.\n\n\tNow I know this sounds like I have a lot of negativity toward this game, but I want to make it clear that I do like it and I think The Behemoth did as good of a job as they could tackling a genre so much more complicated than what they've done in the past.  It's just a little disappointing as a fan of tactics games to feel like this one could have been so much [i]more[/i].", "timestamp_created": 1520280023, "timestamp_updated": 1520280228, "voted_up":

Between patches 1-5 and the final release patch, it almost feels like different people worked on the game, (i know that wasnt the case, just so we're clear) and the people who did the 2nd half of the game just tried to emulate the first half's work. \n\nI'll explain why i get this feeling. The game starts with a witty sarcastic humourous narrrator, good interaction between him and the protagonist, and a sense that you need to take revenge, there are good cutscenes with voice acting and humor. But this doesnt last.\n\nThe story of the game ends up feeling very weak and unintersting, and has you doing a lot for seemingly no reason at all, like needing to retrieve an item for one of the characters, so that you can retrieve another item for that character, so that you can use that item to...spot jerkimeties taking a spa day while you fall from the location that you retrieved the 2nd item from. Literally thats it, the 2nd item that the game up until now had you searching for and working towards served one tiny purpose, and the spa could have been seen with the naked eye. \n\nAnd at this point in the story there is this weird feeling that something is missing now, there seems to be no real humor in the game anymore, and the cinematics have no voice acting, or real animation in them at all anymore, and worst of all, the hilaious narrator who would make quips and jokes isnt there, and hasnt been for a while now.\n\nOk so, the item you got was basically pointless, but thats ok because now the story is going to move on in a meaningful way right? ehh..no so much. You now basically play hide and go seek with jerkimedies as you catch him and he just teleports away, you catch him, he teleports away, then you go to his main base to fight him. Why wouldnt you just go there to begin with??\n\nSo after that he decides to help you for (very very) weak plot reasons, (i dont want to spoil the whole plot of the game) then you're off, to fight THE FINAL BOSS YEAHH!!\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD\n\nSorry, i just couldn't NOT address this. So the giant bear who crashed into the planet was apparently a good guy, until a character from battle block theatre blasted a laser into his lover, killing him/her, causing him to become an asshole. And during this, a 5 word song is playing, saying \"it all makes sense now\" over and over. But it doesn't. IT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE NOW. Seriously, you mean to tell me, that because a character that wasnt even seen in this game, did something to him, he decided to take revenge on a TOTALLY RANDOM BLUEBERRY FARMER?! Seriously, he kidnaps his son and makes it out like horatio is the ultimate asshole, but he didnt do anything at all. He then...my god its so stupid...he then grabs the battle block theatre guy, who has a laser shining out of his head, and uses him to destroy EVERYTHING. THEN a horse floats by, and grants him one wish..... so horatio goes back to the past, saves pipestrella before her dad dies, saves the cupcake before he is taken prisoner and meets up with yosef and sofia at the town, then it cuts to the bear sad in space saying \"what about my dream\" before the horse floats into frame and it fades to black with the end on the screen.\n\nThere is no fucking closure in that, that isnt a resolution to anything, the bear would have still been terrorizing the world, and who knows what his wish would have been. \n\nEND SPOILERS\n\nSo without spoiling it, let me just tell you, there is no resolution to the plot, none of it made sense, the game lost all its comedic value after literally the first 30 minutes of the game and the ENTIRE story of the game probably takes less than 6 hours to COMPLETE.\n\nSo this means that the majority of the game will be spent doing terrible low effort missions and quests that are basically nothing but random map encounters with flavor text thrown in and called \"content\". There are a total of like 15 different monsters and characters you can control, which is far too little, and all the weapons and armor choices basically boil down to cosmetic choices, and leveling up characters is borderline pointless due to how low the stat gains are.\n\nOverall i LIKED the game, but im super dissapointed with how it seemed to be handled, in the beginning of the game it was clear there was a lot of love and care being put into it, but it became super obvious the further into the story you got, that the less motivated and interested they were in the game, and just wanted to rush out the finished product and be done working on it, and the game as a whole suffered. The second half of the game feels soulless and basically just \"there\" for lack of a better term, the story makes little sense and a LOT of it serves no purpose and goes around in circles for no reason, all just to end up with no real conclusion, which is really unsatisfying.\n\nThis game had a ton of potential, but it was squandered. If they decide to add more content and continue the storyline further out, then fine, ill change this review accordingly, but as it stands, i would not reccomend this game, the story is far too short, there is too little variety in party members, the gameplay is slow and not very strategic, it isnt challenging, leveling characters feels pointless, as does getting gear aside from the cosmetic purposes, and literally 80% of the game's content are side missions, which are basically random encounters with a few lines of flavor text thrown in.\n\n5/10.", "timestamp_created": 1520219180, "timestamp_updated": 1520219180, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.638721", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40577593": {"recommendationid": "40577593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029294662", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519851406}, "language": "english", "review": "My co-op buddy killed both allies and enemies with unicorn artillery.

If you want a solid game to grind or simply play casually on, I HIGHLY recommend it. \n\nHowever, there is a notable con to the game.\n\nThe story.\n\n(Warning: Spoilers) I was hyped for a new fun game to play by the Behemoth, and my expectations were met flawlessly. I was also excited for the story, but I was met with some disappointment. When I played the story, I noticed that the cutscenes weren't very fluid. The storytelling is too fast-paced, and the some scenes seem to be rushed. Unlike Pit People, Battleblock Theater had done a much better job at this. The cutscenes were easier to follow along, and the puppet animation was a very creative style. It was smoother, and overall did a great job telling the story. A prime example of my disappointment is the ending. I feel the events were too sudden, such as the reveal of how the bear was suffering on the inside from the loss of Honeyhug. After that, he loses his mind. He grabs Hatty Hattington and uses his hat to destroy planets around him. It was too quick for me, and it didn't help that the cutscene looked so awful at points. The transitions from frame to frame were constant, and some frames could've been animated better. If you don't notice these fallacies, please take a look at the scenes again.\n\nMaybe I was expecting too much from the story.

No selection of these games even shares a basic genre, let alone deep aspects Art and humor style aren't the only factors here. I'm very tempted to keep hating on fankids, but I promised a review.\n\n[b]Key TLDR Points[/b]\n[list]\n\t[*]Fun 2-player Co-op campaign mode (local is best)\n\t[*]Plays well with controllers\n\t[*]Puerile humor and absurdities galore\n\t[*]Shallow but still very fun strategy system\n\t[*]\"Gotta Catch 'em All\" collector aspect for creatures and cosmetics\n\t[*]Casual feel, can be easy, but difficulty has no ceiling, with optional hardcore (permanent death)\n[/list]\n\nBecause this game is highly stylized, even comparing within the genre, it makes sense to address gameplay and style separately.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\n\nPit People is a turn-based strategy game played on a hexagonal grid. In terms of strategy, it brings nothing new to the table, and is actually highly simplified - to the point where it could easily be a mobile game with almost [i]no[/i] changes.\n\nThe only action - [i]only[/i] - that you can take with each unit each round is to move. You can move your units around the grid to put them in range of the enemy, which varies by what weapon they hold. But then the target is randomly chosen from any target that is legal for that unit.\n\nEverything else is up to deterministic steps that are out of your direct control. While this removes one layer of strategy, it does add an interesting layer of meta-strategy. If you want to guarantee your unit attacks a target, you must try to arrange that unit so that the desired target is the only valid one. This means that positioning is vital. If you're hoping to be able to tell unit X to use ability Y on enemy Z, you'll be disappointed. \n\nThere are some other benefits to this simplification. The game's simplicity means that turns can happen pretty quickly. When playing co-op, this is very important. If you want a deep strategy game, there are options. You could play the Heroes of Might and Magic games, for example. Many of them are brilliant. But playing those games co-op has always been a bit of a burden, because one person's turn could take twenty or thirty minutes if they are sucked into a complex combat when you aren't.\n\nPit People tries to make sure that this never happens. Turns are simultaneous, with overlays showing where each unit will go. One unit's destination can be the hex that a unit is currently on, provided that the target hex's occupant will leave it vacant when moves happen. When all moves are chosen, every unit moves and attacks together (barring some staggering of the animations). This does lead to some confusion, because with overlays showing movements scattered around units that will shortly be elsewhere, you can sometimes lose track of what you're doing. But given the difficulty of making all that information appear on the board while keeping the pace quick, I find that the game's solution admirable.\n\nThere are a few special abilities possessed by a few units, but they're mostly pretty usual stuff. A percent chance to stun, for example. But there are a few interesting gems, like the Spidaur's ability to block movement if it is exactly two hexes away from an obstacle.\n\nYou collect new and ever more bizarre team members by a somewhat tedious and annoying capture system, but the fun of collection is still a strong drive in the game. Collection of creatures and ridiculous gear (pizza-slice shields, traffic cone hats, absurd haircuts) is one of the more fun aspects of the game. While fun variety of cosmetic choices exists for most units, I found myself wishing there were more creatures and gear choices of combat significance to be made, and more cosmetic choices for the non-human units.\n\n[b]Style[/b]\nThe art style is easily seen in the game's store page. It's highly consistent all throughout the game.\n\nThe humor of Pit People is a mixture of the absurd (which I like) and puerile (which I put up with). Units have personal names like Parallelogram or Staples, and part of the game's premise is that the world has collided with one giant space-faring bear, and faces the antagonism of another one, whose invasive commentary and nagging is a large part of the game's humor. \n\nFor me personally, none of it makes or breaks anything. I'd feel about the same about the game if it had taken a serious attitude. I left toilet humor on the playground, and have never understood how so many adults never did. Style doesn't do anything for me on that level.\n\nBut for those who really like it, and always wished there was more Cards Against Humanity in the world, you will really appreciate it, and will enjoy yourself thoroughly. Good for you, but perhaps not all. The game's visual and humor style is the one its most consistent and pervasive aspects, and will turn some players off completely. Those players deserve to know in advance that the poop jokes are coming, and that your units WILL wind up with with names like Infinifart and Buttcake, and that you cannot rename anything ever.\n----------\n[b]Personal Note[/b]\nI do want to mention that I'm troubled that the game doesn't seem to include any people of color. [b][i]Whatsoever[/i][/b]. While the generically paper-white appearance of the characters could be argued as neutral, I have to disagree with the stance. All nonhuman creatures in the game feature color. Only humans feature this generic appearance, making it seem specific. The fact that white is a presumed default is precisely the problem. They probably just forgot about it, which is kind of the problem.\n\n\n----\n\nDraft 1, needs editing", "timestamp_created": 1520198401, "timestamp_updated": 1520311697, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498391", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40572274": {"recommendationid": "40572274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198163529433", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 152, "last_played": 1520634233}, "language": "english", "review": "Castle Crashers: wow that game looks really dumb \nRelease: wow this game is actually fun\nBattleblock: OK now this one looks bad just wait\nRelease: alright well its pretty good too\nPitpeople: NOW THIS IS GONNA BE TERRIBLE\nRelease: fuck dude", "timestamp_created": 1520196402, "timestamp_updated": 1520196402, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478261", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40572102": {"recommendationid": "40572102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017783719", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520265894}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is unique. \nWhy isn't it more popular ?

They don't feel unique enough and when putting them in raw combat to compare they all pretty much play out the same. There really isn't a strategy aspect to the game as it stands and I don't think it ever will. Your party will almost always be able to take on 2 encounters before having to heal or return back to the hub. If you're great or if you're terrible it always takes about 2 battles to make you need to retreat. This game gets incredibly stale after your 10th battle; they're all the same despite what enemies are present and how many there are. It is very clear The Behemoth is doing trial and error on this one as they go. The strategy aspect of this game is absent.\n\nSecondly, the map and it's exploration. This game has about 5-6 maps in which each time you load into a new world it picks a spawn point on one of those 6 maps. There's really no point to this aspect of the game. I was fine with it at first but after updates they removed the beacon back to the city. This makes trying to get back more annoying than difficult because time stops when you stop to open the map and try to guess where you are... funnily enough, they were basically forced to revert this in the release. There is now a marker pointing to the city at all times. Over the updates there was also a feature to make elite enemies stun immune, more aggressive, and inescapable. This is incredibly annoying because now special enemies on the world map just attack you out of nowhere and there's no way to stop them beyond out-driving them. I'm not too sure, but I'm fairly sure they got rid of this too. The same missions spawn in all the same places each time there's really no point. They could have just gone with a really big static map and it wouldn't have changed anything...\n\nLastly the collectables. This aspect is just rushed. They had their artists pump in as many crazy things as they could but they're almost entirely cosmetic. The weapons in this game used to be all the same and they tried to change that by making some unique. As time went on, they did this more and more with wider differences. Now, a lot of these weapons are beyond useless and simply cant be used in a strategic sense. There's no easy way to get these collectables or direct means of getting them. If you could just pay for a random item in a gambling machine it would be fine. Currently, the only way to obtain items is catching an enemy (kill all the enemies first, and have a character with a net catch it) and by random loot drops from doing missions/beating enemies.\n\nEverything about this game just screams placeholder and subject to change on a balance level. The Behemoth was taking their sweet time with the game. (months between updates) Despite these huge time gaps between content they aren't changing much. The gameplay didn't get anymore engaging, the main story didn't progress (They delayed the release for cinematics of which, are still-shot sketches, nothing like the first cutscenes), and most of each update was just more collectable dumps. The core of this game never changed. It's still the same casual flat \"strategy game\" through and through. After countless rebalances of how levels and stats work the game is still exactly the same as the first build, worse really. In the final release they ended up undoing a solid 40% of things they changed from the first build. I wanted to give this game a good review, I really did but it's clear these are permanent problems lingering over the game.\n\nThe icing on the disaster cake is the community. Right off the bat, it's dead. Most people try to be helpful but it's just a ghost town. \n\nI have personal problems with this community day in and day out. Back in the day I used to be extremely active, I would help people with any questions or problems. I would boast about having the most completion because I loved the game and played it religiously. However the downfall of the community was The Behemoth and their connection to said community. \n\nThey moved over to discord and the forums here were getting more and more silent by the day. So they decided to make a community manager, a fellow player. I don't want to seem jealous, but they made this guy a manager out of no where for no reason and he isn't an employee. He simply embraced a meme and became the center of attention by making his profile themed after Pit People. Sure, this is fine at first but he really isn't helpful or active like I was. He was basically made community mod to be a jester to liven up the place. (That worked really well right...?)\n\nThen I go onto the forums after being disappearing after many months and updates. I come looking for help to get 100% completion or as close as I could. What do we have...? No one. The forums are empty for the most part. I stumble across a group of select people trying to make a full list of everything in the game. Turns out, they're close buddies who won't help out unless it's to help themselves. They just want Steam forum fame on an empty game. So I continue my search...\n\nI go to the Discord asking around there. I find someone who's willing to help. To my surprise they had more items than me despite me 100%'ing the game a few updates ago. What do they do? Oh yeah, they scam me. Turns out this guy is also buds with the small group of completionists. Wow, great community huh? He accused me of cheating for having the max number of items when I played this game a lot longer before there was more content but okay...\n\nThe community is ran by 3 people and it's pretty obvious who they are, they AREN'T the devs. They own all the big guides, respond to everything, are overly toxic, and they scam. These 3 should be banned. What kind of a weird shut-in do you have to be to claim a steam forum for yourself, get buddy-buddy with the devs, then pose as a community manager to glorify yourself...", "timestamp_created": 1520031788, "timestamp_updated": 1520031788, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623849", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1521609863, "developer_response": "Hello!

Unfortunately that's where the good parts end, as the game does not satisfy my itch for a tactics game.\n\nStrategizing is definitely the meat and bones in a good Tactics game. For Pit People, positioning is very important in the game as it determined who each unit might attack (you can't select exactly who to attack unless you position very well), the battles are overly simplified to the point of sucking down all the enjoyment out of it! I'm amazed how all the elements that makes a good strategy game were dismissed in lieu of some comedy you already get on Castle Crashers or BattleBlock Theater. \n\nLike I mentioned, there are a lot of fun options to dress up your characters which add a SOME depth to choosing your units and what they can do, but the variety for recruits are disappointedly limited and there isn't much to do in the game more than read out the hit-and-miss \"funny\" dialogue for the story line. At first I thought it was just because of the lack of content (Started playing during Vanilla or patch 1), but after trying again these last few weeks with their last update (and plans on leaving Early Access very soon), I noticed that that is it for the game and I saw no notable differences in terms of gameplay or substance.\n\nIn short, I would look away from this game.

(I'll link it; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFl4FHNTJx0 ) This is practicly why I bought the game, because of the artstyle, the voice acting and the gameplay...\n\nPros:\n-amazing story\n-incredible voice acting by the great William Stamper himself\n-the battles are fun\n-loads of funny little easter eggs on the map\n-fun and challenging gameplay\n-over 21 different monsters to capture\n-over 3500 different cosmetics\n-a lot of really fun sidequests, ranging from beating up cupcakes to following a detective troll\n-8 save slots\n-Pupondely hondely hopley hobba, peshnoki tooki, pesh toodidoo,  antonki whonki donkahong\n-you can stun enemies from your cart, so that you don't have to fight them\n-all characters do something different\n-the storyline intertwines with their other titles, like BattleBlock Theater\n\nCons:\n-the battles are sometimes infuriating\n-the battles take a long LONG time to finish\n-Elite enemies exist... (these are stronger, and will relentlessly focus you on the world map untill you inevitebly get in a battle with them, they can't be stunned either)\n-sometimes you don't know what tiles you can walk on and which ones you can't in battles\n-bosses sometimes are ridiculously strong... (Like a certain boss in story mode which got nerfed a month after I beat it and got my ass whooped at the same time\n-The prices in the store are ridiculously high... 7000G for a merc? you can LITTERALLY go out into the field with a cage, and capture like, 2... (the item shop is good though, you can buy items you never came accross before)\n\nOverall: I extremely recommend this game, there are a few bugs and glitches here and there, but overall it's a great game!", "timestamp_created": 1519757033, "timestamp_updated": 1520065054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.480341", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40443973": {"recommendationid": "40443973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198253962885", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 311, "last_played": 1520630894}, "language": "danish", "review": "just... fun... you know?", "timestamp_created": 1519756162, "timestamp_updated": 1519756162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40434259": {"recommendationid": "40434259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051922022", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 24, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519724317}, "language": "english", "review": "great art style, funny commentary, great visual. the story connects to other behemoth games so its pretty rad. only been playing it for a while, but i can already tell its gonna be good.

Items are almost entirely cosmetic so much of the \"RPG\" in this is worthless. The overall game feels like it has no direction and is just a mashup of ideas. Overall mechanics are also deeply flawed e.g. you cannot choose who to attack. This is a huge issue considering it plays on a hexagonal grid, allowing your character to be adjacent to two enemies simultaneously. The AI chooses who you attack and it can be random each round so the whole strategy aspect of the game is hamstringed. I absolutely loved the art style, incredible voice acting, and overall idea behind the game but I can't bring myself to play it any further because it's....boring. If I can't choose who to attack, can't get gear that's really worth anything, and don't get a solid idea of what's actually occuring in combat situations I can't continue playing.

Despite this however, Pit People definitely holds its own from the rest of The Behemoth's titles. With countless amounts of unlockables this game will have a grasp on the completionists for a good while. Offering 18 or so unit types the team combinations are quite varied. It is unlikely you will see 2 team compositions back to back and even less likely that these team combinations will have the same gear. Strategy is up to the user and many troops have varying success rates depending on what their teammates are. Team synergy and positioning is the name of the game for Pit People and the game makes it quite obvious. Cupcakes can heal most units in the game but when it comes to the Electrobot unit type they cannot. The player learns that the Robots would do better in a team with Gnomes instead as the Gnomes can heal the Electrobots. \n\nThe game has countless hours of playtime. I played it in Xbox Game Preview and decided to get it on steam as well. Even as an Early Access title I would highly recommend this game. The main thing you don't have access to in early access is the complete story. You still get the first handful of missions but the final ones are not in it yet. You still have access to a large quantity of side quests and the online Pvp and Unfair challenge let you test yourself and recieve exclusive rewards for ranking high in the leaderboard among 99 other players. The game is great. The main things I hope for in a future update(s) is a that the story hopefully has more than just one more mission for the cutscenes are great. The game could standalone from its story without a problem, the story is just the icing on top. My biggest wish is hopefully after launch the game continues to update with new items (like a costume for the mascot that makes it look like the Raccoon from Battleblock if that can't become a new unit) and I cross my fingers for a potential new unit. We already have a good handful to select from but I have been playing for a while on Game Preview and I have played around with the units a lot. One more unit would be an awesome surprise. The game is awesome and the devs are just as awesome. They listen to the community unlike many developers nowadays and make good changes in their games.

There are multiple creatures you can capture to use in your party, from mushrooms, to pixies- and each have loads of cosmetics that they can use, and if you use humans in your party you can customize weapons AND cosmetics. The best part about this is that they make the ridiculous looking weapons actually viable, have you ever played a game and seen a weapon that just looks amazing but you know that its really a terrible weapon and you shouldn't use it? Well that mostly won't happen in pit people, in fact most weapons look ridiculous anyway so that isn't a problem. \nThe fact that I'm saying so many great things about the game and I've only done a few main story quest is amazing- you can do side quests that have their own mini stories and end in one massive ending battle that is tense beyond words. I found myself starting to care about my troops individually because of how far we had come in the battle. You can also play with friends which makes the experience incredible, I would more than reccomend this game without co-op, but with it becomes a very funny but also epic experience sometimes.

theater este es un juegazo con solo las 10 horas que he jugado digo que este es el mejor juego de the behemont y eso q a mi no me gustan los rpg , pero este esta muy bueno , historia original , humor gracioso me ha hecho reir muchas veces y no en videojuegos q no me rio mucho , este videojuego hay como un mundo a cual explorar tambien puedes capturar monstrour y tenerlos como tu equipo , tambien puedes comprar tu  equipo ,y puedes personalizar tu equipo, tambien puedes capturar a cualquiera monstrou o persona del juego cuando compras una jaula , tienes un mapa , tienes un mundo abierto donde puedes a ir a donde quieras , mientras ganas misiones secundarias o principales ganas armas , armadura ,etc para ponerles a tus personajes , lo unico malo de este juego es q te da lento les recomiendo q le pongo graficos bajos para q les vaya rapido y lo otro malo es q hay pocas misiones secundarias y principales pero eso es porque esta el juego en acceso anticipado cuando salga habra mas  y si tienes castle crashers y battlebock theater te dan casco o skin de cada juego , este juego se los recomiendo a los fans de the behemont y tambien a todas las personas especialmente a los que buscan un rpg mundo abierto con comedia , yo le doy un 9.5/10 un 9.5 porque me ha dado algunos errores pero es porque q esta en early acces , bueno que esperen COMPRENSE ESTE MARAVILLOSO JUEGO",

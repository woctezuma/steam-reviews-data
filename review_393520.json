Not only that but they sometimes get a little preachy (I won't spoil what but there's a lot of tumblr-isms) which can get tiring after a while.\n\nThank god that cutscenes are like 1% of the game, and the rest 99% is absolute gold. The movement and the combat blend perfecty with eachother and both can be augmented with different tweaks that you have to find and craft which in turn give you access to more parts of the game. Granted this is all optional but good luck getting through some of the boss fights without them.\n\nOverall this game has outstanding gameplay but there are a lot of issues with the story.

With that said, I have a confession to make here, and it really hurts me to have to say this because fans of mine will know that I always finish games before I write my reviews on them, but Iconoclasts, I don\u2019t know if I can finish this game, I\u2019m legitimately bored to tears here. I had a stream open where I was watching a guy play Fire Emblem and I thought that was more entertaining than playing this game. I\u2019d be happy to go into more detail on that, just let me know in the comments, some really interesting tactics were put into action.\n\nDo not for a second listen to anyone that describes Iconoclasts as a Metroidvania, because it\u2019s more like Cave Story in the sense that it\u2019s linear with chances for some very limited exploration, like that part where you have to collect all the dogs in the desert area (maybe it was cats). Now here\u2019s where we run into one of our issues with Iconoclasts: there isn\u2019t much there. Cave Story had health and missile upgrades that you could find as well as a variety of hidden items and weapons. In other words, if you went off the beaten path you would be rewarded. In Iconoclasts, the reward for every single optional challenge that I\u2019ve found so far is one of four different types of ore. What do you do with the ore? I\u2019m glad you asked, what happens is that you go to a workbench and trade in a certain combination of these ores and receive a \u201ctweak\u201d which you can equip into one of your \u201ctweak slots\u201d. Tweaks are minor upgrades, such as being able to stay underwater for longer or being able to take an extra hit. If you take damage, your right-most tweak slot will break; you start with three so if you take three consecutive hits your tweaks will be useless until you can collect special orbs by breaking statues (even healing at a save point doesn\u2019t restore your tweaks). This is the only form of optional content in the game that I\u2019ve encountered so far, is opening the chests and getting tweak materials that you won\u2019t even end up spending because you have so many and none of the tweaks sound that interesting. What this means is that there\u2019s very little motivation to do anything other than go exactly where the game tells you to go. Even if there were other types of optional rewards I\u2019m not really sure what they could be, because, outside of boss fights, the game tends to focus more on platforming- and timing-based puzzles (which I\u2019d like to add tend towards being tedious/boring more than anything else, now that I think about it I should probably focus on how boring doing the puzzles is but man the system with the tweaks really pisses me off) than combat; even on the hardest difficulty available when you start the game, enemies are fairly sparse and save points are so close together that health upgrades would be completely unnecessary. This is probably an identity issue more than anything else; Iconoclasts isn\u2019t sure what it wants to be.\n\nWhile the general pattern of gameplay is to run through however many puzzle rooms, maybe backtrack a bit in the process (very tedious), and then encounter a boss, Iconoclasts tries really hard to be a \u201cnarrative game\u201d. There are, to put it nicely, way too many cutscenes and general gameplay interruptions in Iconoclasts. This might not be a problem if the writing was good or the story was interesting, but no, both are complete dogshit. The writing is incredibly cliched, and while the game tries to take itself seriously it just comes off as super ham-fisted because it\u2019s impossible to see Iconoclasts as anything but a video game. The environments themselves are very video game-y, with levers and doors and locks and keys everywhere, there\u2019s no attempt to try to make things fit into the context of the game world. The village that your character lives in, in classic JRPG fashion, appears to have a grand total of 5 or 6 residents. When you\u2019re given directions, the characters don\u2019t say \u201cWest\u201d or \u201cEast\u201d, they say \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d, like \u201cgo right of your house to reach the village\u201d. I can\u2019t believe that this setting exists, and as a result I can\u2019t bring myself to care about anything that\u2019s happening in it. The plot itself, I was going to try to describe it in a way that made it sound stupid, but it\u2019s literally just about intolerance. It really isn\u2019t subtle at all, there\u2019s a big evil religion that controls everything and you know what who cares, it isn\u2019t interesting, it isn\u2019t believable, it\u2019s communicated entirely through clich\u00e9s, the plot of this game isn\u2019t worth thinking about other than to wonder about why you have to waste so much time mashing through text boxes.\n\nIconoclasts looks nice but that\u2019s it, it\u2019s a one-trick pony, all style zero substance. Fighting the bosses isn\u2019t bad but so much of the game is spent doing other, much more boring things. Also, the game is probably like 8-9 hours long. Hey, that\u2019s reminding me of another game that I played recently, hmmm, that\u2019s right, it\u2019s No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle, developed by Grasshopper Manufacture for the Nintendo Wii and released in 2010! But wait, NMH2 is a good game, how could that be? Well, dear reader, that\u2019s because NMH2 knows what it wants to be, you run at enemies, mash buttons, and eventually you fight a boss. Is the game filled with long cutscenes, is there even that much of a plot? Of course not, but even with how minimal the story is, you still get a sense of what the game is trying to do. NMH2 also had an entire team of devs working on it, so the risk of getting sidetracked from the primary goal was comparatively low. Iconoclasts, what is it, who is it for? It\u2019s got Contra-esque bosses, but it also has a lot of platforming puzzles. It looks like it might be a Metroidvania, with the map and all, but it isn\u2019t really? And it\u2019s still trying to have a really heavy and impactful story despite the fact that implementing something like that clearly isn\u2019t the dev\u2019s forte? Ultimately, Iconoclasts is a lesson on why we need other people in our lives; they give us value, they give us meaning, and they prevent us from cluttering up our Cave Story fangames with puzzles and terrible writing.\n\nTaster\u2019s score: C-\n", "timestamp_created": 1516887945, "timestamp_updated": 1516887945, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.447679", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39605237": {"recommendationid": "39605237", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988065337", "num_games_owned": 753, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "last_played": 1516885145}, "language": "english", "review": "Man, this was worth the wait.

It's a shining example of simple game design, executed amazingly well, created by a truly humble designer, Konjak. It's not perfect, but oddly that kind of coincides wonderfully with the overall theme of the game...\n\nThe gameplay itself is absolutely delicious. Motion is tight, responsive and goes at just the right speed to make traversal through the beautiful world rarely seem tedious. The stomp attacks and wrench grabbing have a little bit of homing on them, and generous hit boxes so as to allow the player to never really slow down. Think Metroid run speed with Megaman air control. Not only that you can increase this speed, making Iconoclasts a viable speed run game.\n\nCombat is simple to execute, and bosses are fun and unique for the most part, save for one or two slightly frustrating set pieces. Konjak made a point to try and make all boss fights somewhat unique, and while in rare cases this makes some feel like a slog as you're trying to work out what to do, they all shine in one way or another. The other great thing is that it's clearly shown the moment they switch gears. Under their health bar is sometimes a selection of crystals, giving you an inkling of how many times this boss will switch tactics and a good idea of the time it will take. It's a simple yet very nice addition that I appreciate after loving Cuphead's progress meter after every death. It's also nice that the game does not subscribe to the 'hard game' trope that is often used to bloat an otherwise short game. It knows exactly what it wants to be without pandering to hardcore gamers.\n\nWhere this game really shines is its presentation. There are no voice actors present, and the game is dialogue heavy. However, the design, the beautiful animations, the actual thought put into how emotion is portrayed through text effects and the flow of it all really showcases the care Konjak had for the narrative. Each character is as flawed as eachother, [spoiler]including the main character Robin, who essentially by the end of the game is somewhat selfishly doing what she wants to do, rebelling against a world that tells her she can't do everything. Indeed her trying to do everything is sometimes the catayst for alot of misery, and even when saving the world, it was almost less about saving anything than to show her traumatised older brother that she doesn't need his protection, amking the whole end sequence almost a violent temper tantrum[/spoiler]. It really hammers home the weakness of humanity, how even the powerful are nothing more than human, and how we all find comfort in one thing or another, be it faith, family or even fear.\n\nStill, as stated, it's not perfect. My main gripes have been miniscule at best, but still memorable as flaws. Some bosses are a tad obtuse, often several minutes spent trying to work out the path forward. Some people would probably work it out quicker than others, but there's an inconsistency to the help you get, like in some cases a partner in a boss fight will hint at you the way forward, but on other bosses they stay silent. While this is not too bad, being predisposed to getting hints can make some boss sequences a folly of trying to work out the correct bunch of powers or the right sequence. Once the gears start turning again however, they go down quickly and don't ever repeat the mistake. \n\nAnother problem, again with the odd boss, is that there is A LOT going on. You can get lost in the mish mash characters as everyone explodes their flashy animations everywhere or dialogue attempts to distract you. It's rare, but it feels a little sloppy. When done correctly though, it's a visual feast.\n\nMy final gripe is that some heavily scripted moments can break, meaning that the game soft locks. I feel a quick restart function like in old Playstation RPGs would really help keep the pace going fast. Thankfully the game has some generous checkpoints and many save points so you never feel too overwhelmed. \n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic narrative driven action platformer that delivers a near perfect experience. Fascinating, funny, equal parts heart warming and heart wrenching and polished to a mirror sheen, this game being worth the wait is a pretty huge understatement.\n\nGet it, be inspired.", "timestamp_created": 1516880455, "timestamp_updated": 1516880455, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505230", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39601144": {"recommendationid": "39601144", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989433135", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 724, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 724, "last_played": 1516825029}, "language": "english", "review": "i'm ~35% in this game on Hard and find it to be pretty boring.

While it may have the appearance of being well produced, it's hard to not feel that those efforts lie almost entirely in surface level aspects. Iconoclasts is a game that has somewhat satisfying movement, cool effects ,etc, and deserves notice for such, but this is about as far as my praise will go.\n\nIt's difficult to be concise about the problems Iconoclasts is plagued with as there is such a huge variance between them. Iconoclasts feels like a game that underwent many iterations, and instead of confidently embracing one, a messy cluster was settled upon instead. Part shooter, part puzzle, part platformer, part brooding drama, Iconoclasts fails to elegantly combine these aspects and instead presents a game where none of these aspects shine.\n\nA majority of the gameplay in Iconoclasts is puzzles. While maybe not the focus of how this game is marketed, a primary chunk of time spent within the gameplay loop will be messing with switch puzzles of varying complexity. Every upgrade, 6 hours into the game at least, functions first and foremost as a new means of solving a switch puzzle. A problem with this, is that these puzzles don't combine new elements in a compelling or interesting way. Getting an electricity attachment for the grenade launcher doesn't mean that you solve problems in a new way, it just means that you have a new type of switch you can shoot. This alone isn't egregious, but to be frank it's pretty boring. Where Iconoclasts transcends from boring to annoying is the fusion of these elements with the combat and platforming sections. It is very often in Iconoclasts where a puzzle is made \"more difficult\" by having an enemy, or a bed of thorns placed to punish failure. These additions never make a puzzle more interesting, it frankly just makes them fucking annoying to deal with, especially given that the rewards for the optional puzzles are almost never worth it (see tweaks later). There is also a very frequent issue with the puzzles in this game where the primary source of difficulty is from elements being communicated poorly to the player. I haven't once yet had the ever sought after \"A-ha!\" moment from the puzzles in this game. Puzzles made me familiar with \"well that was bullshit\" more than anything else. On a related note, the mini map has outright lied about whether I can access rooms from above or below, making some of the exploration based puzzles terrible to experience (The Tower, notably. Rooms that need to be accessed from below saying they can be accessed from above, etc etc)\n\nThe pace at which you're given new gear & upgrades is disappointingly slow, especially given how little they actually change gameplay (as mentioned above). The lack of movement options makes platforming and exploration a total slog. It feels as if Iconoclasts is afraid to give players any movement options (I could be wrong given that I haven't completed the game) for fear of puzzles not being solved in the intended way.\n\nCombat is a total bore, as most engagements are won by sitting and waiting to spam attacks, or using the exact same strategies over and over. Enemies aren't used in interesting and new contexts, they serve exclusively as annoying roadblocks to pad out game time.\n\nBoss fights suffer the same communicative issues as puzzles mentioned earlier. I've had cases of bosses giving off explosions particles on hit, only to later learn that I wasn't damaging them at all. Boss fights are also very willing to throw in new mechanics at irelevant times, like spamming you with notifications that Mina has a shotgun when it isn't immediately relevant.\n\nTweaks as a system are baffling and annoying. They're not important enough to have any weight on your completion of the game, but they feel as if they exist to curb mechanical intrusions. The tweak to charge your electric wrench is a perfect example. Without the tweak on, a full wrench spin is about 1 tick too short of charging the wrench. It completes in one spin with the right tweak though. Getting the spin duration up tweak isn't a fun or meaningful change to my character. It feels like a feature that should've just been there already. Additionally, some of the most desirable tweaks are heavily gated for no discernable reason, such as \"run speed up\". It almost feels like the game doesn't want me to have fun at times.\n\nMost egregious of these all is the writing. To be frank, the writing is pretty insufferable in this game. While the moment to moment banter is alright, the game will constantly derail itself as often as possible to exposition dump uninteresting lore and racial/cultural drama. I don't think I'm the only one so tired of seeing racial allegories being slapped on to titles so that we can pretend characters are more multi-faceted than they are. The racial and cultural tensions feel wildly insincere and half-assed. It's gotten to the point where I want to skip a cutscene if I see Mina talking. The writing feels more focused on angsty shouting and squabbling instead of any ideological confrontation. It feels almost patronizing how unspecific this drama is. If you do decide to play Iconoclasts, my sincere advice is to literally skip every dialogue scene as fast as possible. The drama presented in Iconoclasts is mostly a vehicle to push the plot. It is woefully non-concise, insincere, and worst of all boring.\n\nDespite being what a lot of people probably believe to be considerably harsh, I look forward to seeing more projects from this developer. I'm not usually one for this phrase, but Iconoclasts is loaded with \"potential\". The bottom line is that in it's current iteration, it feels \"undercooked\".", "timestamp_created": 1516852782, "timestamp_updated": 1516852782, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598886", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39596162": {"recommendationid": "39596162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011746963", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 731, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 736, "last_played": 1516825690}, "language": "english", "review": "Superbly polished gameplay, incredibly high-quality pixelart and animations, great humor, and a well-paced and interesting (if at times thematically muddy) narrative.

You'll definitely get your money's worth.\n\nJust can't recommend it enough.", "timestamp_created": 1516798628, "timestamp_updated": 1516799592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39579414": {"recommendationid": "39579414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006165906", "num_games_owned": 372, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 89, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 89, "last_played": 1516793475}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0443 7-8 \u043b\u0435\u0442. \u0415\u0449\u0435 \u0432 2012\u043c \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0432, \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u043c\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432, \u044f \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d. \u041d\u043e \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0432, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438 \u0432\u044b\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043c, \u0443\u0434\u0438\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430.\n\n\u0421\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0441\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c.\n\u0412 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \"\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\" \u0441 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0437\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c.\n\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0431\u043e Joakim Sandberg \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0448\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0440! \n\u042f \u0443\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0443 \u0435\u0449\u0435 2015 \u0430 \u0442\u044b \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0433! \u0412\u0430\u0443!\n\n\u041d\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0442\u0435\u043c, \u043a\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0438\u0442 \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440 \"\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0434\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439\" (\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0442\u044b \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u044b\u043b \u043b\u043e\u043b)\n\u0410 \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0442\u0435\u043c \u0443 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u0436 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e \u0441 \u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c, \u043d\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0444\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 (\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044f\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044e\u0442, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430)", "timestamp_created": 1516795230, "timestamp_updated": 1516795230, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528639", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39579408": {"recommendationid": "39579408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001273308", "num_games_owned": 377, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 644, "last_played": 1516790841}, "language": "english", "review": "Look upon this game and tremble.

Blueprints for new accessories, and the materials needed to craft them.  This game allows you to equip up to 3 'tweaks' at a time, but in order to get these, you'll need to find the blueprints and materials, which are often hidden in boxes in out-of-the-way areas, sometimes requiring some platforming or light/medium environmental puzzling to reach.  No grinding for materials by killing enemies, as all of them are found via exploration.  The more you explore, the more types of tweaks you'll be able to craft, and the less selective you'll have to be with which ones you decide to make.\n\nThe difficulty seems pretty mild during the 3 hours I've put in so far, but has been ramping up at a gradual rate to where I'm starting to feel challenged at times, so I think it's probably fine.  There is also a 'harder' mode availible from the start, which might be more ideal for those looking for a tougher game from the start. \n\nThe lore and story of this game have been interesting to pay attention to so far.  The characters are also great, each with their own personalities, motivations, and backstory.  There has been some genuinely funny writing, too.. There are quips, sarcasm, blunders, and even a little bit of mild 4th-wall-breaking, which for me are always appropriate and never too over-the-top, and just enough to give the characters some extra pizazz, and a serious-but-not-too-serious vibe that I have been enjoying.\n\nThe graphics look great, of course.  You can tell that much from the screenshots and videos here on the store.  Unless you have a problem with sprites and pixel-art, you'll enjoy the quality of the drawing and animation.  Every inch of this game oozes life and atmosphere.  The music is catchy and pleasing to hear.  The sound effects are perfect, suiting the style of the game just fine and sounding great.  \n\nIn my opinion, this is the best game to come out so far in the month of January 2018.  Well-worth the money.  If you've been looking for something to play, and if this looks good to you, then I say go for it.  Quality through the roof, top-notch indie game.  I'm glad Joakim finished this game.

Its development alone, the hobby project of one man spanning a gestation period of half a decade, showed the world that one person, with a singular vision and a self-motivated drive to express themselves through the melding of both the sciences and the arts and a window roughly 640 pixels wide and 480 pixels high, could create a new, personal style of game that rivaled, and in many ways surpassed the experiences handed to us from the Nintendos and Segas of the heyday. This Metroidvania -- a portmanteau which owes its very existence to this masterwork of code, pixels, and FM synths -- would spark the powerkeg that would kick off the independent revolution.\n\nIt was amongst this backdrop that I, a starry eyed youngboy with a copy of Multimedia Fusion and a devil may care attitude would take aim to the skies and shoot down the albatross that would hang around my neck for decades. It was around this time that I began work on The Underside.\n\nFor a decade prior to this big mistake, I had been part of one of the lesser tribes of the proto-indie games community, the Click Community. Under the label \"Fallen Angel Industries,\" I had worked alongside a few rabblerousers, one of which was a quiet swede who at the time was going by the name ZeroTau. His big project, his Moby Dick in this convoluted and barely cohesive string of nautical fiction references was a Monster World IV inspired platformer called \"Mina of the Pirates,\" a swashbuckling adventure that starred the titular (or was it eponymous) heroine, Mina, who indeed was a pirate.\n\nYears passed, the Click Community faded into obscurity, a few of its graduating members moving onto become indie games figureheads. Mina of the Pirates -- the game that had captured the hearts of the young boys and girls that had devoted their precious dial-up bits to arguing over bad South Park fangames and whether or not Derek Yu's Eternal Daughter was actually good or not (turns out it was, but I had not yet developed a discerning eye in my teenaged years) -- was nowhere to be seen. The name \"ZeroTau\" was scarcely seen without a dangling \"Mina\" modifier, and as weeks became months, and months became years, and the albatross grew heavier and heavier still. Perhaps it was the weight of the expectation coupled with Multimedia Fusion's finnicky toolset that finally did it, but Mina was canceled and as the game he had worked on for years faded in the public's consciousness, so too did the name ZeroTau. (I may of course be playing it fast and loose with the events of history for the sake of creating poetic flow.)\n\nI know this feeling all too  well. I grew up creating games alongside ZeroTau, who now goes by the name Konjak. I too had that albatross project, for his Mina of the Pirates, I had my own The Underside. What began as a 16x16 box moving around the screen and shooting other 16x16 boxes with smaller, 8x8 boxes would eventually grow up to be the single game that defined my existence. Every new image I'd put out of the game would be passed around the dark corners of the internet like some weird pre-internet pornography. It's true, I once had the gall to end a 30 minute demo of the game with the words \"coming soon\" -- a phrase that would become a recurring punch in my career as a indie games developer.\n\nJust as shooting that albatross would become the catalyst that would strand the ship of the ancient mariner at sea, The Underside, Mina of the Pirates, and yes, even Iconoclasts, the very game I set out to write about but have until this point failed to mention by name even once, all found themselves in development limbo, and their fans, the crew of the ship, once working together to steer the ship towards land found themselves veering off course and inadvertantly becoming agents of pressure and torment. In the poem, the other members of the crew end up succumbing to the sea left feeling nothing but emnity towards the mariner, shaping the mariner into the type of crazed old man who takes a perfectly happy wedding guest passerby and unpromptedly drops this sort of story on him.\n\nWhich is why it's an imperative that you play The Iconoclasts. This is to say nothing about how it looks or plays -- neither of these things should be a surprise to you if you've ever played Noitu Love or Legend of Princess, or if you have any sort of fond memories of the off-kilter, bouncy, kinetic feel of old Treasure games like Gunstar Legends or Mischief Makers. You can feel Konjak's poured his soul into every inch of the game, from the incredibly hand pixeled opening animation, to the little visual flourishes like the bouncy save confirmation prompt (yes, the save confirmation prompt in this game somehow manages to exude more charm than most games have in their best moments)\n\nInstead, Iconoclasts is a game that exists in spite of its legacy -- you can, at times, feel a bit of Konjak in the story as Robin, a quiet mechanic with a very big tool quiety fights back against the One Concern, a legion of faceless fascists who publicly decry, but secretly kind of rely on Robin's skills as a mechanic. And not to beat a beat a dead horse with a big wrench, but to see Konjak finally release this thing, to kill Moby Dick and to take off that dumb bird necktie he's been lugging around for over a decade, well, it leaves THIS ol' grizzled mariner feeling a bit overstunned (a wonderful turn of phrase I hope I'll be seeing a lot more in the coming years)\n\nAnyways, I hope you enjoyed my review of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, it's certainly worth a read if you haven't already encountered it in your high school English classes.", "timestamp_created": 1516742146, "timestamp_updated": 1516758296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 30, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696509", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39566667": {"recommendationid": "39566667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099954891", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 735, "last_played": 1516900459}, "language": "polish", "review": "[h1]Czy 10 lat developingu poz\u0142o na marne?[/h1]\n\nIconoclasts jest to gra kt\u00f3ra powstawa\u0142a blisko dekad\u0119,czy to oznacza \u017ce jest arcydzie\u0142em?

Every inch of this game is dripping with style, from the charming character sprites to the utterly gorgeous environment art- there isn't a section of the screen that isn't a joy to look at. The animation doesn't hold anything back either, and all that gorgeous pixel art looks great in motion.\n\nThe music is pretty good- and fits each area/boss really well. I haven't run into any songs that specifically stand out, but in general they've all set the tone really well.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect from a quality metroidvania- you can jump, you can shoot, you can hit things with your giant wrench, and there's a whole bag of tricks to unlock throughout the game. Iconoclasts doesn't focus on combat as much as you'd expect, and apart from using enemies as mobile obstacles, for the most part running around in the world is more focused on puzzles & platforming challenges- at least early on. Which is actually kinda refreshing. Enemies also don't respawn often, so you aren't forced to re-fight everything while backtracking around puzzles.\n\nFollowing that trend, the bosses are also more puzzle than fight in a lot of ways, and I spend more of my time trying to figure out how to exploit/reveal their weaknesses than plinking away at a massive healthbar. Each boss also completely unique so far, and have all been fascinating to fight.\n\nYou also get companion characters! Though they're plot limited so far, and generally only stick around for a bit, they're kinda fun to work with when taking down bosses- which is something I haven't really seen in this genre before.\n\nLastly, and almost most notably- this game's writing is really solid. Iconoclasts is set in an extremely broken world governed by a regressive, tyrannical religion that seems determined to keep everyone in the stone age. Almost immediately you're introduced to a handful of colorful (or not so colorful) characters, who paint a fairly vivid picture of the state of things. It's kind of crazy how stark of a contrast it is against the bright and cheery visuals, but it works really well. Despite that, there are still a large number of jokey moments that were absolutely hilarious, and caught me completely by surprise.\n\nOverall, Iconoclasts is already one of the best games of 2018, and I doubt that opinion will change as I play through the rest of the game.

Lo hemos podido ver con Eric Barone y su excelente Stardew Valley, y, desde ya, os aseguro que Joakim Sandberg es otro de estos peque\u00f1os grandes artistas, su obra Iconoclasts, as\u00ed lo va a demostrar en las semanas y meses venideros. Puesto que tras 7 a\u00f1os de duro trabajo, se nota que aqu\u00ed hay calidad y aut\u00e9ntica pasi\u00f3n por el mundo del videojuego.\n\nPero antes de nada, pong\u00e1monos en situaci\u00f3n. Somos Alondra, una mec\u00e1nica en un mundo gobernado por una sociedad religiosa en la que el uso de la maquinaria y el combustible que las hacen funcionar, el Marf\u00edl, est\u00e1n estrictamente regulados por ellos, quienes dicen representar al dios al que todo el mundo teme, pues los pecados se pagan caros con la llamada Penitencia. As\u00ed pues, Alondra como mec\u00e1nica debe medir cuidadosamente sus pasos si no quiere terminar en el punto de mira de esta organizaci\u00f3n que controla todo, o casi todo... Sin embargo, la aventura comienza con un acontecimiento que desencadenar\u00e1 una serie de sucesos que cambiar\u00e1n la vida de Alondra y la de su planeta al completo para siempre. Y hasta aqu\u00ed puedo decir, de verdad, a nivel argumental el juego me ha sorprendido much\u00edsimo, es tal la profundidad que tiene en cuanto a lore que es algo que para nada uno se espera en este tipo de juegos.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278882655\n\nVamos a conocer a much\u00edsimos personajes muy interesante a lo largo de la aventura, tanto enemigos como aliados, cada uno de ellos con una personalidad y una \u00e9pica arrolladoras, por momentos incluso vais a creer que est\u00e1is en un jrpg dada la cantidad y calidad de los di\u00e1logos. Es una trama que no solo se sigue con much\u00edsimo inter\u00e9s, si no que adem\u00e1s saber combinar con maestr\u00eda momentos de humor, drama o acci\u00f3n. Y a la que solo se me ocurre una palabra para describirla; Sublime.\n\nEn cuanto a la jugabilidad, que es otro elemento important\u00edsimo en esta clase de videojuegos, tranquilos, est\u00e1 a la altura de los mejores plataformas y/o metroidvanias que se os puedan venir a la cabeza. El control es perfecto, y las animaciones r\u00e1pidas, los saltos los puedes ajustar al milimetro y tenemos una amplia gama de movimientos, desde saltar, agacharnos, reptar, engancharnos a los bordes... Nada se echa en falta cuando juegas a Iconoclast ni tampoco sientes que nada sea mejorable en ning\u00fan momento, de nuevo se vuelve a notar que su creador ha aprovechado mucho esos 7 a\u00f1os que le ha llevado crear esta maravilla virtual.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278883916\n\nEl desarrollo del juego es una mezcla entre metroidvania y juego de plataformas, pues a principio avanzamos por zonas mientras dejamos otras atr\u00e1s, no obstante llegados a cierto punto podremos regresar libremente a todas las ya visitadas, dando como resultado un enorme mapeado coherentemente interconectado. No en vano contaremos con el t\u00edpico minimapa donde ver las habitaciones estructuradas en cuadraditos, por tanto, la exploraci\u00f3n es fundamental para descubrir secretos. \n\nEn los escenarios nos iremos encontrando enemigos a los que despacharemos con nuestra pistola aturdidora o bien a golpes cuerpo a cuerpo con nuestra fiel llave inglesa, que adem\u00e1s \u00e9sta nos ser\u00e1 \u00fatil para resolver ciertos \"puzles\" que encontraremos, los cuales siempre se combinar\u00e1n siempre con plataformas, dando como resultado un gameplay que en ning\u00fan momento se torna mon\u00f3tono. Por supuesto conforme avancemos iremos obteniendo ciertos objetos que nos brindar\u00e1n nuevas habilidades, al tiempo que nos permiten acceder a zonas previamente inaccesibles. Y adem\u00e1s, podremos craftear ciertas mejoras que nos otorgar\u00e1n m\u00e1s salud o mayor velocidad de movimiento etc. Por lo que esto \u00faltimo es otra capa m\u00e1s de profundidad en la jugabilidad.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1278883413\n\nPor si fuera poco, el juego nos ir\u00e1 sorprendiendo a cada paso con peque\u00f1as mec\u00e1nicas que rompen por completo con la f\u00f3rmula habitual de plataformeo etc. Por ejemplo, lo mismo estamos escapando de unos guardias con sigilo, que participando en un minijuego que simula el tres en ralla, por poner dos ejemplos. Y lo m\u00e1s incre\u00edble que es nada est\u00e1 metido con calzador, todo tiene su por qu\u00e9 a nivel argumental. \n\nLos jefes finales, que por cierto hay m\u00e1s de 20, merecen una menci\u00f3n a parte. El primero, muy simple, s\u00ed, solo es el tutorial... El resto, a cu\u00e1l m\u00e1s original que el anterior, sinceramente, una sorpresa tras otra. Cada uno con sus mec\u00e1nicas propias y bastante desafiantes (sin llegar a frustrar). No hay ni un solo enfrentamiento que m\u00ednimamente se parezca a otro, y eso en un juego con tantos jefes finales es todo un logro, os lo aseguro. Hablar de los enfrentamientos es hacer spoilers, porque de verdad, derrochan originalidad por los cuatro costados y est\u00e1n tan ligados a la propia trama del juego que es mejor no decir nada m\u00e1s. Tan solo recomendaros tirar por el modo dif\u00edcil, ya que ser\u00e1 una experiencia m\u00e1s satisfactoria, puesto que en este modo los jefes finales cuentan con m\u00e1s ataques y son mucho m\u00e1s divertidos.\n\nPara terminar, el apartado gr\u00e1fico y sonoro, decir que est\u00e1n a la altura del resto del programa. Cuenta con unas animaciones exquisitas, los personajes muestran muy bien sus emociones con ese pixel art tan bueno que tiene Iconoclast (mucho mejor in-game que en las im\u00e1genes, ya os lo digo) y la banda sonora es buen\u00edsima, con temas muy variados que mezclan sonidos retro con toques modernos muy bien medidos. Las canciones se nos quedar\u00e1n grabadas en nuestra cabeza sin darnos cuenta. Lo que es una se\u00f1al inequivoca de que tiene gran calidad. Y por cierto, el juego est\u00e1 perfectamente traducido al espa\u00f1ol,adem\u00e1s de contar con una duraci\u00f3n generosa de entre 12 y 15 horas.\n\n[h1]An\u00e1lisis completo[/h1] http://www.mediavida.com/foro/juegos/analisis-de-iconoclasts-602247", "timestamp_created": 1516707388, "timestamp_updated": 1516731786, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.669670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39554781": {"recommendationid": "39554781", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043816722", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 665, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 665, "last_played": 1516799928}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc640! \uba54\ud2b8\ub85c\ubca0\ub2c8\uc544!  \ud0d0\ud5d8\uc694\uc18c! \uc65c \ub09c \uc774\ub7f0\uac8c\uc784\ub9cc \ubcf4\uba74 \ud765\ubd84\uc744 \uac10\ucd9c\uc218\uac00 \uc5c6\uc744\uae4c \u314b\u314b\n\uc870\uc791\uac10 \uad1c\ucc2e\uace0 \ubcf4\uc2a4 \uc801\ub2f9\ud788 \uadc0\ucc2e\uace0 \ud37c\uc990 \ub108\ubb34 \uc7ac\ubbf8\uc788\uace0 \ub9d8\uc5d0\ub4ed\ub2c8\ub2e4", "timestamp_created": 1516707372, "timestamp_updated": 1516707422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39554778": {"recommendationid": "39554778", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045411400", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 41, "last_played": 1516797575}, "language": "english", "review": "[Full review pending, will be posted at a later date.]\n\nThis game is the near decade long passion project of one incredible human being known as Joakim Sandberg.\n\nI have played this game for just over half an hour, highly recommended on that alone.\n\nWatch this person, they are a force to be reckoned with, appreciate their work while you have the chance.\n\nIconoclasts is a 2D, incredibly detailed, fluidly animated, action platformer. It has actual DS4/PS4 controller support and every move in the first half hour delivers responsive, satisfying, audio/visual feedback. Sharp sound effects and lively animation punctuate every action. Moving in this videogame feels great, exercising your toolkit (wrench, gun, movement) consistently delivers in combat as well against environmental hazards. The world and its inhabitants look, sound, and are characters of intrigue. The writing is straight to the point while bein' witty and the introduction wastes none of your time. The HUD is snappy and delivers extra charm to tha game in its presentation.  I get a sense of nostalgia, but one which states the past still has unrealized potential bein' finally realized right 'ere, raight nao. I hafta play the whole game first, but this is highly favorable material right off the bat, I see that much potential in it.

Thank you Joakim, for the intro to your videogame alone, Love & Respect! :D\n\nJus' a heads up, do not buy this game on my recommendation alone at this time, as I'd like to release a more realized and experienced review in the future. This tentative placeholder is just a reminder to do so at some point. I did my research and so far, have had my expectations exceptionally exceeded. Still keep an eye on Joakim, but put in the work to see if this game is for you. If you want a beautiful action platformer with a strong personality and no nonsense introduction in terms of the first half hour, look no further.

Not to mention the writting is surprisingly funny! [Mild Spoilers] I just snuck past the guards after breaking out of jail. The converstaion the guards were having made me laugh hard enough that I kept intentionally failing the scene just to read through it again! \n\nI'm also really liking the world lore. Very unique! I like how the game doesn't just dump a bunch of info on you. Instead, it lets the world unfold in various conversations. \n\nIf anyone out there is on the fence about this, pick it up, give it a try. I know $20 is often seen as high for an indie game, but this game is worth it.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nA bit further in, the game is still funny. So far the only things I can critic is that the game is far too easy, even on the harder difficulty and, this is a personal preference, but I'm not a fan how the game is divided into little sub stages. I wish it was a big open world. It sucks how you hit a story point and then get dragged into the next area.

Such a fantastic addition to my didgital library.\n\nTrust me, I don't write many reviews on Steam unless it really makes an impression on me.\nI love the fact that this game was made by one man alone and took many many years of blood sweat and tears of dedication. I for one will always consider Joakim Sandberg a legend in modern retro style developers. \n\nPlease, anyone that took the time to read this long post....go show support to an Indie developer who wants to bring us nothing but the highest quality.\n\nWho knows, with enough sales, maybe he can expand his team to bring us even more super polished and high quality titles in the future.! \n\nKeep It Retro - SocialGamer", "timestamp_created": 1516910391, "timestamp_updated": 1516910391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39613636": {"recommendationid": "39613636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047490755", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 747, "last_played": 1516854686}, "language": "english", "review": "Finished the story line in 12 hours.

I played through a level, thanked the presenter, and walked away thinking that I was interested in the game, but that it seemed like it'd be too easy and have too basic of level design, but that it looked really nice.\n\nBoy, I couldn't have been more wrong. Not only is the game  perfectly balanced and challenging in Harder mode, but the level design throughout the entire game is incredibly thoughtful and thought provoking. That's awesome alone, but there's actually also the most compelling story, world, and characters present in any 2D platformy-type game I've ever played. I think the biggest asset Iconoclasts has actually is not the gameplay (but the gameplay is awesome), but the cohesion of the entire world, the characters, its art style and its music. It all fits together so flawlessly that every time I played, I was entirely immersed in the world and the story, which is something I don't get from many games like this one any more. The characters in my party were my friends, and I felt every emotional blow done to them and every victory we achieved just as they did. The villains were expertly portrayed as well, as I had sympathy for them at the same time as wanting desperately to defeat them or escape from them. They also have some excellent character themes, which I'm a sucker for.\n\nIconoclasts is a masterclass of storytelling in the metroidvania genre (It's important to mention that Iconoclasts is more linear than you'd expect from a Metroidvania, so make sure you have that expectation), with an incredible attention paid to level design and gameplay as well as its beautiful art style and soundtrack. The only drawback I can think of is that I felt like it got a bit too wordy towards the end, but even still I think that's more of a personal thing than an actual (incredibly minor) issue. Buy this game. Play this game. I'll be coming back to it for 100% and even another play through because there's so much to see; What an adventure. There's no doubt in my mind that this'll be high on my list (if not #1) when it comes to game of the year.", "timestamp_created": 1516908526, "timestamp_updated": 1516909634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39613133": {"recommendationid": "39613133", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023367384", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 806, "last_played": 1516895872}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, before I explain why I do not recommand this game, I will make this one perfectly clear.\nThe game isn't terrible, but It's not great either.\n\nThere are some good moments in the game but there are many issues (Not game breaking issue, but rather something that detracts fun).\n\nStructure- So the game is utilized the Metroidvania template. So you do have the map, and you do get to do some backtracking and everything. However, one of the great aspects about Metroid like structure is that you as a player wonders around the level and figure something out and then you learned something more about the game. \"curiosity\" is the keyword here. Because why explore when we already know what's in the environment? Now one problem with this game is that There is nothing to \"explore\". Yes, you do investigate the area to trigger the character dialogues to progress the main quest. But I don't really consider that as an \"exploration\". It just looks more of you moving to map to map until you find certain cinematic check point. Besides that you do have optional treasure chest to open, which you will be able to unlock \"tweak\" which is pretty much another word for \"tool upgrades\". These upgrades are pretty minor stuff that doesn't affect gameplay all that much. So in the end, you might as well just play the story part. not the other optional contents. Because those are not worth while contents. \n\nStory, Narrative, and Drama - Speaking of dialogues, Yes this game has a lot of dialogues. It's pretty much reminds me of Owl Boy. So from my understanding, the game is trying to be more of narrative based Metroidvania. Which I can understand that the game is about finding \"trigger cutscene\" around the map only if the game had actual interesting story or anything. But unfortunately, I don't find story was all that engaging. The writing in the game seems all over the place. While the character personality was pretty clear to me, but many character motivation or anything else seems confusing and flat out non sensical. So even the story here is not the strength of the game. It's rather weakness in the game. \n\nMusic - Alright for the most part. None of them was all that memorable. So I have no strong opinion about that.\n\nCombat and gameplay - This is probably the what game sorta best at it. But at the same time, it was pretty mixed bag for me. So majority of the game plays out like solve switch puzzle to find keys and figure out enemy weakness and counter attack them. Kinda like Zelda, Shantae, Owlboy. The thing is some of the bosses or some puzzles does expand little more than \"Oh switch this and that\" or \"I have to use this gun hit boss's weakness to stun em\". But majority of them are kinda like that. and after certain points in the game where the game is looks like to be an end game, the game starts to become more like walking to the certain linear levels to just fight bosses and this end game part has stretched out pacing. Which can be very exhausting... So even majority of the content here isn't all that well put together. It's just all over the place.\n\nIn other words, this game is just like Owlboy..\nPretty art, charming characters, and detailed animation. But the game itself is pretty shallow. and really, you are not exploring the area. You are just finding the cinematic cutscene.\n\nIf you want to play decent Metroidvania, you can't go wrong with this game.\nBecause as a game, It's not really broken game that you can't enjoy.\nThe game in general is okay to play.\n\nBut If I have to recommand other Metroidvania game...\nYou can either try Ori & Blind Forest or Hollow Knight\nThese two are usually my best Metroidvania up to date IMO.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516908375, "timestamp_updated": 1516908375, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471014", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39612473": {"recommendationid": "39612473", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042404396", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 790, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 790, "last_played": 1516906413}, "language": "english", "review": "Good Game.

Honestly I think the bright visuals give those moments more shock or punch than your garden variety edgelordt black and grey fest.\n\nGameplay is simple, you don't get any major character upgrades (like health) and craft and equip items for boosts to Robin's abilities.

O jogo foi muito bem recebido pelo p\u00fablico que esperava ansiosamente e com isso ele voltou com tudo no desenvolvimento, concluindo o jogo no dia 23 de janeiro de 2018.\n\nNo jogo voc\u00ea \u00e9 Robin, uma garota cujo o pai era um mec\u00e2nico de um mundo repleto de m\u00e1quinas onde s\u00f3 os mec\u00e2nicos eram capazes operar. Robin queria seguir a mesma profiss\u00e3o do pai, porem uma das religi\u00f5es decide proibir esse oficio, mas Robin desobedece essa religi\u00e3o e continua a utilizar a chave inglesa, herdada do seu pai, pra ajudar seus amigos. O jogo possui uma hist\u00f3ria bem complexa, que s eu falar mais um pouco al\u00e9m disso, vou acabar soltando spoilers, o que posso dizer \u00e9 que ap\u00f3s acabar o jogo voc\u00ea vai refletir um pouco mais sobre as coisas que acontecem no nosso mundo e passar a se questionar sobre elas.\n\nDesenvolvido por uma unica pessoa, esse metroidvania, n\u00e3o \u00e9 um exemplo que todos devem seguir, com grandes inova\u00e7\u00f5es e tudo mais que todos esperam que tenham ap\u00f3s dez longos anos de desenvolvimento, mas n\u00e3o \u00e9 porque n\u00e3o tem grandes inova\u00e7\u00f5es, que n\u00e3o existe qualidade, j\u00e1 que em toda a sua gameplay o jogo traz uma gama de sentimentos e realiza\u00e7\u00f5es ap\u00f3s cada desafio vencido, fazendo com que a empolga\u00e7\u00e3o de ter que continuar jogando continue mais e mais.\n\n[h1][b]GAMEPLAY[/b][/h1]\n\nO gameplay \u00e9 bem satisfat\u00f3rio, apesar de ser linear, ele \u00e9 bem fluido, algo que eu foco bastante em minhas jogatinas, j\u00e1 que \u00e9 isso que vai definir se eu continuo a jogar ou n\u00e3o. Apesar de ele ser bem linear, ele ainda tem partes de explora\u00e7\u00e3o, fazendo com que voc\u00ea volte algumas vezes para mapas que j\u00e1 tenha passado, mesmo que por poucas vezes e o que me deixou desanimado foi o sistema de upgrades, que \u00e9 bem simples e n\u00e3o agrega em muitas coisas, fazendo com que eu chegasse ao fim do jogo sem ter que usar nenhum deles, mostrando o qu\u00e3o in\u00fateis eles s\u00e3o, mas alem desses upgrades, existem outras armas, que no decorrer do jogo voc\u00ea vai encontrar para derrotar bosses ou para usar na resolu\u00e7\u00e3o de puzzles. Os puzzles desse jogo tamb\u00e9m foi algo que me deixou bem decepcionado, j\u00e1 que a resolu\u00e7\u00e3o deles \u00e9 bem simpl\u00f3ria e as vezes eu passava por um sem perceber. Os bosses, apesar de serem memor\u00e1veis e bem trabalhados, n\u00e3o eram t\u00e3o dif\u00edceis, pois como em todo metroidvania \u00e9 s\u00f3 decorar os padr\u00f5es e fim, por\u00e9m n\u00e3o joguei a vers\u00e3o do NG+, ent\u00e3o posso estar enganado enquanto a dificuldade do jogo.\n\n[h1][b]AUDIOVISUAL[/b][/h1]\n\nQuanto a arte do jogo, ela \u00e9 simplesmente espetacular, \u00e9 dif\u00edcil at\u00e9 de imaginar que foi somente uma unica pessoa que fez o jogo inteiro, pois o jogo possui uma \u00f3tima fluidez nos movimentos e anima\u00e7\u00f5es muito bem feitas. O jogo tamb\u00e9m possui algumas cutscenes, que s\u00e3o feitas completamente em pixels e tenho que dizer, s\u00e3o maravilhosas. O level design do jogo tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bem impressionante, pois a intera\u00e7\u00e3o do personagem com o cen\u00e1rio \u00e9 bem completa, fazendo com que quase todo o mapa possa ser explorado.

Little lite on the metriod-vania aspect as the game is very linear.", "timestamp_created": 1521402272, "timestamp_updated": 1521402272, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40904280": {"recommendationid": "40904280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042008739", "num_games_owned": 342, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1355, "last_played": 1521649514}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The game I've been waiting for... for a very long time.[/h1]\n\nI [i]need[/i] to write a review for this game.\nI [i]needed[/i] to write a review for this game.\n\n\n[b]Graphics: 10/10[/b]\n\nNothing beats the old-school pixel art. It's not even a matter of \"Oh, it's a 2D Sidescroller and there are tons of those around,\" it's the fact that the developer took time to add detail to everything, [spoiler]Robin even has a booty.[/spoiler] Each map, each character sprite, each effect - they paid enough attention to detail to deliver a colorful world, even when the atmosphere was gloomy or creepy. You can't beat graphics like this, especially in this element.\n\n[b]Music: 9/10[/b]\n\nI play the game mostly on mute, so I can't really give this one a score. From what I have heard, I enjoyed it a lot. But it won't be fair for me to say 10/10 when I haven't heard half of the soundtrack.\n\nEDIT: I've almost completed the game now. And I love the feeling you get after hearing the track [spoiler]when you fight Black and what I think is also Black by the rocket ship[/spoiler].\n\nOnly reason this is getting a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 was because it's not very easy to put emotion and atmosphere into pixelated game soundtracks. But Konjak managed to do it somehow, especially during certain fights.\n\n[b]Gameplay: 100/100[/b]\n\nI've read other reviews where people liked Iconoclasts at first but started to dislike it as they played it more. Maybe it's because [spoiler]you get characters in your party that aren't playable unless you're in certain conditions/situations, making the whole \"party\" system kind of useless for most of the game. But if you understand that the main character is actually Robin and her \"mechanic\" status is the centerfold of her adventure, then it wouldn't really be a problem.[/spoiler]\n\nI'm a huge Mega Man X fan, so the [spoiler]stun gun[/spoiler] right off the bat had me leading towards a positive review; and if you're a metroidvania fan, you'll also appreciate it.\n\nThe \"you'll have to come back here later in the game\" element in games is always a huge plus to me; it makes the game non-linear, as opposed to being given the tools in that particular area to get past that said particular area. Iconoclasts does a great job of showing you that there's something in an area that you may have stumbled on ([spoiler]which may or may not be at the beginning ;)[/spoiler]), but you will indefinitely have to come back to it later because you probably don't have a certain tool or weapon that's required to interact with [i]anything[/i] around there. There's even a map that's EXTREMELY SIMILAR to the map in Super Metroid that shows you where you are, where you've been, and a legend to help you determine what's what.\n\nThe boss fights are fun, interactive, and not repetitive; each boss is different from the last and some of them actually make you think; and if you take too long to think there's someone/something that gives you a [i]hint[/i], not the solution, a hint on how to beat the boss.\n\nI tried to get myself stuck a couple of times, but they did a really good job with the density of the objects, so that's a plus too.\n\n[b]Characters: 8/10[/b]\n\nI like the dialogue between the characters. I like how each one interacts with the other. They're not drone NPCs, most of them have character to them, [spoiler]except that one guy in the church who serves as a \"Information\" NPC for the whole game.[/spoiler] Some of them will make you laugh and giggle, while others will make you feel for them. Some NPCs you may even hate. Call this something common in games, but it really isn't easy to personify almost [i]every[/i] NPC in a game when you're worrying about the main cast.\n[spoiler]Black's story is sad. Very, very sad.[/spoiler]\n\n[b]Story: TBD/10[/b]\n\nI haven't completed the game yet. I'm trying to find every detail and area to go in to obtain every item possible.

Personally, I view this as a benefit, as it drastically reduces the amount of backtracking you'll be performing bar for a few short segments, though even then said segments effectively serve as breaks between each of the story's \"acts\", and ultimately will be unlikely to negatively influence your enjoyment.\n\nAreas -are- almost always re-visitable, though this only really serves to allow you to grab a few extra upgrade materials using gear you picked up in later areas, and it's refreshing to play a metroidvania that leaves the constant re-running through old areas as an optional side gig rather than a requirement.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple, but uses its simplicity to great advantage. Your abilities at first are just jumping, shooting a basic projectile, and swinging/grabbing with your wrench. Over the course of the game you'll only get three more abilities (a bomb shot, teleport shot, and the ability to electrify your wrench to ride power lines/power up objects), but in using interesting combinations of these abilities both the puzzles and combat stay fresh and keep presenting you with new and unique challenges, so you never feel like you're rehashing old puzzles/encounters.\n\nAlso, the difficulty balance is spot-on. I never got stuck enough on a puzzle to necessitate checking a walkthrough, but still had to actually use my brain to reach the solutions. Some of them even have trick shots/jumps you can make to reach the solution in an unconventional way, which is always a treat.\nCombat against regular enemies isn't incredibly challenging, but doesn't feel like a chore either, acting as quick reflex tests to keep you on your toes between bosses. This in mind, bosses -are- challenging, but never feel unfair. It's not unexpected to die once or twice on a boss, but in turn you can reasonably clear each your first attempt if you're careful and observant enough of their patterns.\n\nMoving on, the story is very well presented and takes plenty of interesting twists and turns. Even if you don't find the gameplay gripping, you'll likely want to keep going anyway to find out what happens next. \n\nIt feels like the developer made sure to fully flesh out the entire story of the world, and then explain only the parts relevant to the main plot as they're brought up, which works great as it makes everything feel like it has an internal consistency to it. While some people might be irked by not having every aspect of the lore revealed to them, I deeply enjoyed it as it made me feel like I was actually someone exploring the world and learning about it, rather than having all the information handed to me in a big pile of exposition or codex lore entries as some other story-heavy games do.\n\nCharacters are just as fleshed out as the world, letting you get invested in their individual plights and genuinely sympathize with both the protagonists -and- antagonists. They actually interact with each other with that level of unpredictability real people have, avoiding tropey and easily-predicted dialogue chains that many games nowadays are plagued with. In turn, dialogue (mostly) flows naturally and can feel like the characters are having actual conversations instead of just exchanging lines back-and-forth.\n\nOn the note of the \"mostly\", a few conversations did have a bit of awkwardness to them, as if the developer was trying to decide between one of two lines for a scene, but liked both too much and so tried to shoehorn them both in, though this is never particularly egregious, and is generally relegated to the less-serious plot moments.\n\nAlso, the spritework is pretty great, which acts as a big help to the story, as characters have a ton of unique sprites/animations that they use during cutscenes that really lets the story show with a level of detail you'd normally only be expecting out of a 3D game.\n\nIn turn, the soundtrack was p dope, especially the unique tracks used for the last few bosses/areas that really help amp up the emotion of the encounters.\n\nIn closing, you can tell the developer poured his heart and soul into every aspect of this game, and while nothing is ever perfect, he comes damn near close. Fans of character-driven stories and metroidvanian platformers alike should get a heapfull of enjoyment from it.\n\n9.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1520658340, "timestamp_updated": 1520658340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40686035": {"recommendationid": "40686035", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053610192", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 116, "last_played": 1520610721}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best game i have ever played in my life!!!!\n1) The story is so good.\n2) The bosses are so much fun, each one of them is uniqe.\n3) Its easy to understand what to do.\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1520611001, "timestamp_updated": 1520611001, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40684393": {"recommendationid": "40684393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198815375867", "num_games_owned": 6, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "last_played": 1520621695}, "language": "french", "review": "j'ai simplement ador\u00e9 ce jeu, tout m'a plu", "timestamp_created": 1520607189, "timestamp_updated": 1520607189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40671408": {"recommendationid": "40671408", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001111085", "num_games_owned": 407, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "last_played": 1520565398}, "language": "english", "review": "Being a huge fan of the Metroid-vania genre really makes my review kinda biased, but this was something I've been looking forward to ever since the initial demo from years ago.

F\u00fcr Alle die nichts mit dem Begriff Metroidvania anfangen k\u00f6nnen hier eine kurze Einf\u00fchrung:\n\nMetroidvania ist ein zusammengesetztes Wort aus \"Metroid\" und \"Castlevania\". Beim dem Begriff ist das Design des Spiel gemeint, d. h. in der Welt gibt es Regionen oder Gebiete die erst mit einer F\u00e4higkeit oder einem Skill erschlossen werden k\u00f6nnen, welche man im Verlauf des Spiels findet. Der Reiz bei Metroidvanias ist, dass man immer neue Skills/Waffen/Fertigkeiten bekommt, die das Spiel abwechslungsreicher und interessanter gestalten. Die Ur-Vertreter sind, wie eingangs schon gesagt, Metroid und Castlevania, aber es gibt noch andere, neue Vertreter des Genres, wie zum Beispiel \"[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoslicht/recommended/332200/]Axiom Verge[/url]\", \"[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoslicht/recommended/367520/]Hollow Knight[/url]\" oder  \"[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaoslicht/recommended/283640/]Salt and Sanctuary[/url]\".\n\nAber wieder zur\u00fcck zu Iconoclast. Die Story des Spiels ist meiner Meinung nach sehr gut gelungen und kommt auch durch die Dialoge sehr gut r\u00fcber. Eine Sprachausgabe fehlt komplett, aber das st\u00f6rt nicht im Geringsten. Die Charaktere passen sich gut ins Spiel ein und deren Handlungen sind immer nachvollziehbar bis auf eine, die fast am Ende der Story auftaucht. Was die Entwickler sich dabei gedacht haben, ist mir vollkommen schleierhaft.... Trotzdem ist auch das Ende der Geschichte durchdacht und rundet das ca. 10 Stunden lange Abenteuer gut ab. Wer alle Kisten finden will kann ruhig nochmal 3-4 Stunden mehr einplanen und der NewGamePlus- und Herausforderungsmodus laden dann noch zum neuen Durchgang ein.\n\n\n[b]Ich habe einen Schraubenschl\u00fcssel![/b]\n\nWie es sich f\u00fcr ein Metroidvania geh\u00f6rt, springen, laufen und erkunden wir die Welt in 2D. Ja, es gibt auch 3D-Metroidvania, aber nur 2D ist das Original! Jedenfalls sind wir auf einem wundersch\u00f6nen Planeten und spielen die blonde Mechanikerin Robin. Die etwas sch\u00fcchterne und sprachlose (wenn auch niedliche) Mechanikerin reist im Verlauf des Spiels an sch\u00f6ne, kalte, karge und beeindruckende Orte, an denen es immer etwas zu bestaunen und zu endecken gibt (Stichwort Kisten). Das Spiel verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber ein sehr kleines, rundiment\u00e4res Crafingsystem, wobei \"System\" sehr \u00fcbertrieben ist. Man sammelt nur 4 Elemente, die sich dann zu einem Boost zusammensetzen lassen. Notwendig ist das eigentlich nicht, aber schon sinnvoll, da man z.B. l\u00e4nger unterwasser bleiben kann oder mehr Treffer einsteckt. Der oben erw\u00e4hnte Schraubenschl\u00fcssel dient als Waffe (Nahkampf) und f\u00fcr R\u00e4tsel.\n\n\n[b]Schraube locker?[/b]\n\nIn der Welt sind kleine Muttern verteilt die wir mit dem Schraubenzieher... naja festschrauben k\u00f6nnen, dass wiederrum ist n\u00f6tig um T\u00fcren oder kleine Schalter- bzw. Schraubenr\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen (wobei l\u00f6sen... man schraubt die ja fest....). In den Bossk\u00e4mpfen spielt der Schl\u00fcssel ebenfalls eine feste (hehehe...) Rolle, mal m\u00fcssen wir ein T\u00fcr \u00f6ffnen damit wir entkommen oder wir schicken Projektile wieder an den Absender zur\u00fcck, spart Portokosten. Aber allein mit dem Schraubenschl\u00fcssel kommen wir nicht weit und so haben wir noch eine kleine Pistole, die \u00fcber einen normalen und \u00fcber einen aufladbaren Schuss verf\u00fcgt, in der Tasche. Im Spielverlauf gibts ein paar Upgrades f\u00fcr Schl\u00fcssel und Pistole, diese sind zwar \u00fcberschaubar, aber w\u00fcrzen das Spiel auch mit Abwechslung. Leider gibt es bei den Upgrades keine gro\u00dfen \u00dcberraschungen, da helfen auch die Craftinggegenst\u00e4nde nicht weiter. Macht aber nix. Das Spiel \u00fcberzeugt mit seiner Einfachheit und der guten Spielbarkeit, eine Vielzahl an Waffen oder Upgrades w\u00fcrde hier nur das Gameplay st\u00f6ren.\n\n\n[b]Da geht doch noch mehr, oder?[/b]\n\nIm Prinzip ist es das auch schon. Die Story schickt uns \u00fcber die gesamte Karte und bringt einige emotionale Momente mit sich, die auch danach noch im Ged\u00e4chtnis bleiben. Au\u00dferdem kommt es vor, dass man dem NPC, mit dem am gerade redet, antworten muss. Ob das irgendwelche Auswirkungen hat? Nun, dass kann ich ehrlich gesagt nicht sagen, aber in den Diskussionen bei Steam sieht es so aus als k\u00f6nne man damit das Ende beeinflussen. Nach dem Ende ist es allerdings nicht m\u00f6glich weiterzuspielen, es sei denn man l\u00e4dt des letzten Spielstand oder man f\u00e4ngt gleich mit eine NewGamePlus an.\n\n\n[b]Und nun ein Fazit![/b]\n\nIconoclast ist ein gutes Spiel, ein Metroidvania, was sich auch als solches bezeichen darf. Die Grafik f\u00e4ngt die Atmosph\u00e4re stets gut ein und auch der Soundtrack ist immer sehr sch\u00f6n. Auch die Story war niemals langweilig, da es viele lustige, aber auch ernste Momente gibt, die nicht \u00fcbertrieben oder kitschig gezeichnet wurden. Mit ca. 10 Stunden Spielzeit ist, bei 52% eingesammelter Komponenten, ist das Spiel definitiv eine Empfehlung wert und falls Ihr lust auf ein kleines Abenteuer habt, Robin ist bereit mit euch die Welt zu retten.

There is some combat involved, but not much, you have upgrades but mostly pointless and you have 3 main weapons which you'll use for puzzle solving mostly. The best part of the gameplay are the boss fights and each one is unique and well made and theres plenty of them. Puzzle solving which is basically environmental will get tedious at some point sadly but not so much that you'd want to stop or hate it. \n\nThe story revolves around Robin, a mechanic which somehow gets intro trouble with the \"law\" of the planet and things escalate to wtf is going on. Things will make sense throught the adventure and the ending feels decent but overall I cant say I was overly impressed by it. Still it has a good amount of characters, humour, tragedy, drama and whatnot so it always feels fresh. \n\nAtmosphere is as you'd expect from a pixelated 2D adventure game. Colorful, detailed and varied environments are all part of the game and theres lots of places you'll visit, each unique. \n\nSound design consists only of sound effects and soundtrack, since theres no voice acting and both of them are well made. \n\nOverall a fine adventure game that offers a good amount of exploration, puzzle solving that might annoy some people and amazing boss fights.

[/h1] \n\nIt has been long overdue but totally worth the wait - Iconoclasts is here to knock your heart out with lovely characters, interesting ideas, engaging gameplay and more! Iconoclasts is 2D metroidvania with puzzling, unique setting and amazing visual looks. You play as Robin a mechanic's daughter (silent, yet expressive protag) who lives in a sad and cruel world built on faith and co-operation with organization named One Cornern. World is basically dying and you're set to unveil what dark secrets One Concern and the current death of this planet holds! \n\n[h1] GAMEPLAY - 8/10 [/h1]\n\nIconoclasts gameplay revolves around metroidvania styled gameplay. You can move to left and right, jump up and fall through certain platforms if you choose to. You have a progression system as usually follows - you go through the story and get new powers leading you to new powers while letting you run free around the rather big 2D styled world to backtrack and collect secrets. What's so unique about Iconoclasts then? Well, like I pointed out earlier, the game is rather built around puzzling, your solve puzzles with your meelee weapon, the Wrench which gets more upgrades along the way to spice things up. You can turn bolts to open doors and interract with almost all of the puzzles in the game. First of all, Robin controls smoothly and jumping never feels off except one certain parts which I'll return to later. You can also whack enemies with your Wrench and parry certain projectiles by performing a meelee attack in the right time window. Alongside your meelee weapon, you also get 3 different gun types with regular fire type and charge shot. \n\nSTUN GUN: Medium Damage with charge shot to break through walls and damage enemies in the expense of being vulnerable until it charges back (happens with all of the gun types).\n\nBOMB GUN THING: Heavy Damage with bombs and charged rocket to solve puzzles. These bombs help you to move certain obstacles and damage enemies. \n\nWEIRD SWIRLY TELEPORTATION GUN: Major Damage, shoots swirly particle thingy that passes through enemies making piss easy later in the game. Charging this gun will perform teleportation that swaps your place with enemies or certain objects depending who you shoot it at. \n\nIconoclasts also comes with a stomp move which I loved. It was there from the start and it feels heavy and impactful. Stomp can be used to damage enemies or break breakable blocks underneath you. \nYou will also get a charged electric power which lets you break through said blocks while traversing through electric wires. This is an interesting mechanic which gives a bit more variation to the puzzles. Why isn't the gameplay 10/10? Well  there few issues, enemy placements fall on the bad side time to time, enemies can be spammy or just downright insanely irritating, sometimes you will take damage because the enemies react way too fast. Secondly the puzzles get rather stale sometimes, they good for the most part but they get rather stale by the midway (they do get better tho!). I also find the perk system sometimes way too forgiving and sometimes way too punishing - you have perks which you can craft by collecting certain materials found across the map. You take damage = the perk gets destroyed until you fix it by collecting cubes from enemies, puzzles, opening doors or bosses. Why does this feel inconsistent then? Some enemies drop way too many cubes, you can stack them rendering some bosses and puzzles ridiculously easy and it just didn't sit well with me. Some bosses can also be oddly spammy at times, giving you no space to move making you unable to go through without taking damage, this can lead to some irritating situations but these are few and far between so I wouldn't complain about it too much. Solid gameplay that gets hindered by few issues listed above but it fits the world.\n\n[h1] CHARACTERS AND STORY - 9.5/10 [/h1]\n\nThe characters and story were mostly what kept me coming back when the puzzles were feeling stale. I was engaged, I was riveted by what was gonna happen next. Iconoclasts holds nothing back, the story is sad, cruesome and philosophical. It's led by a narrative that pokes and gives criticism to extreme religiousness, human experiments and over usage or fuel. Every piece or dialogue is interesting and you'll form each of them their unique voices in your head because they are so quirky and fun to talk to! You'll see many colourful characters along your journey but I'll mention the most notable ones: Royal, Agent Black, Mina and Elro. These characters are amazing and all of them alongside the story need to be experienced on your own. It's that good and my rambling wouldn't do it justice. Good stuff!\n\n[h1] GRAPHICS - 10/10 // MUSIC - 8/10 [/h1]\n\nGraphics in this game are fantastic. It's pure eyecandy and it shows how much effort has gone into this department. Every character is expressive, colours are vibrant, cutscenes are beautifully animated and the game is just...it just looks so good. It's unbelievably made and fluidly animated. The music is good but that's as good as it gets. It fitst the theme and looks but it's mostly good and nothing mindblowing. Sound design however is on point. \n\n[h1] LEVEL DESIGN - 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\nLevel design in Iconoclasts can be described with one word - stellar. The level design plays well with it's puzzling elements and nothing feels too exploitable regarding the level design. It's decent with enjoyable platforming and unique worlds. You have your basic first worlds like grass themed one, desert and snow level but these worlds get elevated by the quirky world design and graphics. It didn't too generic but it would've been nice to see these three not be included. Other than that the level design is very enjoyable with multiple settings and sometimes dreary athmosphere when it gets to it.

Contrario a lo que puede parecer en un primer momento: el juego es bastante lineal, pr\u00e1cticamente el juego se basa enteramente en lo siguiente: una puerta cerrada en el lugar A que solo se abre con una llave que est\u00e1 en el lugar B, por lo que hay que ir por ella y mientras hacemos esto, combatimos con enemigos t\u00edpicos de juegos como este. Todo el juego, hablando de sus mec\u00e1nicas, es de hecho bastante simple y lo que necesitamos para completarlo se nos da muy temprano, dicha simpleza es un arma de doble filo ya que si bien, agradezco que no sea saturado con muchas cosas, si me hubiese gustado que se le de m\u00e1s variedad a la jugabilidad ya que el juego dura m\u00e1s de lo que uno espera: me tarde poco m\u00e1s de 15 horas, y creo que el rango esta entre 10-16 horas (en tu primera partida) dependiendo habilidad y ganas de explorar el mundo. Tanto tiempo haciendo lo mismo llega a ser un poco cansado y por eso un poco m\u00e1s de profundidad jugable no hubiese estado mal. \n\nPor ejemplo: en una parte del juego nos dicen que necesitaremos del sigilo para poder triunfar; sin embargo eso no es cierto, ya que vas a ir disparando como loco y no afecta en nada a la aventura, me hubiese gustado que lo hiciera. No estoy pidiendo nada complicado, por ejemplo hay una parte muy ingeniosa en donde debemos ayudar a poner cajas en su lugar pero si hacemos una combinaci\u00f3n equivocada, estas explotan. Hubiese agradecido m\u00e1s momentos as\u00ed, sobretodo porque como dije, el juego es m\u00e1s largo de lo que aparenta. Aunque eso si debo decir: las batallas contra jefes son todas espl\u00e9ndidas, muy divertidas, que aprovechan las mejoras de nuestro equipo y en general un desaf\u00edo interesante. Dos de esas batallas se han convertido en algunas de mis batallas favoritas de todos los tiempos, si acaso solo por lo que significan dentro del juego.\n\nPero bueno toda esa simpleza en lo jugable es debido a que el juego es guiado por la historia, la cual, como mencion\u00e9 al principio, tiene elementos apocal\u00edpticos y religiosos. La idea de un mundo donde los recursos se est\u00e1n agotando y hay muchos temblores mientras tienes a una sociedad que castiga a los \"pecadores\" y le rezan a un ser superior est\u00e1 bien llevada y todo gracias a personajes muy interesantes. Tienes a un personaje que siempre se molesta cuando las cosas no salen como quieren, a uno que quiere ayudarte pero siempre que lo hace termina empeor\u00e1ndolo todo y tu hermano que es ap\u00e1tico a todo lo que acontece durante el juego y que en su af\u00e1n de cuidarte termina cada vez m\u00e1s lastimado. Los personajes sienten, act\u00faan y sufren por los acontecimientos que ocurren antes y durante del juego. Todos me gustaron a su manera y agradezco que hayan tenido tiempo en mostrar sus personalidades. En general me gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo la historia y los personajes que esta tiene pero tristemente tengo que decir que tengo un problema con el final, el cual no revelar\u00e9 por obvios spoilers, pero si dir\u00e9 que por todo lo que se estaba formando uno esperar\u00eda un final tr\u00e1gico o al menos agridulce, y no es el caso. Es decepcionante que el juego, despu\u00e9s de todos los riesgos que toma, se conformara con un t\u00edpico \"final feliz\". No me malentiendan, es bonito y esperanzador, pero se siente como si todos los problemas que te planteaba el juego se arreglaran por arte de magia. No creo que el final por s\u00ed mismo arruin\u00e9 una fant\u00e1stica experiencia, pero si me encuentro decepcionado con este final.\n\nCon todo eso en mente (y que muy probablemente mi gusto por el juego sea mayor que la calidad en si del mismo) debo decir que al final Iconoclasts, con todo y sus notorios problemas, me gust\u00f3 mucho. Su historia y sus interesantes personajes hacen que valga la pena dejar a un lado los malos momentos.\n\nLo recomiendo.", "timestamp_created": 1519697320, "timestamp_updated": 1519773068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40427928": {"recommendationid": "40427928", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040880081", "num_games_owned": 183, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 738, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519694472}, "language": "english", "review": "So This game is... Not good... It's not terrible. It's not the worst. But I really do not recommend it.\n\nFirst off let me say the game is beautiful and the pixile art is gorgeous! And unfortenantly that's about where the praise ends for it. The game play is mostly forgetable the story is hard to understand and the tone of the game is really all over the place.\nThe game play seems to see it's self as a sort of run and gun style metrovaina but I'd find it hard to qualify it as that. The run and gun aspect is very weak, one of the weakest parts of the game if you ask me, and the metrovaina qualities are not totally there. It's rather liniar for me to ever call it metrovaina, in fact if you took out the metrovaina aspects and smoothed it out to be more liniar it would probably make for a much better game. As it stands it's way more focused on the puzzle aspect which I feel is a crappy crutch to the over all game. Most of the time I'd get stuck on a puzzle because I would miss one or two hard to see things or not realize I had X ability. Maybe that last one is my fault for not reading enough text boxes but this game is really wordy. Like it has way to much text and at points I'd be so lost in coversations that I'd just start skipping dialog. But I could put the story together... Mostly. This game could really benifit from one of two things.\n1. Full voice acting. A number of times the tone of what was happening was really questionable. Like once where two characters sat down and had a heart to heart that I thought was suppose to be touching but ended with one character storming off. I was left in total confusion about what the fuck I was suppose to be feeling in that scene.\n2. Character boxes for their face. The sprite work is really good looking but sucks at showing subtle details. Like in the previously mentioned scene it could have been fixed if it had a bigger better represenation of their face so we could see more emotions then eyebrows up or eyebrows down.\nAs for the story... Well at the begining it's so thin that we really don't know what we are doing. It wasn't till past the half way mark that I really got a sense of scope about everything and we finally got to the interesting aspects of the story. Which to be fair to Iconoclasts it does shine in the later half of the game. But it's not worth the first 7 or so hours to get there.\nThe problem is that the tone is all over the map. One minuite it's making jokes about something or has a silly character design to perhaps lighten the mood but then right after has characters burtally murding one another. This is perhaps most odd in the end where after *spoilers* we know the world is going to die and we go fight GOD HIMSELF! it turns out to be a robot piloted by a bird man... What? Was this suggested at any point? Was this suppose to be funny? Because it's not. It's just confusing. And then after murdering GOD HIMSELF! we go home where are ass hole of a brother says \"okay.

Just like that. I'll even say it probably worths at least 1.5 of what it costs right now.\nIn case you need more facts to back my claims up:\nPros:\n - Gameplay is very smooth and thought-out. Controls are tight, and when you mess up, it's your mistake, not Robin lagging due to some input problem. Puzzles are right ammount of challenge, at least for me. Survey situation, see what tools you can apply where, get timing right, and another room cracks open.\n- Excellent style and graphics. Honestly, you can stare at some screens for hours. Amount of detail is staggering, animations are fluid, full of motion and life, and colors are bright and pretty.\n- Story is engaging and doesn't contain any major plot-holes (not sure about small ones, but I think any work of art have at least some mistake here or there). It has humor, drama, good build-up, likeable characters, and also gives player some space to interpret things in your own way.\n- Music is good. I can't say much here, but some tunes stuck in my head after hearing them. Not for long, but at very least never during my gameplay I thought to myself \"Gee, I don't like this theme\".\n\nCons:\n- I honestly can't think of anything bad or aggravating or frustrating about Iconoclasts. There are some things I have questions about, but they are mostly neutral points, not exactly negative things. Mainly, approach to finding things is original, and I'm not sure how to feel about it. Making items yourself instead of looking high and low around levels for them is interesting concept (mind that you still need to find crafting materials), but during my time with game, I never felt any of those 'Tweaks' were particularly useful to me. They make life easier at some points, but that's it - all mandatory items you will find by following story, and anything crafted you can neglect. Not sure if this is the case on harder difficulties, though.\nWhy is this not a strong \"con\"? Because I myself am kind of person who sticks to default weapons for as long as possible. I do (and enjoy) buster-only runs in Megaman, I hoard boost items in RPGs to never use them later, and so on. So this system of helper items flew over my head, as I got some starter ones and never bothered with anything else since then.\n\nSo, to wrap this all up. Iconoclasts is excellent game - fun, thought-provoking, memorable and aspiring.

Don't let the game's cheerful appearance deceive you - Iconoclasts explores the darker side of people's emotions, and you will often find yourself empathizing with the immersive and well developed cast of characters as they struggle to fight their inner demons.

A more linear look at the metroidvania genre that manages pacing and story beats very well. And for being one of the few games to make me shed a tear, I think I'll break down everything I like and dislike about it.\n\nRegardless of what I bring up here, my final point is that the game is more than worth the purchase, and that maybe we'll get more great games from this studio.\n\nLet's start with the positives.\n\nMovement mechanics are incredibly fluid for the most part. Robin moves at a quick and enjoyable pace, and with some practice it becomes easy to range around the environments rapidly.\n\nCombat feels rewarding, while still making outright avoidance an option in the sections where you'll mostly just be passing through while backtracking.\n\nEvery weapon feels powerful and useful, even to the endgame. The three fire modes each find their niche in combat and allow for a flexible combat environment.\n\nThe art style is absolutely gorgeous and even the backgrounds feel flowing and immersive. That's not to mention the depth of unique animations each character has while each one still reads clearly.\n\nThe characters are both powerful and charismatic, each in their own way. I never found myself bored with their antics and speech, even in the larger expository monologues. You'll easily come to fall in love with many of the recurring cast.\n\nBosses are unique and enjoyable, tending to be a test of whatever mechanics you've had to learn to reach them, all while allowing some flexibility in style of combat. You can fight them in the obvious way, or you can sometimes find sneaky ways to deal large amounts of damage and finish the fight quickly.\n\nThe story is nicely laid out and paced. It doesn't frontload very much, and allows you to learn about the history and lore at your own pace, only pointing out the more important bits explicitly where it may be necessary to progress.\n\n\nAnd now my few quibbles and dislikes.\n\nWhile most of the movement is enjoyable, the ledge grab mechanic is very clunky feeling compared to the fluidity of the other forms of movement.\n\nThe weapons each have their own charged shot form, but I find that they don't feel like they charge properly. Sometimes I'll charge a shot and rarely still fire the uncharged version.\n\nRobin as a character is interesting, but I don't think she benefits much from being a mostly silent protagonist.\n\nThe map is large, and unfortunately, with the limited backgrounds, it can be easy to find yourself wandering in circles if you're not checking the map regularly.\n\nI have specific gripes with the prison escape segment in the tower, as keeping track of where things are in it's map is tricky, as well as a general lack of any kind of signposting, resulting in a lot of running around trying everything you can until you finally figure it out.\n\nFunnily enough, although the opening segments have very well incorporated tutorial parts, signposting in the second half of the game drops off almost completely. This may not sound like a problem, but after being subtly led around for the first half, exploring these gorgeous maps, getting lost with no easy way to figure out where to go next can be frustrating.\n\n\nDespite all this, I find the game very enjoyable, so much so, in fact, that I accidentally stayed up way past when I should have gone to sleep one night and spent my entire day at work yawning the next day. I then completed it the next day and proceded to write this review. Overall, I'd give it an eight out of ten. My few issues with the game keep it from a nine and breaking my heart near the end keeps it from the extra point to make it a ten.\n\n\nTLDR It's a good game, with great mechanics (lol) a lovely soundtrack, and can be finished in about a day if you start early.", "timestamp_created": 1519431338, "timestamp_updated": 1519431338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.543568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40341411": {"recommendationid": "40341411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242813636", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5, "last_played": 1520858353}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u592atm\u597d\u73a9\u4e86 \u770b\u5230\u8bc4\u8bba\u533a\u6709\u4eba\u8bf4\u5341\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u73a9\u901a \u6211\u8fb9\u73a9\u8fb9\u770b\u653b\u7565\u6253\u4e86\u5341\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u4f30\u8ba1\u624d\u4e00\u534a\n\u6700\u5751\u7239\u7684\u662f\u88abboss\u6740\u4e86\u4e4b\u540e\u8981\u770b\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5267\u60c5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662fmother\u90a3\u6211\u6570\u4e86\u670965\u53e5\uff0c\u90a3\u4e2aboss\u6211\u6253\u4e86\u516d\u904d\u624d\u8fc7\u53bb\n\u8d28\u91cf\u5f88\u597d\u4e70\u7684\u4e0d\u4e8f \n\u6700\u540e we need chinese", "timestamp_created": 1519430150, "timestamp_updated": 1519430150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40338600": {"recommendationid": "40338600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051147654", "num_games_owned": 1024, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1520723744}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]This is one of my new favorite games, but will it be yours?[/b]\n\nCreated by one person, Iconoclasts is a story-critical platformer with metroidvania stages, unique bosses and simple puzzles.  \n\nYou play as the silent (but not mute) protaganist, Robin.  A talented young mechanic with a mean stun gun, a giant wrench, your smarts and a big heart.  Throw the mechanic into the problems of the world and she will try to fix them.  But, what do they say about good intentions?\n\nLet's break it down!\n\n[h1]Art:[/h1]\nThe screenshots won't do it justice.  Each character has a plethora of different sprites for each expression rather than just text and it's fun to notice new reactions even late game.  On environments: the art has a pretty unique eye-popping style.  Just look at the screenshots above... notice the common shapes used.  There is more going on then just form over function.  Even from the start, you may unwittingly notice foreshadowing.  There's an attention to detail that can easily go overlooked and unappreciated.  But, when you've played through, you may notice all the visual cues that were there.  Personally, it wasn't my favorite style, but it never failed to look good.  Iconoclasts wins big with the art category, and it was made by one person.\n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\nSome games have just a few tracks used throughout the game.  And then you have Iconoclasts.  With 50+ tracks, you'll never fail to have a theme that fits the situation, and it was made by one person.  Like the artwork, the music may be hit or miss with your tastes, but they too compliment the visuals well in maintaing a theme.  If you don't mind small track name spoilers, take a peek at the official soundtrack on youtube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK9BYVfRzMw\nEven if it doesn't resonate with you, it's not boring!\n\n[h1]Controls:[/h1]\nI played using a PS3 controller using an Xbox profile and much prefer it to my limited time on the keyboard.  If I remember correctly, the game felt a bit complicated at the start.  You aren't given hand holding tutorials and baby steps.  Most of the time you are thrown into the air, expected to fly.  This was fine.  Given visual cues and signs, your expected actions are taught in a natural visual way.  For example, you have access to multiple techniques at the start that would make life easier, but you don't know how to perform them if you are just starting out.  Meaning you'll develop and evolve your technique of dealing with areas over the course of the game.  Some people want a universal control scheme... but I appreciate trying something somewhat new.  Learning the differences and adapting.\n\nOh and I should mention movement is very fluid, and forgiving.  Even after running off the edge of a cliff, you'll have just enough time to perform a jump so you'll rarely be frustrated with precision.  And a personal favorite of mine, how many times have you mashed a button to fly through text and accidently pressed a dialogue choice?  Not a problem in this game!\n\n[h1]Combat and difficulty:[/h1]\nThis is a tricky one.  You are given two difficulties at the start, Standard and Hard.  A common complaint is that the game is too easy, or too hard later on.  But in actuality, most battles are puzzles with multiple solutions.  They require their own patterns to learn and defeat, making your first encounters tricky to solve.  As you advance and learn all the techniques available, it can become a breeze.  Well suited to speed-running.\n\nPro example: https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/DLJaBDiWkAA_6j1.mp4\n\nSo, in my opinion, outside of boss battles and a few late areas, combat IS easy.  But playing through once unlocks a third difficulty, Challenge Mode, for you hardcore players loving torment and an achivement to go along with it.  Maybe overall combat could have been made more difficult, but imagine playing through the game by yourself thousands of times?  Being able to flow through it and enjoying replays, rather than finding a constant blockade would be much desired.  So, keep in mind this game is well suited to swift replaying, and includes a NewGame+ to encourage it.\n\n[h1]Bosses:[/h1]\nWhile this should go under combat, bosses are a major feature of the game.  On standard, you are given plenty of opportunity to defeat a boss on your first try while racing to keep yourself alive.  It feels good not having to die to win.  Don't spoil yourself with guides!  You can do it!\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nHave you read this entire review so far?  If so, you'll have no problem reading Iconoclast's dialogue.  Let me address some common complaints: Awkward dialogue.  I don't find this to be an issue.  Yes, there is some structure and diction used that you won't find in a modern spoken conversation.  But, like my comment about a universal control scheme, does English have to fit into a small universal box?  I appreciate the occasional flowery language and it too compliments the character saying it imo.\n\nAnother common issue: Too much story.  ...Really?  Well, be happy to know most cutscenes can be completely skipped.  Which is wonderful for speedrunning.  Anyway, one of the biggest features of this game IS the story.  So, if you're cutting that out, you're really missing out.\n\nOh, and if you like making connections on your own.  Putting together hidden meanings, you'll have a field day with this game.  Pull back the curtain of this game and you'll find more layers awaiting.  I enjoyed piecing together what was happening rather than being given a textdump.  (Reminds me of Cave Story theories.)\n\nPS... no voice acting.\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nIn this age of gigabyte games, how big do you think Iconoclasts is?  ... currently 162 megabytes.  And yet, packed to the brim full of content.  To see a single person can accomplish this...  Iconclasts may not be a game for everyone.  But, what HAS been created is worth investigating.

This game has had a lot of work put into it, and the game developer's dedication into this project really shines through. However, after beating the last boss, and Robin going back to sleep, I put down the controller with a really sour taste in my mouth. I put down these comments hopefully as constructive criticisms so that Joakim can improve these things for his next game: I really wish him well!\n\n[h1]The Game in a nutshell:[/h1]\nIconoclasts is a platforming \"metroidvania\"...I think. You constantly unlock new abilities that add new weapons and unlocks treasures from areas explored. You play as Robin, a girl with a wrench and a gun, as she travels the lands with friends and family, to save the planet!\n\n[h1]Graphics: [/h1]\nHoooooly shit, the number of pixels that has been blessed into this game. The art is gorgeous, backgrounds, enemies, and the characters are all beautiful. The art of Robin is great and animations have a lot of love put into it\n\nsmall nitpick: The squash animation for when you downward slam into enemies looked a little weird. \n\n[h1]Music:[/h1]\nThe soundtrack and the sound design is quite top notch. There is a good amount of love poured into this. I still have the main menu music stuck in my head.\n\n[h1]Characters: [/h1]\nCharacters are well characterised and some are relatable, some are lovable, some you just want to punch in the face [spoiler](ahem Royal).[/spoiler]\n\nNow that I've gotten the positive stuff out of the way, here is the negatives:\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nCrazy religious cult controls the world's energy source: ivory and drains the world of it. Although you are outlawed, you get away with a lot of shit. Like walking around in the capital city as a unregistered mechanic and nobody ever cares. \n\nFor some reason Robin never thought about wearing a fake mechanic outfit to fit in or something. Missed opportunity imo. \n\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\nYou have a wrench, which you use as both a weapon and a puzzle solving mechanic: they really roll with the full scale of the actions available, you twist bolts to open doors, you swing on bolts, you ride on electric belts and you can electrify yourself with the static electricity generated with the wrench. The wrench based gameplay was quite well thought out\n\n......except the control scheme. To twist anything, you first need to push the wrench key, wait until your wrench connects, and then push down. A lot of keys for a simple action which you will do again, and again, and again. \n\nIn fact, now that I think about it, this game has some really really weird control schemes. You jump onto the box and...wait for it, push UP to pick up the box: what? You can only pick up the box while you are on top of it too, you can't just push up when standing next to a box and pick it up. The only way to put it down is to throw it in which, unless you can do parabolic maths in your head, the accuracy is pretty bad. \n\nThe platforming is highly inconsistent: some ledges you can grab, some you can't. For some reason 1 width gaps that are 1 width tall cannot be jumped into. The game also has a lot of frustrating falls where accidentally missing means a lot of lost time backtracking. For example, why is it that I can't move Mina when I crouch but Robin happily crawls along anything? Mina is also a pain to use: to shoot you need to first push the button, then select a direction, then push the shoot key again. Can't I just hold a direction key and then let Mina shoot?\n\nI loved the fights in this game until later enemies kept breaking the rules. Every fight afterwards becomes a trial and error of: is enemy immune to wrench? stun gun? explosives? usurper? I got tired of this real fast. \n\nBosses are inconsistent. The earlier bosses are great, you can figure out what they want you to do relatively quickly. The later bosses got highly inconsistent with signalling what I need to do. I had to continuously look up how to damage the boss. You can call me an idiot, but I really couldn't figure it out: How was I supposed to know I could swap out the blue goo on enemies??\n\nPuzzles rely a lot on timing, and that's annoying. Have to get some pretty exact timings to get around certain puzzles. Especially at the start of the game, I had some real controller tossing rage moments.\n\nRecommended improvements:\nBe nice to players, implement the usual Quality of Life improvements that make the platforming much smoother. \nSome of the puzzles are real time wasters: having to angle the gun at very specific intervals and have to have some very exact timings.. Have some more tolerance for error would be nice, or at least make retries easier. \n\nOverall, I think it's a good game. The 8 years the developer does show. I just hope it actually plays nicer.\n", "timestamp_created": 1519225934, "timestamp_updated": 1519225934, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489740", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40277155": {"recommendationid": "40277155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070688832", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519222592}, "language": "english", "review": "Art and style are amazing, story is simple but fun, characters are colorful and endearing, gameplay is solid and the controls are tight.

El juego es una evoluci\u00f3n de un t\u00edtulo anterior, tambi\u00e9n creado por \u00e9l,  llamado Ivory Springs, el cual posee un apartado art\u00edstico, que nos recuerda much\u00edsimo este t\u00edtulo, pero con Iconoclasts podemos ver una evoluci\u00f3n tanto en el aspecto t\u00e9cnico, como en el narrativo.  Como curiosidad Ivory Springs fue inspirado por el fant\u00e1stico Cave History. \n\nControlamos a nuestra encantadora protagonista llamada Robin, poseedora de la prohibida habilidad \u201cMec\u00e1nica\u201d, este don est\u00e1 vetado por un ente superior, por lo cual debemos mantenerlo oculto. El mundo se est\u00e1 deteriorando r\u00e1pidamente, generando conflictos entre niveles sociales del mismo planeta. Nuestra aventura gira entorno a esto, debemos entender  que est\u00e1 ocurriendo y nuestro papel en este hermoso lugar, con nuestra peculiar habilidad. Adem\u00e1s entender el origen de la existente escasez de marfil, material utilizado para crear pr\u00e1cticamente todo.\n\nLa base del juego recae fuertemente en el estilo metroidvania, pero se inclina m\u00e1s por el lado del metroid. Entramos a nuestro mundo con un arma aturdidora, la cual nos ayudara a eliminar enemigos en nuestra exploraci\u00f3n. El dise\u00f1o de niveles es sencillo pero conciso. Nuestras armas tienen munici\u00f3n infinita, pero tiempos de recarga, un detalle es que los disparos de nuestra arma aturdidora se dirigen autom\u00e1ticamente hacia los enemigos, pero esto tiene rango, debes estar a determinada distancia para que esto surta efecto, y aunque esto le a\u00f1ade un poco de facilidad al juego, est\u00e1 muy bien implementado para hacer nuestra exploraci\u00f3n satisfactoria, sin convertirlo en una experiencia sencilla.\n\nLuego de superar algunas pantallas entra en partida una nueva arma, nuestra llave inglesa, la cual aporta el gran cambio en exploraci\u00f3n propio del juego. Las funciones de nuestra llave son pocas pero muy concisas, lo primero que podemos hacer es ajustar o aflojar tuercas, esto nos permite activar mecanismos para seguir avanzando. Tambi\u00e9n podemos atacar a los enemigos y realizar una especie de counter para poder defendernos, en alg\u00fan punto podemos girar nuestra llave para recargar electricidad, modificando la exploraci\u00f3n en algunas partes del juego. Todas estas habilidades se suman creando un conjunto de posibilidades muy interesantes, aportando mec\u00e1nicas muy agradables y frescas. Despu\u00e9s nos agregan varias armas, cada una con una personalidad marcada, habilitando as\u00ed nuevos caminos en nuestra traves\u00eda, por esta raz\u00f3n es que tiene m\u00e1s inclinaci\u00f3n por el g\u00e9nero metroid, sobre el fant\u00e1stico castlevania.\n\nEsto tambi\u00e9n lo podemos notar en lo limitado de los men\u00fas, ac\u00e1 tenemos items suficientes para disfrutar del juego, no poseemos cantidades descomunales como en castlevania symphony of the night, pero necesariamente esto no es malo, ya que durante toda nuestra aventura la funci\u00f3n de cada objeto tiene un papel importante en su jugabilidad, no son cambios peque\u00f1os, son transformaciones grandes en la exploraci\u00f3n del mapa, pareciera que cada item se intent\u00f3 explotar al m\u00e1ximo y aportar as\u00ed, la mayor repercusi\u00f3n posible en el juego.\n\nEn nuestra incursi\u00f3n encontramos una gran variedad de enemigos, y ac\u00e1 podemos ver lo mismo, cada enemigo fue creado con una intenci\u00f3n \u00fanica, tanto en su agradable dise\u00f1o, como cambiando la mec\u00e1nica, todos poseen diferentes formas de ataque y distintas formas para ser eliminados, ofreciendo m\u00e1s valor a  nuestras posibilidades, este detalle simple, mantiene la aventura fresca. Pero el aspecto que si deja una sensaci\u00f3n extra\u00f1a, es una escasez de ellos, algunas pantallas se sienten vac\u00edas, pero no es un factor muy negativo, solo es la p\u00e9rdida de una posible mejora en su fluidez, si encontr\u00e1ramos m\u00e1s enemigos en nuestras fases el juego resultar\u00eda m\u00e1s fren\u00e9tico o adictivo. Otro detalle es que los enemigos no arrojan items, tan solo nos dan unos cuadritos de energ\u00eda para recargar nuestros potenciadores y si estamos con la salud muy baja, nos arrojaran corazones, pero cuando eres m\u00e1s poderoso, la exploraci\u00f3n nos obliga a volver a lugares iniciales y esto se vuelve tedioso, ya que no tenemos suficientes motivadores extra para querer regresar a esas conocidas zonas. \n\nEn nuestro hud disponemos en la parte superior izquierda una barra de salud, en la parte derecha el arma que est\u00e1 activa y abajo tenemos 3 espacios para agregar unas mejoras a nuestro personaje. Un detalle curioso es, como es habitual en este tipo de juegos, poseemos un lugar para guardar, ac\u00e1 tenemos unas estatuas donde grabamos nuestro progreso, aca es el \u00fanico lugar donde podemos cambiar estas mejoras, no estoy hablando que entramos a nuestro men\u00fa y las activamos, no, solo las podemos modificar en el men\u00fa de la estatua, no entiendo bien porque se hizo esto, pero es una curiosidad.\n\nAl presionar start entramos a nuestro men\u00fa, bastante b\u00e1sico, tenemos varias pesta\u00f1as. Una donde nos muestran las armas o herramientas disponibles en el momento, otra es  el mapa y otra donde nos muestran la colecci\u00f3n de mejoras conseguidas en el juego. Ahora para conseguir estas mejoras debes craftearlas en alguna mesa  de trabajo, que est\u00e1n esparcidas por el mundo. Los materiales para craftear se encuentran esparcidos en todo el mapa, la mayor\u00eda los encuentras superando acertijos o abriendo zonas que antes no pod\u00edas, dedicarte a encontrar o tomar todos los materiales posibles, puede ser de gran ayuda. Las mejoras se pueden equipar, como ya dije anteriormente, en las estatuas y puedes repetir las bonificaciones obtenidas, por ejemplo si has crafteado 3 veces resistencia bajo el agua, puedes usar estas tres habilidades aumentando de forma enorme tu resistencia bajo el agua, ac\u00e1 las posibles configuraciones son grandes y forman parte importante para superar algunas zonas del juego de una manera m\u00e1s f\u00e1cil.\n\nControlar a nuestro personaje es muy satisfactorio, el trabajo en su jugabilidad es admirable, en ning\u00fan momento sent\u00ed incomodidad o disgusto. Lo mismo en el apartado gr\u00e1fico, el trabajo pixelart es fant\u00e1stico, al m\u00e1s puro estilo 16bits. El dise\u00f1o de enemigos es hermoso y los personajes del juego derrochan encanto en sus dise\u00f1os. Los enemigos finales, tambi\u00e9n tienen un dise\u00f1o espl\u00e9ndido y unas mec\u00e1nicas muy bien pensadas, convirti\u00e9ndolos en inolvidables. Su aspecto sonoro es maravilloso, la m\u00fasica nos acompa\u00f1a espl\u00e9ndidamente durante toda nuestra experiencia, los efectos de sonido est\u00e1n muy bien cuidados. Definitivamente en el apartado musical posee una personalidad potente. \n\nYa por \u00faltimo\u2026 la historia, aunque muchos no lo crean, es el aspecto m\u00e1s potente del juego, el desarrollo de personajes y la narrativa es fenomenal. Su cuidada trama sorprende constantemente. Ac\u00e1 Joaking Sanberg hizo un trabajo incre\u00edble, aunque la jugabilidad y mec\u00e1nica del juego es s\u00f3lida, fue su historia la que me empujaba a avanzar, cada personaje est\u00e1 repleto de detalles, logrando crear ese v\u00ednculo emocional con ellos. Pero adem\u00e1s la cr\u00edtica social y pol\u00edtica est\u00e1 muy bien mimetizada, no es una cr\u00edtica pedante sobre la disfunci\u00f3n social actual. Estos temas son tratados espl\u00e9ndidamente por el t\u00edtulo, es m\u00e1s, en algunos instantes pensaba que ese era el objetivo del juego, transmitir un mensaje social y pol\u00edtico de forma discreta, pero agradable. Leer su historia entendiendo el trasfondo mimetizado propuesto, ayuda much\u00edsimo a disfrutar el mensaje. Definitivamente el apartado m\u00e1s potente del juego, con un final, tal vez, pol\u00e9mico.\n\nIconoclasts es un trabajo maravilloso, cuando terminas el juego te deja satisfecho de muchas formas, sientes que se ha puesto amor en muchos apartados, tanto en cada mec\u00e1nica y dise\u00f1o de nivel, esto es gran parte del sistema viviente iconoclasts, su mundo fant\u00e1stico que con mucha personalidad, detalle y sumando su exquisita banda sonora, nos hace disfrutar nuestra traves\u00eda de forma sin igual. \n\nAgregarm como mentor: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9500231/\nEste an\u00e1lisis en v\u00eddeo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F", "timestamp_created": 1519128092, "timestamp_updated": 1519128092, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608414", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40239278": {"recommendationid": "40239278", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032250471", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518497721}, "language": "english", "review": "do yourself a favor, get this game\n\nthere are negatives\n\nit's worth it\n\nk bye", "timestamp_created": 1519087297, "timestamp_updated": 1519087297, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487288", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40234204": {"recommendationid": "40234204", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081678910", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 514, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519161900}, "language": "english", "review": "As an ode to Metroid Fusion this game certainly shines in revitalizing this certain spin on the metroidvania genre. And I think personally i can judge it best when comparing these two.\nJust look at the individual level designs (jungle, water, dark area....) and you see how far the inspiration goes.\nIt has likeable characters, good-feeling platforming, interesting upgrades, and a fair ammount of exploration. \n\nBut with copying this classic GBA-game it inherited some of its flaws.\nIt does get tedious sometimes, you do not feel like you have a lot of choice and you certainly will do the whole backtracking for 100% thing which was way better in MF. \nIt has a  good story with it's good share of twists and heartwarming moments but it doesnt give you as much of a creepy isolated feeling. The music is not as atmospheric, the agents are not the SA-X and the whole situation  you are in (graphics, location, NPCs and sound) feels more free and open instead of claustrophobic and eerie. \nOn the positive side I can say it feels remarkably good to control and I would expect nothing less from the creator of Noito Love 2: Devolution (which you should paly, it's cheap short pure fun).

As a narrative-driven game, the narrative is pretty strong for the most part with lots of twists and drama, deceptively dark for what is at first glance a rather lighthearted game. As far as the gameplay though, it's pretty average at best and kinda bad at worst. Not really... awful but mediocre on the whole, I guess.\n\nI think the big gripe I have with the gameplay is how much waiting is an element of the gameplay. Especially with the bomb gun & the puzzles builty around that, but the general pacing of the gameplay during anything besides boss battles tends to not be very... exciting. And even then, a lot of the boss battles aren't active fights, they're slow battles where you have to wait & dodge before getting a chance to attack, the worst kind of fight. The game is design as a metroidvania and I mean, kind of? The game is very much subdivided into smaller segments that are all not too large in their own right but there's some okay exploration to be had - though not much to find, since all you ever find are crafting materials and crafting recipes, and most of the tweaks save for a few of the hidden ones are not that useful. \n\nCharacter movement & combat is pretty fine though, Robin moves at a decent speed, has a decent jump, feels fine to control. The various weapons all have their uses and all work well enough. You also have a melee attack but that one's msotly pretty useless. The game also has mechanics it will outright never tell you about that are required to get some collectibles, which is... ehh. I can't say the game feels too short though, it took me around 12 hours to complete and a few extra hours past that to clean up everything I missed.\n\nAnd in terms of presentation the game looks great, very vivid and colorful environments, very animated and expressive character sprites, decent variety in enemies, soundtrack's passable I guess but not super compelling. But yeah the spritework is great. I feel like the developer spent a good chunk of the game's development time just on that and it shows, but it sort of felt like it came at the expense of gameplay design quality.\n\nI think if this developer got a few game designers to vet a lot of the gameplay ideas and trim out the weaker ones, this could've been a much better game, but as it is it's just a fine one with a pretty enjoyable (in the worst way) story. I don't regret playing it, I'd say I had a lot more fun than frustration overall, but I was never really feeling it too strongly.

Yes there have been some good ones but in an age where open world games are common, how much longer can a genre last that let's you stray down corridors that amount to dead ends. Constantly. Then again, my view might be tainted by just having played THIS game.\n\nIt started off alright, nice feel, responsive controls, but it didn't take long before the issues began to show. For starters things aren't very streamline. You need to stand on a box to pick it up, you need to press a button over a locked chest to use the key before actually opening the chest, little things that add up over time.\n\nOne of the games focal mechanics is a spanner. You can use it to mess with certain obstacles or attack, but doesn't really add anything at all, it's basically just a fancy \"interact with object\" button. It's not an issue as such, just seems a bit pointless.\n\nThe first big problem showed up in Settlement 17, the first town area. In order to progress you have to go round talking to all the NPCs. After I did so and nothing happened I was baffled. Turns out you have to talk to a boy for a second time once he enters his home. I thought NPCs just wandered round and it was a nice touch but nope. What I don't get is why they didn't just have the boy be two serperate charaters.\n\nBut I figured it out eventually and progressed onwards encountering the second boss. At this point theres a second character with you who shoots the enemies the boss spawns, when she feels like it at least. Sometimes she literally just stood there. Well anyway, first phase was alright, what you'd expect really. Then came the second phase. The boss has an attack where he throws the platform up into the ceiling. In order to avoid taking damage from the spikes above you must duck, afterwards the platform falls and damages the boss. Sounds alright, but let me point out THIS IS HIS ONLY ATTACK so you just have to stand there ducking for a while as the boss defeat's itself. Ok. Third phase was just as baffling, the boss is still under the platform but somehow your charge shot damages him anway, what?!\n\nThere are other issues I could talk about but really the games just boring. It's a puzzle platformer, but since the platforming is rarley challenging at all it just becomes tedious busywork required to solve the not so difficult puzzles. I think the only thing the game really has going for it is I got some enjoyment out of the writing or visual humor, but that's it. Don't play this game.

The sprites are absolutely gorgeous and play a big part in why the characters are so loveable, there's just small own animations for seemingly everyone. \nWhich is the second point: the character design and development is amazing, and very unexpected for this kind of game.\n\nAnd then there's the Story. Without spoiling too much, the initial premise of a happy, rather lighthearted game doesn't last very long, and even though the writing can be a bit weird at times (\"He can't touch us if he can't touch us!\") by the turning point I found myself focusing entirely on the main story just because I wanted to see what comes next. Now, granted, I am someone who loves deep and extensive lore, there might be a bit too much dialogue for other people, especially in the beginning. But then again, in my opinion this is a game you should play for its story, because that's its strongest point.\n\nThe gameplay is... well, it is what it is. The general levels are less \"action platformer\" and more light puzzles with the occasional medium difficulty jump or timed tech, with the more complicated stuff used to hide secrets. And boy, are there a lot of secrets. The vast majority of them are \"just\" chests with materials for the upgrade system - which doesn't really have THAT much of an impact aside from letting you access a few areas and some combat/speedrunning perks that are pretty helpful, but I enjoyed the challenge of finding them nonetheless. (Except that one chest in the tower. Except that one. You know who you are.)\nThe best parts gameplaywise are definitely the bosses, with most of them having their own gimmicks making use of all your mechanics, some of which aren't even meant for combat in the first place. There's kind of two types of bosses in this: the gimmicky ones that are basically puzzles for your various abilities, and the good old \"kill them before they kill you\" one on one fights against the antagonists and some other strong fighters. The optional bosses (yes, they exist. go look for them ;) include my favorite one in the entire game, which I ironcally only found in the first place because I wanted to 100% it.\n\nSo, yeah. Platforming is definitely not the point of this game, and while you can optionally use your new abilities to backtrack for secrets in earlier areas the game itself is very linear, with new areas opening up not because of your new abilities like in a Castlevania game, but because of story.\nNeither is regular combat, pretty much all regular enemies are very basic and only pose a threat if you rush through them or encounter a new one you haven't met before, or when combined with environmental hazards. The bosses are fantastic though. I do recommend playing on the Harder difficulty, as even then regular enemies are laughably easy and easy may turn the bosses into cakewalks, which would take a lot away from one of the parts where this game shines the most.\n\nIf you want a game that's not too difficult gameplaywise, shines in art, music, characters and story while also giving you some puzzles and lots of secrets to hunt for, this is the game for you.", "timestamp_created": 1518733745, "timestamp_updated": 1518733745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40108238": {"recommendationid": "40108238", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028020795", "num_games_owned": 3496, "num_reviews": 129, "playtime_forever": 613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518671982}, "language": "english", "review": "Video review (including score): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJIBoRVEjfM\nIconoclasts is so similar to Owlboy that it is basically criminal. Art, gameplay mechanics, and even the way the story is outlined are just about the same. That is not necessarily a bad thing however, as Iconoclasts is a good game regardless.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[b]Enemy variety.[/b] Iconoclasts does a great job when it comes to enemy variety, a very important trait for metroidvania games. New enemies are constantly introduced, sometimes several at once. The credits for the game have a \u201ccreature\u201d section that lists every enemy in the game and I was surprised by just how many I had forgotten about simply because there were so many in the game. And that does not mean that the attack types and such grew stale either. Each enemy has their own unique attack and method of elimination. Many of the enemies require a different combination of moves to eliminate, so it is not like the player can get through just spamming one attack.\n\n[b]Fun boss fights.[/b] This is more an extension of the previous point, but the game also offers a variety of fun boss fights. In fact, the most difficult puzzle in the game is just figuring out how to kill the different bosses. I actually got stuck quite a few times because of this. The bosses make excellent use of the different gameplay mechanics to offer up exciting, yet sometimes challenging battles.\n\n[b]Crazy story.[/b] The story here in Iconoclasts is on such a large scale and just does not make any sense at times, but it was an absolute blast to play through. Some of the characters encountered in the game are absolutely crazy and have some really excellent dialogue to go along with that crazy. I am sure that a lot of effort went into making this game\u2019s story complex, yet interesting, but it came off as a comedy more than anything to me. I like to believe that was intended and, as a result, the game was much more enjoyable.\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[b]Controls can be annoying at times.[/b] One mistake I made constantly throughout the game was touching the analog stick when grabbing onto a rail. Doing so caused my character to jump off of the anchor point rather than hold onto it and glide along the rail. In order to use the rails, I had to keep my hand off of the analog stick. It did not feel right, as normally one would move the analog stick in the direction they wish to go, but in this case it can actually cause an unfair death. For a game that stresses constant movement, this aspect just did not fit in.\n\n[b]Tweak variety.[/b] Iconoclasts includes a number of tweaks scattered throughout the game world. These tweaks, once found, can then be crafted and equipped, with the player being able to hold three at a time. The mechanic itself is nothing new, and was a good addition, but the game just lacks in variety here. The game barely has ten total tweaks, with only two or three of them actually being useful. There is only one tweak that adds anything new to the gameplay, the rest just make the game less annoying. For example, there is one that increases the player\u2019s run speed and another that just makes it so the player can charge up their wrench in one spin rather than two. Both of these just serve to save time for the player. The game could really do with some more gameplay-changing tweaks.\n\n[b]Wonky difficulty.[/b] There are two difficulty options to choose from at the start of the game: standard mode and harder mode. I went with standard expecting a light challenge. I was surprised to find that most of the game is painfully easy on this difficulty. Most of my deaths were due to stupid mistakes or me not realizing how to finish off a boss, rather than the fights just being difficult. I had more trouble clearing certain enemy sequences than many of the game\u2019s bosses. Some of the later bosses were much, much easier than earlier bosses, giving so many health drops that I could tank several hits and still be fine. The difficulty was just all over the place. The \u201cstandard\u201d difficulty would be better off relabeled as \u201ceasy\u201d and the inclusion of a \u201cvery hard\u201d difficulty would work wonders.\n\n[h1]Overall:[/h1]\nIconoclasts does a lot of good when it comes to the metroidvania genre. The gameplay mechanics are slick, the enemy and boss variety is excellent, and the story is just crazy. However, the difficulty, tweak variety, and controls could use a little work. If you are a fan of Owlboy or similar games, then definitely give Iconoclasts a look.\n\nFull review: https://cublikefoot.com/2018/02/15/iconoclasts-actual-game-review/", "timestamp_created":

platformer by Konjak, the guy behind things like the Noitu Love games and Legend of Princess. It tells the adventures of Robin (Alondra in Spain), a mechanic girl in a world where being a mechanic without a license is considered a sin. A society/cult/megacorp called One Concern hunts her down to put her to death for her crime. When running from the Concern, she makes wonderful friends, fights ruthless enemies and goes on an adventure to put down the cult for good.\n\nSounds like your average Saturday morning cartoon, right?\n\nWRONG!\n\nStrap yourself tight, because that's just the beginning of the story! What follows after that is a wild ride in the rollercoaster of feels as a plot that you would see on a JRPG rather than a metroidvania unfolds, all of it peppered with vibrantly colored graphics, fluid and expressive animations and a really neat soundtrack. The story alone makes it worth it.\n\nThat said, while the story is neat, the gameplay... Could use some polishing. It is not based so much around gathering abilities and fighting, but about solving puzzles. Jumping puzzles, block puzzles, switch puzzles and so on. Oh, yes, there is fighting, but I feel that the enemies are secondary to the puzzles. These puzzles can be frustrating from time to time, and, to be honest, I didn't feel very accomplished when finding out the solution to a puzzle, since they are rather obvious and simply require that you get the abilities that let you solve them. The bosses are pretty good, however, with some very memorable ones at the middle road and the final stretch of the game.\n\nThere is also a crafting system: Along the game, you gather diagrams for various upgrades you can use, as well as materials to craft those upgrades. It's a very simple system, though, and you need to equip them in slots, which get disabled as you take damage, so I felt that, other than the ones that let you take extra hits without losing life points, most of them were pointless.\n\nTo summarize, Iconoclasts is not the end all, be all metroidvania. In my eyes, that position is for La-Mulana. However, despite its gameplay having some flaws, it is entertaining for as long as it lasts, and the story is beautiful. And, what the heck, it was made by a single person over the span of 11 years! That's an accomplishment in and of itself!\n\nYou should not buy it at full price, but on a sale, even a small one, it is worth grabbing.", "timestamp_created": 1518563909, "timestamp_updated": 1518564250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40056553": {"recommendationid": "40056553", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994904389", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518977359}, "language": "english", "review": "As a fan of previous Konjak's works and someone who had relatively high hopes for this, I'm quite disappointed. It's an Owlboy's syndrome all over again: when a particular game sits quite long in the oven, but ends up lackluster after release. Iconoclasts is not *that* much dissapointing mind you, but it still made me question my 20 dollar purchase.\n\n[i]\"So what is wrong with Iconoclasts?\"[/i], you may ask. The short answer is that the moment-to-moment gameplay is too shallow and its story isn't up to scratch to pick up the slack. The long answer is little more nuanced, but basically you can boil everything down to those two main aspects. The presentation (animations, sprites) don't leave a lot to be desired and music is okay-ish enough to not consider it a major point in my review.\n\nKonjak's previous work - Noitu Love 2 - was a action-platfoming showpiece that was high-octane fun, no matter which side to looked at it. It was extremely tight in the design. In opposition, Iconoclasts' mechanics try many things at once and in the end the game overall severely lack focus where it matters the most. Game is supposedly a Metroidvania, but it lacks the level interconnection, meaningful upgrades (there are some, but they are few and far between) and you aren't really forced to backtrack that much. This on itself isn't bad - it simply means that it lacks the classic Metroidvania pacing.\n\nUnfortunately in its place comes lackluster combat, tedious puzzles and admittedly decent boss fights. Hitting things with wrench and pistol is snappy, but enemies aren't numerous, difficulty is very forgiving and every encounter feels like on the autopilot without the expected excitement (especially with generous auto-aiming present). This, on its very own, is quite disappointing seeing Konjak's previous works, but the puzzles are the main show ruiners.\n\nYour character is a mechanic by trade, so game tries to paint it with puzzle solving build around traversing rooms with a lot of moving, controllable platforms, blocks and screws to spin. Those are numerous and often times they are the main source of the tedium, mostly because of them being quite sizeable and hard to parse. Additionally, you character feels quite unfit for the job: always shooting block-pushing projectiles very slowly, spinning the wrench way too many times to electrify it and waiting to de-electrify said wrench when you don't want to have machinery-enabling arcs running out of you. Puzzle segments take a sizeable chunk of the playtime and they never really felt satisfying to solve, leaving the sour taste between all other attractions.\n\nExploration in-between puzzles also feels bad with generic rewards that are used for the upgrade crafting system that adds very little to the game. Buffs provided from this system are miniscule and unrequited, leaving the treasure chest hunt and crafting a bland endeavor.\n\nFortunately, most of the boss fights are great. They are big, beautifully animated and quite climactic in many instances. While normal combat often times feels quite mediocre, those encounters squeeze all the potential good from the system and turn them into quite an enjoyable moments. Some bosses are the bad examples, but the overall takeaway is that they are probably the best parts of the game gameplay-wise.\n\nWaiting for the game to be released, I wasn't really that excited about the gameplay itself. I was very much intrigued by the story. I hoped that even if mechanics will turn out mediocre, plot will bring everything up back on its feet. I'm quite sad that this is not what really happened.\n\nPlot is very convoluted, dialogue often times heavy-handed and the cast is pretty much unlikeable all across the board with few exceptions. Robin as a main character is often times mute and doesn't bring much to the table story-wise other than being extremely determined and helpful to others. Mina is a jerk, Elro ends up being apathetic and that leaves Royal as the only party member that despite his arrogance is at least somewhat entertaining. Side villains are also relatively fun (General Chrome especially), but their dialogue often times leaves them somewhat hard to get, especially with the poorly-telegraphed intrigue in the background. Rest of the characters fall flat, with the special case of prominent villain that enters the story quite late and leaves it as fast as a con artist with your wallet.\n\nStory meanders and turns at below-average pace and with spotty world-building (game world is unique and extensively explained, but not to the lengths I wished for) it didn't really grab me as much I would liked to. Thankfully, the last few hours save the plot a little, by providing bigger stakes, better spotlight on the best characters and decently written conflict and struggles. While I was nonchalantly unconnected with the world of Iconoclasts for the most of the playtime, the later fragments finally grabbed me in. I risen an eyebrow on the last phase of the last boss due to ridiculous tonal shift, but overall, Iconoclasts cast and plot recovered just before the end credits.\n\nAll in all, I'm still quite negatively surprised with the game. It's by no means as bad case as Owlboy, where there was absolutely no meat to the game present, but Iconoclasts doesn't impress where it's most important and delivers the lukewarm platforming experience with the story that could use many [i]tweaks[/i] in various places. It feels like the years of development eroded the edge that every game should have to feel exciting and new. Game doesn't really bring anything new to the table and everything else feels \"okay\". Unfortunately, on the current market, being \"okay\" is not enough.\n\nI hope that Konjak will learn heavily from this. His next project should either go in the different direction or learn from the mistakes made here. Noitu Love 3, maybe?\n\n[i]Like this review?

IDEAL FOR NEW PLATFORMER PLAYERS OR CHILDREN, BORING FOR METROIDVANIA VETERANS.\n\nPros:\n\n-Good controls, they are quick and comfortable.\n\n-Interesting set of weapons and combat options, the delay and overload in weapons makes you observe and plan instead of mindlessly going gung ho.\n\n-Creative puzzles. You have to use your weapons to solve them and every one fill a specific role in these puzzles. The best aspect of this game, no doubt about it.\n\n-Bosses are built around the puzzles you can solve with your weapons, there are really interesting encounters. Other top aspect of this game. EDIT: the 2 secret bosses aren't built around this and shows.\n\n-Pixel art and animations are really good, every character had loads of different animations and have good flow.\n\nCons:\n\n-Short game. 10 hours max if you wander a little or lose some time getting upgrades. Roughly half duration of base Hollow Knight.\n\n-The only replayability reason for now are harder runs. A boss rush would have been interesting and easy to do.\n\n-Very, VERY, LITTLE MUCHO simplistic map. For a metroidvania the map feels linear. Small zones even compared to old Super Metroid, there are 2 \"secret\" bosses unlockables by doing a \"find shit around the map for the lulz\" which I didn't realize they were there until I read a guide. I wasn't really encouraged to stray from the path and find these myself and that kills these type of games. The worse aspect of all.\n\n-Equipable upgrades are bad designed. Unlike Hollow Knight where charm combinations dictated your playstyle or focus, the more defining upgrades in this game are completely skippable and often worse alternatives to the typical shield upgrade for bosses and/or run speed and/or more breath. Also, they don't change gameplay much and given the upgrades can be lost by taking damage they are quite unreliable. And I personally skipped them until I read a guide because I didn't care to explore that much since everything was on rails.\n\n-Plot. The plot becomes more and more dramatic but still feels cheesy and have some nonsensical or unexplained turns. Worse example of this is the final boss, it just doesn't make any fucking sense and is not explained at all. I know it's a tribute to other game, but ffs, IT'S THE FUCKING FINAL BOSS.\n\n-Characters. I want to distinguish between the MC and the rest of the cast and why they fail in the mix of both. MC is the classic blank character which doesn't talk. I don't have any problems with that, the Knight from Hollow Knight is that type of character, Samus was mute too in Super Metroid and Zero Mission. But you can't make a mute character when she is not only participating in conversations but also you have to choose the answer in those conversations. We can imagine how she is more or less but when you have this much text talking directly to the MC you can't make her mute because it just gives the impression she just does whatever she is told to. Don't give us expectations of a developing character, just make conversations short and don't give options.\n\nAnd the rest of the cast has their own formed persona, there are a lot of character clashes. They are way too warring and bullheaded, it's really difficult to have simpathy for them or their motivations.\n\n-Rushed end. Like I said before, the final boss doesn't make sense and that is because nothing is explained nor it have many exposition in the game, at a certain point things happen faster and faster. Between its revealing and the final fight we could have perfectly at least 2 hours or a pair of new maps. I know this is not a big production and has been pretty much done by one person but there was a missing opportunity there, I suppose there is nothing much to do about it.\n\nMinor concerns:\n\n-You can't attack in diagonal with melee weapon. Other weapons have diagonal attacks, it could have perfectly have and would reduce some frustration with its use in climbing situations.\n\n-Few weapons. This is just me being unfair since every weapon has its own very specific use in combat and puzzles and designing a new weapon with that idea in mind is hard to implement. I had this same concern in Hollow Knight, the thing here is the MC is a mechanic who uses different type of devices, I'd like to see more.\n\n-No arena. While this game's main focus isn't combat it would have been interesting having an arena like many other Castlevania games or Hollow Knight. A bit of combat expertise hard check it's always stimulating. There is only one situation in the game with that mentality but it's too short.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile this game is underwhelming for veterans, I recommend it, specially if you haven't played platformers since this is one is easy to start in them. If you are a veteran just lower your expectations, it's not a horrible game. I hope it receives some love in form of DLC, expansion or second part, it has a lot of potential.", "timestamp_created": 1518515454, "timestamp_updated": 1518828422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0,

Well yes, if what you're looking for is a hyper-detailed kind of pixel art, but sadly not quite so if you seek a more artsy product. The pixel art in Iconoclasts often feels lacking an artistic vision and, despite being impressive in terms of mere technical abilities, may fail in leaving a lasting impact.\n\nThe story, on the other hand, is pretty great for a game like this, with some memorable characters tackling deep and serious themes.\n\nThe gameplay is sadly the worst aspect of the game. Feeling fresh at first, the progression based around solving puzzles to acquire the skills needed to open the pathways to progress further gets stale pretty quickly due to a poorly balanced backtracking that will see you go endlessly back and forth through empty stages in order to proceed. The boss fights also fail to improve the overall pace of the game due to their trivial difficulty even at the highest level.\n\nAll things considered, it's a game worth playing and a quite impressive one, coming from the mind and hands of a single person, but that probably won't leave you mesmerized, unless you're part of a very strict niche of gamers looking for this kind of pixel art.", "timestamp_created": 1518453302, "timestamp_updated": 1518453588, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.615378", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40026673": {"recommendationid": "40026673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061128125", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 895, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518447920}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts is a peculiar combination of story-telling strategies and gameplay. An amassed history of experience with both interactive and non-interactive media will make Iconoclasts sit uneasy on your tongue, so to speak, like a cookie with both raisins and chocolate chips. There is a heavy focus on storytelling and world-building. While the strategies to imbed these into the game vary in success, the world being conveyed is wonderfully intriguing. Strong narrative themes of religion, family, purpose, and interpersonal interaction take center stage. The guns, moveset, puzzles, enemy and level design are all solid. There is also a good amount of speed tech for the game like jump cancelling your slide down a slope to gain horizontal speed, or turning around mid-charge shot for a boost. Iconoclasts is incredibly impressive considering how much work one man put into it, and I was surprised that it lasted me about 12 dense hours to complete my first playthrough. The injection of humor and very tragic story content can create and mixed and unpredictable tone which is not objectively good or bad but contributes to a unique flavor.

Les combats de boss, eux, sont vari\u00e9s et pas trop frustrants dans l'ensemble.\n\nLe visuel : Le style est joli et les animations sont soign\u00e9es, mais la DA manque quand m\u00eame d'inventivit\u00e9. Les designs de personnages sont sympas, mais les d\u00e9cors sont tr\u00e8s conventionnels. Une for\u00eat, un d\u00e9sert, des couloirs... Il y avait moyen d'injecter un peu plus de piquant l\u00e0-dedans. C'est pareil pour les ennemis : les boss proposent bien des designs un peu fouill\u00e9s et plus frappants, mais les monstres et autres soldats sont vraiment quelconques.\n\nL'histoire : On en arrive au point n\u00e9vralgique. Iconoclasts est fortement inspir\u00e9 de Monster World 4 et met son sc\u00e9nario en avant encore plus que son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur. Il y a plein de sc\u00e8nes de dialogues entre personnages majeurs et mineurs, la progression est r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement entrecoup\u00e9e par des set pieces et des sc\u00e8nes d'action non interactives. Attention, qu'on soit bien clair : ce n'est pas un d\u00e9faut ! Au contraire, j'appr\u00e9cie tout ce qui est jeu narratif. Non, l\u00e0 le probl\u00e8me, c'est que tout est fouillis dans cette histoire. Il y a des id\u00e9es int\u00e9ressantes et de bonnes surprises, mais il manque bien cinq ou six passes d'edit pour en faire un r\u00e9cit qui tient debout. Les dialogues sont parfois trop vagues et sybillins, ou juste \u00e9trangement formul\u00e9s. Tout le lore sur les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pass\u00e9s et la raison d'\u00eatre de cette soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est volontairement obscur et reste en retrait par rapport \u00e0 l'aventure des h\u00e9ros. Des flashbacks et des moments tragiques surviennent un peu n'importe quand, sans grand effet. Les motivations des personnages sont floues et leurs arcs se terminent en queue de poisson. C'est tellement dommage ! Il y a quand m\u00eame un chouette r\u00e9cit d'aventure au c\u0153ur de tout \u00e7a, avec des persos bien d\u00e9marqu\u00e9s et une mont\u00e9e dans les tours sur la fin, mais \u00e7a sonne toujours un peu faux, maladroit.\n\nEt malgr\u00e9 tout \u00e7a, je peux pas dire que j'ai pass\u00e9 un mauvais moment. La fin est intense, les niveaux sont plaisants \u00e0 parcourir, il y a des secrets planqu\u00e9s un peu partout. Un bon jeu, donc, mais qui aurait pu \u00eatre mieux.", "timestamp_created": 1518378182, "timestamp_updated": 1518378182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40009357": {"recommendationid": "40009357", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980186686", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 55, "playtime_forever": 1054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517782550}, "language": "english", "review": "There' a huge amount of iconoclasty to this game.\n\nEven though, I think I prefer the name \"Ivory Springs\"", "timestamp_created": 1518376279, "timestamp_updated": 1518376279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40009004": {"recommendationid": "40009004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047660397", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2181, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519388953}, "language": "russian", "review": "Iconoclasts -

If you want a game that's about people, play this one.\n\n1. The game is about people\na. some of the best characters I've ever seen in a game, are in this game.  The humor, the quirkyness, the feeling of realism is every bit as professional as in the best Bioware moments.\nb. some of the greatest environments (conceptually) I've ever played in.\n\n2. Interesting mechanics\na. mechanics build on themselves over time\nb. main character doesn't seem to kill anyone--which is a huge accomplishment for any game\n\n3. Good Art\na. Art has tons of character.  I'm a big fan.\n\n4. Good sense of humor\na. I really appreciate the sense of humor.  If you don't, then it will probably grate on your nerves.  (Also you're too serious)\n\n5. Shocking emotional depth for any videogame, book, or film\na. I put this at #5, because I don't expect it to be a plus for everyone.  If you want to see an argument between two NPCs that's so real, you feel like you need to leave the room, this is a great title for you.  If you are continuously disappointed by characterization in shooters, this might be a welcome relief.  (If you've never thought about character development in shooters before, you may not enjoy the amount you see in this game)\n\n6. Subversive Social Commentary\na. It's pretty intense.  If you feel like questioning your beliefs is a bad thing to do, you may find the amount of growing the games asks of you painful.\n\nFinal note: this reveiw is based on my first ~9 hours of playing.

So, I'm just gonna gush real fast:\n\nThe mechanics are creative and interesting - puzzling through rooms utilizing the various abilities you've collected was satisfying, combat (especially against bosses) was satsifying, and the narrative decisions and player-agency were engrossing, enrapturing, engaging en-d other words. In fact the biggest applause I have to give this game, as much fun as the gameplay itself was, is the world-building and narrative presentation. The setting intrigued me immediately, and the story is paced in an exciting way. The characters grabbed my attention, and I felt my own sense of emotion towards each one, and one scene in particular will probably be the thing I will always remember this game for - and how it wasn't a cutscene at all, but rather a set of actions the player themselves has to do.\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but it is damn good where it counts.", "timestamp_created": 1517978119, "timestamp_updated": 1517978346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516345", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39901060": {"recommendationid": "39901060", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966604206", "num_games_owned": 348, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520056926}, "language": "english", "review": "So far the more I play the more I like it. There's only been one \"unusually difficult\" mini-boss that ticked me off because you had to beat it repeatedly, but so far I really like the game and I'm eager to get further. \n\nPlease note that there are \"destination hints\" on your map when you're looking for a particular item, even if the game never mentions that fact. Helped me a lot once I finally figured out that you can tell where the things you NEED actually are. \n\nIf you really like metroidvanias, this is a good one.\n\n--------\n\nBeat the game and I still recommend it.

It was very satisfying and well-made; I'm actually glad I paid full price, to support the designer. \n\nA little bit of commentary / constructive criticism:\n\nThe % completed meter is misleading, it's the % of stuff you've found. You can beat the game with % complete still showing around 50%, which caught me by surprise. \n\nThe name of a Tweak when you pick up its schematic is totally different from what it will be in your crafting table, which was VERY confusing. I kept thinking it was a bug. \n\n- I had issues finding any of the \"optional\" boss fights, despite looking up spoilers- they just didn't trigger. Bothersome. Are they not available before you beat the game the first time? Well, optional stuff can be well hidden. I may have just missed a requirement somewhere. \n\nThe difficulty curve is quite nice- in retrospect, the times when I felt horribly unable to progress were when I was just tired. Try again fresh the next day, beat the boss with relative ease. \n\nThere were a few places where *I* would really have added a save point or a checkpoint, just so folks didn't have to repeatedly skip cut-scenes to try the same boss again, but it's a minor complaint.

I had only heard of it a few months ago and thought the art look nice. Then I heard that it was like Cave Story and Owlboy and decided to pick it up. Just wanted to put that out there since I've been seeing what I think are people having set unrealistically high expectations for it.\n\nTo start off, the art is great! It immediately gave me vibes of Owlboy with how detailed the art and animations were. The dev really put work into those. The environments are quite nice, albeit feeling like I was seeing the same texture within the zones. The performance is great as well. I was running it on my laptop and only had a frame drop when I had a Windows Defender notification. The music is also pretty sweet too, ranging from happy tunes to intense melodies as the story progresses.\n\nThe gameplay surprised me in this. I love myself some good bosses and the bosses are all genuinelly unique and interesting. I was continually surprised at how cool I felt the boss designs and encounters were, if you are going to play this game for anything, the bosses are one of the highlights!\n\nThe other stuff that you do during gameplay is pretty much your standard 2D action puzzle/platformer fare, though that's not a knock on that by any means, it's really well executed and the puzzles are genuinelly challenging and fair. It just doesn't appeal to me as much.\n\nThe story was what surprised me the most about this game! I don't get invested in stories and characters that often. You can imagine my surprise when I found myself not wanting to put the game down for the sake of finding out what happened next, and what was going to befall those characters. Also, special shoutout to the dev for making Black such a compelling villian and character. Her arc is in my opinion, one of the best and saddest things that I've played through since NieR: Automata. \n\nAll in all I found Iconoclasts to be a pleasant surprise! If you like games like Owlboy and Cave Story which focus more on the narrative and having more of a scripted and paced feel, then don't hesitate to pick this one up when you are able.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1517766124, "timestamp_updated": 1517766124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39847315": {"recommendationid": "39847315", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058560532", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517729837}, "language": "english", "review": "Well worth the wait.

It starts out FANTASTIC. The game looks amazing: the graphical style isn't just your bog standard 16 bit retro style, but a more evolved pixel look. The soundtrack is great, the controls are fairly tight and the Metroidvania elements are paced just right. I constantly felt like I was progressing at a steady pace and the constant drip of new abilities allowed me a nice loop of advancing the story, going back to get some treasures I couldn't reach before, and then repeating.\n\nThe story is more mature than most in games, and deals with fairly heavy stuff like organized religion and the complicated mess that is personal relationships, be they between siblings, lovers or parents and children. For the first 2/3 of the game I was enthralled and really loving the game.\n\nSadly, Iconoclasts kind of outlasts its welcome. Towards the end of the game some of the encounters and fights start to feel frustrating, some of the boss fights might be interesting as ideas but poor as far as execution goes and generally I felt more and more like the game should've ended already. My frustration was mounting and I found myself just waiting for it all to end, more out of obligation to finish the game I'd already sunk 8 hours into than a real desire to see where it all ended up.\n\nAfter completing the game I am happy I did so, because Iconoclasts does stick the landing. It could've benefitted from tighter editing (chopping off an hour or so would've done the game wonders) and I found some pretty strange bugs (after about halfway through the game I kept finding new Tweak blueprints but they never appeared on my crafting menu) and so on. For a game made essentially by a single person Iconoclasts is a remarkable achievement, especially considering the engine its built on. I'd say overall it's worth playing, but with some tighter editing and probably a bit wider outside testing it could've been an amazing game.

The game doesn't really explain its world much at first, preferring to drop you in the middle of things and let you piece things together as you go. To make matters worse, though most of the writing is good, some of the dialogue is kinda clunky, possibly because the developer is from Sweden so English isn't their first language, and the game wasn't really clicking with me as a result.

It's not exceptional or amazing, but it doesn't do anything wrong either. You control a young woman named Robin, who has an interest and a knack for mechanics and technology. Sadly, however, in this world, technology is tightly controlled and holy, so fixing or knowing about them is against the divine authority. \n\nThe story is quite basic, girl gets in trouble with authorities, runs away, makes new friends and the friends uncover secrets of the world almost by accident while helping other friends. But the story works, the characters are interesting with clear personalities, which are kept throughout the game and are shown in dialogue and actions of said characters. The world and its lore are introduced in good chunks with a good interval between action. Art is charming and the beautiful world enhances the experience. Only noticeable annoyance in world building is the size of the cast. A lot of characters are introduced, but there are quite a few that nothing is done with, they just disappear when you scroll to the next screen.\n\nGame mechanics are solid with a good amount of variety. Different equipment is used throughout the game as upgrades are made available. The puzzles don't offer much of a brain tease, but they do not repeat themselves and do ask somewhat agile actions from time to time. Boss fights are numerous and interesting. Many bosses have quite unique mechanics that require the use of different tools to defeat them. However, for experienced gamers I do recommend skipping the standard mode as the game is quite forgiving on taking damage and boss fights can be a bit too easy as they require a lot of hits to take you out.\n\nOverall, I do recommend Iconoclasts for anyone looking for a solid 2D action platformer and some puzzles.", "timestamp_created": 1517606636, "timestamp_updated": 1517606636, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39796388": {"recommendationid": "39796388", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961858362", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 928, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517595186}, "language": "english", "review": "Only game I will ever review on steam.

One of the few games I felt no compunction paying full price for, to support a solo developer.\nOn to my thoughts-\n\nPros:\n\nGood control setup - had no problem going through the whole game using keyboard, and the ability to remap keys is always welcome (sad that it even has to be said, but so many developers now seem to force feed their preferred XBOX360 controller mapping on you.)  The game has come a long way from the original alpha, which required near-pixel-perfect timing to get wrench parkour working properly.\n\nGreat story - a few plot twists, and enough focus on the in-game lore to keep you hooked in to find out where things will go next.\n\nArt style, sound and music all get high marks.\n\nCons:\n\nNot sure what really qualifies as a con - on to nitpicks.\n\nNitpicks:\n\nThe silent protagonist - not a new idea, and by no means out-of-place... but towards the end of the game, you really wish Robin could more clearly share what she's seen with the other characters, or give a glimpse of her own thoughts at the end of the adventure.\n\nClosure - it feels like a lot of loose ends were left at the end.  It's not an unusual desire to want a bit more story, after the playable end of a story, to see if the world you've just finished saving has learned anything that might keep them from embarking down the path to ruin all over again.\n\nAs others have said, some of the chests on the 100% list can be easily missed, and are rather difficult to track down without looking up walkthroughs.\n\nI saw another reviewer comment on awkward phrasing in the dialog.  Although I can see the point, not everyone is an English major (I sure ain't), and the dialog is more cohesive than many written communications I've received from college graduates, in my work life.

That's just plain boring. This game instead has your character improving changing the entire gameplay as the hours go by.\n\nThis is the epitome of platforming.

It takes risks in the story, the puzzles in no way hold your hand so it actually challenges the player, the game actually does something new for once in making a platforming game feel fresh again.

Like Owlboy, laying into Iconoclasts is painful because of how much effort has clearly gone into the game. This is a ten year project and is the effort of a single creator, and tearing into such a stunning piece of pixel art kind of breaks my heart.\n\nI think part of my lukewarm opinion of the game stems from my own expectations, which is perhaps a little unfair. As a linear puzzle/platformer punctuated by spectacular boss fights, Iconoclasts isn\u2019t bad at all though I\u2019d say it never really strays into greatness. The controls are slick, the puzzles and combat are mostly well designed (if a little repetitive), and while I was never amazed it all comes together quite nicely.\n\nHowever, all the reviews of the game paint it as a metroidvania and if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after then Iconoclasts kind of sucks. There\u2019s maybe five upgrades doled out through the game over its generous 12-15 hour runtime, and some of those are minor upgrades to previous tools. The rest of the collectables are schematics and materials to build \u201ctweaks\u201d \u2013 little upgrades that you can apply to your character. You can equip three, and they\u2019re things like slightly faster movement speed or slightly more damage. They make so little difference they might as well not be there. There are no upgrades to health, tweak slots or indeed anything that might actually make you want to seek out any of these secrets.\n\nThe other big selling point of Iconoclasts is the narrative, which is a shame as the writing is straight up awful. Scenes seem to go on endlessly with clunky, poorly translated dialogue straight out of Golden Sun, and you bet your ass there\u2019s some terrible attempts at humour too. The plot itself is almost incomprehensible, partly because of the rotten dialogue and partly because the game neglects to actually explain what anything in this fictional world actually is or how any of it works. Like Final Fantasy XIII there\u2019s a large degree of assumed knowledge and everything is packed with nonsense terminology. Several scenes that I\u2019m sure were supposed to be shocking twists fell completely flat, particularly concerning the infighting within the enemy faction as I wasn\u2019t even aware there WERE subfactions until the inevitable betrayal.\n\nAs a last complaint Iconoclasts seems to forget what type of game it is for the last 2-3 hours. Prior to that point it was a somewhat relaxed puzzle platformer with the occasional high octane boss fight to break things up. Near the end the game becomes a nonstop combat and boss gauntlet and the pacing goes out of the window. As set pieces the bosses are a lot of fun, but throwing you up against five in a row is just tedious and exhausting. I will say however that the difficulty curve does seem to be generally well calibrated, and on standard difficulty Iconoclasts might actually be a little on the easy side.\n\nIn conclusion, if you loved Owlboy (and it certainly had plenty of fans), then you\u2019ll almost certainly enjoy Iconoclasts as they share the same facets (or flaws, if you\u2019re feeling less charitable). I found the writing clunky and obtuse, others may enjoy the wordiness and ambiguity. I found the metroidvania aspects shallow and irrelevant, but you may find the direct, linear story appealing. So overall, I didn\u2019t love Iconoclasts, but I didn\u2019t hate it either \u2013 it\u2019s just, you know, alright.", "timestamp_created": 1517425929, "timestamp_updated": 1517437240, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 155, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714683", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39750620": {"recommendationid": "39750620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198168033116", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520215009}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing and lovingly crafted platformer that was a joy to play through. There was a lot packed into this experience, and my first run took about 12 hours. It posed a comfortable challenge, and rarely felt unfair. The puzzles were interesting, and kept mixing in new elements that kept things fresh. I enjoyed the deep story, and a lot of the characters were pretty well fleshed out; although I did find myself liking the side characters a lot more than the main cast, who tended to irritate me at times. Agent Black was easily the best character in the entire game, and she only got better as things progressed.\n\nI only really have a few negative points to make, but they're ultimately rather minor. Firstly, I didn't find myself liking most of the main characters who tag along with you. Mina is fine, but Royal was very annoying and whiney, and Elro legitimately angered me multiple times. He was definitely my least favourite of the entire cast. There were also a few gameplay moments that were low-points for me as well, such as a point in the snowy mountain area where I straight up got stuck with no idea where to go, and the game itself didn't really give me a decent indication, so I eventually had to look it up. I liked Mina as a character, but she wasn't nearly as fun to play as Robin, as she felt somewhat stiff to control. This was particularly glaring at one point in the game where she gets an auto-scrolling section, which was a little frustrating due to how awkward it was to shoot down some of the hazards. This was also followed by a painfully slow section with Elro that really wasn't fun to play at all. I also noticed that the eyepatch he wears would occasionally switch positions relative to another injury he had, and that kind of inconsistency is honestly quite distracting to me.\n\nWith all that said though, this was a great experience, and well worth the $20 price.

I'll put it this way: I pre-ordered Monster Hunter: World and have only played it once, since I wanted to finish this game first.\n\nIconoclasts mixes metroidvania style gameplay with puzzle platforming, though it goes far heavier into the puzzle side of things than the combat. Even boss battles are really puzzles, requiring thought and strategy to overcome. The game itself is beautiful, featuring a story that--while certainly not lacking in social commentary--manages to pull off an engaging narrative with memorable, multi-faceted characters at the helm. \n\nThis isn't an especially difficult game in Normal mode. It's not easy, but you won't typically find yourself stuck on a section for longer than a few tries. Puzzles are just nuanced enough to make you feel smart for solving them on your own, and boss battles are creative and fun enough to be enjoyable even if you die a few times trying to figure them out.\n\nI would recommend Iconoclasts to anyone who enjoyed Cave Story, and anyone who enjoys puzzle platformers in general.

rollercoaster-ride of sorts. From the get-go, I knew this game was for me. Metroidvania-platformer mainly reminding me of Cave Story+ - which isn't a bad thing. You run around and shoot stuff with your gun and get other guns and so far so Cave Story. Then I realized that this game is very very puzzle-focused, which I found weird at first but quite endearing after that. Almost every room incorporates a puzzle and even some of the enemies have you thinking how to defeat them. Oh and the bosses - they are amazingly well crafted and often presented as a giant puzzle in and of themselves. Gameplaywise you are getting what's on the cover of the box - a solid puzzle-focused metroidvania experience. \n\nNow why was this a rollercoaster-ride? For me, because this game starts out very, you know, happy. Everything is colorful and fluffy and just uplifting. And while this overall tone doesn't change completely, there are moments, that just really go dark in one or the other way - and I loved that. I had conflicts with the actions I was taking even though those actions, narratively speaking, were just and logical. That, to me, was an amazing feeling that still kind of lingers with me. Sometimes there was too much talking for my taste, but ultimately it made for some well crafted characters, that made me enjoy the story more, than a lot of other metroidvanias tend to do. \n\nAs a metroidvania - it is a solid game. The sense of exploration doesn't hold up to something like [b]Hollow Knight[/b], but the puzzle focused areas are an interesting fresh take. Moving around isn't as fun as, say, [b]Ori and the Blind Forest[/b], but the diverse cast of characters delivers on another level. So, as a metroidvania, it is very solid.\n\nAs a game, genre not accounted for, it is great. It got me hooked from the very beginning and as of writing this I'm closing the gap from 92% completion to 100% and I still enjoy every second, feel decently challenged (playing on harder mode) and am just having fun.\nThis is a game, that deserves your support and your time :)", "timestamp_created": 1517324515, "timestamp_updated": 1517324515, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39727075": {"recommendationid": "39727075", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049379938", "num_games_owned": 2150, "num_reviews": 64, "playtime_forever": 197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517141000}, "language": "english", "review": "This month was so rich with its games and I can't be happy enough about it. Let's say, I had already a lot of fun this month and it's only a start of the year with lots of good stuff coming. Majority of these games were indie projects of course and I spent a lot of time exploring all of them.\n\nFrankly speaking, I really respect ambitious people. It's something I really adore and can't stop admiring the way they carry their ideas through the whole life without even thinking of dropping it, meeting problems and other obstacles and dealing with them. I know a lot of people in my life, who has a lot of \"cool ideas' which ends only on paper. When it comes to real life and to that moment where you have to really do something - they fail and never recover. Because it's simply much easier to talk, rather then create and show everyone, that we all live here on planet Earth for a purpose.\n\nLast time we had this ambitious project created by only one person, was Stardew Valley and it was simply stunning, brilliant and definitely a perfect example what a great work should look like in the end. Only one person, with a support of his loving girlfriend created something that looks like an enormous game made by a big team with a strong support. It's clearly fantastic and so damn motivational!\n\nAnd now we have Iconoclasts. Another game that was in development for 10 years and was only created by one one person. Last 7 years Joakim Sandberg was spending all his time on developing Iconoclasts. And now, when it's fully released, we can enjoy this masterpiece to its fullest. He came to the idea for this game back in 2007, but only had a chance to start working on it 3 years later. Like I said before, it was a really big and enormous work for one person, not only because of how big this game is, but also because of the ambitiousness of the project. \n\nThe game plot sets in a world, where everything depends on a fuel, called \"ivory\", which counts as a sacred one and used for fueling machines. All these workers, who are responsible for fueling these machines are really important in this world and are counted almost as a priests, as well. It's really interesting that this game has a mix of this interesting idea, story telling, puzzles, arcade mechanics and metroidvania elements. Joakim never had a scenario, before he started to work on this game, he was writing everything during the work. When he started working on this game, he was at his early-20th and the whole game shoulda be much more funnier, full of these easy vibes, without any deep meanings and strong characters. But the more he worked on it and became older, the more darker the whole story became. \n\nAnd you can clearly feel it while playing the game. It starts kinda slow, in meditate manner and then it turns to a serious story about growing up. About people in your surrounding and the way you change through the communication with them and helping them around in any possible way you can. It's something you don't care about when you are 20, and all this understanding comes to you when you are older and much more experienced person. I have these feeling, that Joakim put something really personal in this story and its up to you either you wanna feel it or just run through the game and move to the next one asap. \n\nI am really enjoying this masterpiece. Everything I see on a display deserves hours to look on it and explore and just enjoy every pixel, because when you see something like this, made with love from the bottom of you soul and heart, you simply want it to last as longer as possible. All these puzzles you need to solve with your wrench are so enjoyable and they never seem hard or boring to you, I can count it as a major plus to this game, you will never have this feeling like \"oh jeesus christ I don't get what they want from me, damn this game, I am out\" and rage quit, no, its not about this game. It's simply about the charming adventures and life questions that Robin (main female protagonist) tries to find answers on.\n\nMr. Joakim Sandberg, if there is any chance that you will see my review here on steam, I just wanted to say thank you for your enormous work and let you know that your hard work should be taken as an incredible example for anyone, who starts something new and experience hard times during development. I admire you a lot and wish you only the best in the future, will be looking forward to your next games and I believe that you are one of these amazing creative and talented persons who should lead the gaming community on the way to its quality and responsibility for their products.\n\nTo sum everything up.\nYou should grab this game if you:\n\n+ Indie lover like me :)\n+ Feel like playing something really special, a masterpiece BIG game, created by ONE person\n+ Enjoy puzzles in arcade platformer games \n+ Put story telling and character development higher than anything itself.\n+ Just like quality games with polished design \n+ Like metroidvania elements\n+ Want to create a next big game, and you need a motivation, this one will definitely blows your mind.\n\nYou should pass if you:\n\n- Well, to be honest it's kinda hard for me to talk about cons in this game. I guess, you should not grab this game if you don't like pixel art and arcade platformer games are not your genre in general.               \n\nEnjoy!

Great music, gorgeous animation, it leads in well.

I just grabbed some upgrades because I had the slots, not because I cared about having the upgrades.

For someone to single-handedly create every aspect of a sizeable game (design, programming, graphics, audio) by themselves over 7 years, and for it all to have this much polish, is nothing short of impressive and inspiring.\n\nBut this fact would not matter much if Iconoclasts wasn't a good game. Thankfully, it is. There's two things that to me are particularily noteworthy about the game:\n\nOne: Incredible, creative boss fights. If you've played konjak's previous game, Noitu Love 2, then you'll know what to expect, but the stuff on display in Iconoclasts surpasses even that. Here's just a short list of the type of boss fights you can expect: Innovative, almost puzzle-like experiences. Simple, but narratively significant moments of tension. Tough-as-nails and hugely satisfying brawls. Surprising and over-the-top encounters. Seriously, if boss fights often happen to be one of your favourite things about video games, then grab Iconoclasts. It will absolutely deliver.\n\nTwo: This one is big. Iconoclasts is an action-heavy game with explosions and fights and yet... the player character does not turn into a mass murderer over the course of the game. The majority of enemies you fight are robots or monsters inspired by flora and fauna. So, the first time a human enemy dies, it's actually a big deal. The character responsible breaks down over it, even though this enemy had just tried to kill them and you. Shortly after this scene, you have to clear an area of human enemies. My initial concern was that this would just make the previous scene feel silly. But, as it turns out, you only knock them out! Combat works normally, but you don\u2019t kill. Later, playing as a different character, you do end up killing human enemies (or you can run past them, if you prefer). But for this character, narratively, it made more sense, than it did for the main character. This is what we need more of! Not to derail this review, but I recently played Rise of the Tomb Raider and all its attempts at making Lara a relatable, realistic character don\u2019t matter, because she is just mowing down enemies left and right without a second thought or any self-awareness about it. Iconoclasts however proves you can have action gameplay without the carnage or forcing non-lethal stealth alternatives onto the gameplay and that is just really incredible to me.\n\nAlso noteworthy is the game's strong focus and dedication to its characters. Although there is no voice acting, the playful nature in which the text is animated or variated in size, as well as the strong characterization on display both work together to give Iconoclasts a uniquely memorable and distinct cast. I can't remember coming across a Metroidvania-style game where the characters and story had this huge of a focus, and that was really refreshing. Also, it's pretty darn funny at times. It's not a comedy game, but when it makes jokes, they land.\n\nAlthough, upon namedropping the Metroidvania-term I'll have to say that the feeling of exploration that these kinds of games often exhibit felt somewhat absent here. That's not to say that that's a bad thing, or that the beautifully illustrated and lively game world was boring to explore, but the focus felt more on the how of navigation rather than on the where of navigation. By which I mean to say, to progress you'll often have to solve very light puzzles. Rather than having a very open layout with multiple roadblocks clearly requiring new abilities on your part and backtracking a lot, Iconoclasts is very streamlined. Unless you're going for 100% completion, you're probably unlikely to revisit the various areas in the game. You're also not picking up a huge number of different abilities, you're picking up different weapons (and different upgrades for them), but ultimately you only have four available (counting the wrench). You do also gather crafting ingredients for so-called tweaks. It took me until pretty late into the game to actually start utilizing these tweaks seriously, so to me personally, they felt a little bit like an afterthought. They don't add much to the game, but once you realize that specific combinations may give you big advantages in various boss fights, you'll likely find it to be a pretty fun system to play around with.\n\nThere's also minor nitpicks to be had, such as the mechanic for throwing boxes being a little fiddly or it not always being clear on what to do next (whether it's how to fight a boss or where to go next), but I never felt truly stuck and in need of external help. Additionally, although the plot itself felt less interesting than the characters to me, the strong focus on the characters and the intriguing world-building still meant I was curious to see what would happen next. These issues may weigh more strongly for other players, but to me they in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the game.\n\nTo summarize: Iconoclasts is a polished and beautifully illustrated game, full of incredible boss fights and fun, simple navigational puzzles. It has a uniquely strong focus on its characters' personal shortcomings and challenges, paired with imaginative world-building.

With Iconoclasts however, I not only got to see a wonderfully mature and thoughtful series of ideas and unique situations, but as the game escalated into its climax it ended up being a wild ride of surprising experiences. The game has a high focus on Spatial Reasoning puzzles over your typical combat/platforming common in the genre, and because of that I'm not positive every Metroidvania fan is going to enjoy this particular cup of tea. But if you DO enjoy these kinds of puzzles, along with some excellent (but also puzzle heavy) combat, and a JRPG style of story-telling, Iconoclasts may in fact be the best game in the entire genre for you.\n\nI'd like to emphasize the story aspect first, because in my mind that is one of the the primary draws of the game. The way it is told is nothing short of masterful. Robin is a silent protagonist, and Mario RPG style she pantomimes most of what she's thinking - and like Mario RPG it's incredibly cute and entertaining. I'm not normally a fan of the Silent Protagonist, but the decision serves the game well to magnify the game's fantastic supporting cast. There's a lot of quirkiness throughout the narrative that helps to keep it fun, but at no point did I feel like any of the game's villains were non-threatening as a result of it. The game celebrates life with its presentation while keeping a tone of tension in a remarkable balancing act that places Iconoclasts high on the list of great storytelling in video games of any genre. It tackles themes that are controversial in a philosophical way, reminding me of games like Xenogears, particularly on the topic of faith. It cautions against blind adherence to dogma without necessarily discounting the benefits of religion - leaving a lot of conclusions about the very real feelings conveyed up to the player to interpret. It's the kind of story that I could write essays about in analysis, and I really don't feel like I'm overselling it by saying that.\n\nBut with that said, there is also a very clear gameplay focus. The game begins with no cutscenes, and provides only signs that explain the game's controls through the conveyance of pictures. The tried and true method of teaching the player through gameplay is tackled magnificently from the very start.  Bosses begin their AI pattern gradually, showing off each of their attacks individually before they ramp the challenge by mixing attacks together or speeding up. The puzzles too put each of your new abilities to the test as the game progresses.\n\nAnd it all works together thematically as well. Puzzles involve moving platforms around using your wrench to turn bolts and wheels, often permanently changing the landscape, which gives this game a feeling of everything unfolding gradually as you fix the worlds problems. As you unfold the story and mysteries of the game it's like a puzzle box where each layer reveals something new and often surprising. Even the combat is deceptively simple at first, giving me the impression that this was indeed a puzzle game above all else - until the stakes got to the point that I was facing enemies that tested me as much as some of the greatest encounters in the genre.\n\nIconoclasts is nearly perfect, but that isn't to say I don't have a few nitpicks. The music is good but not quite as memorable as some of its Indie Contemporaries - which is less of a fault and more that the standard has been set so high in that regard. The tweak system is interesting but I feel like the execution could use a little work. The metroidvania exploration element of this game has you finding one of four crafting materials that function as fractions of these equippable tweaks that affect your stats in specific ways. If you get hit in combat, you lose one of your tweaks, which you can recharge by collecting enemy drops - it's sort of like Cave Story. Unlike Cave Story however many of the tweaks are less attractive for combat and more attractive for puzzle solving or more exploration. If your equipment is focused on anything other than combat then the risk of losing your tweaks becomes less of a source of tension, almost making the system feel pointless. There are a few key tweaks that are especially useful when fighting, but even on the game's harder mode I never felt like I was desperately trying to keep my energy levels at maximum as part of my survival; my incentive to avoid being hit was strictly about not dying. The near irrelevance of the tweaks is especially important because they are the only reward for exporation.\n\nBut I consider complaining about the tweaks a nitpick at best. Exploration is rewarding in Iconoclasts because it is fun, and there are also challenging bonuses available to the most stalwart achiever in that category of gameplay. Even if my only reward for exploration were bits of poo, I'd still do it because it is enjoyable.\n\nWhich sums up Iconoclasts in a single word; \"Enjoyable.\" I'd add the important \"thought provoking\" and \"challenging\" to the descriptor, but I know for some people the pure joy this game provided for me is enough for my report.\n\nIf you like the three things I mentioned in the first paragraph, that is, JRPG style storytelling, Metroidvanias, and Spatial Reasoning puzzles, get this game. It may be the best purchase you make this year.\n\n5 out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1517253897, "timestamp_updated": 1518586433, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.533898", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39711876": {"recommendationid": "39711876", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131373913", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517179843}, "language": "english", "review": "Overall I think this is a flawed masterpiece. I appreciate its existence immensly, but there are some questionable stuff. Below I'll just list spoiler free observations that would've guided me in buying the game if I didn't own it already.\n\nThe game looks very, very good. In most other games, especially 2D ones, you'd see about 10 % as many unique animations per character as this game has, and they'd be 10 % as polished. The cutscenes are majestic creations. It's easy to see why this game took so long to make. Whether or not you think it was worth the time is another question (I do, for the record).\n\nI'm not sure I'd call it a metroidvania, but that's semantics, so to explain: the progression is not so much about getting powerups that allow you to get to new areas. You do that a few times, but mostly new roads are unlocked arbitrarily due to story progression. This is neither good nor bad but some people with specific ideas of what they want from a metroidvania might be disappointed.\n\nIt has significantly more emphasis on puzzle platforming than on action. This is not an action game in the same sense as Noitu Love 2, or Momodora, or even Cave Story. Most of the enemies you fight are puzzles themselves, where you need to wait for the right moment or parry them. You can usually just run past enemies though, or facetank them (even on hard). This too is neither good nor bad, but I really enjoy action focused games so I was a bit sad. At the very end comes some really well made battles that made me think \"god damn, why couldn't the whole game be this focused on raw action?\" I'll guess I'll have to replay Noitu Love 2 for that.\n\nThe puzzles are decent. Despite how many there are, only a few made me feel \"oh, that's clever\". Mostly the solution is fairly obvious and from there it's just a matter of execution. Most of the actually clever ones were to reach optional chests, which is fine I guess.\n\nThe optional chests unlock stuff that didn't really excite me that much. It's basically a crafting system that lets you build modifiers that buff you slightly, but when you take damage they power down and you must build them up again (think Cave Story). While the upgrade system itself didn't wow me, I feel like the optional chests were important for the game, and they had to be filled with something.\n\nI usually enjoy when games don't direct you too much, but man, sometimes I got really confused during this game. Sometimes Joakim understood that people would get confused - so much so that he added fireflies that guided your way. And then sometimes those fireflies didn't go away when they were supposed to, so they began guiding you the wrong way.  Once in a while, you'll get a ?-mark on the map to show you the way, and to be honest despite my usual preference I actually think those should've been around all of the time.\n\nThe reason you might be confused is because, as I mentioned earlier, progression is usually not tied to what skills you've obtained, but through generic locks or story progression. The story progression part is super, duper arbitrary. A place with a closed door might suddenly have opened, or a cave is cleared from rubble, or some dude has appeared where previously there was nothing. The for me unintuitive level design is probably the only thing I feel [i]decidedly[/i] negative towards in the game.\n\nI found the music passable. I don't remember any songs. Despite it being okay, I do feel that if Joakim should've gotten help with any aspect, it should've been the music. He has spent such tremendous effort polishing cutscenes and building atmosphere that the music just falls lightyears short. I respect his decision to hold firm to the \"one man army\" thing he has going, but music is [i]so[/i] important for cinematic experiences, and I wish he had swallowed his pride and done what was best for the game here.\n\nI really liked the worldbuilding, and the characters. If you don't like the characters you won't like the story, because the story is about the characters and the plot itself is just a framework for them expressing themselves. There are some mysteries uncovered about the world as you go, but to me it didn't feel like these revelations were the core of the story.\n\nTo me, the massive reliance on characters to drive the plot is one of the key things that make me appreciate this game so, so much. I can confidently say that the experience in that regard has been completely unique compared to all other games I've played. Even though the plot moves more sideways than forward, it's okay because so much effort has been put into making characters talking to each other interesting.\n\nThis does mean though that if you're not into banter, or you dislike the characters, the story is probably stillborn for you. You get a good idea of how it'll all play out within the 2 hour refund window.\n\nThe game took me 10.5 hours to beat on \"harder\" mode. My playtime on Steam is higher because I kept the game running a lot in pause menu. Replayability is limited, in my opinion.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this game is a superb cinematic experience, has uniquely character driven storytelling, is a decent puzzle platformer, and an okay action game. Honestly it tickles about the same spots as an Uncharted game for me, but I personally vastly prefer the characters and setting in this game.\n\nAll its flaws aside, to people like me I highly recommend playing the game.", "timestamp_created": 1517252080, "timestamp_updated": 1517252080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39711600": {"recommendationid": "39711600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049836322", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517247601}, "language": "english", "review": "Iconoclasts has it's shortcomings (I would definitely make some changes to the checkpoints and tweak system), but it's strengths definitely outweigh it's weaknesses.

"french", "review": "Avant de commencer \u00e0 donner mon avis sur Iconoclasts, je vais d\u2019abord vous parler de Joakim Sandberg, aka Konjak.\n\nQuand j\u2019\u00e9tais jeune, enfin plus jeune\u2026 \nBref\u2026 vers 2008, 2009. Je suis tomb\u00e9 sur Chalk par hasard qui est un petit jeu dudit Konjak. Petit shoot tr\u00e8s original et bien sympathique qui m\u2019avait bien plu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 chercher des informations sur son auteur et je suis tomb\u00e9 sur Legend of Princess. Et l\u00e0, je dois bien admettre que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 sous le charme. Imaginer un fan game Zelda, un action/plateforme 2D avec un scrolling horizontal, beau, ultra-nerveux et respectant son univers avec une touche de folie et une musique bien sentie. Il est de plus gratuit et vous n\u2019avez AUCUNE EXCUSE de ne pas y jouer surtout au vu la qualit\u00e9 du soft.\n\nD\u00e8s lors, j\u2019ai attendu ses projets avec un certain int\u00e9r\u00eat et m\u00eame si je n\u2019ai pas encore jou\u00e9 \u00e0 Noitu Love 2 que par le biais d\u2019une d\u00e9mo. Je dois dire que j\u2019ai bien suivi les projets auxquels il a particip\u00e9 sans m\u2019en rendre compte. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a travaill\u00e9 pour WayForward sur des jeux comme Contra 4, la s\u00e9rie Shantae et Mighty Switch Force dans l\u2019animation de sprites 2D!.\n\nJe vous laisse donc imaginer mon impatience de toucher Iconoclasts. Et je ne suis pas d\u00e9\u00e7u.\n\nTout d\u2019abord, sachez que Konjak a sorti une version \u00ab ant\u00e9rieure \u00bb \u00e0 Iconoclasts. Elle porte le nom d\u2019Ivory Springs qui parcourt assez fid\u00e8lement le d\u00e9but du jeu et s\u2019arr\u00eate apr\u00e8s le 2eme boss du jeu.\n\n\nVoil\u00e0 pour le pr\u00e9ambule. Et sinon, Iconoclasts c\u2019est bien ? Et c\u2019est quoi en fait ?\n\nIconoclasts est un action/plateforme typ\u00e9 \u00ab metroidvania \u00bb en 2D on l\u2019on contr\u00f4le Robin, une m\u00e9canicienne qui va avoir beaucoup de probl\u00e8mes avec le r\u00e9gime en place. De fil en aiguille, elle parcourra une histoire des plus agr\u00e9ables avec des sujets vari\u00e9s comme l\u2019\u00e9cologie, la religion ou l\u2019industrialisation \u00e0 outrance. Questionnant son lecteur au fil de l\u2019aventure. Des liens seront tiss\u00e9s entre les protagonistes cr\u00e9ant une empathie que j\u2019ai rarement vue dans un jeu vid\u00e9o. C\u2019est simple, tous les personnages sont attachants sauf un ou deux et l\u2019histoire cont\u00e9e est des plus soign\u00e9es.\n\nLes graphismes sont au top, et l\u2019on sent que Joakim Sandberg a boss\u00e9 comme un tar\u00e9 sur le design. Il n\u2019y a qu\u2019\u00e0 voir les d\u00e9cors, les personnages et les animations pour se rendre compte du travail abattu par le monsieur. Alors oui, on peut chipoter sur certains graphismes, sur des animations un peu \u00ab brutes \u00bb mais on est quand m\u00eame devant un travail orf\u00e8vre. Un bijou visuel qui manque de quelques touches de-ci de-l\u00e0 pour parfaire une l\u2019\u0153uvre d\u00e9j\u00e0 sublime.\n\nLe game design est tr\u00e8s bon, le personnage r\u00e9pond au doigt et \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153il et propose une grande gamme de mouvements ainsi que des am\u00e9liorations bien. Les ennemis bougent bien et ont des patterns tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9ables et novateurs pour certains. Les boss sont un d\u00e9lice, ils sont beaux, vari\u00e9s, diff\u00e9rents dans la mani\u00e8re de les affronter, difficiles comme il faut mais pas insurmontables.\n\nMais je note des moments chiants comme d\u2019affronter les troufions de base du projet qui sont une plaie ou la maniabilit\u00e9 qui manque de souplesse comme une esquive offerte avec une am\u00e9lioration qui s\u2019utilise avec BAS + ATTACK. Ce qui est contre m\u00e9canique (le lier \u00e0 une touche sp\u00e9cifique aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus intelligent par exemple). Le tout reste tr\u00e8s jouable, mais j\u2019aurai souhait\u00e9 plus de rigueur. Que l\u2019on soit d\u2019accord, c\u2019est toujours du chipotage. \u2665\n\nPar contre, le level design est parfait. Le monde regorge de combat, de secret et d\u2019\u00e9nigme sans jamais lasser le joueur. En 15 heures, je n\u2019ai jamais eu la sensation de faire 2 fois la m\u00eame chose. Chaque zone \u00e0 son level design et chaque objet d\u00e9bloque plusieurs capacit\u00e9s, je prendrai la cl\u00e9 \u00e0 molette comme exemple qui sert \u00e0 de nombreuses choses, mais les autres items ne sont pas en reste. Bref, c\u2019est LE point fort du jeu au-del\u00e0 du reste qui touche d\u00e9j\u00e0 le sublime.\n\nLa musique est bonne dans son ensemble, certaines sortent du lot et sont vraiment excellentes. Les bruitages sont globalement bien choisis.\n\nBref, Iconoclasts est un bijou que je ne saurai que trop vous conseiller. Pour ma part, je ferai s\u00fbrement une \u00ab new game + \u00bb ainsi que pour d\u00e9couvrir le boss cach\u00e9 du jeu.", "timestamp_created": 1517236558, "timestamp_updated": 1517382539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656250", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39704974": {"recommendationid": "39704974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141417691", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 778, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517634853}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521d\u89c1\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u6536\u96c6\u4e8680%,\u5185\u5bb9\u4ee5\u5916\u7684\u591a\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1517229330, "timestamp_updated": 1517229330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39700725": {"recommendationid": "39700725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198206123620", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517207844}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6211\u671f\u5f85\u4e86\u5f88\u4e45\u7684\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u89e3\u5bc6\u7c7b\u7684\u901a\u5173\u65b9\u5f0f\u90fd\u8ba9\u4eba\u5341\u5206\u7740\u8ff7\u3002\n\u53ef\u60dc\u6b63\u5f0f\u7248gameplay\u771f\u7684\u8ba9\u4eba\u5341\u5206\u5931\u671b\uff0c\u524d\u671f\u73a9\u5bb6\u8fd8\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u611f\u5230\u5341\u5206\u65e0\u804a\uff0c\u800c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c\u53ea\u80fd\u7528\u7cdf\u7cd5\u6765\u5f62\u5bb9\u4e86\u3002\u8ba9\u4eba\u6765\u56de\u5f80\u8fd4\u6d6a\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fc7\u4e8e\u8ff7\u5bab\u4f3c\u7684\u5730\u5f62\uff0c\u5916\u52a0\u6570\u4e0d\u80dc\u6570\u7684boss\u6218\u6597\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u5bf9\u5267\u60c5\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u7684\u63a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ec5\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u6253\u65e0\u5173\u7d27\u8981\u7684boss\u6765\u5ef6\u957f\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4f17\u591a\u4f0f\u7b14\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u56de\u6536\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u4ece\u4f55\u65f6\u5f00\u59cb\u88abstarworm\u6d17\u8111\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u5f92\u5bf9\u4e8estarworm\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u5426\u53ea\u662f\u8d44\u6e90\u6536\u96c6\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8ff7\u4e4bboss\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u592a\u591a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4f3c\u4e4e\u90fd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u7b54\u3002\u82e5\u662f\u8c1c\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u5f00\u548cboss\u7684\u6218\u6597\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5267\u60c5\u6709\u63a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4e5f\u5c31\u53ea\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d6a\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\u4e86\u3002\n", "timestamp_created": 1517209738, "timestamp_updated": 1517209738, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507975", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39700506": {"recommendationid": "39700506", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986022825", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 962, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517207346}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, I gave this go on Harder Mode and 100%'d the game. I can't say if the standard difficulty would resolve some of my problems, so bear that in mind.\n\n\nIconoclasts is a very good game, with excellent music and art. The story is pretty decent, as well. Its gameplay is probably the element with the most flaws - with very good ideas and platforming sometimes made frustrating with poor telegraphing.\n\nLet's break it down: The exploration aspect of Iconoclasts is solid - the secrets are well hidden, and fun to discover. However, there were plenty of moments where my character was TOO responsive when making more delicate maneuvers (I hate the dang ladders because they wont let me jump up them by continually holding up + jump) *shakes fist*.\n\nCombat with standard enemies is alright, but it was rarely something I enjoyed outright (beyond a few circumstances where the enemies and room worked together exceptionally well). None of your weapons let you take a lazy Metroid-esque approach and just spam shots everywhere that murder everything. Even the last weapon has a limitation with its cooldown, which juuuuuust kept it away from being real fun. \n\nThis was likely intentional, and I could see the logic behind it, but as I said - rarely did the standard combat catch my interest.\n\nOn the other hand, the boss fights deserve a special look because they're good. Not great, but good. They are almost always frantic, often have a unique mechanic, and very learnable patterns. HOWEVER, those unique mechanics and patterns would often collide in an ugly mess where I couldn't quite figure out what the heck is going on. There were many boss patterns that I would just attempt to brute force through, and spam attacks instead of dodging.\n\n\nThe developer gets bonus points for not relying on super obvious and offensive tropes in the story. . :)\n\nI'd give this game a B+ (which I think is rather good) for an overall excellent production for but a few rough edges.

The gameplay is tight and the pixel graphics look great.  That said, it doesn't really provide anything we haven't seen before.  I keep hearing about how the story sets is apart, but I am waiting to be convinced.  Six hours in and I am still looking for a reason to care about what's happening.  The religious elements give the narrative a bit of edge, but not enough to sustain my curiosity.  Also, unlike Metroid or Castlevania games, the sense of exploration just isn't there. It all feels kind of shallow to me.  \n\nIn short...a well made game that just isn't providing that special something to keep me invested.", "timestamp_created": 1517200829, "timestamp_updated": 1517200919, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.427289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39698031": {"recommendationid": "39698031", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041535258", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 203, "last_played": 1521506514}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Dej\u00e1ndome llevar por toda la emoci\u00f3n a este juego le pongo un 10 cerrado.\nVi\u00e9ndolo fr\u00edamente se le puede atribuir un 9.

Con el control en las manos he de decir que las mec\u00e1nicas empleadas son una maravilla para gozar.\n\nPuede que como Metroidvania no sea la quinta maravilla, ya que el backtracking que se hace es meramente para acompletar el 100% de cada mapa, obtienes ciertos recursos al abrir los cofres y solamente lo considero necesario para un par de mejoras que se pueden equipar, esto en parte no tiene nada de malo, ya que hace que la experiencia sea disfrutable en todo momento a\u00fan cuando tus habilidades explorativas no sean precisamente buenas, el juego recompensa medianamente pobre la exploraci\u00f3n y lo mejor de abrir un cofre es la sensaci\u00f3n de encontrarlo, no el contenido en s\u00ed.

It's gorgeous, it's fun, the characters are great (Agent Black has slipped into my top five favourite videogame antagonists, muttering about a headache) and the game's setpiece boss battles are endlessly inventive.\n\nFor people who care about my largely nitpicky cons, I'll elaborate below.\n\nThe writing was weirdly inconsistent - part of it was a sense of 'lost in translation', with some sentences being oddly structured or difficult to parse, but there were other issues, like how the plot felt like it wanted to make a point, but raised so many subjects I wasn't sure what that point was, and the bizarre variances in tone between the dark af central plot and goofy, quirky side character dialogue.  This wasn't a big deal for me, I'm the kind of person for whom plot is secondary to character (and the characters in this game are brilliant, at least the central ones are) but this might nag at you if you're a story nut.\n\nThe issue that *did* wind up bothering me, however, is that the game is fond of wildly sharp difficulty spikes, both in combat encounters and in terms of puzzle complexity.  The controls simply didn't feel tight enough for some of what the game was demanding from me, and that was compounded by incredibly demanding timing required on a number of puzzles whose completion was mandatory to advance the story, and a couple of encounters late in the game that subject you to an overwhelming volume of opposition, demanding that you carefully jump and weave between multiple damage-on-contact hostiles in an almost bullet-hell like fashion.  I don't object to that kind of gameplay, but given it wasn't seen in the game before that point and the ever so slightly mushy controls, it led to a number of moments of facedesk-level frustration as I retried the same encounter over and over and over.\n\nI want to reiterate that I love this game, but if difficulty spikes in particular bother you, be careful going into this one.", "timestamp_created": 1517185006, "timestamp_updated": 1517185006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.561978", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39695505": {"recommendationid": "39695505", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989154506", "num_games_owned": 784, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 931, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517176422}, "language": "english", "review": "The overall experience was pretty good.

I would consider it a standard run, not rushing to complete it, but not detouring for everything either. This run took just under 9 hours at the rates noted above.\n\nOverall I'm pretty much in the meh/negative on Iconoclasts (and feeling more negative the more of this review I write). There are a variety of issues with this game and I don't think it's as simple as saying \"well it was under development for 7 years\". Yes that's a long time to work on a game, but I'm only going to judge it on the gameplay and the story. There are plenty of other reviews that go into graphics. It looks pretty good though there are a few places where animations seem to be missing, or where things are kind of rough.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThis is not a Metroidvania, there is some backtracking if you're into that for chests and such, but I don't see the point. The game is very linear and contains a good amount of puzzles, and I would consider even combat to be a sort of puzzle, so if you aren't into that stay far away, especially considering how mediocre both aspects are. There are very few upgrades/changes to how your character plays, and most of them just give you a way to solve more puzzles. You cannot gain additional health, you cannot gain additional tweak slots. [spoiler] At the end of the game you still only have the 3 tweak spots you started with, 2 wrench upgrades, and 3 weapons in total. This to me was one of the biggest disappointments of the game, my character felt the same for 75% of the game, I never felt more powerful, I never got upgrades that let me have a shorter cooldown, or that improved my stun gun in meaningful ways that made me feel like combat was faster. I just got the third upgrade and pretty much used that for the rest of the game. [/spoiler]\n\nDue to this your character feels extremely static and there is no true feeling of improvement. I also found many of the boss fights to be annoyingly simple, but also convoluted in weird ways. There are several points in the game where it feels like you are being delayed with repetitive rooms simply to extend the play time of the game. I really disliked this and did not find the combat to be fun, it was more of a chore than anything because most of the enemies have a specific action you have to do before you can kill them so they can become vulnerable, and one later game enemy I don't even think you can kill, if so I couldn't figure it out. Either way the game is not difficult and combat is just a slog. Gunplay feels weird because it has lock on but you need to be in a specific range (all the weapons are pretty short range), grabbing things with your wrench feels bad and awkward in a variety of ways. Swinging the wrench in the \"spin\" maneuver which is used in combat to reflect certain projectiles is clunky, if you spin while jumping and land you come to a complete stop, there is no timer or obvious indication for the spin so you just have to learn when it ends, this isn't a huge deal, but it's annoying. [spoiler] This move is also used to charge up electricity later in the game, but requires 1 spin, and a little more for absolutely no reason other than to delay you and be annoying, I have no idea why this design decision was made but it isn't good, you'll quickly start abusing jumping and spinning to charge so you can keep moving while charging up [/spoiler]\n\nThe puzzles are okay in some spots, boring in others, and clunky in most places. I regularly felt like I wasn't doing the right thing, only to realize I was and the hitbox of an object was weird, or the method to solve something was kind of convoluted (spinning gears I'm looking at you). Often times I felt like I was somehow abusing and brute forcing the mechanics to solve the puzzles, but I couldn't figure out another way to do it and what I did worked, so what else am I supposed to think?\n\nThis leads into the next major issue for me, the way hints and direction are handled is very poor. While the game is generally very easy throughout things aren't explained very well. I still have no idea why tweaks are named differently when crafted as there seems to only actually be 5(?) different tweaks which are named the same in the menu so you have duplicates of tweaks that don't do anything else. Maybe I didn't understand something, but I saw no reason to switch my tweaks after the first hour since they're all basically the same.\n\nThe gameplay is okay, it's not as smooth as it could be, it's not as interesting as it could be, and it's not as intuitive as it could be. Overall it's only alright.\n\nStory:\n\nEverything below this well be spoilers, but suffice to say the story isn't good.\n\n[spoiler] I don't even know where to start here, the story is trash, things are poorly explained and not fleshed out, and most of the characters aren't likeable. Maybe the game was going for the mysterious world, but there's not enough world building to justify that. Worse is the characters are complete garbage and most of them are not likeable in any way, nor do they undergo character transformations as the story progresses in any meaningful way. There are a few minor throaway lines and scenes at the end, but these aren't satisfying at all.\n\nThe ending is absolutely atrocious and one of the worst I've seen in years. You kill some random bad guy, why was he bad? It's not explained, what was the reason for his badness? It's not explained, where did he come from? It's not explained. The final boss DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A NAME. It's been a while since there was a game with potential for an interesting world and characters where it's cocked up so badly. There are simply too many characters that aren't fleshed out, and too many things going on that are not properly explained with a good backstory. You have a general idea of the universe, but it is in no way meaningfully fleshed out. The writing is bad and grating. I wish I had skipped all the cutscenes.\n\n\nI really can't express my dissatisfaction with the overall story, and especially the ending. It seems so disconnected and clunky like it was meant for a (shitty) 100 hour teen drama RPG and stuffed into an 8 hour game.[/spoiler]\n\n\nFinal Verdict: Meh, skip it and get something else instead. There are other games out there that are better than Iconoclasts in every category, including price.  I can't recommend this game as I was happy to be done with it when I finally got to that point.

It played well, it was unique, and even then it was gorgeous.

It was sad that this beautiful game would never be finished but then 8 million other indie games came out and I moved on. But I never forgot Iconoclasts. The game with the female protagonist who wasn't a destined warrior or a bounty hunter. The game where your main weapons were a stun gun and a giant wrench.\n\nThen it actually came out, and I actually got to play it.\n\nIconoclasts is still a gorgeous game, it's finely detailed pixel art uses a broad colour palette and features smooth animations. There's animated cutscenes, the time investment required for that boggles my mind. The music never overtakes the scenes but is still catchy as all hell. The controls are tight, the gameplay satisfying. Bosses are challenging and unique, with multiple phases. On the harder difficulty this game will kill you. And the story, god the story. These characters are amazing.\n\nAll made by one person.\n\nIn Construct 2.\n\nThis game shouldn't exist, but it does because Konjak never gave up on it.

O review n\u00e3o \u00e9 longo, mas se voc\u00ea quiser s\u00f3 um resumo, role at\u00e9 o final.\n\nNas primeiras horas tudo era \"Uhuuuul! Olha esses efeitos! Meu deus que anima\u00e7\u00f5es suaves, explos\u00f5es, sons gostosinhos, oh yeaaah!\", at\u00e9 que chega um momento que essas coisas deixam de ser interessantes (ou deixam de ser o seu foco) e voc\u00ea come\u00e7a a olhar pro resto. E quando voc\u00ea come\u00e7ar a fazer isso... seu interesse pelo jogo morre. Nesse momento voc\u00ea enxerga defeitos como:\n\nO combate. De in\u00edcio voc\u00ea tem uma pistola que mira automaticamente nos inimigos pr\u00f3ximos, uma chave inglesa e um golpe de esmagada (apertando pra baixo e salto enquanto est\u00e1 no ar). A pistola \u00e9 absurdamente f\u00e1cil de usar, tudo que voc\u00ea precisa fazer \u00e9 apertar o bot\u00e3o freneticamente e olhar pro inimigo. A chave inglesa n\u00e3o tem erro, e o esmag\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 se posicionar em cima do inimigo e executar o comando. N\u00e3o achei isso um problema de in\u00edcio, afinal, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel projetar inimigos que sejam divertidos e desafiadores de se enfrentar mesmo que voc\u00ea tenha poucos ataques e que eles sejam simples. O problema \u00e9 que o jogo n\u00e3o faz isso. Em vez disso, coloca poucos inimigos pela fase e tudo que voc\u00ea precisa fazer \u00e9 descobrir qual arma serve pra matar ele, e isso frequentemente n\u00e3o \u00e9 bem comunicado. Por exemplo: se um inimigo tem espinhos no seu corpo e o \u00fanico espa\u00e7o aparentemente vulner\u00e1vel \u00e9 sua cabe\u00e7a, \u00e9 \u00f3bvio que o ataque que causa dano \u00e9 o esmag\u00e3o. Mas... e quando ele \u00e9 um soldado comum? Qual ataque devo usar? Voc\u00ea descobre por meio de tentativa e erro, algo que n\u00e3o \u00e9 nada divertido. E assim que voc\u00ea descobrir, fa\u00e7a o ataque repetidamente at\u00e9 que o inimigo esteja morto, algo que tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o \u00e9 divertido, mesmo com o polimento e efeitos que o jogo tem. Sem contar que tem inimigos no jogo que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o invulner\u00e1veis a ataques, qualquer ataque serve pra mat\u00e1-lo. Esses s\u00e3o os inimigos mais rid\u00edculos, do tipo que voc\u00ea pode at\u00e9 ficar envergonhado se levar um dano dele.\n\nMas ok, voc\u00ea pode dizer que \"combate n\u00e3o \u00e9 o foco do jogo\", pois de fato n\u00e3o \u00e9. O jogo \u00e9 um puzzle platformer, que foca mais nos quebra-cabe\u00e7as do que em todo resto. E como s\u00e3o os quebra-cabe\u00e7as desse jogo? Chatos e previs\u00edveis. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o precisa pensar, voc\u00ea s\u00f3 precisa fazer o que claramente precisa ser feito. Por exemplo: tem um parafuso que precisa ser enroscado com sua chave inglesa, mas est\u00e1 alto demais pra voc\u00ea alcan\u00e7ar. Tamb\u00e9m tem algumas caixas a\u00ed perto que voc\u00ea pode levantar e posicionar onde quiser. O que fazer? Aposto que voc\u00ea, mesmo sem ter jogado o jogo, sabe como a solu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 \u00f3bvia. Pegue as caixas, posicione perto do objetivo, suba nas caixas, enrosque o parafuso, e quebra-cabe\u00e7a solucionado. A parte interessante de qualquer quebra-cabe\u00e7a \u00e9 encontrar a solu\u00e7\u00e3o e se sentir esperto por t\u00ea-la encontrado. Como as solu\u00e7\u00f5es dos puzzles nesse jogo s\u00e3o t\u00e3o \u00f3bvias, a divers\u00e3o nessa parte tamb\u00e9m se perde. N\u00e3o tem nenhum momento \"A h\u00e1!\".\n\nOs di\u00e1logos s\u00e3o cansativos e complicados de entender (e eu sou quase fluente em ingl\u00eas). Muitas frases s\u00e3o esquisitas, como se fossem escritas com o prop\u00f3sito de parecerem mais complicadas do que s\u00e3o, requerindo que eu leia mais de uma vez pra compreender. Tendo que ler mais de uma vez tudo, chegou um momento em que eu n\u00e3o lia mais nada.\n\nEm resumo:\n\nPr\u00f3s:\n- Gr\u00e1ficos e anima\u00e7\u00f5es sensacionais\n- Boas m\u00fasicas e efeitos sonoros\n- Polimento incr\u00edvel, n\u00e3o tem nada fora do lugar e n\u00e3o encontrei nenhum bug no tempo que joguei\n\nContras: \n- Combate f\u00e1cil demais e desinteressante\n- Puzzles com solu\u00e7\u00f5es \u00f3bvias e, consequentemente, desinteressantes\n- Algumas lutas de chefe tem o ponto fraco \u00f3bvio demais e outras te deixam confuso sem saber o que fazer\n- Di\u00e1logos confusos e que n\u00e3o v\u00e3o direto ao ponto. Alguns textos s\u00e3o t\u00e3o confusos que voc\u00ea precisa ler mais de uma vez (at\u00e9 que chega um momento que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o l\u00ea mais nada)\n- Personagens dif\u00edceis de se relacionar. N\u00e3o d\u00e1 pra se relacionar nem com a protagonista porque aparentemente nem ela sabe ao certo seu papel na hist\u00f3ria\n- Demora muito pra ganhar novos upgrades. At\u00e9 ganhar algo novo j\u00e1 deu tempo de enjoar de tudo que voc\u00ea tem\n\nPra mim, esse jogo \u00e9 muito semelhante a Owlboy, outro jogo que n\u00e3o gostei. Levou anos pra fazer e tem \u00f3timos gr\u00e1ficos, e esses s\u00e3o os dois motivos principais que chamam a aten\u00e7\u00e3o do povo e levam eles a comprar e acreditar que est\u00e3o curtindo. Afinal, se levou tanto tempo pra fazer e a arte \u00e9 t\u00e3o bem trabalhada, [b]o jogo tem que ser bom[/b], n\u00e3o \u00e9? Por ter belos gr\u00e1ficos, voc\u00ea acaba presumindo que todo o resto tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 bom.

The last third (and my favorite part) has a huge tonal shift from what you get at the beginning of that game, which is fine and alright in itself but there\u2019s just so much that doesn\u2019t need to be here, and so much that never gets a conclusion at game\u2019s end. I\u2019m looking at you those \u201cnew\u201d three \u201cagents\u201d (you\u2019re in the game for what? 30 minutes?) and someone\u2019s mother\u2026. I\u2019ll not spoil anything else here.\n\nAnother thing that bugs me is in such a story focused game, Robin, the main character doesn\u2019t speak, it comes off as weird when all these huge world effecting events happen and all you get is \u2026.. On the other hand I really liked Black, her story was by far the most interesting. There\u2019s too many places and people that are in one or two scenes and never heard from again. Characters like Grey and White add nothing but useless padding.\n\nBut enough about that. Gameplay is more important; and in that regard Iconoclasts does pretty well for itself. There\u2019s tight controls and loads and loads of fun if a bit short bosses, quite a few puzzles, and the difficulty was just right (play it on Harder, it makes for a better experience). There\u2019s only a hand full of upgrades in the game, but that\u2019s ok, you get just enough to make it interesting; but I have to say the \u201cTweak\u201d system was another thing that could\u2019ve been cut. Oh, and if you\u2019re into exploration, this isn\u2019t going to do it for you.\n\nI\u2019m not going to talk about the music as I\u2019ve already forgotten all of it, it suits it\u2019s purpose but I can\u2019t say I really liked a single track. Sound effects are your standard \u201cretro\u201d game fare and do just fine as well. \n\nSo in the end, is the Iconoclasts worth your money? Yes, but not at full price. I can tell a lot of time and love was put into this product, but that doesn\u2019t make it a great game. For me, it falls somewhere between Hollow Knight and Reverie Under The Moonlight and it\u2019s miles below something like Rabi-Ribi.\n\nAt nearly 30 CAD I can\u2019t say I\u2019m thrilled with my experience, it honestly was fun; but it overstayed it\u2019s welcome.", "timestamp_created": 1517085240, "timestamp_updated": 1517085240, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515090", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39664013": {"recommendationid": "39664013", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076793066", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 856, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517078657}, "language": "english", "review": "Good:\n- Amazing pixel art and art style\n- Solid gameplay (most of time)\n- A decent amount of secrets and items to collect\n- Some of the puzzles are really good\n\nCons:\n- Almost every boss fight is \"figure out this boss' gimmick!\" instead of being \"use what you learned so far\". I even beat one of the bosses near the end of the game without ever figuring out what I was supposed to do.\n- You can create \"tweaks\", that are small improvements for Robin; but most of them are redundant or kind of useless.\n- The items you can collect are materials to create tweaks, but, as I just said, they aren't useful. You mostly collect the chests just for bragging rights. It feels like padding a otherwise very linear game.\n- In some areas you have to do a lot of backtracking for no good reason.\n\nJust my opinion:\n- I see a lot of people praising the story, but to me it felt generic. I could predict the overall story from the very beginning of the game, but just didn't expect the people to screw up so badly. \n- The backstory, on the other hand, is amazing. There are hints of how the world got the way it did, but it isn't ever properly explained. Still, you can get the general idea.\n- The overall theme of the story, IMHO,  is to \"take your head out of your ass and listen to what other people have to say\". For that reason, almost every character start out very, VERY, annoying. It's hard to empathize with their problems when most of their problems where caused by their own dumb decisions.\n- The game feels very linear, and doesn't give much incentive to exploration.\n\nTLDR:\nNice gameplay, with some bad parts.

The best way to describe it would be a cross between Metroid Fusion and Metal Slug. It's not quite a full metroidvania title, as you mostly progress in a linear fashion, but there are times you can't get everything in sight, and much like Metroid Fusion, there are plenty of times where story trumps everything else. I won't speak much about the story, but it kept me interested throughout and there were some nice twists and turns.\n\nTo me, the core of Iconoclasts is the boss fights, and boy does it deliver on those. Ranging from huge screen size robots extremely reminiscent of Metal Slug bosses to intense one on ones, these fights are intense and frantic. There are plenty of unique musical themes and arenas that help to enhance these fights. I played on normal mode, but I can imagine the harder difficulties providing quite the challenge.\n\nThis game isn't perfect, there are some rough edges that will hopefully be cleared up over time. There's a line of text describing what you should be doing when you pause the game, but it can be painfully unclear where to go or what to do sometimes. I softlocked the game twice just playing through normally. But don't let these detract you, Iconoclasts is a fantastic game that deserves your time and money.

The core gameplay consists of roughly five mechanics, and it's executed greatly. As is true to the Metroidvania genre, you spend your time exploring a large, platforming map pulling off various feats and fights as you make your way through the story. And it's that aspect that I was wowed by!\n\nSeriously, this game gave way more time developing its characters than I would have expected, and that's a good thing. It never felt like it went for too long in any particular scene, as the cutscenes serve as breaks usually right after something intense, such as a boss fight. (There are many good bosses.) I was legitimately fascinated by the personalities of the main reoccuring characters, and I cared for them as I discovered their flaws. I'm also extremely impressed by how the game approached their arcs, appreciating how it was chosen to address their issues in a realistic way I could sympathize with.\n\nThe gameplay itself feels silky smooth, with a flow that snaps to you after a few hours getting your boots wet. You're introduced to your gameplay mechanics one at a time, and like a great game it usually spends an area letting you test out the limits of this idea before moving on to the next. Later on, these intertwine as combinations that never felt cheap, and the smaller number of options meant it was natural to swap between them to devise an answer. The map design is also great, being large enough to feel like a fleshed out place, but never so large or needlessly structured to get lost in. Every room has its purpose, and besides a few puzzle rooms for collectables you'll encounter everything just by your own intuition. Speaking of the collectables, I'm happy to say the game never pressures you into feeling like you need to amass a large pile of things in order to have the strength to progress. It's essentially all optional, with your own loadout able to overcome the game's obstacles.\n\nThe bosses are all unique--with one maybe being more of a redux, but it's still remixed well--and there was one particular sequence that was a great emotional end to an arc that I loved. The music for that piece absolutely nailed the feeling too, wow. (Side note: great soundtrack!)\n\nThis labor of love absolutely shines, and it's a shame it feels like this game has been overshadowed by the also great Celeste.

This is a beautiful-looking, 16-bit era throwback of a game with an exceptional amount of polish that's sure to scratch the itch of many a metroidvania and/or platformer fan. It is also, 4 hours in and at 30% complete, probably not for me.\n\nOh, I was having a lot of fun at first! I really, really, REALLY loved how it felt like I was playing a lost SNES classic, remastered; the world is just pretty to look at, and every character is just bouncing with, well, character! The little touches like the slight auto-aim on the pistol and auto-correct on the divekick on enemies are welcome, non-intrusive bits of player aid. There are also the occasional massive, sprawling puzzle rooms, where you utilise the tools you had gathered up to that point TO THEIR MAXIMUM POTENTIAL and those can end up pretty fun; the final rewards are often a little bit meh (more components to build Tweaks that I won't use? ok) but the joy of solving said puzzle rooms are a reward in themselves.\n\nBut the further along the game I played, the more the little things just niggled at me. One example, you can use a giant wrench to leap at and hang off giant bolts in the environment, allowing you to swing off them and get to higher ground. Fine mechanic in theory, but just a little bit more fiddly than necessary; usually the bolts sit just a little bit higher than you can reach with a standing jump, so you have to do a running jump to attach the wrench to the bolt and you have to do that running jump PRECISELY otherwise you'll just sail right past it and you have to start all over again. Also, sometimes if you don't release the wrench button fast enough when you latch on the bolt, you'll automatically leap off and sometimes not in the direction you wanted to go. It's not a SUPER major issue, and I succeed at it like... 75% of the time; but it's just a little bit of niggling annoyance that happens over and over again (amongst various other little things) in the game that added up and ruined the \"flow\" of the game for me.\n\nAnd at the centre of things that annoy me in this game are the boss battles. Normally, I'm all for boss battles that rely on puzzle-like mechanics to defeat as opposed to being a bulletsink with a zillion hitpoints; but the lack of signposting of what you're supposed to do with some of these bosses is aggravating as all get out. Like yeah, I get that I'm supposed to use a particular attack at a certain point in the boss' attack cycle, but which attack (charged or not) and which cycle and do I actually have all that guesswork right only I'm not standing on the EXACT spot that I needed to be etc etc etc. I actually started to yearn for bulletsink bosses after a certain point, because at least for those guys you can still do chip damage and feel like you're actually progressing (however slowly).\n\nAnd lastly, while I think the story is surprisingly meaty and filled with pretty cool characters and funny moments, I also feel the script needed a second pass by a native English speaker? It was pretty okay at the beginning, but as the game progressed it felt like I was reading the English subtitles from a knockoff Hong Kong DVD; filled with \"DO NOT WANT\"isms and \"I got knife scars more than the number of your leg's hair\"alings. This can actually be a source of fun after a certain point though, so your mileage may vary!\n\nAll that said, I easily recommend the game based on the visuals and the obvious love and care lavished on the game; and honestly, a lot of the things I was personally bothered by may not be a problem for anybody else! As for me, I may wait until a full guide to taking the bosses comes out, because I'd rather not waste time figuring out the one attack that will damage the boss at the exact moment because it is completely invincible otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1517045921, "timestamp_updated": 1517045921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509531", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39649085": {"recommendationid": "39649085", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207066500", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1505, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519536937}, "language": "english", "review": "DUDE THIS GAME IS JUST AWESOME, it should be recommended to everyone ;w;", "timestamp_created": 1517042916, "timestamp_updated": 1517081925, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.484111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39648065": {"recommendationid": "39648065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066960569", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520315525}, "language": "english", "review": "The 2012 alpha demo of Iconoclasts has been sitting on my computer for years. I've always kept coming back to it, sometimes not even just to play it, but to closely analyze its design. It's been a strong and direct inspiration for my own game development, as have been some of the creator's tweets, so needless to say, this has been one of my all-time most anticipated games.\n\nAbsolutely worth the wait. The game starts good, then it steadily works its way uphill to a legendary place.\n\nWhile it's been classified on Steam as a Metroidvania, Iconoclasts has relatively little exploration or backtracking compared to most games in the genre. It's a largely linear, densely-packed platformer that moves along at a smooth pace, for the most part. The tools you acquire throughout the journey quickly become second nature thanks to the intuitive controls, and they're constantly utilized to solve satisfying, often action-oriented puzzles.\n\nBoss fights are a major gameplay focus. All of them are good, most of them are great, and a few are unadulterated awesomeness. However, there are occasions when a lot of experimentation is required to discern how to deal damage to a boss, disrupting the pacing somewhat.\n\nThe narrative is the real driving forces of the experience. I'd say it's impressive and unpredictable enough to bring video games an important step closer to being a more widely-appreciated storytelling medium. Clearly the product of years of ideas, it is refreshingly complex, if a bit ovewhelming. I have no problem with a game having a well-developed world, or a story that takes more than one playthrough to fully appreciate. But I do wish a bit more time was spent familiarizing the player with the world's unfamiliar infrastructure from the beginning; I felt as though my emotional investment in the characters was delayed because I didn't understand their roles yet. A few lines of dialogue also read like forced exposition, which momentarily breaks the immersion from the generally great characters.\n\nI have three complaints with 100% completion. First, there are no descriptions for the key items in the pause screen, meaning you can carry around an optional letter with no hints or reminders on who the intended recipient is. Second, there doesn't appear to be a more efficient way to check the treasure-collecting percentages of each area, short of revisiting each one and checking the map. A visible list of the areas and their percent of completion would be convenient. Third, the means by which you reach hidden items are occasionally horrendously unclear, not even offering a semblance of a hint. It's a shame that most of the optional aspects of the game feel like an afterthought, design-wise, since the main game is so strong.\n\nIconoclasts is a very human game, and a delightfully ambitious one that's always on the move and changing things up.

Das Haus der Nachbarin wurde von einem Roboter zerst\u00f6rt. Agenten des h\u00f6heren Galubensbekenntnisses sind m\u00e4nnliche Frauen, die Schwarz und Weiss heissen und der Protagonistin verbieten, H\u00e4user zu flicken. Sie geht los ins Dorf. Dort sind die Leute sauer auf sie, weil sie H\u00e4user flickt, worauf der Mond br\u00f6ckelt und die S\u00fcnde H\u00e4user bombardiert. Andere NPSs sind entweder Hausfrauen oder Piratinnen. Alle beten zu einer Mutter, welche zu einem \"Er\" reden kann. Der Bruder hat Streit mit seiner Familie. In der Kirche gibt mir jemand eine Batterie. Die Agenten erwischen uns und machen das Haus des Bruders kaputt und f\u00fchlen sich erhaben, indem sie allen ihren Glauben aufzwingen wollen. Wir werden mit einer Piratin eingesperrt, welche einen Baum in eine T\u00fcre pflanzt, worauf wir durch den Estrich einer Bar kriechen. Dann bombt uns ein Soldat ins Wasser, wir werden rausgefischt und gleich wieder reingeworfen. Dann landen wir in der W\u00fcste. Sp\u00e4ter helfen wir den Soldaten, einen Fahrstuhl zu bedienen. Dann kommt ein Prinz, der Blumen aus dem Boden zaubert und wir verlieben uns. Dann tritt ein d\u00fcrrer Mann einen anderen von der Klippe w\u00e4hrend er missionarisch aus einem Buch zitiert und einheitliche Meinung propagiert und gleichzeitig eine pummelige Soldatin als Lover hat. Die Schwarze Agentin ist am trauern. Dann entgleist der Prinz einen Zug mit Zauberkraft und wir landen bei den Piraten. Und das innerhalb 2.5 Stunden Spiel. Alles klar?\n\n- Die Figuren:\nFrauen. Das ist das Wort, welches es zusammenfasst, ohne es zu werten. Es sind irgendwie alles Frauen, selbst die M\u00e4nner. Und obschon das Spiel vermutlich explizit so aufgemacht ist, um Frauen-Power hervorzuheben, komme ich nicht herum, zu denken, dass der Schuss ziemlich nach hinten los ist. Es ist klischiiert und teils sexistisch. Nicht, dass es nicht andere Spiele g\u00e4be, wo dies noch viel krasser ist, aber gerade bei diesem Spiel st\u00f6rt es gewaltig, weil es vermutlich genau das Gegenteil h\u00e4tte sein sollen.\n\n- Boss-Battles:\nDauern nicht l\u00e4nger wie 2-3 Minuten, braucht vielleicht 2 Versuche, da man nicht sieht, was man tun muss. Sehr einfach. Das gr\u00f6sste Problem ist, dass der Bildschirm sehr stark wackelt und immer wieder Sprechblasen auftauchen, die man versucht ist, zu lesen, was aber meist nur st\u00f6rt.\n\n- Plattforming und R\u00e4tsel:\nNach 2.5 Stunden im Spiel dauerte das komplexeste R\u00e4tsel vielleicht 5 Minuten, weil es sich \u00fcber 4 Bildschirme erstreckte. Plattforming ist easy und zugegebenermassen fl\u00fcssig und schnell, aber die Steuerung spielt manchmal einen Streich.\n\n- Mission - Motivation:\nWieso tue ich, was ich tue, was tue ich, warum, wohin muss ich, wer hilft mir... Keine Ahnung. Es gibt bereits in den 2.5 gespielten Stunden mehrere Situationen, bei welchen ich mich fragte: Und was tue ich jetzt? Ich irrte beispielsweise 15 Minuten erfolglos rum, um den Prinzen in sein \"Camp\" zu bringen. Ich musste schlussenlich online nachschauen gehen.\n\n- Cutscenes:\nVon den 2.5 Stunden waren gef\u00fchlt 1.5 Cutscenes. Manche Cutscenes scheinen bislang v\u00f6llig unn\u00fctz zu sein (Beispielsweise die Szene mit dem Schiff). Ich vermute, die Intention der Spielemacher war, die m\u00e4nnlichen Figuren in den Cutscenes als b\u00f6sartig und unmenschlich darzustellen, oft ist es aber einfach nur langweilig. Die l\u00e4ngste dauerte rund 20 Minuten, unterbrochen mit einem viel zu einfachen Boss-Fight.\n\n- Steuerung:\nGrunds\u00e4tzlich nicht schlecht, reagiert sehr schnell. Aber Kombinationen von Tasten klemmen, weswegen man h\u00e4ufig in die falsche Richtung blickt, sich nicht sauber an den W\u00e4nden festh\u00e4lt und runterf\u00e4llt und manchmal die Tools einfach nicht funktionieren. Aktionsmuster werden nicht gen\u00fcgend ge\u00fcbt, weswegen die Tasten und deren Kombinationen sehr schnell wieder verlernt werden, was zu st\u00e4ndigen Fehlern f\u00fchrt. Sowieso sind vier Aktionstasten zuviel f\u00fcr die Spielemechanik, siehe n\u00e4chster Punkt.\n\n- Das Tool: Das Ikonische an dem Spiel ist der riesige Schraubenschl\u00fcssel. Aber ehrlich gesagt k\u00f6nnte man die Spielemechanik locker ohne bewerkstelligen. Es w\u00fcrde reichen, Buttons zu dr\u00fccken, anstelle sie mit dem Schl\u00fcssel drehen zu m\u00fcssen. Es w\u00fcrde reichen, sich an Haken festzuhalten, anstelle sich mit dem Schl\u00fcssel daran festzuhalten. Und es w\u00fcrde ohne Probleme funktionieren, einfach zu parieren, anstelle mit dem Schl\u00fcssel zu schlagen, bzw die paar wenigen Gegner, bei welchen dies tats\u00e4chlich einen Effekt hat, einfach weglassen oder umprogrammieren. Sprich: Das Spiel k\u00e4me auch ohne aus.\n\nFazit:\nZu einfach, zu konfus.", "timestamp_created": 1517004329, "timestamp_updated": 1517132248, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.412371", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39637734": {"recommendationid": "39637734", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984286213", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517254239}, "language": "english", "review": "Would recommend to anybody who likes platformer games.

While most metroidvania games tend to take from the big titles like Super Metroid and Castlevania Symphony of the Night, Konjak seems to draw more of his inspiration from Metroid Fusion and Castlevania Order of Ecclesia. This shows in the fact that upgrades are extremely sparse due to the game's preference to give you everything you need and let you work with the existing mechanics instead, as well as the fact that this game is very boss heavy and those bosses are all very fun to fight. \n\nThe music is probably the game's weakest component. It's not bad. It is simply serviceable. It does the job, but it doesn't do it at peak performance. You may find most of the tracks to be forgettable in the long run, but it's clear that this is not where Konjak truly shines, and that's fine. \n\nThis game is also a very narrative and dialogue heavy metroidvania, so that may put off people expecting the traditional metroidvania fare of being given a sparse narrative and letting you explore the world to figure things out. The story is told quite deliberately through character interaction and dialogue rather than personal, environmental interaction as one would usually expect from this type of game. The stark contrast of fast-paced gameplay into slower paced narrative bits may not gel well with a lot of people, but if you're actually into that, then you'll have no problems here.\n\nThe narrative and themes themselves may seem heavyhanded, but as the name of the game suggests, that's pretty much to be expected. The dialogue can feel a bit preachy at times and there are points in the story that don't feel as well written as they could have been, but it does a decent enough job at establishing the circumstances of the world. It may feel like all doom and gloom at first, but there's plenty of comedy to break of the drama. \n\nIconoclasts also features a challenge mode after you beat the game once which adds new attacks to bosses and has the player dying in one hit.\n\nTL;DR: Game is fun, music is serviceable, art is amazing, and it's a very story heavy metroidvania which may not be for everyone.", "timestamp_created":

And story here is amazing. I definitenly didn't expect so serious and deep questions, philosophy and morality in a \"just another platrofrmer game\". This game is not about pixel man, jumping over platforms, not about fighting with an evil villain \u2013 it's about family, friendship, love, religion, faith, deceit, hyrocrisy, growing up... it's about people and how they change, and every core character in this story is ALIVE. It's a great game.\n\nA special like for how thoroughly emotions are expressed here. You're not just reading a text \u2013 due to highlighting with capital case, animated jumping words, etc, plus detailed animation of characters themselves \u2013 it feels like a real emotional speech. With no voice and very few sound effects. Great job.\n\n\nAbout negative sides. I found perks almost useless (except of 2 ones), I think here there is too much backtracking (pass 10 rooms you cleaned before, move to another area, pass 5-6 rooms there to find a character, speak to him, and then GO ALL THE WAY BACK RIGHT TO THE POINT YOU STARTED FROM), and one boss in the final part of the game is frustratingly difficult (just because he can hit you, and you can't hit him, having about 0.5 sec to aim his vulnerable place).

It controls well, gets excellent mileage out of a smart handful of smart mechanics, and has a bevy of inventive boss fights (both pure action and very puzzle-y). Most remarkable is the absurdly good pacing - the action, puzzles, and story mix seamlessly and smoothly increase in intensity throughout the 10-15 hours of playtime. It\u2019s more linear than a metroidvania and more puzzley than an action platformer, and the result is a very pure 2D adventure. \n\nThere\u2019s much more attention paid to the story than you\u2019d expect from the genre. The characters are well developed, and though its beginning can be a bit heavy-handed (characters are a bit too keen to bring up philosophy and make it very clear where they stand ideologically) it develops well, and delivers gut-punching grimness and heartwarming tenderness surprisingly effectively. A good chunk of a playthrough is spent watching cutscenes, but thankfully none are too long, all are skippable (not that I recommend it), and optional dialogue and sidequests give extra details for those who care. If you\u2019re just looking for action and puzzles then it\u2019s a bit harder to recommend, but the story is marginally deeper in its themes and better in its treatment than most games. \n\nBoth tonally and structurally, I can\u2019t help but compare it to Cave Story. It has that same cheerful and charming exterior, with brightness and genuine hilarity that comes from sharp dialogue and impeccable comedic timing moreso than actual jokes. Underneath both there\u2019s a well-formed maturity in the characters, and a world with real darkness in its history. While Cave Story is content to largely hint at the themes underlying its world and focus on the action, Iconoclasts spends much of its playtime exploring them explicitly. Cave Story expects players to earn the story through action and Iconoclasts notably doesn\u2019t - its Standard difficulty is quite easy, and generous checkpointing will guide beginners through to its end (experienced 2D action game players may want to start on Hard). Both succeed in creating worlds with a weight and memorability that exceed the relatively short time you spend in them, and both are games worth coming back to.", "timestamp_created": 1516940628, "timestamp_updated": 1516940628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39620862": {"recommendationid": "39620862", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103492868", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 562, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 12, "last_played": 1521494832}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida, buen soundtrack, buena historia, buenas mecanicas. 10/10\n\nEspero a que este disponible el OST para comprarlo. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1516939915, "timestamp_updated": 1516940008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39620148": {"recommendationid": "39620148", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073148373", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 21, "last_played": 1521246244}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Lo he esperado por a\u00f1os, desde el demo del 2012 me encanto, las graficas pixel art, el soundtrack, es un metroidvania super bueno, aun no lo he pasado pero paso por aqui a recomendarlo, un precio super aceptable por lo que ofrece. \n(Despues cuando lo termine hare un analisis mas profundo)", "timestamp_created": 1516936316, "timestamp_updated": 1516936316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39619728": {"recommendationid": "39619728", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049013890", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516933976}, "language": "english", "review": "Holy moly,\nJust end the game and the only thing I can tell is that this game is amazing\nThe story is so amazing, the universe created in this game is awesome.\nI really enjoy playing this game.\n\nEveryone should play it", "timestamp_created": 1516934200, "timestamp_updated": 1516934200, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39619551": {"recommendationid": "39619551", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013259300", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 736, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516929852}, "language": "english", "review": "I have been waiting for this game's release ever since I played its demo back in 2011, and oh boy, it did not disappoint. 10/10 Will smack everything with my oversized wrench again.", "timestamp_created": 1516933508, "timestamp_updated": 1516933508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39617483": {"recommendationid": "39617483", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044339015", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1013, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516923535}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

Your melee weapon could have been a sword or stick or hammer, the game would still work. Sure you would have to do some dressup and replace the cogs with plain old levers, but they are not more than levers. It is like one of the million AAA games, were the story and gameplay are disconnected.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather simple and uninteresting, except for the bosses.\nThe bosses are all unique, make sense in the world and often it is too hard to tell what is going ( at least the first time around, I played it on hard). There is at times too much stuff on the screen and the game is bad at communicating what is something that can harm you and what is just some random visual effect, they all have the same visual intensity. Since each boss is unique it is also very hard to tell what you are supposed to be doing, It is rarely just \"hit him until he dies\" and the game is bad at giving you some guidance. This stuff could have been done visually ( and has been attempted ) but since everything in this game is visually very loud it is hard to pick that up and just goes under as noise.\n\nSo yeah, it is a bit like owlboy.

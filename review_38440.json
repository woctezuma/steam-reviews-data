You are wandering mage, who fled his destroyed world and entered a realm of squabbling gods. Each of them welcomes you with open arms, and tries to use you to undermine the other gods by battling their champions.\n\nIn the actual game you summon various units and command them in the battlefield, you also cast spells on your enemies. Depending on the deities you join forces with you may be able to summon ents, dragons, demons, beasts made of rocks or flying monstrosities. You will be able to create an erupting volcano, summon a tornado or Death itself to kill anything and anyone on the battlefield. As an added bonus you will be able to burn your enemies with a fiery dragon, bombard them with great boulders from the sky or simply make their intestines explode. Fun!\n\nIn order to summon all these fantastic beasts and cast those fearsome spells, you will need mana - to replenish it, you will have to seize control of mana fountains scattered around the map. In order to summon your minions you will also need souls. You will start off having some, and you can collect the souls of your fallen soldiers. You can also use the souls of your dead enemies - but you need to purge them first. Summon a wicked witchdoctor, who will suck out the soul of the dead body with a giant syringe and carry it to your altar, where it will be tortured until it breaks and joins your side. Be wary tho, your altar is a great source of power, but also a great vulnerability - if your opponents desecrate it and kill you while doing so, you will be banished from this realm.\n\nThe game sports a campaign that allows you to get familiar with the units, controls,m tactics and strategies, but the AI is not very demanding - the winning strategy is to mostly hunker down near your own mana fountains and let your enemies bleed souls with each attack they launch at you. Still, the campaign is enjoyable, and completing it allows you to freely build your unit and spell selection for multiplayer matches.\n\nAs you probably already noticed, the game also sports a multiplayer mode. The battles are hectic and difficult, almost as difficult as finding opponents online. Strongly suggest playing with friends. Nontheless I think that this mode is the core of the game, and the games depth allows for a lot of learning and getting better to kick your firends' buttocks.\n\nI must mention the style and aesthetics of the game. While the numbers of polygons and texture resolutions did not age well - obviously, considering the age of the title - the style is superb. The mix of grim and gory elements with a wicked sense of humor makes a very tasty cocktail. I would love to see this game remastered with current hardware!\n\nIf you don't mind dated graphics, enjoy an interesting aesthetic and style and are curious of an action/RTS hybrid about maintaining control of the map, get this game.

Your wizard gets spells and units from that god that are yours to keep, so each playthrough can yield different units/spells based on your choices.  As you progress some gods will become offended and stop offering you work.\n\nYour wizard is active on the battlefield along with your units.  Units are summoned with souls.  When friendly units die their souls can be easily recaptured by their wizard, or converted to a hostile wizard with some effort.  This caps the total number of units and makes each fight a potential boon or loss to your pool of souls.  There are a couple structures that can be built for the purpose of generating mana, defense, and movement.

Keep in mind though, that if you serve the dark powers, you will soon lose the favor of the benelovent gods and vice versa, so choosing sides has limits according to your previous choices. All the gods have an interesting character that can always surprise you, as the good guys can become quite warlike, the bad guys may become just scared, the smart guys can act foolish and the simple guys quite resourceful, so everything and everyone turns out to be quite different than as they seemed at first.\n\nThe creatures in game are colourful and interesting, the spells you can control are ok first, but become quite powerful as you get more power, in the end you may summon volcanoes or tornadoes, or even death itself, depending on who you serve. The islands look like paradise or hell, depending on which god has control over them. On every stage every wizard get an altar, which serve as a base for them. Mana fountains are scattered across the island you play on, which can be occupied to get mana from it. The key element of gameplay however is the resource called 'soul', the more you have, the more powerful army you can summon. Yes, by using souls, you can summon creatures to fight, who will serve you until they die. If a creature falls, you can collect its soul again, but if the creature served another wizard before, you must sacrifice it on your altar first to get its soul, which means the enemy has a chance to prevent it. The key to victory is to desecrate the enemy wizard's altar: you may sacrifice one of your own creatures there, and if the enemy wizard dies during the ritual, you win. Oh yes, death is not permanent in the game until your altar stands, as you may easily resurrect yourself at a mana source.\n\nTo sum up things, gameplay is quite dinamic and fast, there are no slow base building elements, you just get a few mana sources, then you summon creatures, and the enemy is already upon you. This game mechanic is actually quite fun - even if it seems a bit difficult at first - it mixes roleplaying and tactical elements in a way no other game does. Voices and music are also amazing, graphics are still ok, and it is a big pro, considering that this game was published in 2000. \n\nTo cut things short, if you like decent old fantasy games that were made with devotion and enthusiasm, you must try out this one, but beware, once you get the feeling, you will never be able to stop playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1502473098, "timestamp_updated": 1513426188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800157", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34042003": {"recommendationid": "34042003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001320805", "num_games_owned": 228, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1440909877}, "language": "english", "review": "This was my childhood game.

The units and characters all have a very distinct look (although several models are re-used for a few different units), it's not all cookie-cutter humanoids everywhere like in most RTS you can see. It's definitely very refreshing.\n\nThe gameplay is great and very innovative, still feels pretty unique as there's not been any kind of sequel or competitor since then (Brutal Legend has some similarities, but the atmosphere is so different you cannot compare the two). One small \"bad\" thing about the soul mechanic is that every mission basically has a negative difficulty curve : you must beat back the enemy assault with your small initial force, and as you convert some of their souls each subsequent fight becomes easier. Doesn't prevent the game from being very fun to play.\n\nThe storyline is also pretty interesting, and the fact that you can choose a different god for (almost) every mission makes for good replayability - the campaign lasts 10 missions and 9 of those are different for each god, so that's a total of 45 different maps and scenarios to play through if you want to be torough (which I definitely recommend). The first missions seem to have almost no impact because they're minor (so even if you're not the one doing X, it will still happen) but as you progress in the story there's definitely major differences between, say, a Charnel playthrough versus a James one.\n\nCheap, often on sale (4,99\u20ac as I'm writing this) and very enjoyable, there's really no reason to not get this if you

It's an older game so don't expect much from the graphics. Sacrifice is an army-focused spell-casting game. You play as a wizard that summons creatures to create an army and fight other wizards. Your character comes from a dying world to a new world with five gods. Your wizard introduces himself, and starts selecting which of the god's quests he wants to complete. \n\nWhat makes this game neat is that you can only choose 1 of the 5 quests, which makes that god like you more and the others dislike you, and the storyline spirals out from there. The same overarching storyline applies, but how you go about completing it and the way the story is told changes slightly depending on which god(s) you help. The five gods go from \"Good\" (Persephone) to \"Evil\" (Charnel), and it doesn't matter which one(s) you choose to do quests for. Besides the storyline shifting slightly, the god(s) you choose to assist will give you summon creatures and spells from their domain. For example, Persephone will give you healing spells that the other gods do not have, as well as Druids and Rangers, creatures only granted by Persephone. The game has a ton of re-playability because of the many combinations of choices you can make yielding entirely unique arsenals of creatures and spells for every playthrough. \n\nI highly recommend this game as a unique experience for gamers, even if \"army-based strategy RPG\" doesn't sound that appealing to you.", "timestamp_created": 1445977589, "timestamp_updated": 1445977684, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18532024": {"recommendationid": "18532024", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983131202", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 557, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470595945}, "language": "portuguese", "review": "This game brings so many memories !!\n\nThis game is awesome even now, the game style is amazing !!\n\nTry it !!", "timestamp_created": 1445106512, "timestamp_updated": 1445106512, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18180567": {"recommendationid": "18180567", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960960793", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 845, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443149889}, "language": "english", "review": "Another reason I love steam.

The game has great series of unit-sounds. Also,  you can change background music by replacing your own in game`s folder. And, game story is pretty rich and fun to follow. It gives player 5 choices at the start of game with unique philosophy that flows over the units during each level.\nThe method that player arise dead enemy`s soul and capture them in temple with kind of dancing presentation, is one of the nice artistic features of the game. The difference on design between low power units and high level one, is creative and nice. \n\nI suggest RTS game designers, renew this game by saving ALL sound effects and it`s a good game

You can often alternate or even redeem yourself in the eyes of  angered gods, which allows for a very replayable game.\nThe resources for summons are souls, which can be re-used for your creatures, or captured, for enemy creatures.\nThe AI are good, that makes the game hard.

Many of you will skim over this because you've never heard of it, because none of your friends play it or because of its sparse store page. You shouldn't.\n\nSacrifice offers the best mix of tactical depth and ease of learning I have ever seen in a strategy game. You play as a wizard standing down on the field where everything happens. Any units you summon are summoned directly next to you, buildings are created only by you standing next to them (for up to 10 seconds for the largest buildings), and orders are given based on what you can personally see. This makes for a much more immersive and easy-to-grasp gameplay than most other strategy games out there where you may be queuing up orders, units and buildings; might be zoomed far enough out  to be disconnected from the world but not far enough out to see any useful distance.\n\nFurthermore, the wizards you can choose from in multiplayer (you always play as Eldred in the fully-voiced campaign) are all equal. That is, everyone you might play against has access to the exact same spells and units as you. Or rather they have access to the same choices: your spell and unit lists are fully customizable offering a massive amount of variation possible. You could have ranged units that damage over time, can go invisible, can track enemies etc. Or you could pick units based on style if you prefer and do just fine: disease-ridden monsters, aloof mythical creatures, rangers, soldiers, constructs...\n\nThis customisation is in the campaign too but in a much more organic style so that you won't have to worry about choosing units based on no previous experience. Every level of the game has 5 alternatives (one for each of the gods) and each god will try to convince you the help them for each mission. You can decide who to help on a mission-by-mission basis, picking the most interesting or beneficial mission for you. You can become unwaveringly loyal to a particular god (or a certain alliance between 2 or more gods) and only server them. Or you can decide completely randomly if you like. Every mission you take increases your pool of spells or units equally, with units and spells granted by the god you choose to work for. You can also pick up heroes along the way who will be loyal to you (unless you do something completely against their nature) and will follow you in future missions until they die or you lose their trust. Every mission you choose (and don't choose) affects future levels to varying degrees. By making a god's defence stronger you protect their territory that another god or being was after and would've been able to use in future levels. Discovering something allows the god you discovered it for use that information in future battles. Capturing a village, building, character, area etc. will give the benefits of that asset to your god (whether that be a new factory, new allies, a weakness in another god or a number of other boons). This all leads to your character and the world evolving organically in a way that's not always obvious but always makes sense. By the end of your fifth mission you'll have access to a wide variety of spells and units (and perhaps a hero or two) and certain gods will have grown or diminished in power noticeably.\n\nAll of the spells are breathtaking. From the bog-standard heal and speed-up spells you begin with which create a pleasant glow/melody and a cool-looking trail effect respectively. To the more extreme spells granted later on including tornados, volcanos, earthquakes, death-incarnate and many more. In addition, most of these spells can be cast within a couple of seconds and without stopping. This allows you to run amidst your army healing, speeding up and buffing who you need, sniping an important enemy unit (or a bunch of them) and then hiding behind your own units again within a very short period of time. A lot of these spells (and some units) scare the landscape permanently too. This makes places where small skirmishes and large battles have occurred very obvious, even after 5, 10 or 60 minutes. Scorch marks, blood stains, unnatural bumps or dips in the earth, sometimes even the earth itself has gone.\n\nThe penultimate thing will mention (even though there is so much more I could say) is that the humour in this game is incredible from start-to-finish. From the gods (voiced by Brad Garrett, Kevin Michael  Richardson, Castulo Guerra, Jennifer Hale and Tim Curry) to the units (every one of which with the sole exception of the manahor (an armless, mana-dispensing bunny) has a half-dozen lines if you enjoy clicking on a unit repeatedly long enough for it to yell at you to get lost) to the wizards. This game has so much personality and not in an annoying way.  The humor interlaces with the rest of the game beautifully instead of being forced like in so many other games.\n\nLastly, this game is worth your money and time without question. Without exaggeration I have played through the campaign seven times with a vastly different playthrough and experience each time: once following each of the gods wholeheartedly, once working for all of the gods and keeping them all as friendly with me as possible for as long as possible and once attempting to keep a pair of gods powerful and friendly with each other until the end.\n\nAt \u00a37 it's worth it easily, at half-price (as it is at the time of this review) I can't recommend it more to everyone I know. Get it, it's awesome.\n\n-Edit- There isn't much more I can say about this game before I nominate it.

It depends if you want to support a diverse gaming industry. I find that when games try to give the player more control over what goes from seeming complicated to simple in a small amount of time that the learning curve is an easy one, but makes the gameplay all the better. I'm a big fan of RTS games that allow for individual FPS control (think starcraft but you could control a single marine, or a pyro, and when you die you become the guy next to him). This wasn't exactly the case, but doesn't meant I can appraise the game for what it is.\n\nSacrifice's storyline itself is good. In fact it's great that I won't talk about it because if your really into story telling of four gods duking it out waging wars with one another and you being the catalyst, you might like this. The gameplay itself I like for the reason the game designers had the intentions of making a FPS RTS game, they tried pushing boundaries. This game back in the day may have been phenominal, but today the gameplay leaves me to hunger for a bit more. You are a sorcerer of sorts able to casts spells to build certain buildings (mana places or soul collecting places for troops) and build units around those buildings and replenish your mana faster. Over the course of the game you come across units and similar buildings to yours, which of course you have to attack commanding your units or by your magic. Different units allow for different purposes. Mana horns I learned early on that you need them to replenish mana in the field (after dying several times... probably should have read a tutorial but ain't nobody got time for one longer than a minute)! The control scheme as well I find is easy. The only thing I would really like if they allowed you to zoom out furhter on the character.\n\nI will give this game a .9 instead of a .7 due to it trying to break more boundaries. I find games like this allow gaming to go beyond graphics, but start looking at gameplay again (be it single player, coop, or multiplayer. They all have their own joy to offer). \n\nRATING : 7.6/10\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]C[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]C+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]", "timestamp_created": 1407522779, "timestamp_updated": 1470092573, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.902439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11595125": {"recommendationid": "11595125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015130102", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1450820716}, "language": "english", "review": "I need scissors! 61!", "timestamp_created": 1407459255, "timestamp_updated": 1407459255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11594295": {"recommendationid": "11594295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015206516", "num_games_owned": 727, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513819259}, "language": "english", "review": "Really great strategy game, very innovative for it's time.

wizard that can get insane powers over 5 elemnts from gods he power of earth,fire,air/storm,death, and life. The game is at its core RTS you make units go out fight and destroy the others sanctuary/base. But this game has twists that are awsome. to make units you use souls yes souls that you can get from your and your enemy's dead units. But an enemy soul you first have to convert with a cool spell and unlike most RTS when you want a unit if you have the material it can be made anywhere at an almost instant speed. This is just your units the spells you get to fight using your wizard are epic as you level. you can if you do the path of death call an angel of death to kill everything in range you can make a dragon of pure flame and storms depending on the element. The graphics are dated and the story is kinda weird since you can hop gods and go from working for death to life in an istant but for this same reason it is really got a go replay value since you can do hundreds of paths.

The fact that the world and the creatures look like something designed by Hieronymus Bosch is part of the reason why this game still looks unique and interesting. But the voice acting is also very well done. In fact if you look up the IMDB page with the voice cast of this game it reads like a who's who of voice acting. If you've been watching cartoons or playing games in the past fifteen years there's a good chance you've heard their voices many, many times. Tim Curry is probably the most well known, but veteran voice actors like Tony Jay and Michael Bell (Legacy of Kain), Tara Strong (Harley Quinn in recent Batman games and cartoons), Dwight Schultz (Murdock on the A-team and Luitenant Barclay on several Star Trek shows), Frank Welker (Megatron in the movies and the cartoon series) and Rob Paulsen (Yakko from Animaniacs, Stanley Ipkiss from Mask) are just a few of the actors that deliver the voices heard throughout the game. \nThe game is also a lot of fun to play. It's a real time strategy game where you are a wizard who has been driven from his own universe and is now a drifting mercenary for hire. Each level you can choose one of five gods to work for and this god will grant you two of their minions to summon and spells to cast. This makes for great replayability because all the minions have different strengths and weaknesses. Because some of these gods hate each other working for one god will make other gods dislike you. So if you choose the same god several times some of the other gods won't be available. \nOnce you start a level you'll need manna to cast spells and souls to cast creatures. Each level is a tug of war between you and several other wizards who are all trying to grab as many souls and as many mana fountains as they can. Only by destroying the altar of an enemy wizard you can really vanquish him from the area. This makes for some frantic gameplay where the tide of battle can suddenly take a change for the worst.\nShiny also infused the game with their unique sense of humor. For instance each time you cast a spell you'll hear your wizard shout out some magic words. Some of these sound a lot like \"klatuu barada nikto\" a command used in the classic scifi movie \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951) which is often referenced in games and movies (like in Evil Dead 3 where Bruce Campbell has to use these words as a spell to calm down the Necronomicon). But there's also a spell which will summon a huge cow which will crash down like a meteorite and create a large crater.

It's built on the tried-and-true Melee/Ranged/Flyer triangular counter system and focuses on a central unit, the wizard, which gains experience levels and new spells as the match or mission progresses. \n\nThere are no goldmines or forests to exploit, however, the only resources on the field are manafounts, which, once built upon, can relay mana to you and your army. To build units, you use souls, which are painstakingly converted from heathens, including enemy military units. Since you're feeding on your enemy, you can either chip away at the enemy army in a passive game of zoning and area denial, cut down his mana supply by harrassing his manaliths, or you can just strike at the jugular and attempt to kill the wizard in a battle royale, severely reducing the potential of his units if successful. Despite the strategic simplicity of the game, all RTS playstyles are accounted for.\n\nSacrifice is a third-person view game centered on the player, not top-down view like a traditional RTS. The camera is notorious for not zooming out a lot - the wizard is advised to seek high ground so he may properly command his forces. Control groups help a ton. The interface is extensive and highly-customizable, but it'll probably take a lot of playing before you're making use of all the shortcuts.\n\nThere's an all-star cast of voice actors and they're all in their element here. The soundtrack is memorable and no game element seems odd or out of place, as bizarre and surreal as the game world is. The grotesque monsters, the meaty ground, the strange plants and structures, the whole aesthetic of the game comes together so well.\n\nIf I had to criticize one thing about the game, I'd have to criticize its competitive value. The game is better-suited for tournaments than many RTS but there are a lot of random elements that plague the player, particularly the random nature of melee attack damage and certain endgame spells and units. Speaking of the endgame, the final levels of the campaign and the credits seem a bit rushed in comparison to the tons of love given the early missions.\n\nNo matter what you're looking for in a classic game, I'm pretty certain you'll find it here. You cannot truly experience this game on the first playthrough. The lore is deep, the gameplay is deep, and the crevasses between the floating islands that make up the world are deep.

Unique mixture of RPG/RTS/TPS, which doesn't feel like almost any other game. You are a wizard, who comes to a new world and is being offered to serve multiple gods, totally 5 of them, which one you will pick is your choice and each of them has its own distinguishable personality + the voice acting is just excellent! With names like Tim Curry, Brad Garrett and Jennifer Hale.\n\nThe gameplay self revolves around collecting souls that enables you to create your own units and capturing manaliths that gives you mana regeneration to cast spells and summon creatures. The objectives vary in campaign, but is mostly  focused on defeating enemy Sorcerer by desecrating their altars (casting Desecrate spell on own unit and killing enemy sorcerer), since if you only kill them, then they can ressurect.\n\nEvery time you choose to play mission in campaign, you have to pick which god you are going to side with, which grants you either specific creature/spell of that god or both, meaning each god has 9 Creatures and 9 Spells that you can combine. Some creatures and spells have similar concepts, but each has specific visuals and/or twist, which provides huge variety and replayability, although I personally think Pyro is the most powerful one.\n\nThe campaign also provides interesting story with some quite nice twists, it's indeed not the anything extremely extrodinary, but I still like the story regardless. The best part is that you can side with different gods with each gameplay, thus playing from different point of view, making it look like multiple different storylines. Every god has also specific personality, based off elements. Nature/Life + Ground/Rocks/Earth + Air/Ice + Fire/Machines/Technology + Death/Decay.\n\nThe graphics looks quite good for it's time (2000!), especially thanks to the character designs I've talked about earlier, but Sacrifice was also one of first games to use anti-aliasing, terrain change and other advanced technologies, which actually makes it feel more like 2004-2006 game, which is quite an extrodinary achievement, so kudos to developers.\n\nStill, despite being accepted extremely well by critics and being called one of the best games of the year, the game didn't sell well. It probably was due to many factors, but one of the main ones would be that it was quite performance depending game and only top PC setups of its time could run it propetly, making it sort of Crysis of its time, thus the actual market for the game quite tiny and the Shiny (company that developed Sacrifice) ended up in huge losses and never recovered, which is personally kind of ironic, since I consider this one of best games ever made to this day.\n\nIn conclusion, Sacrifice is worth not only playing, but also replaying. It is one of most unique games that works flawlessly, the designs looks amazing and characters are extremely memorable, with great writing and voice acting, it is a gem that we should treasure, not only for its quality, but also for the efford it took everyone to make it. The developers put everything they had into this game and I only wish they had opportunities to make more great games.

Movement feels like a different era (probably is), overall gameplay feels not all too interesting (singleplayer pretty much comes down to luring the enemy into a trap to snatch some souls, rinse&repeat until you got enough to crush him near his altar).\n\nI will not doubt this was a unique and milestone-ish game at one point, but measured with today's standards, it just can't cope (gameplay/controls-wise, I do not judge it for it's graphics).", "timestamp_created": 1388167633, "timestamp_updated": 1388167633, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527986", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8311119": {"recommendationid": "8311119", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970364294", "num_games_owned": 562, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1388687326}, "language": "italian", "review": "Spettacolare", "timestamp_created": 1388087306, "timestamp_updated": 1388087306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463224", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8306647": {"recommendationid": "8306647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045360080", "num_games_owned": 451, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 705, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1395315387}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, hours of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1388077759, "timestamp_updated": 1388077759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530941", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8300703": {"recommendationid": "8300703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021388837", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461598417}, "language": "polish", "review": "Bardzo fajna gra, stara ale jara.

Even though it's almost ancient (It was released in 2000), it has really awesome thoughts put into it. The idea of this game is fantastic, yet it's a bit hard, since you only have that 3rd person perspective with sort of crappy camera adjustments. However, it sure is a Game worth playing: Magic in this game is something I'd considder *REAL Magic*, I haven't seen any game with that sort of magic concept such as in Sacrifice, since it's really affects the environment or is 'realisticly' big. A summoned Tornado, for example, is roughly the game characters size multiplied by 255. It's fantastic to look at that. Furthermore, the Game itself has gigantic potential. I personally hope for a improved remake of this game.\nPro vs Cons:\n+Great replay value as mentioned everywhere; Due to the campaign.\n+Great Concept and Ideas.\n+Unique Troops. And I've seen lots. \n+Awesome Spellcasting. By far the most awesome part in the whole game.\n+Differences between races/elements is good.\n+Entertaining, as you can influence the slightest flow of battle.\n~Challenging. My longest battle till now was 'round 12 Minutes of non-stop summoning/spelling stuffs.\n~Amass of Species: There is enough for everything, but there could be \"more\". More Maps for skirmishes, maybe levelable summons, things like that. Maybe even a skill-tree for your wizard.\n- Camera Angles: Can often disturb the scenery, also there's only 3rd Person, as far as I have played.\n- Ressource-Management: There could be some sort of other way to gain Souls; Since if you lose an important battle, you basically lose the match, as you lose all your gathered souls to your enemy, except if you were agile enough to gather them during battle.", "timestamp_created": 1388062460, "timestamp_updated": 1388062460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8290344": {"recommendationid": "8290344", "author": {"steamid": "76561197974231725", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1389215595}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game ! pitty that almost nobody saw the potential in this game back there, when it was realesed.

If yes, have you heard of Sacrifice? Assuming not, Sacrifice IS one of the first and the best Action RTS hybrid titles out there, so BL's gameplay is hardly all that \"innovative\" (though still fun). Fun fact: Tim Curry starred in both of those games. You don't know who Tim Curry is? Go sit in the corner, you're on timeout.\n\nSacrifice is an incredibly bizzare and twisted game. Probably the weirdest I've ever played, aside from American McGee's Alice and The Path. The game sounds fantastic, has got a very memorable soundtrack and the voice acting is simply superb. The world and the creatures that inhabit it are quite strange, but unique and beautiful in their own way. The graphics are pretty outdated in this one though and it's something that may be difficult to overlook, especially if you're having a hard time getting engrossed into the game.\n\nThe gameplay is something that takes time to get used to and playing the (rather comprehensive and enjoyable) tutorial is a must here. As previously mentioned, it's a third person squad based game where you make formations out of your units, cast spells to aid them in battle and complete various map objectives. Whatever units and spells you acquire vastly depends on the deities you choose as the story progresses, thus making the game replayable due to the large amount of combinations that can be created. \n\nLast but not least, game has the same oddball sense of humor you might find in titles like Earthworm Jim. Considering that Earthworm Jim was the first successful creation of (now defunct) Shiny Ent. along with Sacrifice that followed a few years later, it's not all that surprising.\n\nThis game is really, horribly underrated. But at the same time, it's not for everyone.

Perhaps some of you don't need to imagine, perhaps some of you still live a life away from the madness of the net, able to sequester yourself in an insular paradise.

But it's very rare to be able to look *back* at a time, and say while it mightn't have been the best use of the time, you don't regret it. This game was that much fun.\n\nLater on it was joined by staples such as Wizardry 8 and fps's i'm sure we've all played, but even throughout the next two years of my life, it still earnt its place on the shelf. It's just...an amazing game. It is still beautiful, the insane character models defying time, the gameplay still challenging and sometimes even frustrating, the spells still awesome, the gods still scheming and the action as frantic as ever.\n\nI have yet to play a game that really catches up to Sacrifice. Like a lot of great innovative games, at the time it just didn't get to its audience. Like your system shocks or deus ex's, where decades have passed before they've been emulated and resurrected, Sacrifice fits into a niche that is hard to define. You play like a field marshall, summoning troops to your side even as you dodge incoming fire and fury, and your objective is often simply to conquer, to destroy, to cleanse. But the path to that goal is often turf-war, sneak attacks, flanking, trap-setting and straight bull-dozing through your enemies.

This is a game that was ahead of its time in several aspects - player choice, voice acting and simple gameplay.\n\nSacrifice is something of a cross between a strategy game and an action-RPG. You control a wizard, and you can summon troops, cast spells and summon buildings across the map. This sounds like pretty standard fare, but the context of the single player campaign is what brings it to the next level; there are five competing gods, any of whom you can side with from mission to mission. The spell(s) and creature(s) you unlock depends upon which god you sided with on each mission, and is permanent for that playthrough. Of course, do enough to piss off a specific god and they will no longer be prepared to deal with you, and towards the latter stages of the campaign you are forced to lock-in your final choice anyway, as events reach their climax. I mentioned voice acting, and the gods in Sacrifice are the main source - my personal favourite - Charnel, the god of death - has some cracking lines and jibes at the others.\n\nIn this day and age, Sacrifice is going to be a bit dated - hell it came out in the year 2000, but for a few quid this is really one of those hidden gems from gaming history.\n\nP.S my playtime on Steam is pretty low because I bought the original CD version back when it came out.", "timestamp_created": 1357301727, "timestamp_updated": 1479944458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2711143": {"recommendationid": "2711143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011476135", "num_games_owned": 710, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 34, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1354608000}, "language": "english", "review": "Very unique and creative.

Their second miracles lies in summoning life, from nowhere, to do their combative bidding. Souls are currency for more stronger monsters, and mana is the fuel for all sorts of magical mayham.

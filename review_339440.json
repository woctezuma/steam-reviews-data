Satisfying combat, good visuals, difficulty is just right, at least so far as I've seen. The soundtrack is awesome too.

Locking it to the screen is helpful, but it blends in to most of the scenery too easily. Maybe make it larger, or a brighter color or something.

The game mixes RPG aspect such as the leveling systems that unlocks further abilities you may use innately and those that you must call forth at the right time, such as an ac-130 gun ship to rain fire down upon your enemy or a sentry tower to provide cover fire for your well planned escape. You will also gain ability points to spend in such skills as speed, health regeneration, and a number of others that will give you the upper hand you may need in order to succeed as the levels grow harder and harder with every victory. This extremely fast pace game will get your heart racing as you jump and fire in all directions as chaos consumes the screen in a bright and vibrant display of both color and carnage. \n\nPros:\n\n- Great level design even if at first they seem simple, given the ability to damage the surrounding areas with your weapons allows for an ever changing play through.\n-Leveling system is well balanced giving you just enough to allow you an edge without making you to overpower to soon.\n-The three difficulties is just right for both beginner and expect alike allowing you to tailor your own experience.\n-Replay value is definitely there as you can go back to try your hand at a high score everyone can see or simply go back to get more experience to level up and try and beat that pesky level giving you a hard time. \n-Music is amazing and only further adds to the immersion effect \n\nCons: \n\n-The game is rather short at the moment but given time I have no doubt they will be adding more levels to the game (side note: even though there aren\u2019t a great deal of levels to play, depending on your skill this still may take you a good amount of hours to beat)\n\nIn conclusion, a great game definitely worth the price and will only get better as time goes on, I for one can\u2019t wait to see what lies ahead for this game and this company.5 out of 5, one of the best voxel based shoot em up games I\u2019ve played in years.

The game itself is really well presented and polished up for the current state that it's in (Early Access), the art style of the game is really niceand the current amount of weapons is decent for the time being. It's very addicting to play and is insanely fun. It is worth noting that this game does demand for your computer to be decent, especially when it comes to destorying the enviroment with all of the explosions happening and big craters that are on the ground. If you are having troubles with performance issues of this game, then I suggest you do some changes in the opitions menu to make the game run smoothly.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nCritical Annihilation is a fast paced shoot 'em up with some really cool perks, and character progression. The game is strangely addiciting along with all of the enemies that you have to kill. The destructable enviroment of the game really fits well with all of the enemies that will be running at you trying to kill you. Although, when playing through the game, it seems that the game is really demanding for your computer to be decent. With all of the explosions happening when you pla through the game and craters that appear on the ground, make sure your specs of your computer are good enough to run this game decently. There is a rather large selection of weapons available up for use to kill your enemies with. Providing that there is also randomly generated drop system in this current stage of the game, it is really impressive to see that sort of detail be in the game already at this stage of the game that is currently in Early Access.\n\n[h1]Art Style[/h1]\nThe decent visuals and art style of this game really fit the type of game the developers made for this game. Most of the stages are very well detailed, with vibrant lighting and colours which really bring this game to life. The games graphics are made out of voxels, but upon doing some research of this game, it was also based upon the voxel engine which allows for the destructable enviroments that happen during the game. The lighting really comes into play when explosions happen throughout, the lighting is really well presented when exlpsions occur and that's when the lighting effect is best shown off. \n\n[h1]Music & Sound[/h1]\nGenerically, the sounds are very nicely done and presented when playing through the game. With the music in the background that really fits the fast paced shooter game, with a kind of dubstep music to it. The sounds of the guns and the enemies are fairly nice, not annoying like some game where they use the same sound effects for each gun.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nA very fun and addictive game to play, with some really nice graphics and explosions that occur through the game. Although it demands a bit on your PC, so make sure that your specs or up with the recommened specs. If you are having trouble then tweek some settings to make the game run smooth. Some really nice music to fit the fast paced type of game.\n\n[code]For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GoodGamesGR#]Good Games Giveaways & Reviews[/url] curator group [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/GoodGamesGR#curation]here[/url].", "timestamp_created": 1458343671, "timestamp_updated": 1458343691, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.485990", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21880477": {"recommendationid": "21880477", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997724945", "num_games_owned": 2862, "num_reviews": 177, "playtime_forever": 275, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458185665}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Critical Annihilation[/b] is an isometric twin-stick shooter with a voxel graphic style. Not only the graphics are made out of voxels, but the game itself is based upon a voxel engine, thus allowing for destructible environments and some pretty good looking particle and lighting effects when there is an explosion. It is also worth noting that the can be somewhat demanding on your computer, especially during big explosions due to all the particles flying and the big craters that appear on the ground. That said, the game already has a very detailed options menu so if you run into trouble running the game, you can do some tweaking and it will most likely run fine.\n\nOne thing I must say is that I\u2019m not really one to play much of these top down survival shooters. Still, I was atracted by its rather unique look and was surprised that I found myself enjoying the gameplay as much as I did.\n\nOne other thing that surprised me was the soundtrack. I\u2019m not much of a listener to this type of electronic music (dubstep?) but I must say that after playing the game for a few hours, it started feeling quite catchy and it kind of grew on me.\n\n[h1]The core:[/h1]\nBy looking at the game trailer and screenshots you can clearly guess what the game is all about, mowing down hordes of enemies. That said, I\u2019m going to try to explain some other mechanics that the game has.\n\nFirst and foremost, you have three different modes, one of which is not available at the moment. You have your campaign mode, that currently has 15 different missions, which allows you to unlock powerups, perks, weapons and the specific mission maps for survival mode. Survival mode, as you probably imagined, is just survive as long as you can. Last but by no means least, \u201cclassic survival\u201d mode, which is unavailable at the moment, is basically survival mode but with no powerups and you select your weapon at the beginning, atleast according to its description. As with any other game of this genre, Critical Annihilation also features online highscore leaderboards.\n\nNow, where the game gets interesting, atleast for me, is with the ability to choose different characters and improve them, unlock perks and different abilities. As of right now, you can choose between three different classes, Soldier, Engineer and Scout. Each one of them has their own ups and downs and you should try each one of them out and see which one better suits your playstyle. That said, the character progression is fast paced, every now and then you\u2019ll be able to spend points to upgrade your stats (Life, Accuracy, Speed, Stamina, Regeneration and Shield). You\u2019ll also be able to choose different perks and abilities for your current character.\n\nPerks are basically passive abilities, such as increased life regeneration and the ability to make enemy bullets move slower. Abilities on the other hand are divided into two categories, offensive and defensive abilities. While playing you can activate your offensive ability with \u201cQ\u201d and your defensive ability with \u201cE\u201d. Examples of offensive abilities are things such as a sentry turret or an airstrike, while defensive abilties can be something like a plasma shield that makes you invulnerable for a short period of time or the ability to slow down time.\n\nAfter killing them, some enemies will drop either weapons or powerups. Weapons range from your standard assault rifle, shotgun, laser pulse rifle, grenade launcher and minigun. The minigun particularly is really satisfying to use, since it completely obliterates waves of enemies. Powerups can be simple things such as medkits or life saving items such as nukes, turrets and rocket launchers. The nukes are my favourite because they cause a huge explosion and leave a hole on the ground.\n\nOne thing I also found out to be really helpful was the ability to jump, which is rather unusal for a game like this. Jumping allows you to shoot rockets above the enemies at the front so that the explosion hits the middle of a crowd, thus causing more casualties. \n\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\n\nTo sum things up, I do have some minor things that I think need to be adressed. One is the fact that the game has no story whatsoever. This is not necessarily a bad thing for some people, especially people who are die hard fans of this genre, but others like myself might find this to be a negative point.\n\nOne other very slight complaint that I have is the fact that the the sprinting animation is very hard to distinguish from the standard move animation. I believe that having a different animation for sprinting would allow new players to distinguish the two a little bit better. Maybe I\u2019m just nitpicking.\n\nStill, after looking at the forums, I can say that the developer is open and takes into consideration the ideas and suggestions given by the players and the community, so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if these small issues I have with the game would be adressed.\n\nIn the end, the game is pretty simple, and people looking for an in-depth shooter might not find that here. That said, this game is ideal for people who just want to have some mindless fun and have the satisfaction of shooting endless hordes of enemies in the face and, as I mentioned, the game has its fair share of perks, weapons and power ups, so if you\u2019re into that sort of thing, I think you\u2019ll find plenty of enjoyment here.", "timestamp_created": 1458185491, "timestamp_updated": 1458185491, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.697218", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21863894": {"recommendationid": "21863894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082995144", "num_games_owned": 10294, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1458102280}, "language": "english", "review": "Nothing I enjoy more than having a nice relaxing evening playing a mindless twin stick shooter, plowing through waves of creatures, and building up that old school high score..  (brought back memories of my days plugging quarters into the arcade, trying to beat some over the top high score.)  When I first saw Critical Annihilation my first thought was this looks awesome..  After playing the game for a few hours I said yes, this game is awesome.  Voxel based games have really taken off the last few years...  While some may take issue with the art style and game play, I love it.  \n\n[b]Gameplay -[/b]  \n\nTypical twin stick shooter game play, (pretty sure they are still considered twin stick on the PC, anyway) the environment is billed as being totally destructible, which is great, but on almost all the levels you'll be too busy avoiding bullets, zombies, spiders and everything else the game throws at you... In all that mayhem, you'll likely forget all about the Environment being destructible.   From what I saw stuff got destroyed after a while, but this isn't a game about causing massive destruction, but about killing lots of enemies.  What sets Critical Annihilation apart from the other twin stickers out there....  along with the above-mentioned environment destruction, the game has some rpg elements as well, with various stats you can increase as you level up.  The game appears to have 3 classes which are unique from each other, Soldier, Engineer and Scout, each class has their own advantages and disadvantages..  The Soldier has the best base combat stats, but no regen or shields..   The Engineer has ok combat stats but starts with a high shield, the Scout has the weakest combat stats but starts off with high regen.\n\nThe stages are fairly large (they are contained to a large round play space), nice amount of room to kite them around (kiting is the act of running around in large circles while the enemies lump together allowing you to pick them off one by one) very common tactic in twin shooters.  Although you can employ the kiting tactic to get an advantage, it starts being far less effective the higher in levels you get.  The last stage I played had I could have sworn 50 - 60 enemies on it.  The difficult really ramps up, with each stage you finish. \n \nCA has 2 main game modes, Campaign, and Survival..   Campaign's and the survival modes are the same, with the major difference being, the campaign will eventually have you wiping out the enemies and facing a boss battle prior to moving onto the next area.   While survival is as you may have guessed trying to stay alive for as long as humanly possible... (After about 3 minutes or so survival seems to get very very hairy, and dare I say very fun.).  A third game mode is grayed out, being an early access title I'll make the leap this mode is currently being worked on, or I didn't finish the game far enough along to unlock it.  \n\n[b]pro's[/b]\nFun and addictive game play\nDecent music, \nvery challenging,\nhigh intensity\n\n[b]con's[/b]\nsome minor glitches with enemies\noccasional hit detection failures\n\n[Summation]\nI'd recommend this fun title, have yourself some mindless fun, slaying all manners of creatures, level up your characters, chew bubblegum and kick butts.

I was skepticle to buy this game at first considering some other early access games I purchased were not as fun as I'd hoped, but this is an excelent acception.\n\nPros:\nThe world is very destructable\nPhysics are nice\nPowerups are amazing, esspecially the slow motion and explosion.\nThis game is definetly challenging\nGreat soundtrack\nfair veriety of maps\nAgain, the explosions can only be described as satisfying.\n\nCons:\nThe game gets difficult extremley fast, I mean level 4 fast. I like a good challenge in games but this is rediculous with now way to change the difficulty.\nYeah thats pritty much it...\n\nConclusion:\nDefenitly would recommend this game, even in early access.\n\nWhat I would like to see added:\nMultiplayer of coarse, it would be amazing to play survival co-op with friends online. \nWould be great if players who make maps could change the entire layout of the map so instead of just a circle, they could make an adventure map.

I highly recommend it.\n\nHowever there are some suggestions and tips how this game could get better. (Since its still early access and I just had some ideas, maybe theyre stupid, but hey you can just ignore them.)\n\nIdeas: \n\n1. I haven't completed the campain yet but I already wish there would be more levels. Maybe some more stages and/or Bosslevels after a Chapter.\n\n2. More characters. I dont now if you have to unlock some first but it would be cool if there were more options depending how you think you could survive best.\n\n3. A co - op mode would be very nice. Dont now if local is needed, but online has to be a thing.\n\nBugs?:\n\n1. Dont know if that is intented but some monsters just clip through the environment. And I checked, no, the obstacles were completly intact.\n\n2. When an enemie ( for example a dog) stands right infront of me, the bullets spawn behind him and do no damage, which is annoying when you are not fast enough to back off.\n\n3. Balance: The diffuculty is nice and balanced. The only thing bothering me are the special enemies with special guns, which make so much damage if you dont look out. Most of them are big enought to see, but some look very similar to the \"normal\" guys and get overlooked so easy. And the red bar doesnt realy help. Maybe make the similar looking ones just bigger or shinier? Would be very helpfull.

First it is nearly impossible past level 8 so needs some balancing. Crosshairs need to be visible. They are almost invisible. I cant stress that enough had no idea where the crosshairs were most of the game.  Would prefer the game wasnt at an angle  makes it very hard to target and walk with a keyboard but that may not be possible with their game design maybe make view angle optional? Other than those few frustrating and very fixable game design issues its really great. I love the voxel model destruction and it looks absolutely fantastic on 4k.

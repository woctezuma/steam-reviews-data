review will be very similar to my previous reviews of the UBERMOSH games, so keep that in mind.\n\nUBERMOSH Vol.3 is the third game in the UBERMOSH series, and has a few new features and changes. \n\nPros\n- Fun and fast gameplay\n- Good visuals \n- A great soundtrack that gets you pumped while you play\n- The same classes from the previous two games all return in addition to a new class, which adds variety to the gameplay\n- The new changes include a new class and a new enemy type. The biggest change however is the removal of cover and the restricted play-area, which gives the player much more freedom of movement\n- The price\n\nCons\n- No options menu to adjust graphics or sound settings, but the volume can be easily adjusted via Volume Mixer (For Windows users)\n- The player automatically picks up whatever gun they walk over which can be annoying, however once you get the best gun in the game it stops happening\n- The removal of the boundaries trivializes the survival achievements, since the player can just keep walking in one direction and outrun the enemies. However this is completely up to the player whether they abuse it or not\n\nLike the previous two installments, I recommend this game to pretty much anyone, largely because of the price. Fans of other top down shooters like Hotline Miami and Nuclear Throne will like this game.", "timestamp_created": 1506197481, "timestamp_updated": 1506197481, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3,

And all of the enemies die in a single hit--how hard could this possibly be?\n\nAs it turns out, hard as \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing nails. Set to a thrumming metal and techno soundtrack (which is still easily one of the best things about the UBERMOSH series), you will die again and again and again. Fortunately the game subscribes to Edmund McMillen's \"Super Meat Boy\" model, wherein dying happens quickly and restarts are virtually instantaneous. This game doesn't want to waste your time--it just wants 90 seconds.\n\nDepending on your class*, you may begin with a sword; use it to relieve an opponent of one of a handful of different firearms. Some of these weapons are great. Some aren't so great. Fortunately (as I previously mentioned) enemies die as quickly as you. Therefore the best weapons are those that allow you to spread death around fastest. Within 30 seconds of a single game, you'll have access to every available weapon--pick the one that works best for you.\n\n*There are several unlockable classes that are fundamentally different takes on the same thing: One can only use a sword, one starts with the best weapon, etc. And each has a different number of allotted respawns. They impact the game, but not in a radical way.\n\nThis time around, there is also a \"Brainclap\" mechanic to compensate for a complete lack of cover.  The way it works, each character class automatically produces a \"Brainclap\" (an explosive attack that can clear most enemies from the screen) after a certain number of kills; some of the weaker classes have lower thresholds for triggering one of these explosions, making them more common.  In general, it helps provide a risk-reward mechanic for some of the weaker classes since the Brainclaps are most common (and effective) in large groups of opponents.\n\nThe game is stripped of all but the barest essentials--there's nary a plot, an economy, or an exposition.  Like UBERMOSH, Vol.3 doesn't have time for those sorts of formalities. And because of that, the game's a great shot of adrenaline whenever you've got more than a couple of minutes to stop and play it.\n\nWho might like this game? Anybody who wants a no-frills top-down shooter that's hard as hell. People who love a soundtrack that makes you want to kill, crush, and destroy. For those who played Devil Daggers and thought, \"You know, I wish this game was remade as a twin-stick shooter.\" For $1.99 this game is a solid deal; for $0.99--the price of a candy bar--you'd still be a fool to skip out on this game. \n\nPROS\n+ Great Soundtrack\n+ Super accessible drop-in/drop-out model \n+ Very challenging\n+ Additional \"Brainclap\" mechanic is a solid addition\n\nNEUTRAL\n~ EXTREMELY similar to UBERMOSH--to the point that you could almost argue Vol.3 should have been a game mode in a previous game.  Still, you can get both games for a combined $1.49 on sale, so it's not a big deal in this case. \n\nCONS\n- No Steam Cards (even the previous Ubermosh had them)\n- Weapons and enemies could still use a little more variety", "timestamp_created": 1480005685, "timestamp_updated": 1480005904, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26945600": {"recommendationid": "26945600", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029262750", "num_games_owned": 416, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499106794}, "language": "english", "review": "High intesity, fast pased, and completely awesome.

There isn't any cover so you do have to play this one different tactically. And I like that.\n\nThe brainclap introduced in UBERMOSH:BLACK makes a comeback along with several more achievements (I like the addition of the survivor-like achievements as well as the score addition), and the game is still as fast-paced and frantic as ever. And still good fun.\n\nA couple of criticisms though. As much as I absolutely love the soundtrack and how fitting it is, I would love some new tracks so there's more cyberpunk moshing to be had. There is some slowdown when there's a lot going on but neither of these detract from the fun this is.\n\nYes, some might argue it's more of the same but the open-world arena and the extra challenge presented by a new enemy (they remind me a little of the swarm in SWARMRIDERS in their movements) definitely set it apart from the other entries in the series.\n\nI'm sure there's more to be added to the game but as for some suggestions: perhaps an infinite respawn mode, still within 90 seconds, where you try and gun down as many enemies as possible but perahps there's deductions for using respawns? And maybe some new guns or even more blade moves.\n\nAll in all, a highly recommended experience and good for short bursts of fast-paced action.

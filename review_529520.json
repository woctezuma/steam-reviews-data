Some teams are not great and for the teams that aren't satirical representations of other teams it just leaves you wishing they made other satire versions of real teams. I'd love the Tennessee Titans, the Minnesota Vickings, and the Phillidelpha Eagles to be included particular I think it would add A TON to the game for those 3 teams particularly to be included. Even if you need more to even the divisions you have the Ravens, the Rams which would be a really solid add also, the Chargers or Chiefs, The Jags or Texans, and more. \n\nThat much bothers me a lot because they could've invested more time into that with reletavely small efforts and made the game much better for many more gamers. The gameplay is fun, the tricks and other plays make it interesting the balance is iffy depending on the teams but overall it's good and fun. One thing you will no doubt notice shortly into playing is how annoying the commentating is and the theme song, while you'll like it at first you'll notice the commentating has VERY FEW lines and thusly gets exessively repeatitive quickly and also often the wrong things are said in regards to the play on the field. The Theme song just plays constantly pretty much, while it isn't bad it sure would be nice to hear a little variety so we aren't annoyed by the same thing over and over and over. With that much said I'll get to the basic blunt Pros and Cons.\n\nPros: \n-Gameplay is Fun\n-Mock NFL Teams are awesome\n-settings offer opportunities to play the game how you want\n\nCons:\n-Not enough satirical teams which stinks because there's lots of good options to add to the game which would add tons for the community to get more enjoyment out of the game.\n-The commentators are extremely repeatitive and get annoying because of their very few things to say\n-very repeatitive music playing over and over, no diversity in this area also gets annoying. Just 2-3 songs total to randomly play at times would make this WORLDS BETTER!\n\nIt is a really fun game, but feels like a solid early access title definitely doesn't feel to me like a full game because there could be so much more to flesh out a lot of hollow areas. Hopefully the devs will put some meat on these bones so this game can be one to always pick up and play instead of getting a few hours played then collecting dust, this could be a great game with a long lasting community but this game desperately needs some fleshing out of the hollow areas. At the moment I'd say I don't regret spending $20 on this but it feels like it's not quite worth the 20 just yet for me. I am hopeful my concerns will be fixed in the future since they are opinions that would add a ton for everyone that plays the game and not just me personally.\n\nIf I was to give this game an out of 10 rating, I'd say it's a 6/10 with legitimate potiential to be a 10/10 I'm going to recommend the game in the end hoping the Devs will step up their game.", "timestamp_created": 1514579580, "timestamp_updated": 1514579580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502560", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38832045": {"recommendationid": "38832045", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080036714", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 779, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 779, "last_played": 1514755970}, "language": "english", "review": "Didnt even know this game came out in October.

TACTICS?!!\n\nI know, one of the things I listed is not like the others. But that is the best way to describe [b]Mutant Football League[/b]. You have your violence and humor taken from Blood Bowl and then you have your real-time gameplay from the NFL. The game functions similarily to those NFL games made by other companies which is rather odd considering Mutant Football League is a game with a wacky setting. This was a surprise to me. A pleasant one after a while but at first I got a little desperate over the gameplay.\n\nI'll start with the ugly. The tutorial in the game is rather heplful but presented in a weird way. This was one of the main reasons why it was quite hard for me to get into the game and actually review it. I started playing the game in the Practice matches which are freely customizable matches with to Achievement progress awarded. I was absolutely confused by what the controls were and did not understand why the Tutorial tips weren't showing up even though I had them on. Well, I try the buttons and finally managed to get a simple hang of the game. Then I tried the official mods which aren't Practice mathces anymore and there I could access the Tutorial tips. This was rather odd that the developers thought people would go and play the normal game modes straight away and never though that some people might start from the Practice mode. Not a big problem for most part but for me it really was going to affect my review if I wouldn't have just went on and played the game.\n\nNow that we have that under the way I can actually talk about the game. As I said earlier the closest thing that comes to my mind is just your basic NFL game combined with interesting elements. There are different kind of [i]Dirty Tricks[/i] that are out of place from your usual NFL game and will usually give you different kind of advantages, like bribing the referee or gaining a shotgun or just simply using a not-so-legal passing method. They might now always work as the referee may not like them. And the Dirty Tricks are the absolute best thing the game has to offer. It really spices up the gameplay.\n\nEven though you have the Dirty Tricks system in place you still need to rely on the actual football tactics. This might not be the most desirable design choice for everyone as this game seems like a arcade game rather than actual football game. The game is well executed though. It is not bad but just a bit confusing considering the setting and the art style.\n\nMutant Football League is a great game and I really do think it is fun to play. You'll just need to get the hand of the controls because all the controls are vital. Definetly a great game for American football fans and definetly worth checking out even as a game.\n\n[quote][i]For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways]Lot's O Giveaway's[/url] group curations [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LotsOGiveaways#curation]here[/url]![/i][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1512948602, "timestamp_updated": 1512948602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.628012", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38221313": {"recommendationid": "38221313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086481602", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 1857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 212, "last_played": 1514019381}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

Waking up to the smell of burnt troll and freshly sawed robots. This game is so much fun! \nThe only things that would make this game better is a way to export stats after every game, more franchise features like the ability to play multiple seasons with retirements and fresh randomly generated rookies. \n\nThe game play itself is an absolute blast. I do wish you could enjoy an online season with a few friends. \nThe commentary is hilarious. I've now played an entire season and while some of the commentary gets a bit redundant I am still hearing new bits of commentary on occasion. \n\nThere are a few bugs yet which I'm sure will get patched but it's certainly not anything that takes away from the pure enjoyment of the game. Overall this game is quite well done and I'm looking forward to any and all expansions or enhancements they may make in the future. \n\nThe last time PC had any substantial arcarde style American rules football game I can think of is back in 2008 Madden. It's been FAR too long. It's been so much fun playing football on my PC once again I'm absolutely excited to see what the future holds for this franchise. \n\nOptimization: 10/10 It runs extremely smooth \nSound/Commentary: 8.5/10 Hilarious, a bit redundant though but execellent sound effects that add to the presentation.\nGameplay: 10/10 Plays crisp, a really enjoyable experience with a controller with very familiar controls.\nOverall Presentation: 8.5/10 Would have liked to see a bit more variation in the different mutant races. \nReplay value: 8.5/10 18 teams to check out all of which have varied strengths/weaknesses. No Franchise mode :(\nFun Factor: 10/10 Super fun solo play that improves exponentially when played with friends. \nGraphics: 8.5/10 Great player models, special effects look amazing, weather effects are a bit more than I prefer. \n\nOverall I give this game a very solid 8.75-9.0/10 rating then add about 100 additional points for it being an American rules football game not made by the EA monopoly. \n\nPriced at a very appropriate pricepoint. Definitely worth the money. \n\nBuy this game and give Electronic Arts the middle finger. :) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511699278, "timestamp_updated": 1511699278, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37620794": {"recommendationid": "37620794", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989238546", "num_games_owned": 109, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512476402}, "language": "english", "review": "The biggest mistake you could make is not play this game.

Check the store page and reviews are good so I figure I might as well give it a shot ... with a game like this 2 hours is more than enough time to decide if you like it or not, especially when it's basic mechanics are paying homage to a game I know fairly well.\n\nSo this morning I load the game up first thing and after one hour of gameplay I have yet to be disappointed.  The art is this game is pretty great, it's nothing fantastic but all the charecters are designed well and they have personality.  The commentary team in the game is great as well.  I found myself laughing out loud a few times at the banter they have with one another.\n\nI highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes MLF or MLH because it takes everything that's great about those games and does it's best to add some updated features from more modern arcade style football games such as Blitz.\n\nI was fully ready to have my childhood smashed but instead it has been a wonderful breath of fresh air as far as remakes and remaster type games go.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511650892, "timestamp_updated": 1511650892, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598540", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37591753": {"recommendationid": "37591753", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071827663", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "last_played": 1513838267}, "language": "english", "review": "I just can't put this game down.

While it's playable and fun-ish in its current state, it definitely has a long ways to go before anyone can honestly say it's \"complete\". Look for yourself:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/529520/announcements/detail/1457339073128238279\n\nDoes that read like the roadmap of a finished game, or an Early Access title with much work left to be done? I'll point specifically at two quotes from this blog:\n\n\"Here is the direction we are heading over the next 6 months providing the game can generate enough revenue to allow us to do this:\"\n\nIf the game can generate enough revenue, we have more ideas we want to put into the game to finish it. That's an Early Access mentality, yet this isn't flagged as Early Access.\n\n\"If the game is successful we will certainly start building the brand into a viable property, and the best way to do that is through story development. \"\n\nIf the game isn't a viable property already, why are they selling it as though it's in a complete state? And if they know the best way to build it into a viable property is to have story development (I don't think this needs a story, just a better singleplayer mode - the season has no custom teams, no trading, no custom characters, no custom dirty tricks, it's just a handful of exhibition games back to back and that's it), why isn't it included in this? Because it isn't complete, yet they haven't marked it as such.\n\nWould love to recommend because there's *potential* here, but it really needs the Early Access tag in order for me to be able to do so. As is, it's very misleading. This game is barebones in its current state. It is *far* from complete, given its current pricepoint, and the admission from their own blogpost that they aren't satisifed with the product where it currently sits.\n\nWhat's also unclear is whether or not the planned content to bring this game to a complete state (as dictated in the linked blog post) will be free for pre-complete adopters of this game, or if they'll be selling it as addons. The fact that they refer to this content as \"Game Enhancements / Expansions\" (enhancements are often free, expansions are not) leaves me with a great deal of uncertainty.\n\nGetting into some specifics of the game:\n\nIt doesn't seem to require much hardware to run at max settings (I put up an overlay while gaming to see how taxing it is), it does stutter sometimes while playing, which doesn't make sense on my current rig (i7-7700k, 16gb DDR4 RAM, GTX 1070gb, all at stock - and the game is installed to a SSD). It has some graphic toggles, but for some reason the \"Quality\" setting houses multiple options within it. It's important to note that this \"Quality\" option is not a global preset (it doesn't affect the other options such as shadow quality, for example), but an independent toggle that houses a few options in itself that can't be independently adjusted. I want to be able to turn off Depth of Field, but it's locked to \"Quality\" presets. I want to turn off AA (it appears that they're using an incredibly cheap method of FXAA which makes the entire image blurry), but it's locked to \"Quality\" presets. Oddly, when \"Texture Quality\" (again independent of \"Quality\" as it isn't a global preset) are set to High but this \"Quality\" preset is set to Low, the textures appear as Low anyway - so I can't set \"Quality\" to Low to get some of these extra effects disabled while still enjoying High textures.\n\nThe announcers are funny at first, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's a comedy act with ~5 minutes of material that's given a 60 minute block to fill. There's no option to toggle the frequency of when they pipe in, and they always talk. I ended up turning the announcer volume off, and the game became far more enjoyable.\n\nThe game itself is essentially just an Exhibition mode. While it does have a Season, there are no custom teams, no trades, no customization of dirty tricks (limited powerups each team gets a preset selection of), and it only takes three hours to complete. It is extremely barebones. Everything about this game currently plays like a concept, save for Exhibition mode which gets stale rather quickly, and given their own admission in the earlier linked blogpost that they would like to flesh the game out if sales provide them the revenue to do so, it is very clear that this is an unmarked Early Access title.", "timestamp_created": 1510958594, "timestamp_updated": 1510985359, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36581785": {"recommendationid": "36581785", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044571257", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1514002217}, "language": "english", "review": "I played the original on the Sega Genesis.

Huge thanks to the hard working devs in Ukraine who brough this together. Also to the master and commander Michael Mendheim, who clearly worked hard to make this happen. \n\nIt's a fun brutal game. Will make you laugh and cry at times, as you score an amazing defensive touchdown, only to be called out by an official 'bullshit penalty' by the ref. thats all part of the fun. \n\nThe beta versions were far too weighted in the dirty tactics, you would win or lose based on which ones your team had and playing them was most often a clear touchdown. They seem to wear off quicker now, so its no gimmie touchdown, or even turnover if you use them. I prefer that, they could be brought back a little bit more perhaps. \n\nThoughts and Ideas:\n- add more dirty tricks, some that have smaller advantage, and perhaps can be picked as additional to the current ones.\n- perhaps all dirty tricks can be hand chosen, but maybe you can only choose them as part of a group, like you can only get one of ginormous or roid rage, not both together, etc.. this would still mean you cant overpower.\n- dirty tricks that have only a small advantage, but fun to play, like turning the oppositions QB into a teapot (example) for a drive, mostly cosmetic but when hit will shatter into pot pieces. \n- The Kick after attempt is very much a formality.. like to see this given some challenge. Perhaps its more like a rugby union kick after attmept, where the kick is taken from 10 years still, but its angle is based on where the touchdown was scored - ie, if on the far right side of the pitch it was socred, the kick is taken from the far right also.. \n- The kiack after attempt has a wind factor? the goals rotate or a mutant head is hanging between the goals and hitting the head with the ball gives you an extra point? (rare to do but achievable) this would add more fun to it and add to the insaneness of the MFL. \n- More team management, I know its a huge ask, but something similar to FIFA18 manger control. Would add a huge dimension to the game indeed. having to control budget, players, scouting, adding weird bonuses to your teams field.. endless fun to be had there. \n- Coach avatar and model? You have to choose a coach model and a coach name. Some coaches can be used in dirty tricks that let them QB a play - and of course they are double star players for that play. You see them frustrated after a QB or killing an assistant if scored against.. funny stuff to be added there. \n- Dirty play that changes the ball, so its really slippery, or has the weight of a large rock. \n- Home team advantages, after every QTR the away team gets a player injured, as a result of the home fans throwing rocks at them. Perhaps there is a mutant beast on the sideline that wil only attack opposition teams that get too close. \nAt the moment I dont think there is any extra advnatage to playing at home, and there should be. Hazards that only affect the away team would be great, and being able to add them based on what you like at the start of a season. \n\nThere is just so much stuif you could add to this game its crazy.\n\nHighly reccommend. \n", "timestamp_created": 1510678183, "timestamp_updated": 1510678183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36507869": {"recommendationid": "36507869", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986160636", "num_games_owned": 221, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 588, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 27, "last_played": 1514542480}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, although it needs new teams, and much much more customization.

It's a great and unique game and an excellent refinement to what was a great concept to further skill over raw violence while never forgetting that a little good old fashioned quarterback slaughter is a perfectly viable way to victory. You will learn to despise the Nuked London Hatriots and Ghoulian Metalman as much as any team in any sports game ever. \n\nLonger answer: It's more Blitz than Madden, a faster, more violent game than Blood Bowl and I can finally stop having a Genesis emulator for the old Mutant League games. MFL is more complex than you may think at first glance, requiring you to rotate your players to keep them alive, avoid deadly saw blades on the field, and learn just the right time to bribe the ever helpful Ed Hockaloogie thanks to a vastly improved system dictating when the refs will act on bribes making things just a little less predictable. Adding the ability to resurrect fallen players adds another layer of strategy to season or playoff modes. Personally I was a bigger fan of Mutant League Hockey than football, but this is an excellent improvement and refinement to the concept that became a cult classic in the 90s. I may think that imitating the names of real players so closely isn't that helpful when it results in Sickardo Blewis or Arson Emblamer, but its all part of the fun and there is a lot of fun to be had here. There seems to be a committment by the devs to continue improving the game, adding new races and possibly a franchise/story mode and I'm excited to see how the game progresses from here.

The game has a lot of entertainment value, with jabs at the NFL, its players, scandals, etc., and the over-the-top brutality of MLF and Blitz. Beyond that, it's actually a solid football game, something Steam was lacking, and there are enough options to edit to play the game in a relatively \"normal\" fashion, if you'd prefer a more basic football game, but doing so does neuter this game. Part of what makes this game fun is the gameplay of football, but also trying your best to absolutely slaughter and kill your opponents. You can, afterall, win the game if your opponent has to forfeit due to  a lack of teammates for certain positions.\n\nThe humor is there, the violence is present, and the devs have signaled they'll be releasing a lot of additional content in the future. This is a warm welcome as it addresses my one gripe with the game: there's not a whole lot in it at the moment. You have your basic exhibition (play now), season mode and playoff mode. The incentive to play these lies with the football teams themselves - you have to accomplish certain goals in the different modes in order to unlock all the teams. There are 18 in total, but only 9 start unlocked, and obviously not all NFL teams are lampooned. So this means, you need to have a strong interest in unlocking all 9 teams, as there is currently (but has been confirmed they are planning on including) no team edit, no team creation, no franchise, no story, etc.,. For someone like myself, whose hometown team is NOT in this game, I had to pick the most relatable team to play the season mode with, and the other teams I unlocked, I had no interest in. \n\nBecause of this, at 11 hours of gameplay, I've played exhibition mode, beat season mode and playoff mode and have no interest in playing another 20-something games to unlock the last team needed. So the planned additions the developer has - including creation and story modes, also new kills and new races - will most assuredly keep me playing this game more when they come out. As it stands, even right now I definitely feel I got my money's worth out of it, so if you're looking for an outrageous, extreme take on football, check this out.  \n\n(To note: there IS an online multiplayer, but I haven't bothered with it, so I can't tell you how well the servers are)", "timestamp_created": 1509939585, "timestamp_updated": 1509939763, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36312895": {"recommendationid": "36312895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007940220", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511225603}, "language": "english", "review": "I have waited for an extremely long time for a rendition of the old Genesis game, mutant football league, to come out in another fashion.

It's a 7-on-7 American style football game featuring teams of monsters battling it out for gory gridion supremacy in an \"after the bomb\" world.\n\n\"Gory? Football is violent, but not THAT violent\", you say? Ah, but it turns out trolls, skeletons, and robots are more cavalier about possible concussions or, uh, dismemberment, than real-life footballers. Indeed, in the Mutant Football League scooping up a diva wide receiver and breaking him in half with a move normally seen in professional wrestling isn't unsportsmanlike, it's the norm!\n\nEven if you're not the type to willfully command your players to murder their opponents, players still must contend with the environmental hazards of the various fields: land mines, buzzsaws, pits of molten lava, sandworms, and more. If fatalities run high, you might have to play without a running back, or with half an offensive line. Lose enough players, and you might even have to forfeit the game.\n\nMFL offers a fairly standard assortment of game modes: play now; a 13 game season with an eight team playoff; a playoff mode; practice; and online play. Online mode has random matchmaking, or the option to create a password protected room.\n\nThere are 18 teams playing for a chance to win the Mayhem Bowl, three: the Galaxy Chaos, Orcs of Hazzard, and Tokyo Terminators, are wholly original, and made up entirely of speedy aliens, bruising orcs and trolls, and versatile robots, respectively. The other fifteen are parodies of real NFL teams, including many of their players, such as the Nuked London Hatriots and their unsettlingly handsome skeleton quarterback, Bomb Shady; or the New Yuck Tyrants and their ridiculously coiffed--and ridiculously fast--demon receiver, O'Hell Wreckem Jr. These teams strengths and weaknesses correspond quite well to the current (2017) NFL season.\n\nTeams have decent sized playbooks to choose from that are reminiscient of their real counterparts, with roughly half a dozen or so formations with a handful of plays each. You also have access to Dirty Tricks -- two per half for offense and defense. Plays like Strawberry Fields, where you lace whatever undead drink with hallucinogenic drugs, which reverses your inputs if used on a human, or makes the computer act erratically; or giving your running back a chainsaw for one play, with which he can literally cut a swathe through an enemy offensive line. Each team has a different handful of tricks they can use, and every team can bribe the referee, giving him a chance to make blatantly bad calls in your favor until he is either bribed in return by the opponent, or murdered (which is one of the few ways to definitely incur a penalty in this game. Say what you will about zebras, but they protect their own!) Finally, during half-time a Smash TV style minigame (think top-down twin-stick shooter) will play where you, armed with a gun, try to survive for 30 seconds against a hoard of zombie referees. Scoring 500 points and keeping your brains firmly inside your skull will grant you a Resurrection Dirty Trick you can use in the second half to bring back one dead player. \n\nDuring the action all the basic functions are here: switching control of a defending player mid-play, dives, spins, jukes, leaps. You can call time-outs and audibles, and make substitutions to get specialized players on the field for certain tasks, or just to let a character heal a bit between plays (players have lifebars that greatly recharge between plays.)\n\nGameplay options include typical fare like changing the quarter time from one through fifteen minutes, and gameplay speed to either slower, normal, fast, or fastest. If you really just want to play Madden you can turn Dirty Tricks off, you can also turn incrase or decrease the damage players take, and even play with deaths turned off altogether. Difficulty has five settings, and begins to play competently on normal. \n\nAs for the audio/visual, I always find it best to let people make up their own mind by looking at some gameplay footage, since everyone's got different expectations of what constitutes good graphics or art design. This is a game by a small indie team, so expectations need to be kept realistic. Regardless, I think the graphics, and particularly the art style, are quite good, staying true to the designs of the old genesis game, and brought cartoonishly to life in 3D.\n\nOn sound, each team has their own theme song, which is a nice touch, and the in-game music is generally pretty appropriate for football; all horns, guitars, and bombast -- very NFL films. I really like the commentary, a two person (but three head) group headed up by the nostalgia bomb that is Tim Kitzrow of  NFL Blitz and NBA Jam fame, providing delightfully antagonistic play-by-play, and remarkably crass banter. This stuff is definitely unsafe for the ears of minors, or the politically correct. An option does exist to turn off the mature language, if you like your cartoonish blood and gore without potty humor. For what it's worth, I think they've provided some USDA Choice potty humor.\n\nSo, finally, how do I feel about it, and where do I think the game could be better. There's a surprising amount of strategy that goes into playing around your opponent's potentially game-changing Dirty Tricks, and the parody teams do a great job of invoking their real-life counterparts, all the while being imbued with a newly quirkly charm. As someone who enjoys AAA sports games for management, but finds them too slow for playing actual matches, I think this game has it just right, playing a slightly simplified game tuned for speed and ease of use, not unlike how major sports titles used to play back in the 16-bit era.\n\nThere are definitely some annoyances, some of which I'm sure will be addressed in upcoming patches. Buzzsaws are way too brutal an environmental hazard in their current state, and playing in any stadium featuring them over the course of a whole season presents a brutal home court disadvantage, because they routintely kill multiple players every kick-off, and heaven help you if you find the line of scrimmage overlapping their tracks. Also, playing on higher difficulties reduces the amount of Resurrections you get between games, but since player deaths are often outside of your control this doesn't feel like something you can overcome with any level of skill. I LIKE that this happens; I enjoy a bit of random misfortune in my games, but it shouldn't completely tank my season all by itself. Lastly, half of the teams need to be unlocked by fulfilling certain requirements first. None of the requirements are particularly difficult, but some are definitely time consuming, and I could see this being frustrating for fans of those teams.\n\nI have confidence that the developers want to make this a spectacular game; Michael Mendheim's been trying to get this game made for years, so it's clearly a passion project, and I think this game has the potential to be a truly great football game if they're able to continue adding to it. A story mode of sorts would be great, considering the colorful cast of characters and post-apocalyptic setting, and obviously the remaining 15 NFL teams seem like an almost mandatory future addition. But even in its current state it's just a blast to play, and considering the dearth of football titles on the PC, any fan of the sport should at least give it a look.

Ahora en PC, los juegos relacionados a este deporte son pocos, y los que existen, tienen un corte distinto (turn-based), a excepcion quiz\u00e1s uno de VR. En mi caso no tengo dispitivo para realidad virtual, as\u00ed que mis ganas de un t\u00edtulo de futbol americano estaban sin esperanzas; hasta que lleg\u00f3 Mutant Footbal League.\n\nMutant Football League no es para nada un t\u00edtulo que intente aspirar a ser un simulador de NFL, no tiene visuales de punta, Mutant Football League deja lo est\u00e9tico o realista de lado, y lleva el deporte a un nivel de diversi\u00f3n simplemente alucinante, donde cada jugada es una carcajada asegurada, con una narraci\u00f3n impresionante en el sentido humoristico -y de gran calidad tambi\u00e9n.\n\nEste es un juego meramente arcade, con algunas mec\u00e1nicas fuera de lo normal que van contra toda regla del deporte real. Parte de la jugabilidad permite al jugador hacer locuras sencillamente chistosas, entre estas: sobornar al refer\u00ed, golpear gravemente a los enemigos, usar habilidades especiales, y hasta matar a los contrarios (con consecuencias irrisorias).\n\nCada jugador en cualquier equipo tendr\u00e1 una barra de vitalidad que ir\u00e1 bajando en relaci\u00f3n a la cantidad y tipo de golpes que reciba de los contrarios, si llega a cero, morir\u00e1n. Lo bueno es que al morir, cuando termina un partido, podemos revivirlos y tenerlos de vuelta con nosotros.\n\nLos men\u00fas de juego en lo que respecta a escogencia de jugadas son muy amigables (iguales a Madden), todo es muy instintivo, y los tutoriales in-game sirven de gran manera para aprender un poco m\u00e1s si no hemos jugado a un t\u00edtulo de este tipo.\n\nTodav\u00eda no hemos hablado de lo mejor de\u00a0Mutant Football League: El equipo de narradores; Los di\u00e1logos empleados en todo el juego son lo mejor que he escuchado desde Borderlands, aun con lo limitado que podr\u00eda ser uno de los juegos con narraciones m\u00e1s chistosos que hemos probado.\n\nEl relajo es tal, que entre ellos mismos se hacen bromas, se amenazan y se dan bullying a diestra y siniestra cada vez que pueden; por ejemplo, en una anotaci\u00f3n que recibimos, uno de los comentaristas -con la voz m\u00e1s chillona y horrible del mundo, le roba el grito de anotaci\u00f3n al narrador del juego, en un chillido-chirrido (porque 'grito' no era, ja, ja) de al menos diez segundos: ''Scoooooooooooooooooooore'', a lo que muy indignado su compa\u00f1ero narrador le responde: ''Si vuelves a hacer eso, te voy a matar''. Es simplemente demasiado divertido, y el acento que usan siempre es en tono de broma y burla, buen\u00edsimo.\n\nLos modos en\u00a0Mutant Football League son solamente tres, partidos, temporadas y pr\u00e1ctica. La modalidad de campa\u00f1a no difiere mucho de cualquier otra, escogemos un equipo (hay unos malos, otros buenos), entre los cuales algunos se desbloquean conforme logramos ciertos resultados que har\u00e1n que est\u00e9n disponibles para jugar con ellos.\n\nGr\u00e1ficamente el juego es bastante regular, con modelados de personajes de calidad simple, y que destacan m\u00e1s cuando hay un primer plano tras alguna jugada importante (un touchdown, sacks al QB, incursiones de los refer\u00eds, etc).\n\nDigital Dreams Entertainment LLC ha hecho un trabajo fantastico en este arcade deportivo, con un magnifico e impresionante apartado en su sonido, meramente en las narraciones.\n\nPara mas an\u00e1lisis de indies, visita www.crgamershub.club", "timestamp_created": 1509766346, "timestamp_updated": 1509766346, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521907", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36258345": {"recommendationid": "36258345", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969721192", "num_games_owned": 262, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511474436}, "language": "english", "review": "There's no denying that this is the start of something awesome.

Between the spotty track record of Kickstarter games even getting made, and my doubt that a remake could ever hold a candle to the original, I let it drift off my radar. To my shock, I randomly discovered yesterday that not only did the game officially get released, but that it surprisingly captures all the fun of the original. Even more surprising, as someone that very frequently plays all the modern Madden games, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the football feels. Obviously, it's not at the high-level of quality of the triple-A Madden games, but WOW was I blown away by how satisifying it still is, all while capturing the dirty plays and over-the-top violence that defined the original. In short, buy this damn game. I want to see more iterations of this, with even more polish and updated rosters. This is a fantastic budget title, that totally captures the magic of the original.

After playing around 10 or so games, I like the game quite a bit, but it has a few issues now that I am hoping the development team fixes. \n\nWhat I like:\n[list]\n[*]The voice acting doesn't feel stale, sure you'll hear the same joke 6 or 7 times, but it fits well. It doesn't feel like it is being forced to be edgy.\n\n[*]The teams feel different. I've played most of my games with the Microhard Mutilators and you can see where the running back is a second or third option. On the other hand, playing with the Midway Mutants, your quarterback is slow and bad, so you want to not rely on the QB that much.\n\n[*]The halftime show is a nice bit of novelty that spices up the single player and can really make a difference if your good player gets killed in the 2nd half. (I do kind of miss throwing exploding footballs at the aliens though.)\n\n[*]Balance between the teams is there, but I wish there were an equal number of star players per team.\n\n[*]There is a reward for playing defensively, running out of bounds instead of getting your player killed can be a good strategic move. Throwing the ball away to negate a defensive dirty trick can help turn the game.\n\n[/list]\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n[list]\n[*]The fields felt totally unbalanced. The field hazards in Mutant League Football were nowhere near what they are in Mutant Football League. If you end up with the line of scrimmage being on top of one of the saws, you can count on 1 or 2 of your linemen to just die. Also, the AI is not smart at all when it comes to the non-stationary hazards. They will just run into the path of a saw blade or spikes or just stand still and get eaten by a space worm. It can be very frustrating in season mode when you'll have 1 play that kills pretty much your entire defense.\n\n[*]The time after plays feels a bit long. It's not hard sometimes to kill the opposing team's running back because he's just lying there letting you jump on him. It worked in NFL Blitz because there wasn't the punitive danger to your players.\n\n[*]When you leave resurrections off in season mode, it feels a bit unfair that the team you're playing against is always at full strength, but you have 5 or 6 guys that are dead from the start of the game.\n\n[*]There seems to be some kind of input lag when throwing passes. You almost have to throw the ball a tick before you actually want to. This can be hard when playing with a team with a non-mobile quarterback.\n\n[*]I wish there was a happy medium between no resurrection and immediate resurrection. Maybe have the players resurrect at the half.\n[/list]\n\nOverall, it's a fun arcade football game. As long as you don't take it at all seriously and understand that some of your star players will be dead by the end of the game, you'll have a good time playing it.

Gory, explosive gridiron football with punny fantasy characters and teams, cheesy but hilarious smack talk and commentary by the infamous Tim Kitzrow from the NFL Blitz series. It's a gloriuous mashup of old and new. If I had to compare, it's NFL Blitz meets fantasy characters with over-the-top gore.\n\nDev Support\nDevs are awesome! Continued communication and consistent updates to improve and add new features. Can't stress enough how important and awesome this is for games these days.\n\nGameplay \nWhat sets this game apart from other football games are the unique Dirty Tricks that you can call on both offense and defense that put a great spin on the standard game of pigskin. Not only that, the massive carnage you can deal out to your opponent's team can result in them having to rethink their strategy without any running backs or you could get a win by forfeit if they lose too many key players. This also adds an additional layer of strategy to the game that can result in a victory that would otherwise be a loss. I messed around in one game and was down by a few scores towards the end but narrowly won due to all the opponent's QBs dying. There's also a way to resurrect teammates before it's too late if you set those game options initially too, so it's not very easy to win by forfeit either.\n\nOther nice features include lots of teams to choose from and more planned in the future. Season and playoff modes to setup tournaments with your friends or play on your own. Well designed stadiums with their own unique hazards like mines, ice holes, and giant worms to add to the carnage. Half-time \"show\" which is a mini-game that awards the winner a free Resurrection.\n\nControls\nStandard game controls for running around, stiff arming, passing, etc. Controller and (customizable) keyboard support but I HIGHLY recommend a controller.\n\nGraphics\nGraphics are almost on par with most other sports games but animations and character design could use some more variety and improvement. I'm a sucker for variation as it can get old seeing the same animations, etc. Some of the wrestling-style tackles are incredibly satisfying to watch. \n\nSound\nAs mentioned before, the commentary by Tim always has me LOLing at the game even after hearing it many times. Great carnage from hits and explosions too. Good variety of songs for each team.\n\nSingleplayer/Co-Op\nThe AI is pretty stout when playing against a similarly rated team, but the lower rated teams are no slouch either. They're pretty \"smart\" (see also cheat) :) about calling good plays and dirty tricks and good at time management. I haven't really played much Co-Op yet, but the option is there now for 1v1, 2v2, 4v4 so that's great if you have a group of friends to crowd around a screen and play. Great season and playoff modes as well as a practice mode. Needs a franchise mode for continued fun.\n\nMultiplayer\nThe online mode works pretty well right now. I get some desyncing on occasion and lag, but it's P2P so your connection is also dependent on the slowest person in the game. Hopefully with enough popularity they can afford some dedicated servers. There's talks to implement 4v4 online (2 players per team) so I think that'd be an interesting option if they can get the network side improved. I'd love to see abilities for online tournaments too.\n\nOverall\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game to any fan of the previous Sega Genesis game and any football fan that is looking for an explosive, carnage-filled game of football. The price is right and the game is loads of fun, so get the game, tell a friend and I'll see you on the field. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1506586636, "timestamp_updated": 1510857681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.592728", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35252971": {"recommendationid": "35252971", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315052705", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512524385}, "language": "english", "review": "I 100% recommend it (especially if you are a fan of the sega game Mutant League Football). \n\n\n On a side note, You definitley DO NOT need a 1070 to run this on ultra.", "timestamp_created": 1506564398, "timestamp_updated": 1506564398, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500101", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35252858": {"recommendationid": "35252858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971434473", "num_games_owned": 1277, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 67, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504259826}, "language": "english", "review": "As a backer for this games Kickstarter, I have been playing Mutant Football League since the pre-release.

If you're a fan of MLF or even NFL Blitz, you will love this game.\n\nDesigned by Michael Mendheim, creator of the original game, MFL boasts countless throwbacks to the Genesis classic while also bringing many new features to the table.  Yes, you can still kill players to knock them out of the game--permanently.  And yes, you can still bribe (and murder, if necessary) referees.  But there's more.  One of the most significant additions is a vile, vulgar, utterly hilarious commentary team voiced by none other than Tim Kitzrow, whose iconic work in such arcade games as NBA Jam and the aforementioned NFL Blitz speaks for itself.\n\nIf you've never played the Sega Genesis game and aren't sure what to expect, here's a quick rundown:\nMutant Football League is a violent, fast-paced, 7-on-7 American football game in which over a dozen teams comprised of skeletons, robots, superhumans, orcs, and aliens quite literally fight it out for victory.  Fields are littered with deadly hazards like mines and buzzsaws and teams can even call \"Dirty Trick\" plays like \"Shotgun,\" which makes the quarterback whip out a literal shotgun.  There's also plenty of post-play fighting, so don't be surprised if a linebacker elbow-drops your star quarterback right to the morgue well after the whistle is blown!\n\nOffline you can play against the AI in one of several different modes, ranging from a one-time exhibition game to a full-fledged 13-game season (playoffs included, if you qualify for them).  There's also local multiplayer/couch co-op, meaning you and up to three other people can play with or against one another.  Online play is currently limited to 1v1, but the developers hope to expand on it in the near future.\n\nThe game looks and feels surprisingly polished and is incredibly fun to play.  The controls are responsive and intuitive and the AI can put up one heck of a fight.  There's also a nice variety of teams and fields/stadiums.  Additionally, there are plenty of options that allow you to drastically alter the experience.  Don't like losing players permanently?  Turn on resurrection, and they'll be restored the very next down.  Don't like trick plays?  Turn them off, and you'll never be crushed by a gigantic defender ever again!  More content is also on the way, with demons and werewolves coming post-launch free of charge.  Mod tools are also planned, which is incredibly exciting for obvious reasons.\n\nBottom line:  As I said at the very beginning, if you're a fan of the original Mutant League Football or even NFL Blitz, you will love this game.  It is fast, and it is violent.  It will make you laugh, and probably even cry (losing a star player early in the game is never an easy pill to swallow).  But most of all, it will make you realize that it doesn't take a massive team with a ginormous budget to produce an outstanding football game that delivers hours upon hours of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1506539763, "timestamp_updated": 1509921189, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494466", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35244567": {"recommendationid": "35244567", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037224895", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506569328}, "language": "english", "review": "A blast to play :D Even for someone who hasn't played the old original this is a very fun game!", "timestamp_created": 1506528521, "timestamp_updated": 1506528521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35242530": {"recommendationid": "35242530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198169238482", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511232417}, "language": "english", "review": "As a lifelong fans of the NFL, it's always a laugh when I still (to this day) declare Mutant League Football on the Sega Genesis as my favorite football game of all time.

If you played football games, you may like this for variety and a new twist to what you know about football. If you want good sportsmanship or conduct, you're probably looking in the wrong corner here.\n\n\nI found this game to be quite fun. Definitely a more entertaining twist on football than some other football games, but then again, sports games aren't my forte and the last football games I played was on the playstation 2 and Nintendo 64, I will admit that. I still found it most entertaining and look forward to having fun with people on this game.\n\nThe dirty tricks are varied and interesting, and they help you get a win even if you are trailing by 16 points the the fourth quarter by slaughtering their quarterbacks. Scoring points is also made easier by bribing the ref, warp speed, or any other dirty trick, as well blocking any scoring runs or passes with dirty trick defensive plays to prevent yourself from having a Kentucky Wildcats vs Florida Gators situation. Aside from dirty tricks, you have attack plays that allow you to assault other players to help even the odds in your favor. You could also play an 'honest' game with no dirty tricks or assaults but where's the fun in that?\n\nThe AI has several difficulty settings to it, from easy to masochism. I tried it on the first three of five difficulties as of this review and found it to be pretty solid for the most part, although I will admit to nearly losing to average ai had it not been for dirty tricks since, again, sports games aren't my forte. Any bugs I ran into are taken care of in quick fashion and because of that, don't linger around.\n\nThere's multiplayer in the game so if you want to wreck some player's lives or get wrecked by players, there's that for hours of entertainment, just don't think let your ego get the best of you since dirty tricks, when played right, can make good and bad players equal like colt fireams in the old west. There's also co-op in case you want your friends or total strangers join in on giving out slaughterfests to ai or players.\n\nOverall, I am having a most enjoyable time from this game. I would whole heartedly reccomend this to those who are looking for a twist on football, those who want a game that would be entertaining with others who are sober or drunk, those who want a sports game with lots of dark humor, or to use this game as a revenge fantasy against football teams that failed you or caused your favorite team to fail.", "timestamp_created": 1506518671, "timestamp_updated": 1506575816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35241330": {"recommendationid": "35241330", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961484805", "num_games_owned": 250, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505265597}, "language": "english", "review": "Pretty much everything you would want from a spiritual successor.

A record-breaking crowd was on hand to watch the Football League championship game. None could have known that this was soon to become the darkest day in history. \n\nButch Justice blazed across the field  for the winning touchdown, but before the glory could be felt by the multitudes, the earth began to rumble, growing more violent with each passing moment, until a 10.3 earthquake ripped the stadium from its foundations.\n\nNoxious gases, thick with the stench of radioactive refuse, seeped into the air. Gallons of toxic liquid belched forth from the earth. Those unfortunate enough to come in contact with the poisonous fumes felt their skin boil... change... mutate.\n\nThe fortunate souls in the stadium who survived were no longer human beings. They were now mutants, forever transformed into hideous creatures with strength, speed, stamina, and agility far superior to any human.\n\nRising from the ashes of this devastating tragedy was the most exciting and dangerous sporting competition that the world has ever seen, known to all as... the MUTANT LEAGUE!\n\n-Mutant League: The Movie \n\nFor the uninitiated, Mutant Football League is the spiritual successor to Mutant League Football, a post-apocalyptic Madden spinoff released in the year 1993 on Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. It was known for its remarkable violence. Players weren't just injured in MLF. They were obliterated, using nasty audibles (called Dirty Tricks in MFL), on-field hazards such as landmines, or plain old late hits. Even the refs can be killed (or, better yet, bribed and then killed by the other team). The popularity of Mutant League Football led to the release of Mutant League Hockey and even an animated series called Mutant League, yet never led to an official sequel from EA.\n\nMutant Football League, developed by a team led by Michael Mendheim, who created Mutant League Football, is essentially the same concept as the original: It's football with no holds barred in an \"xtreme\" nineties camp post-apocalyptic world, with teams of skeletons, robots, trolls, and aliens. Like its predecessor, it plays a lot like a more arcadey Madden, if Madden let you kill the opposing players after the play, turn one of your players into a giant, use deadly on-field hazards to your advantage, or fire a literal shotgun. It's absolutely nuts.\n\nA new feature in Mutant Football League is in-game commentary. It's standard in sports games now, but wasn't yet possible in 1993. If you've played NFL Blitz or NBA Jam, you'll recognize the voice of the main commentator, Tim Kitzrow, who is joined by a mutant with two heads to add color. They're funny, and not always in a family friendly way. You can turn mature language off, but I don't think there's much point. This is not a particularly family friendly game in the first place, and the often crude commentary adds to the somewhat cheesy atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe game has eighteen teams, most of which are direct, non-trademark-infringing parodies of real NFL teams, which naturally consist of parody versions of real NFL players, such as \"Airbourne Dodgers\" of the \"Grim Bay Attackers.\" Any of these teams can be played in a solo exhibition, season mode, playoffs, and online and offline head to head or co-op.\nSumming up, Mutant League is extremely violent, fast, explosive, not particularly realistic, but a whole lot of fun for someone who has at least a passing interest in football and/or virtual dismemberment.", "timestamp_created": 1506507661, "timestamp_updated": 1506507661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554419", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35237579": {"recommendationid": "35237579", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970523646", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 4103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "last_played": 1513769432}, "language": "english", "review": "I am a fan of the old Mutant League game's, i recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Mutant league football/hockey or are into sports game's, NFL etc.\n\nReal good fun and a hilarious game!", "timestamp_created": 1506499199, "timestamp_updated": 1509532438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527153", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35237088": {"recommendationid": "35237088", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307832415", "num_games_owned": 1759, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510139512}, "language": "english", "review": "Its sooooooooo good.", "timestamp_created": 1506496388, "timestamp_updated": 1506496388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.426209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35236885": {"recommendationid": "35236885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038518337", "num_games_owned": 926, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 86, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511018603}, "language": "french", "review": "Apres des heures de jeu pass\u00e9 sur l'alpha et la beta du kickstarter, ce jeu est le meilleur jeu de Foot US sur PC, un Madden avec une skin d'halloween.", "timestamp_created": 1506495172, "timestamp_updated": 1506495172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526115", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35236603": {"recommendationid": "35236603", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970334248", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495925178}, "language": "english", "review": "The game nails the arcade action and feel of the original Mutant League Football from the Sega Genesis while modernizing the formula for modern gamers.

I'll be the first to admit that I have a lot of nostalgia for the original Mutant League Football.   However, it just hasn't aged well.

If you have a soft spot in your heart for the original, for NFL Blitz, or just want an actual football game on PC you should buy this game.    It's pure arcadey fun, particularly if you're playing with friends.   It features co-op as well as competitive multiplayer, online or local.    There's a wide variety of \"dirty tricks\" that depend on the team you're playing as, and the cast of knock-off mutant themed NFL Teams (Bomb Shady, O'Hell Wreck'em Jr.) are fantastic.    You can tweak the settings to have it be a death-filled pit of chaos, or something that actually decently resembles a vanilla NFL game.\n\nThe game as it stands is worth the price of admission.   However, the development team appears intent to keep on giving.   The planned dynasty mode with RPG leveling for your players sounds great, and more species of mutant and parody NFL teams are still to come free of charge.

Orcs, skeletons, and aliens would duke it out on the gridiron in 7v7 American Football, with even more violence and mayhem.  Blood and guts rendered in glorious 16-bit sprites.  Screen size was limited, and the Genesis didn't have an efficient sprite zooming mechanism like the SNES's SFX chip, so the top third or so of the screen would be three separate views of your receivers as they run their routes.  The game was fun as hell, with dirty plays, slaughtering your opponents wholesale, and classic football strategy, but was clearly ahead of its time, as the genesis's three-button gamepads and standard TV resolution were very limiting.\n\nNow some 20 years later, the Mutant League returns, in 3D-rendered bone-crushing glory.\n\nLet's be real for a second though.  This game is like 70-80% Madden-style football.  And that's not a bad thing at all, really.  The controls may not be quite as refined, but Madden has had 20+ years to refine their scheme (although EA still charges full price for little more than roster updates or P2W online systems every year nowadays).  But if you're used to playing Defensive Back in Madden, you're still contesting passes with Y or Triangle.  You may not have the refinement of \"ball's in the air, L1 to turn square to the ball, gauge whether to just swat it away with R1, or go for the pick with Triangle, crap I can't get there in time gotta try to time the hit to jar the ball loose instead, oh crap got there too early and now it's DPI,\" but if you have a starred player in your secondary, you can have a good chance of picking off the ball outright when you think you should.\n\nIf you're and old school gamer who rememebers the awesomness of the original Genesis cartridge, you will probably love this game.\n\nIf you're just looking for an American football game, get this game.  As long as EA has their exclusitvity clause with the NFL, there will never be another licensed NFL game outside of Madden.  I hesitate to say \"this is the next best thing\" because I believe that MFL is way more fun than Madden, and probably the best American football game on Steam right now.", "timestamp_created": 1515486669, "timestamp_updated": 1515486855, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541985", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39166595": {"recommendationid": "39166595", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086765012", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 372, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 372, "last_played": 1515522673}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0410, \u043d\u043e \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u044c\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a.

If they are not managers, they are cheap knock offs. Over the years I have found a few good sport games. Like Tennis Elbow 2013, Super Mega Baseball and Casey Powell Lacrosse. Just want to throw it out there that I don\u2019t count racing games because there is a ton of them compared to other sports.\nOne game I\u2019ve been dying for is a football game. Sadly\u2026no Madden and no game that comes close to it. Axis Football looks interesting but the reviews are balls\u2026.lol get it\u2026balls. \n\nSo when Mutant Football League dropped on the store page, I was so excited. Mutant Football League first appeared on Sega. It was published and developed by EA. The original creator Micheal Manheim is also the head of development for the new one. However it doesn\u2019t have EA\u2019s name\u2026.this time it\u2019s Digital Dreams. They only have 1 other game on steam. \n\nThe new Mutant Football League failed its first Kickstarter. After a second Kickstarter Micheal Manheim finally got the funds he needed to make the game. However, he did explain that there was going to be cut content due to lack of funding. Judging by its console ports, I imagine he his spending most of the money on getting attention. More attention, more sales, more money.  \n\nSadly from what I can tell, Mutant Football League doesn\u2019t have that big of a fan base. Steamcharts say that there has been an all-time number of 87 players at once. Reviews indicate that maybe 200 hundred people actually have the product. This means that unless a huge wave of players come through, we may never see the content Micheal Manheim alluded to in the original kickstarter.\n\nMy love for football and my undying want for a football game make Mutant Football League a strong contender for an obsession. One of the coolest aspects of this game is the teams. A lot of them are parodies of NFL teams. Nuked London Hatriots, Scarolina Panzers, Bltizberg Steelheads, Cardinal Sins, Croakland Invaders\u2026.it goes on. Players are also parodied. You got Bomb Shady (Tom Brady) Wham Neutron (Cam Newton) you get the idea.\n\nEach team has their weaknesses and strengths like a normal sports game. Each team also has their own dirty tricks\u2026.stuff you can do mid game that is\u2026well\u2026dirty. Some of them are unbalanced, some of them are useless and some screw every one over. You can bribe refs or kill the ref. Each one of this tricks can only be done once per half so use them wisely.\n\nThe field is also covered in hazards. You got land mines, spikes, buzz saws, alien worm thingies, lava pits and I may be hallucinating because I didn\u2019t catch it on camera but I think I saw lightning strikes. Not dirty tricks either...just random lightning.\n\nYou have play now which is exhibition. Season mode which only lasts 1 year. Play offs if you want to skip all the season games. Online, which is surprisingly active. I get notifications for online games all the time. Team Scouting which I don\u2019t really see the need for considering there is no trading mechanic. I guess it\u2019s for deciding which team you wanna use or something I dunno. It does alert you to their dirty tricks tho.Practice which might as well just be exhibition and that\u2019s it as far as game modes go.\n\nSome of the teams are locked and you gotta do certain things to get them. There is things that are missing. There is no character customization. No create a team. No league or tournament creation. No career mode like Myplayer in 2k. No custom playbook. I could go on. It just makes me wonder what Manheim could do with a triple A budget. Just be glad EA didn\u2019t make it this time around\u2026we\u2019d probably see so many paywalls and p2w mechanics. \nDuring the game you can attack other players and kill them. You can turn resurrection on where players come back to life after each play or game or never at all. In season and playoff mode you get so many rezs after each game to ensure you have some players left over after a game.\n\nAll in all it's worth the price. Hopefully we see more content in the future.

I saw BloodBowl was on sale on Steam, but didn\u2019t buy it as I\u2019m not a huge fan of turn-based. I saw Mutant Football League and immediately thought of NFL Blitz for the N64. Little did I know I would hear some very interesting use of the English language and become comfortable with completely breaking, but following the rules of Football. \n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] is actually really rock solid. It definitely follows the beautiful theme that NFL Blitz delivered by keeping a football game quick and intense. The game is complimented by the fact the delivery is made in the devs creativity and dedication to the whacky theme. It goes far as impacting the entire world of football, from the stadiums, to the play field, to the players, and especially to the rules of the game. MFL literally takes the entire experience to the next level and doesn\u2019t cut any corners along the way. Menus are polished and neatly organized. There is a season mode available for players in which options can be customized. For example, you could choose to have players revived after every game if they die during the game. Yes, your players can technically die - or are absent \u2013 during the game should you get a few knuckle sandwiches to the noggin and bone shackling tackles. Your health will slowly decrease and you can run out of players for certain positions. If you run out of quarterbacks, then you\u2019ll lose the game - plain and simple. Choosing a play in-game is extremely easy on offence and defense. It\u2019s quick to navigate and the game plan is illustrated in a way for anyone to understand. Should you change your mind during a play, you can call-up a mini-menu to quickly change the game plan before snapping the ball.  \n\nEven if you\u2019re a n00b at football, you\u2019ll have a good chance learning the rules and strategies that come along with the sport. There is a n00b friendly feature when the player holds RT on either defense or offence, the chosen play is illustrated on the field. My friend who has no idea about football really appreciated this feature and maybe even taught him a thing or two about the sport. He also liked the back-to-back play feature as he didn\u2019t like always choosing a play. I also really appreciate the fact you can customize a bit of the play (before snapping the ball of course). The player that you are moving before the snap generally has two positions to choose from. Of course if you\u2019re impatient like me, you can snap the ball while the player is between those two final positions to, you know, not only change the play up, but keep the opponent guessing. The [b]controls[/b] in-game are varied just enough to complicate tactics. There are two sort of tackles that the player can do which consist of diving for an opponent or straight just going through an opponent. There are two different hit buttons : one is a little slower and more devastating while the other is quicker, but delivers a smaller impact. One appreciated feature is jumping and one amazing feature is attacking while being on offence. If players are jumping your way to take you down, you can hit that counter-attack button to shrug them off your shoulders and to the ground. This game is definitely unpredictable, but feels fairly balanced at all times. The fairness of the game is sometimes comparable to Mario Party turned on with bonuses; you don\u2019t know who the heck will randomly open a box with a star. You will definitely have to know the game inside and out to have a solid advantage. \n\nCalling the plays can be absolutely ridiculous at times. The regular plays are very efficient in what they do, but there is this thing called \u201cdirty tricks\u201d in MFL. The [b]visuals[/b] of the game certainly compliment the catastrophic potential of dirty tricks (and the game in general). The x-factor, the shazpooz, the whazah, the qu\u2019est-ce-que c\u2019est, the spicey meat-ah-ball of this game is directly related to what you want to do and your strategic approach. Say the other team is low on quarter-backs, you can choose a \u201cdirty trick\u201d play and straight up terminate the quarter-back before the ball is properly snapped. The quarter-back does have a chance to defend, but the player better be quick on their toes to run! Another dirty trick involves the quarter-back pulling out a shotgun while running to get a first down. If you run out of bullets, why not take steroids on the field to run through the defense? Well apparently its encouraged in the MFL! So is bribing the referee. If you think you\u2019re going to miss the run and want a second chance to go for a hail mary, a dirty trick can definitely buy you a penalty. Can the defense do something like that you ask? Well of course! Say the offense bribed the referee for a penalty against, you can choose to take out the crooked official! These are some examples of the insane ways that the gameplay is directly impacted by small tweaks to the rules and strategies \u2013 it was done in an excellent fashion! I love how the game is consistent in nailing the details. Dirty tricks can sometimes be sidetracked thanks to the randomness (or dangers) of the stadium. Definitely keep an eye out for any holes in the field as they may contain spikes. Getting slammed too hard on the ice may throw your character right through.\n\nI should give a notable nomination for the [b]sound and audio[/b]. The commentating in game is absolutely wonderful and the commentators themselves are quite the characters. It definitely reminds me of the intensity NFL Blitz has with a touch of \u201cpourquoi\u201d? In other words, the commentating is the cherry on top to complete the wonderful compliment cake that is this game. I hope that the devs definitely consider updating the commentary! Concerning dialogue, the players aren\u2019t much for words. They sort of have their own language and will babble something out during a very brief cut-scene. The attention to detail to sound seems quite accurate as you will hear players crash through glass or fall into water. \n\nOverall, a pretty solid game and would definitely recommend a purchase on sale. The non-stop carnage even after the whistle makes this an action packed game. The play is not over even though the whistle has blown. That\u2019s what I like most about the game; there is always some thinking involved even though everything is colorful on the TV. If you are a football fan or just a casual gamer, you definitely will get a tackle out of this game! Heh. \n\n\nRATING : 8.0/10     ***Update the commentary and I\u2019ll bump the score***\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]B+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\n[h1] Video : [/h1]\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRYYeSflh2w&feature=youtu.be]Mutant Football League Highlights Review[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1515142329, "timestamp_updated": 1515838828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.602750", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39069649": {"recommendationid": "39069649", "author": {"steamid": "76561198280404531", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 767, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 206, "last_played": 1515268290}, "language": "english", "review": "As the original MLF game was one of my all time favorites from the 16 bit days I was incredibly psyched when I came across this game in the store.

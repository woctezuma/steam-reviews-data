It's a story about Aya - young girl, daughter of a... well \"mad\" scientist.

Steam version has slightly different art, there's also \"save yourself\" mini game added. I don't remember all the story details well, so I'm not sure if anything had changed in that regard. Still, I think this game is well worth the money and it's nice that the creators of \"Mad Father\" are getting more recognition and hopefully, that they are making well deserved money.\n\n\"Mad Father\" has amazing atmosphere, intriguing storyline and impressive attention to details. It captures all the best qualities of RPG Maker horror games, so if you're a fan of that type of games, you definitely don't want to miss out on that one.", "timestamp_created": 1514647725,

En el a\u00f1o 2016, fue lanzado a la venta en la plataforma Steam.\n\n\u00bfVale la pena? Acomp\u00e1\u00f1ame en la rese\u00f1a.\n\n[h1]Historia[/h1]\nEl comienzo no es nada del otro mundo. \nAya, la protagonista, conoce el secreto de su padre, todas las noches escucha uno que otro grito de las v\u00edctimas que provienen del s\u00f3tano, donde se encuentra ubicado el laboratorio. Pero una noche, el grito que resuena por toda la mansi\u00f3n es el de su padre, sinti\u00e9ndose obligada a ir en su ayuda y enfrentar a los cad\u00e1veres vivientes que intentar\u00e1n matarla a lo largo de su trayector\u00eda. Aya es consciente de qui\u00e9n es la culpa, y a\u00fan as\u00ed est\u00e1 dispuesta en salvar a su padre.\n\nPero no es as\u00ed de simple, hay mucho m\u00e1s por descubrir.\n\n[h1]Jugabilidad[/h1]\nJugar con teclado no es para nada un reto pero s\u00ed es muy c\u00f3modo, sobre todo en los Quicktime Events.\nEl juego pondr\u00e1 en pr\u00e1ctica tu sigilo, pues los enemigos te perseguir\u00e1n y atacar\u00e1n una vez te hayan visto (algunos te matar\u00e1n al instante). Tambi\u00e9n tu estrategia para acabar con ellos si tienes lo necesario en tu entorno y en tu inventario.\nSe aplica mucho el [b]Ensayo y error[/b], m\u00e1s a la hora de sacar los finales.\nPara guardar debemos de encontrar a un cuervo que nos dar\u00e1 cinco ranuras. Para los finales, es recomendable guardar por separado en vez de sobrescribir.\nLa [b]motosierra[/b] la adquiriremos en una de las salas de la mansi\u00f3n, con ella no podremos atacar al enemigo de manera directa sino cortar barriles y otros objetos que nos ser\u00e1n de ayuda para acabar con nuestro rival.\n[b]Game Over[/b]: Es como cualquier otro juego de este tipo; morimos y empezamos donde guardamos por \u00faltima vez. Recomiendo guardar la partida cuando veas al cuervo.\n\n[h1]Gr\u00e1ficos[/h1]\nEl peso y rendimiento del juego no ser\u00e1n demasiados al estar desarollado en Wolf RPG Editor, cualquier Pc puede correrlo.\nPara quienes han jugado a su primera versi\u00f3n, habr\u00e1n notado el gran cambio que han hecho en los escenarios, los enemigos y personajes, son fascinantes hasta el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo detalle. Y si hay quienes no han tenido la oportunidad de probarlo en sus inicios, este remaster les encantar\u00e1. \n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 decir? Maravilloso. Sublime. \u00danico. Embriagador. Cada uno va acorde a la situaci\u00f3n en la que se encontrar\u00e1 Aya. Hasta el silencio nos erizar\u00e1 la piel, pues nunca sabremos qu\u00e9 ocurrir\u00e1. \nNo s\u00e9 si incluir esto aqu\u00ed pero aqu\u00ed voy. Las risas de las v\u00edctimas nos har\u00e1n sentir amenazados, creyendo que seremos atacados tarde o temprano. Ni hablar del grito desgarrador de Aya cuando hayamos sacado un Game Over.\n\n[h1]Enemigos[/h1]\nNo todos son iguales. Algunos nos perseguir\u00e1n y atacar\u00e1n hasta vaciarnos la barra de salud; otros no dudar\u00e1n en matarnos en ese preciso instante, llev\u00e1ndonos a la pantalla Game Over; otros no tendr\u00e1n la intenci\u00f3n de asesinarnos pero s\u00ed hay que tener cuidado con ellos si no hacemos el movimiento correcto. Como mencion\u00e9 antes, necesitaremos de nuestro entorno e inventario para salir ilesos de la situaci\u00f3n (m\u00e1s en el final).\n\n[h1]Finales[/h1]\nUn final bueno, dos malos m\u00e1s un Extra. \nPara sacar los tres finales, tendremos que aplicar el Ensayo y Error. \nPara sacar el Extra, tendremos que encontrar las 21 gemas y sacar el final bueno.\n\n[h1]Personajes[/h1]\nA algunos les tendremos cari\u00f1o; a otros los odiaremos; a otros nos picar\u00e1 esa curiosidad de saber m\u00e1s de su historia. Si bien estaremos en la piel de Aya, tambi\u00e9n intentaremos estar dentro del zapato de otro para comprender el porqu\u00e9 de sus acciones.\n\n[h1]Moraleja[/h1]\n\u00bfPerdonar\u00edas a alguien que ha sido capaz de cometer semejante atrocidad a otros?\n\n[u]Resultado[/u]: 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1514258951, "timestamp_updated": 1514260603, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648562", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38673787": {"recommendationid": "38673787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198175458105", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512281921}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un muy buen juego para el a\u00f1o que fue lanzado, adem\u00e0s de tener una gran historia, incluyendo su banda sonora que es atmosf\u00e8rico =D\n\nEste juego tiene 11/10\n-IGN", "timestamp_created": 1514238267, "timestamp_updated": 1514238267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521739", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38643066": {"recommendationid": "38643066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104197783", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 239, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 239, "last_played": 1514169061}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1514169136, "timestamp_updated": 1514169136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38608637": {"recommendationid": "38608637", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030801520", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 485, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 485, "last_played": 1514086292}, "language": "english", "review": "Sprites and horror, what a great combo", "timestamp_created": 1514095138, "timestamp_updated": 1514095138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38549411": {"recommendationid": "38549411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314649330", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490522616}, "language": "turkish", "review": "oyun iyi ama fiyat\u0131 de\u011fer mi derseniz hay\u0131r\nbuna benzer rpgler bedava iken bunun 10 lira olmas\u0131 kalp k\u0131r\u0131yor ben fakir miyim 10 liran\u0131n laf\u0131n\u0131 yapmam derseniz buyrun\nbanane", "timestamp_created": 1513975909, "timestamp_updated": 1513975909, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38536440": {"recommendationid": "38536440", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118511442", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513303762}, "language": "english", "review": "Really unique, fun, and scary RPG.

But unlike Misao: Definitive Edition witch was all most a remake. \n\nMad Father is more of a remastered version then a remake like Misao. With update art, newly added events, and some new story. But anyway time for the story.\n\nYou play as Aya, a little girl who lost her mother about year ago. As she reflects on the past in her nursery she hears her father, who is a doctor screaming, so Aya gets up to see what is wrong but soon she sees what her father has been doing, so it\u2019s up to her to save him. \n\nNow what I like about this game/the remastered version. I liked the new redesigns, not just for the undead monsters but the Drevis mansion as well. \n\nI mean the Drevis mansion looks more put together. Like in the old game Aya or her parents room looked a bit empty and looked the same, but now in the new game her room is more detailed. It just feels more real.\n\nI liked that we got some new story for two characters in the game. Liked the creepy atmosphere. And I liked the music it could be vary creepy. Characters were good too.\n\nNow for something I did not like changing the quick time event, you see in the old game you hit the spacebar but in the new game you hit the arrow keys, I don\u2019t get it I liked the old way.\n\nNow with all that done. Mad Father is one of the classic rpg maker horror game, that just got even better with this new remastered version. Great art, good scares, and a nice story.

I do have to say, however, that I wouldn't recommend expanding the screen size despite the relatively small window it opens in, as the visuals get VERY fuzzy and distorted.  It simply wasn't made for the fullscreen experience.  However, unless you're overly finicky about something like that, I can promise you that the smaller game screen does not affect your enjoyment of the game.  It's a minor detail that is very easily forgotten about once you start playing.\n\nConcerning the plot, I think it's a great story that isn't too complicated, but it doesn't stop the revelations from being exciting and the intentions of the villain from being disturbing.  The fact that I'd already seen the entire game before and knew how it ended made no difference to how much I enjoyed it playing it myself, and I really did.  I like the level of challenge in that it was relatively easy to figure out what to do next without getting stuck and having to look it up.  The horror aspect of the game is well done in that it doesn't rely on sudden jumpscares or loud noises, but is more subtle in the way it creeps you out.  It's in the way something looks or moves.  There were some great moments that made me gasp that were simply something in the background moving for a second, or something appearing that wasn't there before.  This isn't a plot spoiler, but as an example of such, I love the moment you leave the kitchen while the rabid dog is still in it for the first time, and just as you activate the door, the dog suddenly flies across the room running so fast and is right behind you as the visual cuts to black.  There wasn't even a noise that came with it, but I genuinely freaked out for a second cos it was unexpected and very sneaky!  There are a lot of great moments like that that keep you on your toes.  I also really appreciate the game's very sparse use of voices and speech, as pretty much the only voice you will hear throughout the game is the protagonist's little gasps, unsure noises and screams, and then the odd monster groan.  Hardly any other characters are voiced, which means that when you do suddenly hear a voice out of the blue, it has that much more impact.  Again, I'm not going to spoil, because this one does involve a MASSIVE plot point, but there's a hugely important character that never speaks aloud until a certain moment, and when they do, it's the most creepy, malicious sounding voice of the whole game, yet almost an intimate murmur-in-your-ear in the way it's delivered... it gave me a full body shiver because it was so creepy!\n\nThe plot was decently paced and the game felt like the right length for the story, not too long or short.  The twists are, while potentially easy to spot in advance, very enjoyable and you really get a feel of being that protagonist trapped in a horrible situation where you just want the people you love to be alive and happy and all get along, but it just doesn't seem like it's able to work out that way, forcing you to make very tough decisions and choose between people you'd rather not.  There are several endings to achieve, and the 'true' ending definitely has a sinister twist to it that you really don't expect after going through what you went through.  There is also a very cleverly written and very mysterious character that I still don't believe anyone truly understands.  Once you play it, you'll know exactly who I'm talking about. \n He appears friendly and helps the protagonist, yet he then goes on to do certain things behind her back that contradict that, and his true intentions are never revealed, leaving him to perpetually walk the line between good and evil without you ever understanding who he is and what he's trying to achieve.  I felt loyal to him one moment and scared of him the next, and I love his character because he infuriates me!  I want to know!\n\nOne last thing that's important to say; Mad Father was being sold at Halloween in the Bloodsoaked Bundle with the game Misao.  They might not be bundled anymore, but once you've played Mad Father, I still highly recommend you play Misao because...  in the least spoilery way possible, there's a continuation.  The actual main games seem completely unrelated to each other, but let's just say there are characters and themes that are related to Mad Father that appear unexpectedly with no warning in Misao.  If you weren't familiar with Mad Father, you wouldn't even realise.  In the small moments that they do appear, they give you extra information on the more mysterious and unresolved elements of Mad Father that, while not providing a definitive answer, set a lot of possibilities running through your head.  I very much like that sneaky little extra.  Do try it for yourself.\n\nRight, I've rambled enough!  Short version: Mad Father is one of my very favourite games of this genre and you should definitely give it a go.  Interesting plot, creepy villain, drama and deceit, running for your life, and mysteries that never quite get an answer...  also, who doesn't love a good chainsaw?", "timestamp_created": 1511043883, "timestamp_updated": 1511043883, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.524584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36602094": {"recommendationid": "36602094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036145790", "num_games_owned": 551, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510978010}, "language": "english", "review": "Played the original back in the day, along with Misao, Witch's House, Ib and others.\nThe remake made everything even better for me, as far as i remember the old one.\n\nThis game is a japanese horror story centered around a girl whose father is a mad scientist, her mother is dead and they live in a mansion.

I'm sure that for some people this is actually NOT scary at all, but that's not the reason of why you should avoid or just buy the game for, it actually has a reaaaaaally nice story. Like I would give it a 9, and 0.5+ for the after story, leaving 0.5 for the errors, bugs, to not to be as biased, blah blah blah. \nThe game mechanics are really simple, aaaand *epic music* collecting things in this game is easy, fun and important, so you don't feel like you are wasting time looking for the orbs, looking through every room, and clicking everywhere to find something (I have quite the OCD when it comes to collecting things ingame)\nThe logic/puzzle is pretty simple once you get the grasp, and even if you get murdered, burned, bitten, killed, [spoiler] chased to death by your loving father (that part did scare me REALLY bad) [/spoiler], you can aaaalways find a way out. Oh oh, however there are this few places where its all about speed reaction, so good luck!!\nUhm... So overall, yes, I would recommend this game!!

Eu fiquei irritada e feliz ao mesmo tempo com isso, mas ok.\nTipo, num geral ficamos 5 anos acreditando que o Dio era um dos v\u00e1rios testes e que tava morto, pra mim foram 3. A\u00ed c\u00eas me vem com o IF dizendo que ele tava vivo desde sempre. Eu queria meter o cacete no Sen por causa disso mas vida segue. \nEu recomendo, DEMAIS, pegarem a vers\u00e3o da Steam. N\u00e3o s\u00f3 por isso, mas o visual num geral mudou e ficou muito bonito. Eu s\u00f3 fico meio inquieta com o sprite default da Aya por causa dos olhos (tamb\u00e9m como a Monika)\nFicou muito mais... suave?

Y mejor a\u00fan, preguntarse  \u00bfRealmente vale la pena pagar 5$ por este tipo de juegos cuando hay tantos juegos en la misma categor\u00eda que son totalmente gratis? Pues con tal solo ver la manito que se encuentra a mi izquierda deber\u00eda alcanzar para que conozcas mi opini\u00f3n, pero r\u00e1pidamente dir\u00e9\u2026Si, lo vale.  A continuaci\u00f3n dar\u00e9 mi opini\u00f3n con m\u00e1s detalles\n\n* Como siempre, empezamos con lo m\u00e1s interesante de estos juegos, y como es de esperarse la encuentro bastante \u00fanica, quiz\u00e1s predecible en algunos aspectos, pero como ya dije, \u00fanica.  Dime, alguna vez has experimentando alguna historia donde desde el comienzo sabemos que el causante y responsable de los males sigue siendo alguien que tiene cierto afecto nosotros (La protagonista) y nuestro deber no es ni matarlo o si quiera detenerlo, m\u00e1s bien salvarlo. Esto da lugar a un interesante tema que se va desarrollando a lo largo del juego acerca si es posible perdonar y incluso cambiar a alguien que ha cometido atrocidades a otros seres vivos.\n\n*Luego tenemos la est\u00e9tica, que es bastante llamativa, mientras que los salones no sorprenden mucho en cuanto a la forma, suelo o incluso paredes, resalta mucho en objetos, y sobre todo en personajes, si lo has comprado te invito a que observes con detalle el pixel art que llevan, sobre todo las criaturas, cualquier fan\u00e1tico/a del dibujo pixelado le encantara, y no olvidemos  la enorme  cantidad de objetos que hay en cada sala, es incre\u00edble el esfuerzo y dedicaci\u00f3n que hay visualmente, se nota bastante que este juego paso por muchas actualizaciones hasta lograr la belleza que es hoy.\n\n* Vamos al gameplay, aqu\u00ed hay bastante que se\u00f1alar ya que utiliza ciertos recursos que son muy subjetivos. Mejor empecemos lo que comparte con otros juegos.  Los puzzles son bastante sencillos y f\u00e1ciles, puede que est\u00e9s perdiendo m\u00e1s tiempo en buscar lo que necesitas para resolver el acertijo que en pensar en c\u00f3mo resolverlo, lo cual puede hacerlo un poco molesto m\u00e1s si tomamos en cuenta que varias veces hay que regresar a zonas ya investigadas.  Y mientras la mitad del juego se resuelve bastante f\u00e1cil, la otra mitad se convierte en morir una y otra vez en el ya tan conocido t\u00e9rmino \u201cPrueba y error\u201d  por suerte, casi siempre hay un \u201ccheckpoint\u201d o guardado justo antes de la parte donde muuuy probablemente llegemos a la pantalla de \u201cgame over\u201d. Lo cual dudo en contarlo como algo positivo, pero est\u00e1 en usted, mi querido/a lector de contarlo como t\u00fa quieras. \u00bfY qu\u00e9 hay del gameplay  \u201cno com\u00fan\u201d en estos juegos? Son m\u00e1s bien, una especie de minijuegos, como quick time events o secciones de sigilo, los cuales agregan cierta variedad que fueron realmente de mi agrado, pero reitero, puedo que a ti lector sea totalmente lo opuesto, aunque debo admitir que volver a pasarlo cuando estoy haciendo un \u201cRe run\u201d es bastante molesto.\n\n*Hay muchos aspectos m\u00e1s del que quiero hablar, pero siempre t\u00e9rmino hablando de m\u00e1s \u00bfVerdad? Bueno, esto es lo que m\u00e1s me llamo la atenci\u00f3n, el nivel de detalle y secretos que tiene.\n\u00bfDetalle? Puede que uno usualmente no se d\u00e9 cuenta de estas cosas, pero realmente hacen la diferencia, \u00a1puedes caminar en diagonales!, una signo de exclamaci\u00f3n aparecer\u00e1 sobre tu cabeza cuando te encuentres pr\u00f3ximo a una casilla de algo que puedes examinar, los ruidos que emiten los personajes cuando hablan son cosas que uno puede pasar por alto, mas all\u00e1 de eso\u2026 \u00bfSecretos? Si, desde que interactuar varias veces con un mismo objecto provoque una nueva frase, de una manera que no tiene sentido, pero si lo pasas y vuelves a iniciar tiene un cierto sentido, lo cual aporta algo de re jugabilidad que se aprecia mucho en estos juegos, hablando de eso, hay un bonus si encuentras todas la gemas en una sola partida lo cual te invita a que investigues todos tus alrededores, pena que hay veces donde no puedes volver para atr\u00e1s y llegaste a olvidar uno suerte en la pr\u00f3xima partida, yo har\u00eda que no necesariamente tengas que obtener todos sino una mayor\u00eda, me niego a jugarlo de nuevo al menos por ahora,  pero alg\u00fan d\u00eda juntare todas y podr\u00e9 ver ese bonus.\n\nEn fin, tiene sus fallas pero realmente vali\u00f3 la pena cada centavo por su detalle y propuesta que me mantuvo pendiente hasta que lo termine.\n", "timestamp_created": 1501217922, "timestamp_updated": 1501217922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny":

moment I spent in the game and due to its length it is perfect for people who would like a game that they can just pick up and play and beat in a afternoon.\nWhile nothing in the game was overly scary and nothing made me jump I would not say that it was the games fault as rpgmaker does have it's limits, but it does not take anything away from the game.\nIt has a good story and some likeable characters, You play the game as Aya, a 11 year old girl that awakens to hear her father screaming and finds a curse has been unleashed on the house and it is now filled with ghosts and dead people brought back to life, Aya braves the horrors of the house to try and find and rescue her father.\nYou have no weapons in the game so you will not be able to kill or fight anything off. \n\nI would

And the first thing that appeared in there was a blood-covered zombie maid. Far from being frightened or unsettled, my reaction was more like \"Really? Seriously?\" I carried that feeling of mixed contempt and incredulity through the whole game.\n\nIt felt to me like the writing, the characters, the environmental design, the arbitrary stealth sections where you navigate around murderous dolls... almost everything about this game seemed to be messed up for the sake of being messed up. There is absolutely no subtlety to the horror, from beginning to end. Mad Father does not have a good buildup of tension like there is in, say, Oxenfree or Fran Bow. Well-designed horror starts with small, unsettling things and gradually works up to the unspeakable horrors. MF threw the horrors at me within the first 30 minutes, and with that as a baseline I quickly got used to seeing blood and mutilated bodies all over the place. I wasn't frightened, like I have been in any number of other horror adventure games - just tense and annoyed.\n\nYou go from one too-easy puzzle to the next, broken up by segments where an inexplicable monster will try to kill you. You learn more about the messed up characters - and almost all of them are messed up, not just the titular Mad Father (someone has a murder fetish! Try to guess who! :D ). Eventually, you learn a secret that could have been telegraphed all the way from the prologue. And there are jump scares all the way. \n\nThe only thing I thought was good about the game were the visual effects. The random spooky things that happen in the background as you wander through the mansion and is 4-5 basement levels were generally well done.

You will need to backtrack from time to time, but this back tracking always comes with minor to major changes in whatever room or rooms you're going back through, which makes it both worth it and a bit creepy to continue on.\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS: 8.5/10: Excellent and detailed visuals with only minor complaints.[/h1]\nI'm a huge fan of games that have that good old fashioned RPG Maker VX feel and this one nails it whilst being detailed and unique enough to where it looks far beyond the quality of what most people are capable of making in said program. I do not have any real major gripes with the graphics with the exception of two things: I feel that the character portraits being a bit low-res/pixelated is a bit of a distraction, and I feel like the sprites, especially of Aya's(the girl's) sprite, should have had more expressions (pupils shrinking during fear, etc.) But these issues are probably just a bit of pickiness on my part, and it may just have been tricky with the sprites' resolutions.\n\n[h1]STORY: 8.5/10: Too short for my tastes, but if it were extended, I'd pay many times more! It's great to me.[/h1]\nThe story is solid and quite enjoyable and suspenseful, albeit a bit predictable. They go over backstories and flashbacks and explain most of what you want or need to know, with the best ending (yes there's multiple endings) being quite the treat. Overall, quite solid. What keeps it from going above the 8.5 however is that it is short, like really short. Don't get me wrong, movies are only an hour and a half long most of the time, so compared to the playtime I got my money's worth. IF the creator decides to release a sequel, I would absolutely buy it. If the game were re-released to have a 8-12 hour or longer story, I would pay $30+ for it.\n\n[h1]SOUND: 9/10: Plenty of high-quality sound effects and some voice acting![/h1]\nThe soundtrack is a bit small but fits the mood and atmosphere. Along with this, there is voice acting for grunting/moaning/screaming, as well as a bit of voice acting for the Father that absolutely makes the game reach its potential much more smoothly. There is no noticable bad quality anywhere in the audio and there's plenty of sound effects for all the events and things you may do in the game. The only thing keeping this from being a 10/10 is that in some cases the music will straight up stop for a bit (though this may be intentional?), and I wouldn't have minded a bit more music for the background. Not a huge issue at all though.\n\n[h1]VALUE: 11/10: For just $5 you get a game that's sure to be a memorable one.[/h1]\nWhere can you pay the equivalent of a hot lunch at a burger joint for a well made game that's more than worth playing for puzzle and horror fans? Right here you can. I really don't have too much to say for this category, it's an excellent value, and I wouldn't have minded paying $7-$10 for it even if it's short. There is replayability though, in that there are multiple endings and some extra details to be found.\n\n[h1]OVERALL: 9/10 - Highly recommended![/h1]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1492812422, "timestamp_updated": 1492812422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31272661": {"recommendationid": "31272661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198379025700", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 926, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492706185}, "language": "russian", "review": "[h1] \u041e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u0438\u0433\u0440 \u0432 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0451\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0435\t[/h1]\n1 \u0418\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f,\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f (\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f). \n2 \u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430,\u0443\u0436 \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u044b \u0442\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0451\u0442\u0435! \n3 \u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f,\u0430 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0445 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0432\u0430\u0436\u043d\u043e (\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442 \u0430\u0447\u0438\u0432\u043a\u043e\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043c).\n\n\u0422\u0430\u043a \u0436\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f.

I bought it to support the developer, who had released a number of freeware games back in the day.  But, this game is just terrible.  From the awful and clunky controls, the simplistic and needlessly frustrating puzzles, to the fact that if you're not careful you can get yourself caught in an infinite death loop towards the end of the game.  And to be quite honest, this game has some of the worst sound design and mixing I've ever heard in a game.  In a lazy attempt to get a scare out of the player, it will make certain sounds so ear-piercingly loud that you wish you played with the game on mute.  Including the music that plays when you die...which continues to play after reloading your last save.  Gradually getting louder and louder for no apparent reason, to the point where it actually drowns out the rest of the game for a good 5-10 seconds.  This happens every.  Single.  Time.  Every time you make a mistake, just mute your speakers or take off your headphones, because your eardrums are about to be beaten harder than a pedophile in prison.  On that note, what little voice acting there is will make you cringe so hard that onlookers will believe you to be having some kind of seizure.\n\nThe story starts of interestingly enough, presenting the player with a unique moral dilemma.  Unfortunately, said dilemma is completely tossed out the window no more than 15 minutes into the game.  Leaving you with one of the most disappointing endings that you'll ever have the misfortune to witness.\n\nFor crying out loud, don't buy this game.

Art was cleaned up, bonus unlockable segment added, and the characters of the \"blonde youth\" and creepy-corpse-girl-which-follows-the-player-around are flushed out to their fullest in this version. \n\nMad Father is a jewel in the genre of rpgmaker horror games, and this is the standard version to get.

Ser\u00e1 que a nossa pobre protagonista consegue sobreviver a esta aventura?\n\nJogabilidade:\nN\u00f3s, o player, controlamos Aya com as teclas \"WASD\" ou com as teclas direcionais do teclado. Al\u00e9m das teclas de dire\u00e7\u00e3o, a tecla \"X\" ou o \"Esc\" abrem o menu, onde podemos aceder ao invent\u00e1rio, que vai ser muito \u00fatil no decorrer do jogo.\n\n[SPOILER]N\u00e3o assim tanto, mas mais tarde no jogo, Aya vai conseguir adquirir uma mini motosserra, o que vai fazer com que ela seja capaz de destruir barris e cortar coisas fr\u00e1geis, como animais mortos ou incapazes de se mover e de pequeno/m\u00e9dio porte, como c\u00e3es (por exemplo). Ela pode ser acedida ao pressionarmos a tecla \"C\" ou o \"SHIFT\". [/SPOILER]\n\nN\u00e3o encontrei dificuldades nos controlo da personagens ou do acesso ao menu. Tamb\u00e9m gostei da velocidade padr\u00e3o da personagem, o que faz com que n\u00e3o seja preciso correr mais que o necess\u00e1rio. (Se n\u00e3o der para escapar do inimigo, o problema n\u00e3o estar\u00e1 na velocidade, mas sim na estrat\u00e9gia!)\n\nTradu\u00e7\u00e3o:\nA tradu\u00e7\u00e3o em Ingl\u00eas est\u00e1 \u00f3tima, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel entender o que se pretende transmitir ao jogador, especialmente porque a linguagem usada \u00e9 simples e direta.\n\nSobre o Jogo:\nA Galeria de Imagens (designada por \"Museum\") s\u00f3 pode ser desbloqueada depois de o jogo ter sido terminado, contendo todas as informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre cada personagem e os respetivos sprites, as imagens (com direito a sketchs originais e ideias anteriores em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao design dos personagens) apresentadas no jogo e o soundtrack do mesmo.\nNesta vers\u00e3o da Steam, podemos conseguir muitas \"conquistas\" (achievements), portanto explora tudo se gostas de obter todas as proezas! ;) Para finalizar este t\u00f3pico, este jogo cont\u00e9m \"Quick Time Events\" (mini-jogos contra rel\u00f3gio que aparecem subitamente no decorrer do jogo, onde os nossos reflexos s\u00e3o testados haha) obrigat\u00f3rios (algo que n\u00e3o existia na vers\u00e3o anterior, adicionado neste remake!), que consistem em pressionar um espec\u00edfica sequ\u00eancia de teclas de dire\u00e7\u00e3o v\u00e1rias vezes, antes da barra de vida da Aya acabar!\n\nSobre of Finais:\nO jogo tem 3 finais: dois Bad Endings (Finais Maus) e o Good Ending (Final Bom/ Final Verdadeiro). [SPOILER]Para fazeres o primeiro bad ending, \u00e9 apenas preciso escolheres entregar o pai para a nossa m\u00e3e, numa das decis\u00f5es finais; para fazeres o outro bad ending n\u00e3o podes ler o di\u00e1rio da Maria, pois isso d\u00e1 acesso direto para o good ending. Para fazeres o good ending tens de ver o passado da Maria (lendo o seu di\u00e1rio) e ver se ela est\u00e1 bem logo depois, no s\u00edtio onde ela foi deixada, ferida. Se apanhares todas as gems/p\u00e9rolas que se encontram no jogo consegues uma cena b\u00f3nus, ap\u00f3s o good ending.[/SPOILER] Todos os finais s\u00e3o fant\u00e1sticos, ent\u00e3o recomendo jog\u00e1-los todos~!

No entanto, encontramos cenas que n\u00e3o existiam antes e uma arte mais \u00absoft\u00bb, e isso \u00e9 algo bem reconfortante de saber.\n\nValeu a pena?\nBem, eu j\u00e1 tinha jogado a vers\u00e3o anterior ent\u00e3o sabia como era, no geral. No entanto, foi uma experi\u00eancia nost\u00e1lgica e um tempo muito bem passado! o/ Posso afirmar que o pre\u00e7o n\u00e3o \u00e9 absurdo, \u00e9 o valor ideal para este jogo!

I'm a huge fan of RPG and puzzle games and this game has both of what I like. The game has the underlying theme of spooky and horror, but it being scary can differ greatly for various people. There were a few jump scares in the game, but it wasn't too bad. The game even forewarns you ... so you have been warned if you scare easily. \n\nTo the game! You play as Aya and you will start with some instructions on how to play the game. The story plot of the game isn't rich like final fantasy games, but it is quite rich and fantastic for how long the game is. I played the first time around and got true ending after 2 hours, then spent another hour collecting all of the achievements. I could not resist finding out what happened in Aya's past or what will happen to Aya as the game progresses. For two hours straight, I just kept playing and did not stop at all. The puzzle factors are interspersed into the game and I think it has a pretty good balance, Some are hard and some are easy. What was really nice is how forgiving the game can be. You are rarely pressured into making reflex responses and even if you fail them, the game has save points right before all of those events. So, even if you fail, you can just load your save slot and try until you get past it. Even more so if you are attempting achievement completion, the save spots are very convenient for you to do it quickly. Another nice factor in this game is the exclaimation points when you reach a point where you can interact with something/someone. Instead of forcing you to just click on everything, you can focus less on that and more on the game (highly appreciate that). To which brings to point, the details in this game. I highly praise the developer(s) on this, because it appears to me much thought and details went into the game (despite it being a short JRPG). There is a decent amount of exploration in the game and details you have to pay attention to if you want to be a completionist. \n\nDespite the positive factors I have mentioned earlier, some things did pop up to me as minor negatives. 1) The exclaimation mark popping up despite the event has already passed and 2) at the true ending scene, I'm left with a confused moment, because I'm not sure how should I take that ending. Is it actually a bad ending despite it being a \"good\" ending. If there is going to be a sequel to this game, I hope that question gets answered and the sequel will be as good or better than this current game.  \n\nOverall, this is a good game that I would recommend for anybody that loves a good RPG with puzzle factors without long grinding monsters. 8.5/10!", "timestamp_created": 1491282432, "timestamp_updated": 1491282432, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30923611": {"recommendationid": "30923611", "author": {"steamid": "76561198108104422", "num_games_owned": 522, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491449804}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u72c2\u7236\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u8fbe\u6210\uff0c\u6492\u82b1\uff0c\u6492\u82b1\n\u9644\u4e2a\u653b\u7565\u89c6\u9891\uff1a\nhttp://www.bilibili.com/video/av9644330/\n\n\u73a9\u4e86\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u6c49\u5316\u7248\u901a\u4e86\u4e00\u904d\uff0csteam\u7248\u901a\u4e86\u4e24\u904d\u3002\n\u9996\u5148\u8981\u8bf4\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u6c49\u5316\u7248\u3002\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5176\u5b9e\u53ea\u662f\u66b4\u529b\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u8bf4\u767d\u4e86\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u4e70\u6b63\u7248\u73a9\u76d7\u7248\u3002\u800c\u6c49\u5316\u7248\u5176\u5b9e\u8fd8\u662f\u7528\u7684v2\uff0csteam\u7248\u5df2\u7ecf\u662fv3\u4e86\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u753b\u98ce\u7684\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5ba4\u5185\u5e03\u7f6e\u4e5f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u52a8\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5730\u65b9\u8c1c\u9898\u4e5f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u76f8\u6bd4v2\u66f4\u4eba\u6027\u5316\uff0c\u66f4\u52a0\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u5173\u952e\u7269\u54c1\u5468\u56f4\u5934\u4e0a\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u611f\u53f9\u53f7\u7b49\u3002\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u5728\u767e\u5ea6\u67e5\u5230\u7684\u653b\u7565\u4e5f\u57fa\u672c\u662fv2\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u7edd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e5f\u90fd\u80fd\u53c2\u7167\u7740\u6765\uff0c\u552f\u4e00\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u53ea\u6709\u9760\u8fd1\u62fc\u56fe\u9644\u8fd1\u6e38\u8d70\u7684\u4e00\u682a\u5c16\u53eb\u690d\u7269\uff0c\u809a\u76ae\u6cdb\u767d\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u841d\u535c\uff0c\u7528\u7535\u952f\u628a\u5b83\u952f\u4e86\uff0c\u4e00\u9897\u9690\u85cf\u5b9d\u77f3\u5c31\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0cv3\u5e76\u4e0d\u9700\u89812\u5468\u76ee\u5c31\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u5173\u4e8e\u6bcd\u4eb2\u60c5\u4e66\u548c\u7236\u4eb2\u65e5\u8bb0\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u4e14v3\u76f8\u6bd4v2\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e2aif,\u4e3b\u8981\u4ee5\u91d1\u53d1\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8bb2\u8ff0\u4e86aya\u79bb\u5f00\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e8b\uff0c\u7b97\u662f\u589e\u52a0\u91d1\u53d1\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u5851\u9020\u5427\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u5b9e\u5728\u662f\u82f1\u6587\u82e6\u624b\uff0c\u4e5f\u5efa\u8bae\u73a9\u5b8c\u6c49\u5316\u7248\u4e4b\u540e\u518d\u901a\u4e00\u904dsteam\u7248\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6210\u5c31\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u5728end\u5f00\u59cb\u524d\u5b58\u597d\u6863\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1491228854, "timestamp_updated": 1491483330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30914487": {"recommendationid": "30914487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198372765494", "num_games_owned": 10, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491976676}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched a playthrough of the original version with a friend and we immediately wanted to play it.

Highly recommend it if you enjoy games like Corpse Party.", "timestamp_created": 1491187110, "timestamp_updated": 1491187110, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30902068": {"recommendationid": "30902068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299765262", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493808179}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65ad\u65ad\u7eed\u7eed\u7684\u73a9\u82b1\u4e86\u4e00\u5468\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u624d\u6253\u51fa\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5c40\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u65f6\u95f47h+,\u6709\u4e0d\u5c11\u65f6\u95f4\u82b1\u5728\u4e86\u6b7b\u2192\u8bfb\u6863*n\u548c\u67e5\u5b57\u5178\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u5728\u54ea\uff1f\u6211\u8981\u53bb\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u5728\u54ea\uff1f\u4e0a\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u7528\u96f6\u788e\u65f6\u95f4\u73a9\u7684\u75db\u82e6 orz\n\u56e0\u4e3a\u90fd\u662f\u665a\u4e0a\u73a9\u7684\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u6709\u88ab\u5413\u5230[strike]\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u6b7b\u4e86\u597d\u51e0\u6b21[/strike]\uff0c\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u540e\u5c31\u53d8\u6210father\u4e00\u7b11\u6211\u4e5f\u8ddf\u7740\u7b11\u4e862333\n\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u6ca1\u96be\u5ea6\n\u5173\u4e8e\u5b9d\u77f3\uff0c\u7edd\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u90fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u597d\u62ff\uff0c\u5feb\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u6211\u662f\u7f3a\u4e09\u9897\uff0c\u4e00\u9897\u662f\u771f\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230[spoiler] \u952f\u5c16\u53eb\u690d\u7269[/spoiler]\uff0c\u4e00\u9897\u662f\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u600e\u4e48\u62ff[spoiler] \u955c\u5b50[/spoiler]\uff0c\u4e00\u9897\u662f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5bf9[spoiler] [strike]\u5c0f\u874c\u86aa[/strike]\u5c0f\u7537\u5b69\u627e\u5988\u5988 [/spoiler]\n\u611f\u89c9\u89e3\u8c1c\u90e8\u5206\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u662f\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e5f\u90fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u624d\u51fa\u73b0\u5361\u5173\uff0c\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u5b8c\u5168\u9002\u5e94 steam\u7248\u7684\u653b\u7565\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u7684\u88ab\u8bef\u5bfc\u6216\u81ea\u5df1\u6d6a\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e2a[strike]\u60f3\u8d77\u51e0\u4e2a\u5199\u51e0\u4e2a\u5427[/strike]\n[spoiler] 1.\u6211\u4e00\u76f4\u627e\u653b\u7565\u8bf4\u7684\u201c\u5988\u5988\u7684\u623f\u95f4\u201d\u627e\u7684\u4e00\u8138\u61f5\u903c\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u5c31\u662faya\u623f\u95f4\u65c1\u8fb9\u90a3\u95f4\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u59cb\u8fdb\u53bb\u6709\u4e2a\u5973\u4eba\u5413\u4eba\uff0c\u6d88\u5931\u4f1a\u7559\u4e0b\u5b9d\u77f3\uff0c\u540e\u9762\u6709\u4e86\u9879\u94fe\u7528\u9879\u94fe\u6bcd\u5b50\u56e2\u5706\u5c31\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\n2.\u7ed9\u957f\u6bdb\u72d7\u4e00\u6839\u9aa8\u5934\u62ff\u5b9d\u77f3 \u90a3\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5934\u662f\u5c16\u53eb\u690d\u7269\u7ed9\u7684\u4e0d\u662f\u6740\u4eba\u4eba\u5076\u5751\u9053\u90a3\u91cc\u6361\u7684\uff0c\u6361\u4e86\u5751\u9053\u91cc\u7684\u5b9d\u77f3\u5c31\u884c\u4e86\u4e0d\u8981\u6d6a\u8d39\u65f6\u95f4\u6d6a\u8d39\u751f\u547d\u8c03\u67e5\u9aa8\u5934\u5806\n2.\u5927\u5385\u90a3\u9897\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u602a\u5f15\u5230\u697c\u4e0a\u518d\u62ff\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u803f\u76f4\u7684\u6b7b\u4e86\u51e0\u6b21\u62ff\u5230\u5b9d\u77f3\u540e\u624d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\uff0cso sad...\n3.\u6e38\u620f\u5230\u4e86\u540e\u9762\u4e0d\u662f\u6240\u6709\u95ea\u5149\u7684\u90fd\u662f\u5b9d\u77f3[spoiler] \u6bd4\u5982\u8bf4 \u57f9\u517b\u5c16\u53eb\u690d\u7269\u7684\u73bb\u7483\u7f50\u3001\u67d0\u5f20\u684c\u5b50[/spoiler]\n4.\u5229\u7528\u540a\u706f\u90a3\u4e2a\u5f53\u602a\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u5c31\u8981\u8d70\u5230\u706f\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5c31\u952f\u65ad\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u7b49\u602a\u5df2\u7ecf \u5230\u706f\u4e0b\u518d\u952f\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u602a\u8d70\u8def\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u597d\u50cf\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u6211\u8fc7\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u662f\u5de6\u2192\u53f3\t[/spoiler]\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\u6ca1\u611f\u89c9\u6709\u65b0\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6240\u6709\u4e1c\u897f\u90fd\u5728\u4e00\u5468\u76ee\u5c31\u80fd\u63a8\u6d4b\u5168\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1491142435, "timestamp_updated": 1493904205, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.571382", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30898396": {"recommendationid": "30898396", "author": {"steamid": "76561198334391074", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 455, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503770753}, "language": "russian", "review": "[b] Mad Father [/b] -

It's a great horror rpg game <3. The horror aspect comes from the storyline, the enemies that chase you in some areas, and the grosteque environment around you. \n \nIt is a simple plateform game where you move the character with the arrow keys and use the action key to interact with the environment around you. The enemies you face you must run away, or outsmart, and you will die if they attack you. You will die a lot in this game if not careful. \n\nThe puzzles range from simple to one or two that I needed help with, but it's nothing impossible to solve. Some puzzles require quick reflexes of the fingers to get past, while others are simple of combining objects to get past.\n\nI won't give away any spoilers, but the storyline is very interesting, maybe a little bit predictable in some ways, and there are multiple endings that you can achieve. A reminder that this is a horror story so be aware the endings will be shockers. I personally enjoyed the storyline and I was shocked to find out the true motive behind why this is all happening.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves horror plateformers. I was always creeped out by dolls, now I can't stop thinking about this game when I see them lol.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1489374353, "timestamp_updated": 1489374353, "voted_up": true, "votes_up":

This games story is very good. The game is simple, its a horror game in which you move around and solve puzzles with hints and clues and try to figure out how to get to the next area. The soundtrack is very good, I loved it. The game itself is simple and fun. It was not rage inducing difficult but wasn't overly boring easy either. This game shines with it's story. It's simple at first and doesn't give away too much too fast. It has a good pace. And leaves yu asking the questions till specific moments when you figure out whats really going on. Though for those of us used to the Horror Genre we may be able to figure that out ourselves as it doesn't take rocket science.\n\nI encountered different things in each play through, So I am unsure what exactly the differences are and how to achieve them. But I noticed things each time that I did not come acrossed the prior time. This added to its replay value for me as I re-played it through just to see if I could find a hint at what role a certain person who's name I won't mention actually plays. The game will leave you asking questions regarding the story, but will also answer them. Which will also make you ask more questions. It's an interesting story to put it simply. I got the game for 4.99$ and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes horror games and the paranormal / gore intensive stories and games. It was a hidden gem in the 2d horror that I found and I very much loved the game, enough to replay it 3x. \n\n10/10 Loved the game.", "timestamp_created": 1487136628, "timestamp_updated": 1487136628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499775", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29865561": {"recommendationid": "29865561", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967582007", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486879730}, "language": "english", "review": "Super Spooker.", "timestamp_created": 1486880020, "timestamp_updated": 1486880020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29822263": {"recommendationid": "29822263", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991071129", "num_games_owned": 541, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486728625}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not one for RPG maker games. But this is a shining example that 3D graphics and fancy gameplay mechanics are needed to tell an amazing story. Mad father is a Horror Adventure game. In the vein of IB and Misao.

This game is great. Music is top notch, with gothic droning tunes and ambient chamber music. The standing points of this game are 2 things. The Narrative and atmosphere. Let me be frank here, this isn't a game you're going to play for the gameplay, this is a game that you're going to enjoy for the story and ambiance.

At\u00e9 ent\u00e3o, nunca tinha sido \"a f\u00e3\" de terror, salvo apenas por adorar os primeiros Silent Hill e Resident Evil, tendo jogado-os no PlayStation 1 quando mais nova. Por\u00e9m eu morria de medo e evitava ao m\u00e1ximo jogar qualquer coisa no estilo - por isso, fui terminante contra, mas ele insistiu tanto que eu acabei aceitando. E foi a minha porta de entrada para o mundo do indie RPGMaker.\nA partir da\u00ed, comecei a procurar por mais e mais jogos, como Ib, Misao, Mermaid Swamp, Off, Yume Nikki, enfim, qualquer um no estilo de Mad Father. E, apesar de amar muito alguns desses games, outros nem tanto, eu sempre voltava para o primeiro.\nAgora com 17 anos, eis que me deparo com uma surpresa: Mad Father, updated, na Steam, por um pre\u00e7o bom. N\u00e3o pensei duas vezes antes de comprar e jogar tudo de novo.\nEnt\u00e3o, agora que j\u00e1 estamos ambientados, vamos ao ponto:\nA hist\u00f3ria n\u00e3o sofreu grandes altera\u00e7\u00f5es, a parte de alguns detalhes aqui e ali, nada de realmente importante; o plot continua o mesmo da vers\u00e3o gratuita, apesar de algumas poucas mudan\u00e7as nos finais, nada que saia do original. Os gr\u00e1ficos parecem estar mais definidos, com novas criaturas bem desenhadas, e novos sprites para alguns personagens.\nTodavia, o pr\u00eamio de recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o vai para os jumpscares e extras da vers\u00e3o paga.\nO jogo est\u00e1 muito melhor no quesito susto. O que j\u00e1 achava assustador, agora est\u00e1 mais ainda, com novos momentos tensos e suspresas. Por exemplo, em dado momento voc\u00ea est\u00e1 tranquilamente caminhando, quando passa por uma porta e adivinha? Aparece uma boneca na sua frente. Em outro, voc\u00ea escuta uma risadinha. Em outro ainda, algo vem correndo na sua dire\u00e7\u00e3o e voc\u00ea sente seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o parar por um instante.\nUma coisa importante \u00e9 a hist\u00f3ria dos personagens secund\u00e1rios, melhor contada agora. Pessoas que voc\u00ea achava que apareciam no jogo por aparecer e que n\u00e3o tinham utilidade alguma (a n\u00e3o ser em um ou dois momentos da hist\u00f3ria) passam a ter hist\u00f3rias e passados ligados a Alfred, Monika e Aya.  \nDestaque para o final If, que me deixou bem surpresa, mas nada de spoiler! As conquistas na steam tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o instigantes e bem feitas, para realmente deixar o jogador com vontade de explorar mais ainda.\nEnfim, eu adoro esse jogo e recomendo para todos que querem gastar pouco em um terror simples e curto, por\u00e9m excelente e bem-feito para novatos e mais conhecedores desse estilo.", "timestamp_created": 1484414284, "timestamp_updated": 1484414352, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29249420": {"recommendationid": "29249420", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152502012", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478402222}, "language": "english", "review": "Good buy for horror mood game.", "timestamp_created": 1484406271, "timestamp_updated": 1484406271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.444447", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29229284": {"recommendationid": "29229284", "author": {"steamid": "76561197964356207", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483209598}, "language": "english", "review": "pros:\n+ good story\n+ cute anime girls\n\ncons:\n- playing the game is boring\n- bad jumpscares\n- short\n\noverall score: 3/10", "timestamp_created": 1484331427, "timestamp_updated": 1484331427, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.310138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29226429": {"recommendationid": "29226429", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109803046", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 230, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482957086}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5f53\u521d\u770b\u4e86\u5c9a\u5c11\u5b9e\u51b5\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u81ea\u5df1\u518d\u73a9\u4e00\u904d\u53c8\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u611f\u89c9\uff0c\u611f\u89c9\u6709\u4e9b\u7ec6\u8282\u8fd8\u6709\u53d8\u5316(\u539f\u7248\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a????\naya\u771f\u662f\u4e00\u8def\u9ed1\u5230\u5e95\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1484322973, "timestamp_updated": 1484322973, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.643050", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29218433": {"recommendationid": "29218433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088419600", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 499, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488010254}, "language": "french", "review": "j'ai ador\u00e9e ! j'avais jamais fait le jeux au complet en 2014 et aujourd'hui enfin fini et j'ai vraiment ador\u00e9 ! je le conseille ! 10/10 \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1484290145, "timestamp_updated": 1484290145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29193093": {"recommendationid": "29193093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152114733", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 419, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484176297}, "language": "hungarian", "review": "Simply loved it!

However, this definitely isn't your normal family. Aya's father carries the title of a scientist, who works primarily on humans he picks off the street. He nurishes them, gains their trust, and soon tortures them to madness, killing them in the end. Later on, Aya's mother dies of sickness, and Aya is left with just her father and her assisstant. But the dread isn't over yet, for Aya's mother returns, and with a curse to boot. The curse turns Aya's mansion into a horror house filled with all the tortured souls of Father's experiements, back for revenge. Aya's mission is to save her father from her angered mother, no matter the danger.\nI truly enjoyed this game. The game basically tells you the beginning, then throws you in, saying, \"Go ahead, explore\". And the more you explore, the more you find out just what horrors your father's experiments contained. The puzzles are not hard, but do require some brain power to figure out. Plus, the game rewards you for exploring and wanting to know more on just what the hell happened to everything.\nThe game mainly focuses on exploration and puzzles. Whether it's finding the right tool in the nearby toilet, or trying to capture a cleaver-weilding madman while not getting your body diced, this game does a good job in being tense and puzzling.\nThe sprite art is well done, along with the music and sound design. Nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done.\nAll in all, I liked this game. If you like a good 4 hour horror game with a neat story, spooky interactions with experiments gone wrong, and good ol' fashioned puzzles, you may like this game too.", "timestamp_created": 1483819389, "timestamp_updated": 1483819389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29067516": {"recommendationid": "29067516", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063567687", "num_games_owned": 123, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485297689}, "language": "english", "review": "I played mad father long time ago before it was even released on steam.

The reason why I kept receiving suggestions of videos of Mad Father is most likely due to the fact that I did make an exception and watched a \"Let's play\" of a similar game called \"The Crooked Man\", though I never paid any attention to Mad Father the name of the game stuck with me, probably because it's quite easy to remember.\n\nAnyways, a few months ago I saw that the game was released on Steam and generous as I am when it comes to spending money on games I don't need and may never play for that matter, I decided to buy it since it was only $5 with an extra 10% off as a special launch price. I did intend on playing it when I first bought it, but the problem with owning as many games as I do is that I always scroll though my library looking for something to play but due to having so many options I usually just end up playing Rocket League or Team Fortress 2, so Mad Father quickly turned into just \"another\" game in my library. \n\nYesterday however I got around to installing and playing the game and I got to say that I am genuinely suprised of how much I actually enjoyed it.\n\nI got hooked on the game after only playing it for a couple of minutes thanks to the story of the game. In fact, I would like to take a moment to appreciate how original and unique the story felt and played out, it was twisted and disturbing least to say. It's quite rare that I get hooked on a games story, but this one really punched me in the face. The story develops amazingly during the 4-6 hours it takes to complete the game (If I were smarter and didn't have to look up Youtube videos explaining what to do all the time I'm sure I could have completed it way quicker). It's filled with twists and decisions which eventually leads to the 3 possible endings. Now while I would like to put on my tinfoil hat and bring up 50 different theories spinning around in my head after completing it, I think it's in everyone's interest that I keep this review spoiler free. \n\nThe game is, however, of course not for everyone. The gameplay can possibly  be considered dull by a lot of people if you're not into these types of games. But I strongly recommend you taking a couple of hours of your day to play this game from start to finish even if the gameplay may not suite you, because the story really was an experience not to turn your back on. \n\nBesides the fantastic story the game was very well designed, the artstyle and the level design really built an atmosphere that went hand-in-hand with the gameplay and really did a good job on capturing the sinister plot of the game. In fact, everything just simply worked together, the music, the illustrations, the sound effects, visual effects, the very limited voice acting and the writing itself.\n\nNow a lot of people are wondering if it's worth picking this one up for $5 considering the original version is completely free. As someone who's never played the original one I can't really compare the versions back to back, however, as I mentioned I did watch a few videos on Youtube to figure out how to progress in the game and I can say that this version simply does look way better in every aspect, but I guess that goes from one individual to another depending on what art-style you personally enjoy. But if anything by buying it you will support great indie developers who I think really outdid themselves on this one, and I really hope to see more games like this pop up on Steam in the future. There are most likely a few more differences between the versions, but I haven't really looked into it myself.\n\nTo sum things up, really well written and original story (especially for a originally free indie game) that is acompanied by great visuals and sound design. For $5 you really do get what you pay for, even more considering there are 3 endings with room for a sequel. If you're a horror fan like me (or not) I suggest you pick this one up and experience it yourself. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1483021822, "timestamp_updated": 1483021822, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.658468", "comment_count": "7", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28787130": {"recommendationid": "28787130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178435881", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496747190}, "language": "spanish", "review": "muy buen juego, algo corto pero no se puede quejar y le quedaria muy bien una segunda parte", "timestamp_created": 1483011648, "timestamp_updated": 1483011648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583911", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28785287": {"recommendationid": "28785287", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087813901", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 474, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485420255}, "language": "english", "review": "The description on its Steam page is actually you need to know before you start playing the game. The whole gameplay is just as interesting as my first impression of it when I first saw the title and the capsule art. It's so fun and immersive that I didn't even notice I've been playing this for over seven hours already.\n\nMad Father is about a crazy family. You play the role of Aya Drevis, a ten year old daughter of a mad scientist. Despite being aware of her father's inhumane hobby, Aya still loves and respects him. The story begins at midnight of her mother's death anniversary who, according to her father, died of an illness. While attempting to sleep, she heard her father scream for help, and she is determined to come to his rescue. However, the further she goes, the more she learns about her father's nature.\n\nThere's not much to say about the story. It is fairly straightforward and even predictable. That's not to say that the story wasn't good. In fact, knowing how it unfolds adds to the excitement because the gameplay is almost the story in and of itself. Every character is very likeable except the father, although the father still has a reasonable motive behind his actions. There's no other word to describe him other than 'Mad', which stays true to the title of the game. While the gameplay is a masterpiece, the selling point of this game is the art. I must say that it was what made me want to get this game in the first place, and it didn't let me down. The game was an eyecandy until the end despite the dark and gore theme. The music was also very ambient. I honestly did not notice the background music, and that's a good thing. That means it was a part of story.\n\nOverall, This is one of the games where the story, gameplay, art, and music all work together seamlessly. I enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it to everyone regardless of your taste in games.

Mad Father is one of the most beloved of the RPG horror \"series\" next to The Witchs House, Ib and Corpse Party. Im really glad that Sen brought the remastered edition to Steam. \n\nPros:\n-Story is beautifully written. What I like in a game is difficulty, story and well-developed characters. Mad Father has all of this. The story is both messed up and beautiful at the same time, and the ending is mind blowing, though I believe its up to  interpretation for the player. \n-Characters are the best. Aya is the perfect protagonist in a game such as this, Alfred is a pure psychopath, and I will never again trust any chick named Monika. This is the second horror game I have played that the crazy chick is called Monika. Never again. I loved Ogre, too, whom also appears in Misao. I wonder if this game ties into Misao in some way.\n-Graphics are amazing for an RPG horror. With the new edition, the character portraits have changed a lot, look a whole lot nicer, and I believe the sprites have too. Setting design has also been updated and looks wonderful! \n-Puzzles are interesting and not impossibly difficult, which was a cavil of mine with The Witchs House. \n-Actually scary, anxiety-inducing with exemplary sound design and background music. Atmosphere is perfect. \n\nMad Father is one of the best horror RPGs out there. This newer version is just as good as the old, though the graphics are much better. This is everything but a plain, anime visual novel RPG, something that bothers me when I try to introduce friends to these types of games. Mad Father is a wonderful experience.

I guess you could go to the translator's website and play basically the same game for free, but it's worth it to support Sen.\n\nPros about this game:\n*the translator, vgperson, does great work\n*it's a horror game with only a few jumpscares, and most of those are very mild\n*the music is quite lovely\n\nCons:\n*the sound design can be really annoying at times. Aya's scream in particular sounds more like somebody stole her cupcake and less like she got murdered by sentient dolls.  even when the scream was part of a cutscene, my sister would look up from across the room and say, did you die again?\n*there's a lot of backtracking. it's definitely not as bad as other games in the genre, but still enough to be tedious. ESPECIALLY if you want to get the good, \"true\" endings.\n*the father isn't really mad. he seems quite happy, in fact. and if you try to tell me he's \"mad\" in that he is insane, i'd have to say no, he really isn't. he has no mental illness. he is just an a**hole.\n", "timestamp_created": 1482823032, "timestamp_updated": 1482823032, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28697113": {"recommendationid": "28697113", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143729556", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482805395}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't usually play games like this, but I had a good time.

Northern Germany. The exterior is absolutely breathtaking, the interior decoration would bring happiness to whoever lives there. But there is sadness in this place. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the passing of Aya\u2019s mother. Before going to bed, she asked her father if he would celebrate and remember the good times they had together on the day of her death. After a positive response, she fell into a deep sleep until being awoken by terrible screams coming from the mansion basement. The basement is where her father is conducting unorthodox experiments!\n\nMad Father is an adventure/horror/puzzle game with a touch of Anime (cut scenes) where you play a young girl named Aya. She was very close to her mother and despite knowing (to a certain degree) that her dad was performing strange experiments in the basement, they vowed to each other to always support him no matter what happens. That night, the screams were so intense that she decided to check it out herself and in the process found out the true story of her mother\u2019s death.\n\nAs Aya explores this vast mansion, she will discover items by searching inside cabinets and wardrobes and around other furniture. Make sure she examines everything, everywhere. Also, she will collect gems. Some of them will appear when she successfully completes puzzles (they are not too difficult, to be honest) and others will be hidden within the mansion.  \nAya will meet interesting characters throughout this rich story but will also need to avoid some really scary people who will be chasing her; being caught is game over! So, if Aya happens to see a crow in a room, make sure she interacts with it to save her progress. The atmosphere of fear and of the unknown is great in Mad Father. On a couple of occasions, Aya will be caught, but she will be able to free herself with your help by pressing (using the arrows on your keyboard) as fast as possible the sequence which will appear on your screen.\n\nI really like the pixel artwork and the Anime aspect of the cut scenes. The soundtrack really embellishes the acute atmosphere the game portrays - just marvellous! Control-wise they are responsive. The story is very good and will offer a few different endings, which is great. \n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~ \n\n-\tGood pixel artwork\n-\tGood story \n-\tGood atmosphere\n-\tAchievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~  \n\n-\tThe game should have an option tab within the game menu\n\nI enjoyed Mad Father from start to finish!  If you like Pixel artwork, horror and puzzle games. Then give this game a try, its fun!\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

The art style (Alice in Wonderland-esque Lolita) almost put me off, but I\u2019m so very glad it didn\u2019t. If you are unsure about small, indie Wolf RPG maker games, please give this one a shot. \n\nThe gameplay is fairly simple, puzzle-adventure stuff but I stayed for the story. At first glance the plot is pretty basic and within a few minutes of playing you find yourself making certain predictions about the path the narrative will take. But that was part of the charm \u2013 the game reveals a lot of information to you early on, leaving you to explore the rest of the game with that knowledge hanging over your head. With the majority of the big reveals out of the way, you are then allowed to learn more about the characters, discover their deeper motivations and histories, including some careful clues about the protagonist you might miss. Even seemingly minor characters like Maria end up becoming a complex issue for the protagonist. \n\nThe story is quite linear however, there are not many choices to make. All of the endings can be unlocked from the final scene so there\u2019s no need to backtrack. The puzzles are easy, except for a few I found more difficult because my reflexes seize up when a murderous corpse-doll is running at me.\n\nBut what I really want to do is talk about the endings and the characters, so from here on out there will be \n\n[spoilers]\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\nThis is a story about victims of abuse, and how the women in the Mad Father\u2019s life use different strategies to survive in that kind of environment.\n\nSo let\u2019s start from the beginning.\n\nThe Mad Father himself, Alfred Drevis, was a troubled boy who enjoyed killing animals for fun. His first victim was his mother. In an argument over his proclivity for sadism, he stabs her and fawns over how beautiful she looks in death. Obsessed with creating an eternal beauty, he conducts experiments to turn human remains into dolls. Your typical creepy psychopath type, he is the most underdeveloped character \u2013 but that\u2019s okay. We don\u2019t need him to be developed, he may give the game its title but this story is not really about him. \n\nHe murders his way across Europe and in a small German village attempts to murder a local woman, Monika, but for an unknown reason is unable to. It\u2019s implied that she was exposed to horrific things growing up in her ex-cultist mansion, and that this has affected her view of affection. The religious cult sacrificed humans out of love for their deity, and when she was put in a similar position as a potential murder victim, she felt excited rather than afraid. This was how love looked like to her. She invited him to live with her in the mansion, and soon gave birth to Aya.\n\n(It\u2019s possible the father\u2019s experiments on the sacred cult ground was what summoned Mr Ogre in the first place)\n\nShe never showed sadistic traits herself, but she nurtures and cares for the sadistic traits in others. Hence Aya, the player controlled character, begins to show signs of cruelty. She kills cats. Her mother catches her a rat to play with, with the words \u201cI could have cried from delight. To think she enjoys it so. Perhaps she resembles her father in curiosity? I look forward to seeing her mature.\u201d Implying Aya did not treat the unfortunate rat well. Aya mistreats her pet rabbit Snowball, cutting its leg with a chainsaw and (as snowball is cloned whenever it gets hurt) judging by the number of dead Snowballs in jars, she has done it many times. She is all kept from the player, Aya even lies to her father and to the player at the same time when in her flashback she says she\u2019s worried about losing Snowball. It\u2019s only in the true ending when she is an adult is the player invited to put two and two together.\n\n(Adult Aya runs a small clinic in a forest, helping the poor get medical care for free. A young woman called Jean comes for treatment, and the two of them flirt heavily. Then Aya murders her. For me personally, having Aya grow up into a forest hermit lesbian serial killer is the best way this game could have ended.)\n\nAya is conflicted over her feelings for father\u2019s assistant Maria, who he is also sleeping with. At first the game implies Maria could be the one trying to hurt her, but it turns out she cares deeply for both Aya and Monika and regrets any bad blood that rises up between them. She was rescued off the streets by the doctor as a potential victim, but she proved to be a useful assistant. He has no strong feelings for her, but her position is tenuous. She has cultivated a strong attraction to him for self-preservation. If she doesn\u2019t like her job, she dies. So she likes her job. It is implied strongly at first that she could be a doll with her inhuman eyes, but this is a red herring. She may not be a physical doll but she is the complete puppet of the father.\n\nThe reveal at the end is that Monika was not really so jealous of Maria, and it was because the father wanted to turn Aya into his next doll that she put into motion the events of the story. And here\u2019s the interesting part: In no ending is it possible to prevent Aya becoming a doll. The secret ending makes that clear \u2013 father\u2019s work will go on, with or without Aya. she WILL be objectified, whether she likes it or not.\n\nWith this in mind all of the women, Aya, Maria, Monika, show different ways that people cope with abusive situations. This is also true of some of the test subjects like Ines, who was groomed to be Aya\u2019s big sister until the doctor got bored of her. All of them are complex, no-one fits perfectly into a box. None of them are \u2018evil\u2019. If you read them all as merely a sadistic child, evil maid and scorned wife then you\u2019re missing out. That\u2019s maybe what made this game stand out for me in the end, all these characters are human and the player is not invited to make sweeping judgements about them.\n\nThe Mad Father, however, is an easy villain to hate.\n", "timestamp_created": 1481372443, "timestamp_updated": 1481372443, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542555", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28282414": {"recommendationid": "28282414", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089299679", "num_games_owned": 5607, "num_reviews": 338, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481346098}, "language": "english", "review": "Certainlly go down as one of the best RPG maker game that has ever made!\n\nIntriging, twisted, charming, storyline with many twist and turns about crazy love and betrayle.\n\nEverything from this game was perfectly done with Great CG, Music, Arts and plot.

Now, this is coming from a person who typically avoids playing horror games but loves to watch others play them. I just love Mad Father so much I just freaked out when I saw there was a new remastered version on Steam.\n\nRight off the bat I noticed the game looks absolutely gorgeous. The artwork looks a lot cleaner and the sprite work looks much better than it ever did before (though the free version never looked bad either). I went and played this, got all achievements, and noticed just a few things added to the story though they were a very welcome touch. This Remastered version simply polishes up the game and makes it the game it was meant to be by adding the few things it lacked. This version also comes with an \"If\" ending that is really interesting and made for a satisfying conclusion to my playthrough.\n\nI absolutely recommend playing this game through the end and if you seem iffy on paying for it, the free version is always an option as it is still available, however this version supports the developers and in the end, provides a nice polished experience you won't get with the free version.\n\n[h1] A Few Things To Note: [/h1]\n\n[list]\n    [*] I completed this game in 5 hours\n    [*] As any horror game, it isn't for everyone\n    [*] You can only play this game in a small window, because of this, Steam notifications block a good part of the lower right of the game\n[/list]\n\n[b] 9/10\t[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1480893956, "timestamp_updated": 1480894009, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.499835", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28166407": {"recommendationid": "28166407", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121474820", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 300, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487765096}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game.

It is probably a little too easy for some (as someone who is terrible at adventure games, though, it's nice to have puzzles I can solve by myself) but is a lot easier and more player-friendly than The Witch's House, and has some neat little character moments (even if it relies a lot on flashbacks).

You will die and you will die a lot, but thats part of learning the levels and enemies, besides there are plenty of places to save your game manually and there is autosave too, so its not frustrating at all to play it.There are 3 different endings, with bonus cutscenes if you collect certain items, so its worth playing it at least twice.

So is it worth buying when you can play it for free? I'd say yes! While there weren't a lot of changes from the free version, they're at least big enough to be worth paying for. You can check the first update for the full list of changes, but basically most of the graphics were updated, new scenes were added and some aspects of the gameplay were changed.\n\nAs for the game itself, it\u2019s one of the better examples of its little sub-genre. The plot and characters aren\u2019t super complex, but they do have a B-movie charm to them. The art is well drawn, and its huge character portraits set it apart from similar games. The puzzles are clever without being too difficult. It\u2019s also an easy game to 100%, if you care about that.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s on the short side; completing it takes around 2 - 3 hours, maybe 4 if you decide to get all of the achievements. While the Steam version used to have a lot of bugs the publisher, Playsim, has been diligent about fixing them. My only major complaint is that some of the sound effects are too loud, such as Aya's scream when you get a game over, but according to the updates this might have been fixed? I wouldn't turn your sound up all the way just in case.\n\nOverall, [i]Mad Father[/i] is definitely worth playing if you like indie horror games. You should also play [i]Misao[/i], which is by the same creator, if you haven't already.

This developer has always impressed me with their ability to create interesting storylines that keep the player entertained.\n\nThe controls are simple, and gameplay is pretty straight-forward; there is nothing complex about it. The story and environment are why you want to play this game.\n\nNow, with this simple, remastered version, there are many improved elements. Among these are improved visuals, new puzzle styles (the \"correct sequence\" method, instead of \"button mashing\" when being attacked), and, of course, some great, new character development. Each ending is unique, and provides a plot twist to the storyline, including the \"If\" ending.\n\nJust like in the original version, you can unlock character art and tracks used in the game, which are always a nice little touch.\n\nTo put it simply, this game is a great buy.

Systems: Windows 8.1, Windows 10; loading issue has been solved\n\n[h1]The story of beauty[/h1]\n\nIt looks like a classic fighting RPG - attacking monsters and the cruel end boss. It's anything but. [b]Mad Father[/b] is a mystery game which tells the story of young Aya. A terrible curse has fallen on her father's mansion, creatures crawl through the halls, and ghosts hunt the weak. Knowing she needs to find a way past the atrocities, Aya goes on a difficult journey -- to save her father. \n\nEager to try this classic gem, I bought the game on Halloween 2016. The look of the graphics made me feel nostalgic, the game play looked like a challenge and the story appealed to me due to its gruesome theme. When do you get to play Frankenstein's daughter? Rarely. And for sure not in Anime-style. \nAs player, you control Aya with the classical arrow keys (keyboard). Your aim is finding and saving your father. While you solve the riddles in the mansion, you uncover more of the terrible details, and also about your own past. When you get caught by a monster, you'll end up smashing your buttons in order to escape its grasp, left, right, left, up, down, and I'm telling you, you need to be fast. \nThe game has become a collocation of quick time events and sneak scenes, while you need to figure out where to find and use your items. This leads to a refreshing gameplay and a rich story. For once, you're not the almost invincible main character, but a weak girl who will be left alone if you fail. Adding the multiple endings and the loveable characters, this game is a must have for every mystery/horror fan who is also into Anime.

That says a lot in itself, and the fact that me and my brother can play this and get scared every time we play (well at least I do) makes it the best for me. \n    Okay, now onto the emotional part. As you play you begin to learn more about each character, making you grow attached. Now this may seem bad, because they're fictional, but it helps you understand the game and in my case cry when something sad happens get mad when they get mad become happy for them when something good happens to them and feel like you are there to see it all happen and I mean like be there. With Aya, Monika, whatever the father's name is, Maria, Dio/Blonde Youth, Ogre, and all the experiments (such as Collina, Collina's mom, and Ines). \n    \n    For the artistic side of this game I have to say it is well done. Me being a big fan of anime and being an artist myself, the art draws my attention and everytime I see it I think \"The artist behind all of this is very gifted and talented.\" The music is also great. The music itself could probably tell a story and you wouldn't even have to play the game.\n\n    The backstory of the game is greate and grabs the player's attention very easily. When my brother suggested we play this as the next game we complete, he told me the whole story and I immediatley jumped up from my seat and said \"TAKE MY MONEY, JUST GET THE GAME!\" Now I know I sound childish but what do you expect from an otaku? I mean look at Akidearest, Misty/Chronexia, The Anime Man, and Lost Pause!\n\n    Overall I find this is a great game for anyone who is not weak hearted or is not big on the horror genra. I hope everybody else enjoys it as much as I have and I am glad that I decided to play it. \n\n(P.S. keep up the good work!)", "timestamp_created": 1479442087, "timestamp_updated": 1479442087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26630022": {"recommendationid": "26630022", "author": {"steamid": "76561198192235870", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 245, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478881761}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u65ad\u65ad\u7eed\u7eed\u7684\u4e5f\u662f\u628a\u72c2\u7236\u73a9\u5b8c\u4e86\uff0c\u8bf4\u5b9e\u8bdd\u8fd9\u6b21\u4e70\u4e5f\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8865\u4e2a\u8f66\u7968\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u753b\u9762\u7cbe\u81f4\u4e0d\u5c11\u8fd8\u662f\u5f88\u610f\u5916\u7684\u3002\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u8bdd\u73a9\u65e5\u6587\u8fd8\u662f\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u5b58\u6863\u574f\u6863\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u671b\u65e9\u65e5\u89e3\u51b3\u5427\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1479305642, "timestamp_updated": 1479305642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.581395", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26621245": {"recommendationid": "26621245", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216671163", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480110508}, "language": "german", "review": "Schade, dass das Spiel leider nicht starten wollte, obwohl mein PC alle Anforderungen erf\u00fcllt. \nEs soll wohl ein bekannter Bug sein, ich habe es dennoch zur\u00fcckgegeben.\nSobald der Bug behoben ist, werde ich es mir wahrscheinlich noch einmal holen - siche rbin ich mir noch nicht, denn es war schon sehr frustrierend.\nDennoch bekommt es von mir eine positive Bewertung, da ich das, was ich von dem Game bei anderen Spielern gesehen habe, sehr ansprechend und spannend fand.", "timestamp_created": 1479244465, "timestamp_updated": 1479244465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26597066": {"recommendationid": "26597066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087172956", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 175, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479115004}, "language": "english", "review": "I've known a little about Mad Father, so I knew about one particular ending from a mistake of reading some comments on an image of Aya.

I sat on this game for a while before playing it, and now that I have, I can honestly say I almost shed a tear. (somehow, I did not..)\n\nThis game is set in what I guess is a somewhat super-natural type settings, but isn't at the same time. You play as an eleven year-old girl, Aya Drevis. Her father is a mad scientist doing some questionable experiments until things go very, very wrong. It is your quest to save your father from death from some unknown force.\n\nAlthough the game looks dated, I actually find some charm in it as a retro gamer. The artwork is beautifully done and the puzzles actually do require a bit of time to figure out. What is missing though, in my personal opinion, is a bit more on the creepy music. That would set a more menacing tone in certain areas. However, by no means should that be a let-down. With what minimal voices there are (mainly Aya's and her father's), the sounds in general are interesting to say the least.\n\nIt is very short for a game, but it is well worth the $5. It is available for free, but the Steam version does have some extra benefits and a more updated engine if I'm not mistaken. With this in mind, I would highly recommend giving this game a go for those who do love a horror-mystery type of setting.\n\nNow my quest to 100% of the game.

Nuestro padre es un doctor obsesionado con hacer los experimentos mas extra\u00f1os en el laboratorio de su s\u00f3tano. Algo extra\u00f1o (m\u00e1s extra\u00f1o de lo que ya pasaba) nos har\u00e1 emprender la aventura de Aya -La protagonista. El padre de Aya realiza cosas tenebrosas, las cuales ella simplemente deja pasar por amor a su pap\u00e1, pero un d\u00eda algo pasar\u00eda. Una maldici\u00f3n vendr\u00eda como consecuencia de los actos del pap\u00e1 de Aya, la cual trae venganza y sangre a la mansi\u00f3n y hace que \u00e9l desaparezca misteriosamente en la casa, el amor a su padre hace que Aya emprenda una aventura en busca de su progenitor cueste lo que cueste.\n\nEn la mayor\u00eda de las veces logramos desmenuzar los sentimientos de los personajes gracias a sus recuerdos, ese lado que no conocemos de ellos nos es mostrado por medio de \u201cflashbacks\u201d a modo de recuerdos, tambi\u00e9n por medio de notas o diarios que leemos a lo largo del juego. La historia del juego es buen\u00edsima y tiene un guion interesante que te atrapa. \n\nPodemos decir que Aya es una ni\u00f1a dulce, que se preocupa por las personas que ama, y por nada en el mundo dejar\u00eda a su padre, le aterra quedarse sola, le encanta ayudar, incluso a los monstruos del juego o espectros que se topa se tomar\u00e1 la molestia de ayudarles para que puedan hallar su libertad. Conforme avanza el juego, miramos los recuerdos de Aya, conocemos momentos que le hicieron muy feliz, situaciones personales de la familia que marcaron el rumbo de la historia y dem\u00e1s situaciones de \u00edndole narrativo. \n\nEl juego es un t\u00edtulo independiente, que mezcla la aventura y el terror, con un poco de elementos de rompecabezas, habr\u00e1 veces donde deberemos encontrar objetos escondidos sin ninguna suerte de pista, pero tratar de encontrarlos es divertido. Tambi\u00e9n encontramos \u201cquick time events\u201d (o situaciones parecidas) y cuando somos atacados por un fantasma tenemos que presionar correctamente una serie de teclas para poder huir o dejar atr\u00e1s a nuestro atacante, si fallamos Aya muere. Mad Father tiene tres finales distintos que cambian seg\u00fan las acciones del jugador.\n\nEn lo t\u00e9cnico es donde viene el dolor de cabeza, algunos que otro bug nos har\u00e1 quedar pegados en las escaleras permitiendo que los monstruos nos ataquen, haci\u00e9ndonos perder tiempo y teniendo que reiniciar desde el ultimo guardado. Cuando morimos e intentamos cargar la partida, el juego se cierra el 70% de las veces, incluso al volver a abrir el juego y tratar de cargarlo, no podemos pues se cierra. Algunos lugares son nombrados con nombres incorrectos, por ejemplo el cuarto de Aya esta nombrado como \u201cnursery\u201d. buenos efectos como cuando pasamos sobre alg\u00fan vidrio o objeto en el suelo, oiremos ficho sonido, se encuentran bastantes lugares para guardar el progreso. \n\nLa m\u00fasica del juego le a\u00f1ade un sabor a misterio que nos sumerge en la trama, se nos plantean uno que otro juego de rompecabezas (pero muy sencillos), como por ejemplo, uno de los cuartos tenia una caja fuerte la cual no pod\u00eda abrir, m\u00e1s adelante en otro cuarto encontr\u00e9 una nota con la posible clave para abrir esa caja fuerte, pero para conseguir los cuatro d\u00edgitos que abr\u00edan la caja, deb\u00eda seguir las instrucciones de la nota: 1. cuantos barriles hab\u00eda en el cuarto de abarrotes, 2. cuantas mu\u00f1ecas rojas hay en el cuarto de mu\u00f1ecas, y asi hasta completar los 4 umeros que abr\u00edan la cada. esto le agrega un picante extra a la historia   que la verdad me sorprendi\u00f3. Recorrer varias veces los escenarios se vuelve la jugabilidad general y es importante prestar atenci\u00f3n para poder encontrar gemas y cosas ocultas. \n\nDurante la partida toparemos con personajes que nos har\u00e1n hacernos muchas preguntas, de donde vienen? quienes son? porque es tan metiche si nadie lo llam\u00f3? Pero conforme se vea adelantada la trama veremos poco a poco el motivo y raz\u00f3n de sus apariciones. Mad Father es distribuido por AGM PLAYISM y desarrollado por sen cuesta solo $4.99, siendo una ganga para lo que ofrece, y aunque los problemas con cierres de la aplicaci\u00f3n y problemas al cargar partidas son muy molestos, no es nada que un parche o dos puedan remediar. Un juego que da esa sensaci\u00f3n de seguirlo jugando para ver que es lo que pas\u00f3 con el papa de Aya, si logra rescatarlo o si al menos Aya logra salir con vida.", "timestamp_created": 1477152970, "timestamp_updated": 1479339389, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.455680", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26160393": {"recommendationid": "26160393", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999985244", "num_games_owned": 158, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477128655}, "language": "english", "review": "Watched a let play of the old version a long time ago really enjoyed it and when I saw it on steam I was excited that an improved version was made.

I never played the original, though. Apparently it's a cult classic of sorts.\n\nThe game is about Aya and her father, who live in a mansion in Germany. It becomes clear within the first ten minutes of the game that dear old Dad performs gruesome experiment on people. To what end isn't initially clear and I won't spoil why.\n\nSomething about this game just didn't do it for me, which is weird since I'm a big fan of messed up horror like this. But something about character motivations just seemed forced and out of place. For instance, Aya is an apparently kind eharted person, but insists on saving her father after the ghosts of his victims appear in the house and she witnesses the atrocities he's committed first hand. Like... really? Then there's a character named Ogre, who is meant to imply a larger force at work, but honestly comes across as a lame attempt to have an omniscient character.\n\nTo be honest, the story didn't do much for me, and neither did the True Ending, which kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. Everything just felt... bland, I guess would be the word for it.\n\nThe reason I'm still recommending it is that it's still a decent game to play around Halloween since it is genuinely creepy a lot of the time, and for the five dollar price tag, you could do a lot worse.", "timestamp_created": 1476844231, "timestamp_updated": 1476844231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26080555": {"recommendationid": "26080555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072163998", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477528306}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this mostly to just support the amazing dev, already played this a few years ago, and it's AMAZING. yuh. must. get. it.", "timestamp_created": 1476667801, "timestamp_updated": 1476667801, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.622024", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26069484": {"recommendationid": "26069484", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143530384", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476706713}, "language": "english", "review": "Great story, with nice soundtrack and ambience!", "timestamp_created": 1476624400, "timestamp_updated": 1476624400, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502618", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26054304": {"recommendationid": "26054304", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971429913", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 105, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502947911}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fun.", "timestamp_created": 1476557434, "timestamp_updated": 1476557434, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26027300": {"recommendationid": "26027300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236448382", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491121925}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc820\uc7a5... \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 \ud328\uce58\uac00 \uc2dc\uae09\ud558\ub2e4!!", "timestamp_created": 1476444243, "timestamp_updated": 1476444243, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635945", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26015621": {"recommendationid": "26015621", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047333285", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476222653}, "language": "english", "review": "Is and always will be one of my favs in horror game history! <3 I love the story, the gameplay, and with the steam release they added so much more than I could ever imagine to better the experience, totally get it. 100% recommended if you've played the game before the steam release!

First one is a bit of terror. The second one is sadness. Then the third one is. . . WAIT WHAT?!? \n\nThis game is filled with puzzles and obstacles which will sometimes get you stuck on certain parts of the game for a while until you manage to figure them out. This game also has a unique thing where you will sometimes get caught by a monster or whatever and you'll have to mash certain buttons together to get free. You might get stuck a few times at the start thanks to this but once you get a hang of it than it is fairly easy. \n\nIn terms of scares this game delivers them. There is a nice little mix of jumpscares and chases which I like. Also well on the topic of jumpscares. This games jumpscares aren't cheap ones.

It gave me so much Nostalgia solving the little puzzles and collecting all the gems, which I still knew the locations of (hehe).\nThe Steam version features an almost complete make over of the graphics and some new, additional content, which was very fun to play and made the little Mad Father-fan in me jump in circles. \nEven the little creeps and scares were brought back in this version, which I personally really liked.\n\nThe Goods:\n+New In-Game-Graphics, Art and better visual Quality\n+Good,simple and yet deep Story, which makes you theorise about it, even if you've already made it to the end.\n+The BGM choices were always well made(Like in the original),buuuuut...\n+Simple to solve Puzzles and finding hidden Gems\n+A dark Atmosphere\n+Horror elements, which make it even more enjoyable\n+3 Endings (2 Bad, 1 True Ending)\n+New Content! It has an extra new \"Ending\" which you can unlock by getting all the other Endings I think.\n+A lot of Nostalgia\n+Achievements and Trading Cards\n\nThe Bads:\n-Controls are actually fine, but the Stairway and in some other situations it was really difficult to walk on. The main character can get stuck sometimes. (The Stairway is really horrible, ugh)\n-The music sometimes - depending on the song -  is either too loud or too quiet, which can be annoying sometimes.\n-New Graphics kinda took away the overall darkness of the house/game.(It seems more bright)\n-The new Dialogue screen & Character pictures don't seem to fit into to game. I liked the old version's Interface better.\n-Very short sadly (Playtime for one ending with all Gems is about 2hr -2.5hr)\n\nIn my opinion it's totally worth buying and supporting the dev and team behind this. It's good they feature new content and it was very fun and nice to replay Mad Father.\n\nLet's wait for \"The Witch's House\" next, hehe :)", "timestamp_created": 1475179475, "timestamp_updated": 1475179808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25764660": {"recommendationid": "25764660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135063245", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482488756}, "language": "english", "review": "idk but steam version is better to me.. so just bought", "timestamp_created": 1475153127, "timestamp_updated": 1475153127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469799", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25762938": {"recommendationid": "25762938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195567047", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 382, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506058478}, "language": "english", "review": "make sure you dont get your mother to catch your dad cheating\n\nor else this can happen to you\n\n\nwould kill anything 10/30", "timestamp_created": 1475142814, "timestamp_updated": 1475142814, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25762390": {"recommendationid": "25762390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002988745", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479766604}, "language": "english", "review": "A story about little girl, her mad father and a curse.

I don't even read the article, I only saw the post's thumbnail and then checked it straight away on steam. As i begin scrolling the thumbnail on the steam page, I see a busty anime woman and a cute loli girl - something that a weeb like me totally dig. Oh and also, it's cheap so I bought it without any second thoughts.\n\nSo the first one hour of the game I got bored 'cause I hit a dead end and don't know where else to go. So I googled a bit about the game and to my surprise there is actually a free version of the game. To be honest, even though I already said it's cheap, I actually considered to refund the game and get the free version instead. But eventually I decided to give it another chance until I finally passed the 2 hours mark. At some point I finally got hooked up and I finished the game in one sitting.\n\nMoving on to the game itself, I think Mad Father is a pretty well made exploration horror game. While I don't play horror games much, I think most of the game mechanics are quite similar to the more popular survival horror games, e.g. the puzzle solving, jumpscares, and monster hide and seek. And it manages to do it well in 2D. Coupled with a decent level design and music, you have a pretty sweet $5 package for the gameplay alone. As for the story, it also manages to surprise me and exceed my expectations. The characters are pretty okay, there are some plot hole and obvious plot convinience but overall it's good. There are quite a bit of disturbing mysteries to discover, and it concludes to a mildly surprising climax. What I like the most are the endings, not only the ending themselves but how to get all of them. I was forced to replay the game from the beginning because I missed some of the prerequisites for a certain ending but I don't get mad at all, in fact I realized how much I liked this game after doing my second playthrough straight after finishing the first one.

Game) which originally released in 2012 (and was translated into English in 2013). This Steam release marks a rework of the game with an overall nicer layer of polish & some new content. I've only dabbled in the Steam release a bit at the time of writing to compare some early game differences, but I had played the game & gotten every ending back with the freeware version.\n\nI'll start off this review with a general review of the game itself, followed then a mention of some of the new content & early game differences.\n\n-----\nGENERAL REVIEW:\n-----\n\nThe game follows the story of Aya Drevis, a young 11-year old girl who lives in an expansive mansion with her father, Alfred, & their maid, Maria. Aya is aware that her father does somewhat cruel experiments with a chainsaw to people in their mansion basement, but she still loves her father all the same. She has seen his good traits and love he gives to her as his daughter. However, one night she awakens to some odd sounds, & finds shambling corpses and other strange beings wandering the mansion with murderous intent. A curse has been put upon the mansion from the countless people Aya's father has slaughtered, & now the dead walk among them seeking revenge on the Drevis family. The only way to escape now & save your dad is to lay these spirits to rest, either through forgiveness or force.\n\nMad Father gained a strong cult following for good reason, it has a number of creative & interesting varied scenarios despite its simple nature, ranging from puzzles, to light stealth, story, exploration, minigames, & backed with good gothic atmosphere with just a hint of the fantastical. While the main setting of the game is a Mansion, you quickly begin to descend in it, finding surreal labyrinths with intricate detail & interesting elements to each room. Some play a role in gameplay, others are simply interesting to look at. As you explore you'll come to face a number of challenges & entities who want you and your dad dead. You must find a way to put the spirits at rest, & make your way to your father deep in his underground labs. Along the way there is a colorful cast of odd characters you learn more about, & a number of side-quests off the beaten path you can partake in (they're optional to complete the game, but needed to get the true ending, though of note is the whole mansion is explorable even at the end of the game, you can go all the way back to the starting room of the game from the final room of the game). \n\nWhile the story isn't surprising, it is well-told and full of charisma. Aya is a likable protagonist and her relationship with her twisted father is interesting, & the members of the core cast and their interconnecting relationships are just as interesting (if not more so). The journey is engaging all the way through if you're into these 2D RPG-Horrors, & will easily give you a good 3-6 hours of playtime (depending on how much you explore, how many endings you go for, do 'optional' stuff or not, etc). It has a charm to it simply due to its tone, a mixture of a Victorian-styled setting & characters combined with a more modern twisted sci-fi mad scientist doctor via our father and the gruesome undead experiments of his, forging a sort of scientifically twisted vs supernaturally malicious scenario. It's an interesting contrast that creeps its way into various aspects of the game I just find wholly fascinating.\n\nI will mention while the game has some good atmosphere, it isn't all that scary, nor is it trying to be. There is the occasional moment or scene, but the game aims more to unsettle you as a mood-piece with a central interconnected narrative and attract you with elements of intrigue, abstractness, & feeling to set a tone than to startle or even shock you. This said, some of the scenes are rather tense and creepy.\n\nIf you're into the scene of 2D Horror games that came from the like of Wolf Editor and RPG Maker, this one is definitely worth checking out if you haven't before.\n\n-----\nFOR THOSE WHO'VE PLAYED BEFORE:\n-----\n\nBut then for those who have played it before, you may ask yourselves, \"What's new here? What makes this worth $5 compared to the previously free version?\"\n\nThe first thing you'll probably notice as you play is the graphics have been updated in almost every room of the game. Some rooms have been changed drastically with completely new layouts & details; they hardly resemble the rooms from the original. Others just have nice new touches that help bring them more alive & add character. In the mansion at the beginning there wasn't a room I encountered that hadn't seen some sort of overhaul, and the touches look very nice! Along with the new spritework, there is also a few new pictures that pop up during cutscenes to give more life to them & the previous pictures have been revamped to look much nicer. Also has new enemy sprites, better sprite animation & details, more detailed death scenes, & other touch-ups.\n\nFor an example of the graphical difference, here's a comparison of Aya's Room: \n\nAya's Room (Original Game): \nhttps://66.media.tumblr.com/c0a14bb4150eed0064df5b8652e6b1e3/tumblr_ody8hvPxRt1se6ntfo2_400.png\n\nAya's Room (Steam Release): \nhttps://67.media.tumblr.com/49e7dac7f473ffb5719a3391c9712f5e/tumblr_ody8hvPxRt1se6ntfo1_400.png\n\nAnd so far, most rooms have been drastically redone like this.\n\nThe game had to get rid of things it couldn't use for commercially, with the element that stands out the most being the music. Most of the original OST is present, but there are a few new original music tracks in this version of Mad Father in-place of the few unusable songs they had. I've only heard a couple new songs thus far, but I like them! They fit the game nicely & don't feel out of place. I may even like them more than the originals.\n\nThe game also has some new ease of use elements. Aya now will have exclamations pop over her head when near things she can interact with or investigate. Items glitter now to stand-out, so you don't have to observe everything just to find key items hidden in shelves or the like, & the hit-detection feels much better & smoother than before. The UI/Menu is completely reworked, & the QTEs the game previously had have a new gameplay style where instead of rapidly pressing a button, you now must press a series of buttons before time runs out (with an improved UI element as well).\n\nWhile I can't speak in full length as I haven't quite beaten the new version of the game, there are some new dialogue & scenes in the game. There is some changes to the layout of the locations as I said before, some new areas as a result. The dev has also said there's some new optional side-stories to uncover, new scenes, & some of the gems have been relocated. \n\nThere's also a new \"IF\" option on the title screen, which is unlocked once you get the True Ending (not sure what it is, tho).\n\nGame also comes with the Steam features of Trading Cards & achievements (which there's a 27 of).\n\nSome may not find the new all that new, but it's made revisiting this game a joy for me so far, and as I loved the original I don't mind putting down some money for a revamped version with some new paint & some additional content to support future endeavors.\n\n-----\nOVERALL:\n-----\n\nWhile some may want to stick to the free version for its 'freeness', I think this version of Mad Father is an overall improvement which will be the best way to experience the game for either new players or fans of the original. Maybe not the huge expansion some may have hoped for, but the much more detailed & realized world along with the various additions, changes, & fixes all feel in-line with the vision of the original game while in my opinion steadily improving on it. Mad Father had a cult audience & will find new fans. If these type of games interest you, I do think is wholly worth checking out.", "timestamp_created": 1474619753, "timestamp_updated": 1474667462, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 156, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881398", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25647025": {"recommendationid": "25647025", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141236720", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474624263}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u963f\u96c5\u548c\u89e3\u4f53\u65b0\u4e66\u597d\u8bc4\uff01\n[spoiler]\u652f\u6301\u963f\u96c5\u548c\u739b\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u767e\u5408\u7ed3\u5c40\uff01[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1474617984, "timestamp_updated": 1474623315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25646758": {"recommendationid": "25646758", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096632451", "num_games_owned": 8047, "num_reviews": 156, "playtime_forever": 214, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474771809}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6ce8\u610f\uff01\uff01\u6ce8\u610f\uff01\uff01\nF12\u4e3a\u91cd\u7f6e\u6e38\u620f\n\u6240\u4ee5\u8bf7\u52ff\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528F12\u622a\u56fe\uff01\uff01\n\n\u8001\u7248\u753b\u9762\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768330762\n\u65b0\u7248\u753b\u9762\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768344398\n\u533a\u522b\u8c8c\u4f3c\u86ee\u5927\n\n\u54e6\u54e6\u54e6\u3001\u72c2\u7236\n\u6709\u5361\u624d18\u3001\u800c\u4e14\u5361\u4e5f\u53ea\u6709\u4e94\u5f20\u3001\u8865\u5145\u53051200\u3001\u4e5f\u7b97\u53ef\u4ee5\n\u826f\u5fc3sen\n\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768330593\n\u5b9e\u6d4b\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u4e1d\u7eee\u62c9\u7684\u6c49\u5316\u3001\u4e0b\u8f7d\u89e3\u538b\u540e\u5168\u90e8\u8986\u76d6Steam\u7248\u672c\u5373\u53ef\nhttp://sycrealastudio.lofter.com/post/1c580c_86cc6d7\n\u53ef\u8dd1\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6389\u5361\uff09\u3001\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u9501\u6210\u5c31\n\u540c\u65f6\u56e0\u4e3a\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u6539\u8fdb\u753b\u9762\u3001\u8001\u7248\u672c\u5168\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u8bdd\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f53\u9a8c\u65b0\u7248\u753b\u9762\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u5148\u7528\u6c49\u5316\u8dd1\u904d\u5267\u60c5\u3001\u7136\u540e\u518d\u8fc7\u8fb9\u65e5\u6587(\u82f1\u6587)\u65b0\u7248\u753b\u9762\uff1f2333\n\n\n\u5efa\u8bae\u5f00\u59cb\u524d\u5148\u201c\u542f\u52a8\u914d\u7f6e\u5de5\u5177\u201d\u6539\u6210\u7a97\u53e3\u5316\n\n\n\u53e6\uff1a\nPLAYISM\u5b98\u7f51\u4e5f\u53d1\u552e\u4e86\u3001\u76ee\u524d\u6298\u6263\u4ef7448\u5186\u3001\u5408\u4eba\u6c11\u5e01\u4e0d\u523030\n\u5305\u542bSteamKey\u4ee5\u53ca\u514dDRM\u7248\u672c\u3001\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u514dDRM\u7248\u672c\u7684\u8bdd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6765\u4e70\u8fd9\u4e2a\nhttp://playism.jp/game/464/mad-father", "timestamp_created": 1474615698, "timestamp_updated": 1474622381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765027", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39401722": {"recommendationid": "39401722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198394605097", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 255, "last_played": 1516207005}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "6 anos dps e ainda amo esse jogo", "timestamp_created": 1516146387, "timestamp_updated": 1516146387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39399911": {"recommendationid": "39399911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258083196", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 740, "last_played": 1516133788}, "language": "english", "review": "after beating it 6 times.. you still want to play it again and again", "timestamp_created": 1516139376, "timestamp_updated": 1516139376, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39379053": {"recommendationid": "39379053", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999162473", "num_games_owned": 312, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 215, "last_played": 1515841693}, "language": "english", "review": "Mad Father is one of hundreds of avaible RPG Maker-esc, stylized horror adventure games you can find from that programming platform. It tells the story of a young girl, attempting to save her Father from supernatural forces, while learning the turth behind her Mother and Father along the way.\n\nAs far as game mechanics go, this game really doesn't break any new ground. It's mostly like a visual novel with a few puzzles and chase scenes scattered about the game. The puzzles generally make sense, but there was one or two that were fairly vauge that required me to look up help from a guide. \n\nThe writing is alright, but honestly, you can see the story from a mile away, almost from the start of when you first begin playing. There's multiple endings, but they aren't very satisfying. There's questions the game ultimately don't answer. Some would say this leaves the players \"something to chew on\". I just find it lazy writing and a refusal to answer all the necessary questions of the story.\n\nI think with better, more polished game mechanics, better vocal work and a better laid out story, I'd have been more happy with it. As it were, it's not a bad game and I'm not mad I bought it, but I kind of feel like this is a $0.99 game at best.\n\nCan I recommend this game? If this kind of game is your jam, you'll love it.

It tasks you with saving your deranged father from the horrors he himself created. \n\nPros\n+A surprisingly in-depth and gripping storyline. Characters are varied and well developed\n+Both the mandatory puzzles and the optional puzzles to obtain collectables reward the player for quick thinking and paying attention to their surroundings. Fair and sensible solutions keep the game from feeling cheap\n+Multiple endings, and each ending has branching paths on top of that\n+Frequent save points; not once did I ever have to backtrack when I wanted to save\n+Many CGs\n+Varied soundtrack with many memorable pieces\n+Great price for the amount of content, even when full priced\n\nCons\n-The game is not scary. Those who are looking for a mortifying horror experience will not find it here. The game is, however, as disturbing as it should be, and does not disappoint in that category. \n-The later parts of the game have many instant death events that can easily become frustrating\n-One of the beginning areas has two enemies that chase you, which should be trivial to avoid, but tile glitching on the stairs makes it extremely easy to get pinned into the wall and die\n\nFull price or no, any horror game or RPG Maker game fan owes it to themselves to give Mad Father a try. Its creativity in storytelling, characters, and puzzles is both memorable and highly enjoyable!

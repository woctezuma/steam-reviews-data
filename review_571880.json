The art style is just a facade, the story is very interesting, and you legitimately get interested in all of the characters. Some of the extreme things that occur do not feel just for the sake of it, but they help the story. One of the best parts about this game is the characters act realistic. What you say and how they react are based on reality. For example, if you try to awkwardly hit on someone, they will awkwardly try to leave.\n\nThe music really helps keep interest, it's very nice and calming to listen to. It goes well with the long text that can occur.\n\nSome things that I don't like are the actions towards the end of any of the paths. They feel very limiting compared to the previous sections. You can see plenty of other options, but there are no prompts to be seen. Your character starts to say things that are not what you would have wanted them to say/do, e.g towards the end with Adine's chapter.

[b][u]It's more focused to be a story-rich visual novel[/u][/b] than it is a dating simulator. Don't get me wrong though, the elements are still there, all I'm saying is it doesn't seem like that's the main focus. Only 3 of the 5 main dragons are actually \"dateable\" (make it 4 if you download that mod for Adine). [spoiler]Bryce and Anna are really the only dragons with \"scenes\". Safe for work by the way, though Bryce's might be questionable...[/spoiler]\n\nEach of the 5 dragons have unique personalities and interests that set them apart from one another. Some of the choices you make with them might also affect others though, as well as the ending of your playthrough, obviously. [u]New and different choices become available after you recieve your first ending.[/u]\n\n[u]The story [b]starts off[/b] easy to understand.[/u] You and your partner, Reza, on a simple trade mission until shit hits the fan and you gotta find out where he went and who's been murdering dragons. [u]Most of the game is spent interacting with other dragons and just wandering about, while the rest is aiding with the police investigation and proceeding with the story.[/u] Items you find or obtain throughout the game [i]may[/i] determine which ending you'll get.\n\nThe confusing part of the story (at least for me), would be later in the game where the true functions of the portal are explained. This'll tie in with how the replayability works in the game story-wise, but I won't speak about it here. I found a much better understanding towards the completion of my first ending.\n\n[h1]The Review:[/h1]\nThe game was a lot more than I expected it to be. [u]The story is rich and character interaction and conversations were smooth and realistic[/u]; it didn't feel generic, or written by a 14 year-old. The game in its entirety is very well-made, and [u]its plenty of endings (especially the bad ones) left me emotionally devastated. The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous and wonderful to listen to while playing the game.[/u] I especially love the freedom in the choices you're able to make in the game. For example, [spoiler]being a complete cuck towards all the 5 dragons and refusing to help the police investigation gives a unique \"evil\" ending.[/spoiler]\n\nDefinitely one of the best indie games I've ever played.

It's pretty darn good.\n\n[b]Loooong version:[/b]\nOne of the first things that stand out upon starting the game are its outlandish premise and slightly-subpar visuals. Don't get me wrong, most of the actual dedicated CGs and completion art is absolutely fantastic, but the standard character portraits are kind of lacking in comparison, which, coupled with the premise of the story may seem a little unpolished and be a turnoff for some. (Though, of course, the basis of dating dragons is also the main enticement of the game!) \n\nHowever, the actual story itself more than makes up for these minor issues; it is an experience that not only tugs at the heartstrings but leaves the player thinking. The pacing and wording suffer from a modest amount of discomfort here and there, but the main humour, drama, and plot devices (as well as the \"romance\" sections) are blended together in a pleasing and familiar manner. There are much less dating-sim elements present in the game than the store page would have you believe (and a lot more drama instead); most of the possible romance scenes seem like natural extensions of the main storyline and serve to further worldbuilding and character development. In the same vein, the aforementioned scenes do not include any of the explicit \"romance-reward\" scenes one would expect to find in a run of the mill dating sim. Well, most of the romance options don't. (The ones that do are totally worth it, though.)\n\nNot much else can be said about the storyline without potentially spoiling anything, so I will simply take the liberty of saying that it is, in short, really good. The emotion embedded in the plot, though not the absolute pinnacle of tragedy, is definitively touching and invested, and it is bested only by the drama and turmoil of the sci-fi elements of the plot. Oh, and of course, there are several secrets to be found as well, not just in the story, but also elswhere...\n\nTo conclude, if you are a dedicated fan of visual novels (or dragons), I would highly recommend picking up Angels with Scaly Wings. However, if you're looking for something romantically-focused, or a light, happy dating sim, this is not the VN for you. General playtime is around 10-15 hours, or a lot more, depending on how generously the player uses the skip function.\n\nP.S.

I dunno take your pick. Either way, you'll be going through a seemingly straightforward and simple storyline while getting to know these colorful dragons, and doing little mini games in between! Easy, right?\n\nWell...no. You eventually learn that this game is more than what it appears to be, and replay value just got a LOT higher at that point. Welcome to the game.\n\n[b][Opinion][/b]\n\nAs a person who likes dragons, this was kind of an easy choice. It's not always that a game has dragons as main characters, the game looks good as an indie, and that trailer got me convinced it's not just another easy, cash-grab dating sim visual novel. This was a first for me since I don't recall playing a visual novel before (maybe they just weren't memorable). I was a bit skeptical about the price at first glance, but now I do believe it's at least worth its regular price, if not a bit more.\n\nWhen I first got into the game I could not imagine how the game would go beyond 5 hours (except from getting tired of reading). A short while later after my first playthrough, I realized I was in for a long, long ride.\nWith 35 hours on record and the game 100% through. I'd love to detail the experience of the game, but its an emotional roller coaster that I think (and recommend) is best you experience yourself.\n\n[b][The Good, The Bad, and The Meh][/b]\n\nTHE GOOD: The dragons. The characters are diverse, well made, and in many points, relatable. The storyline is rich, and (from what I pretty much tried) solid. It evokes emotion, and invites you to keep learning about the big picture. The interface itself is very conveniently made to make the experience faster and less of a hassle. Overall the game is good!\n\nTHE BAD: It's not for a lot of people. It's wordy, like I guess it should be, but there are a few parts where you get lost in a wall of text with explanation or just plain heavy conversational rant. The art isn't very consistent (mostly on the 'cutscenes'). May or may not cause certain negative feels. \n\nTHE MEH: The quote \u201cThe selling point of this game is to bone/get boned by a dragon.\u201d is not wrong, but I don't think it'd be a a reason to not play the game. Yes there are scenes where it [i]implies[/i] such, but there are also platonic options. Few default character emotions used don't perfectly match the situation. The music isn't like mega overwhelming but its alright and suits its respective scene. I guess I'd wish there's more detailed stuff (more backstory/interaction) for the main characters.\n\n[b][The Verdict a.k.a. TL;DR][/b]\nIf you're put-off by lots of reading or just prefer something more animated, this is not for you.\nOtherwise, If you're looking for dragons, a cool storyline, playing indie games with decent quality, or maybe a combination of those, then look no further!\nDespite its flaws, I strongly believe it's a good game worth the time.\n\nP.S.

This game makes me wish I could have spent more money for it. 13/10)\n[b]*LONG REVIEW*[/b]\n\nI never thought I'd write a review on a Steam game but this game forced me to change my mind.\n\nI've had this game floating around on my wishlist for quite some time and only just convinced myself to buy it a few days ago as I had a lot of free time and wanted to have a laugh, I expected this game to be nothing but a joke when I started it up. \n\nFor my first half an hour playing I was just trying to find every little thing wrong with the game I could to laugh at and make me think of how I had just wasted $15 on something I didn't enjoy.\nAlthough after not being very successful for the first half an hour, I finally thought to relax and just go along for the ride, even if it was bad.\n\nAnd boy does that feel like the best choice I have made [i]in my [b]life[/b][/i].\nWhat started as a joke had just turned in to probably one of the best experiences I have ever had.\n\nThe first thing I noticed about the game is the dialogue. I expected nothing but minor choices and no real consequences for what I chose in the conversations, although I quickly came to realise that really wasn't the case. The choices aren't streamlined to a certain attitude which allows you to experience a different kind of story depending on how you wish for it to go, which provides a very immersive experience.\n\nAnd then I focused on the art, at first the art seemed quite unappealing to me, although as I kept playing I grew more and more fond of it. The characters design matches the way they act and even though the art is quite basic, the various poses the characters take really gives the text more life and feeling. Along with the background art being very detailed and pleasant.\n\nThe next thing I noticed was the music, which would have to be my favourite thing about the game. Although it didn't jump out at me at first, when I focused on it a little more it was amazing to listen to throughout the game, and even after finishing the game having bought the Digital Deluxe Edition. Almost all of the music suited the scenarios flawlessly and amplified emotion of the scenes really well.\n\nFinally came the story. \nOh my gosh the story. \nIf you thought I had already preached too much about this game go grab a bucket of popcorn and a drink because the story was [i]amazing[/i].\n\nWhen I first purchased this game, I expected a linear, boring plotline riddled with stereotypes and monotony. What I found through playing the game was that I found it extremely hard to take my conscious thought away from the story and felt personally invested on learning all the ins and outs of the plot. The variation of story throughout different playthroughs and different choices amazed me.\nI ended up feeling like every choice I made mattered and replayed a lot to get every ending (Which the game encourages and now I do too.)\nThe ability to choose between the skip option skipping everything or just text you've already seen makes playing every ending very enjoyable as each time around you only have to see what you want of the story, along with what you haven't seen before.\n\n\nI enjoyed almost every aspect of this game and plan on playing it to completion at least once a year.\n\nThe aspect of this game I didn't enjoy was the end, only because I knew it was over and wished I could learn even more about the characters and the story.\n\nI'm overjoyed with my purchase of this amazing game and I cannot stress enough that even if you feel the slightest urge to buy and play this game, even as a joke, buy a copy when you can. You might just be amazed with what you find.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1509039381, "timestamp_updated": 1509039381, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517103", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36003606": {"recommendationid": "36003606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329438328", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509166384}, "language": "english", "review": "Angels with Scaly Wings is a game where your choices affect just about everything around you (to some degree that is). I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but I thought it was good. The music is pretty good, I think it fits nicely with the game. The art style is very nice as well, and I liked the character designs. Speaking of the characters, I thought the main five dragons were interesting enough. Bryce is my favorite with Remy being second. However, I was disappointed by how short the game was. Sure there are multipile endings to see, but (spoilers) there are only five chapters in the game. I wish it went on longer than that. It feels like there could have been more drama, action and character devolpment. But maybe I'm being too harsh. What I can say that I didn't like was how your choices really don't feel all that impactful other than it affecting how others treat you. I mean yes it does also affect the story, but some choices in the game really don't matter at all. Like during the investigation scenes, it really doesn't matter how much you screw up. I wish there were more consequences for your actions. And honestly, there feels like some lost potential with a few characters as well. There's one character named Emera who is quite mean towards Remy (one of the main dragons) and she never apolgizes for her behaviour. It would have been nice if she felt bad and said she was sorry to Remy. And then there's Kevin. Now even though he has the best design in the game, he's kind of boring to an extent. There's not much going for him other than the typical college guy attitude he has. All you do is talk about college and it's pretty much the same in the dragon world as it is in the human world. And yes I do kind of understand why that might be, but I still think that there should have been some differences. Being in a world full of dragons means that there should at least be some differences in how they go about things. Remy for instance asks about your hair which he presumes to be fur, while Bryce asks about your tail and clothes. This shows that dragons don't know much about human attire or fashion. It just feels a bit of a shame that the dragons don't feel all that unique when compared to humans. Sometimes they just feel like they could be humans dressed as dragons. Maybe make it so they are more feral and they do things differently than humans do. That's just me though. Anyways I hope that helps. Again, I wouldn't recommend this game to everybody, but it is worth a try at least. Despite what I said, it's not a bad game. It feels like it had effort put into it.

I don\u2019t want to spoil much of the story, so I\u2019ll just start with saying that it\u2019s broken down into 5 chapters, and in each chapter you can make a phone call to one of the 5 main dragons to meet with for \u201c\u201d\u201ddates\u201d\u201d\u201d. I say it like this because AWSW really didn\u2019t feel like a dating sim at all, it is MUCH more of a sci-fi/fantasy story with dragon dating on the sidelines. There is plenty of light humor and antics throughout with your dragon friends, but the overall mood outside of dates could be surprisingly somber and even unsettling.\n\nBefore I get to the best parts I\u2019ll cover the absolute worst: the pathways and endings. Here\u2019s the problem \u2013 they are extremely repetitive. Each time you do a playthrough to date a different dragon and get a different ending, most of what you see outside of the 1-on-1 date scenes is the same or very similar to your previous playthroughs.\n \nBut the biggest disappointment is that the endings are also too similar. Every dragon has a good and bad end, and each good end is almost the same as the counterpart bad end. I\u2019m gonna need an example here so SPOILER: [spoiler] In Adine\u2019s good end you give her the map that lets her sneak up behind Reza in the building. I expected you, the main player, to go with Adine, exploring the ruins, maybe finding some interesting relics that hint about the story\u2019s big secret of the dragons\u2019 past, and then ambush Reza together. But no, you hear the fireworks, rush to the building, and have almost the exact same talk with Reza as every bad end before Adine pops up to help you. [/spoiler] This is a huge problem I had, even though I didn\u2019t mind going through the same parts of the game again because they were enjoyable to read. Even the True Ending was disappointing, although now that I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about it I like it more than I did originally.\n\nOkay now for the good parts. The 5 main dragons are pretty well done. They are: Remy, Bryce, Lorem, Anna, and Adine. \nAdine is my favorite. She\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite! \nAnd for good reason, her story is so cute and memorable and that [spoiler] beach flying and fishing and sandcastle building [/spoiler] scene is so damn adorable I want to play it over again. I liked Lorem\u2019s story second most because of the adventure you go on with him and talking with Ipsum back in the apartment. Bryce\u2019s scenes were fun but my least favorite of the 5. Remy\u2019s story is pretty sad but he wasn't my favorite character either.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Anna. Even with her unpredictable bouts of anger and that creepy look in her eyes, she shouldn't seem eerie, but in several scenes she really is.\n\nBryce has one of the funniest and most suggestive scenes [spoiler] holy wine bottle batman [/spoiler], and Anna has a very suggestive scene too, so, [b]promised dragon innuendo \u2013 check[/b]. Adine has one scene that would normally be very sexual in any show/movie/game  [b]shower scene[/b] but in here somehow it wasn\u2019t. This scene is much more cute and amusing than anything else (but that\u2019s just how I saw it, not sure about other people).\n\nThe side dragons can have very fun and colorful scenes - I loved Sebastian and Zhong especially. I do wish some of the other characters had had more screen time [spoiler] Vera, Amely [/spoiler].\n\nAs I mentioned, AWSW\u2019s sci-fi elements, while messy (especially the endings) are more of the game\u2019s main focus than the dating. There\u2019s an underlying mystery going on that is explained well enough by the end, and it\u2019s a cool concept about dragons and humankind I\u2019ll never forget. Your interactions with each dragon lets you learn more about their past and current problems, and this scaly world is really brought to life when you exchange descriptions of customs, places, behaviors, etc. with them. The dragons he selves are most unique in their behaviors and beliefs, though they can have generic traits (Bryce is tough guy cop etc.)\n\nThe dialogue in this game is pretty well done, and there are only a few spelling and grammar mistakes throughout. Banter can be awkard at times, but I've never played a visual novel where this wasn't the case. \nIt is easy enough to connect with the dragons and choose the options that\u2019ll make them laugh (except Anna), and the text usually has well detailed descriptions of your actions and surroundings.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, can be inconsistent. I like all 5 main dragon designs (especially Adine <3) and the backgrounds, while mostly generic, fit each mood and environment. Most of the game is colorful and bright and it adds a lot of life to the dragon\u2019s world.\n\nThe music is good too, and [b]VERY[/b] memorable.\n\nFor the most surprising and possibly best part of the game - I had gotten every achievement and every ending and thought: Well that\u2019s the end right?\n\nSPOILER: [spoiler] There\u2019s a secret ending, and it turns the game from a relatively normal story to one of the best 4th wall breaks I\u2019ve ever seen. As someone who loves this type of thing and didn\u2019t expect it at all in AWSW, I had to figure out the secret \u2018total ending\u2019 at all costs. [/spoiler] This thing came completely out of left field and it was perfect - eerie, mysterious, worrying, cryptic. The only other time a game has engrossed me with such 4th wall breaks is, dare I say it, Undertale. Some of it remains cryptic and interesting still [spoiler] All those image files\u2026? And who is Marcus? [/spoiler]\n\n\nWell, right now I\u2019m listening to the game\u2019s OST, and all I can sum this review up with is that AWSW is unforgettable, despite its flaws. The [b]ONLY[/b] 2 visual novels I would personally recommend are 999 and this one \u2013 Angels With Scaly Wings.\n\nThis type of game would probably be best if you really like dragons and/or are a furry, since that seems to be the target audience, but others might like it too, I dunno.\n\nI may have been disappointed at the endings, but I forgot how enjoyable AWSW was. That sounds real stupid for a game described as a \u2018dragon dating sim\u2019, but that label doesn\u2019t do it justice. What a long mess of a review! This game is still hard to describe right - it remains strange and wonderful to this day.\n\nPS: Apparently there\u2019s a word limit for reviews, and I just hit it.

Every ending up to the True Ending, 15 hours and all. It was true pain to watch everyone suffer so much, and so many times, before finally getting to the true, happy ending that they all deserve.\n\nIt was a hell of a depressing (but fulfilling) experience, each character has their own stories and motivations, and the game looks much more tragic if you begin to think about choices you DON'T make - characters making lethal mistakes because of you not being there to stop or help them.\n\nNow, onto the actual review I suppose.\n\nAs one of the other reviews said: this isn't EXACTLY a mystery game; more of a puzzle game meets dating sim, if anything else. As you do more and more playthroughs and aim for more and more endings, the pieces start to come together. Some characters have secrets that pertain to other characters, meaning to save everyone, you'll have to get to know everyone. You may even get a few bad endings in the process - I was lucky and only got one, but I was rather emotionally invested at that point. One was one too many. Even some of the 'good' endings just felt...too bittersweet, too painful. Some were better outcome-wise than others, but the True ending is where it's at. To see that, however, you have to live with your consequences up until then, and do what you think is right. You CAN save everyone, just....not at first. That's something I wasn't used to, as I'd gotten the true pacifist ending in Undertale my very first time playing. Here, you have no choice but to press on past your mistakes.\n\nMany choices and the knowledge you obtain from them persist between playthroughs, letting you (and them) make better choices and avoid unpleasant fates for yourself and others - if you save them one, you save them every time, with a very few unavoidable situations. Plus, there's a few skip functions allowing you to bypass minor dialogue you've already seen before - hence why it only took me 15 hours to reach the true ending, opposed to a few more.\n\nThis game was jsut utter magic to me - getting the soundtrack from the digital deluxe version was well worth it. 94 different songs in the game - some of them credits themes, yes, but many of them more ambient and setting the mood. The dialogue is rather well-written, the story gets slightly convoluted but is relatively easy to follow overall.\n\nNow, in case you're still not convinced: the first playthrough can take less than 2 hours, which is within the refund period. The game is 10 dollars - you cna afford it. If you don't like it, you can refund it shortly before or after your first playthrough, which is more than enough to gauge your interest, I'd wager.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm probably going to go write fanfiction and maybe continue crying a bit, because I now have a empty void in my heart. I'm dead inside.

If you read its Steam description carefully, you will see that it has not been explicitly advertised as one, but you could be forgiven for having that impression from some of the screenshots and Steam tags.\n\nWith the most important caveat out of the way, we can get to the actual plot.  Well, plots, really.\n\nThe main plot of the story is essentially a police procedural (but with dragons).  As with many visual novels, the plot is not gameified; there isn't much in the way of winning or losing here, unless you're playing for achievements.  As a result, this part of the game has almost no replay value.  You're not trying to win anything, so once you have seen the ending, the only part left is to explore the options you missed last time.  You do learn a few new things, and in one or two cases you can get better outcomes.  But there aren't any major reveals because they don't know which options you'll take the first time, and can't risk spoiling the ending.  The good news is that the developers knew this kind of material could be really annoying to click through when replaying, so you don't have to do that.  The game makes it easy to skip through anything you've already seen, without accidentally skipping things you haven't.  As a result, the lack of replay value in this section is unfortunate but does not drag down the rest of the game.\n\nAs the tag \"Dating Sim\" suggests, the rest of the story is focused on meeting and getting to know a few of the main characters in each playthrough.  Some of these characters have optional romance scenes, but not all of them.  The emphasis is on companionship rather than sex.  Unlike some dating sims, AWSW mostly fades to black rather than showing anything explicit, although there are a couple of suggestive images here and there.\n\nThe term \"dating sim\" is problematic in its own right.  If you click on the Dating Sim tag, you'll notice that it spans everything from shooters to visual novels, and everything from horror to comedy.  Outside of Steam tags, I have also seen it used to describe \"normal\" games like Mass Effect (actually, I'm pretty sure everything Bioware ever made has been called a \"dating sim\" at some point).  In the case of AWSW, it does have a grain of truth to it, since there are failure states for all of the characters (i.e. you can make them hate you).  In some cases, you can trigger these failures quite easily, with relatively little hinting that you're doing something wrong.  But it doesn't matter, because the game specifically encourages multiple playthroughs.  With the benefit of hindsight (and enough replays), you can befriend anyone.\n\nA game like this will largely stand or fall on its characters, especially given that it specifically wants you to make friends with all of them.  Personally, I found them a heartwarming and likable bunch.  You probably won't love every single one of them, of course.  They're a diverse group, and don't always get along with each other.  But they have all been well written, so the average player will take a strong liking to at least one or two of them.\n\nUnlike the main plot, the side plots have a great deal of replay value, and not just because you get to meet more characters.  The gameplay has a bit of a Majora's Mask feel to it, in that you're repeating through the same events, never able to help everyone in the same playthrough.  It's a bit depressing at first, but the game finds ways to improve on this formula.\n\nThe true ending is reasonably satisfying.  Most of the bad endings are quite painful to watch, as are some of the \"good\" endings.  This is deliberate, of course, and well executed.  The only major problem here is that most of the endings are nearly identical for large portions.  The game's skip functionality works as intended here (except for one brief scene which is ever-so-slightly different in each playthrough but still similar enough to annoy), but it further robs the game of replay value it could have had.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the time I had with this game, but I feel like it squandered some of its potential.  While AWSW certainly has more of a plot than a typical dating sim, it still feels less like a story and more like a vehicle for character development.  If a sequel is made, I hope it goes further, with a less linear plot and greater emphasis on player agency and story-relevant choices.", "timestamp_created": 1506144990, "timestamp_updated": 1506144990, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35116179": {"recommendationid": "35116179", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119654813", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511549606}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought it because it was on sale and didn't expect much of it, I was pleasantly surprised by the story and characters. 10/10 would cry again", "timestamp_created": 1506037171, "timestamp_updated": 1511380123, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35098556": {"recommendationid": "35098556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074607526", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 798, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506925598}, "language": "english", "review": "Angels With Scaley Wings is the FireFly of visual novels\n\nExperiencing the entire thing once is truly fantastic, and it's one of those games that you can enjoy once until you forget about it, then replay and get just as much out of it.\n\nThe characters are so rich and full of life, each with their own story and hardships\n\nI cared for each of these characters, and seeing all the game had to offer made me so happy to see their growth.\n\nThis game is a 10/10 for me.

Unfortunately, I had so much to say that I actually ran out of typing space in this review. Let me sum it up easily, then.\n\nI was drawn in by the idea of dragons as characters. What I was given was a handful of amazing, wonderful and very relatable characters. Characters that I genuinely cared for. I was also given characters that I genuinely hated. Ones that made me swear and curse at my monitor, something I haven't done since Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2. Not even to the extent that I did in this game.\n\nI was also given a gut wrenching story. A narrative that tugs at your heart strings at any moment it can. A game that's not afraid to give you hope and happiness, and then suddenly rip that all away from you in one fell swoop. It's a story that will sometimes bring twice as many questions than it does answers. Sometimes you need to come up with the answers for yourself, because this game doesn't always tell you everything you need to know.\n\nAngels with Scaly Wings was an emotional rollercoaster from beginning to end. You have to prepare yourself for that, and you have to push through to discover every secret you can. Do this, and you'll be granted an incredible ending that was absolutely worth the time.

My first ending, everyone died. Everyone. No one was spared, and I am still recuperating from that fact. \n\nThe game has an AMAZING soundtrack, with some pretty good heart-wrenching visuals here and there. While I will honestly say going through the story multiple times was a bit repetitive, the game has a very intuitive mechanic of fast-forwarding, without skipping any NEW dialogue and choices, and when you've done an entire scene before, the game asks if you'd like to skip it entirely. \n\nAnd lastly, I largely appreciate that in playing it a second time through, there were a few hints here and there that some things carried over from the previous ending.

There's a pretty nice musical score, nothing out-of-the-ballpark, but there are some strong mood-setting pieces and atmospheric melodies that compliment the game quite well. Artistically speaking, it's very colorful, vibrant, and I thoroughly enjoyed the expressiveness of the characters and simple art style.\n\nThere may always be for improvement, but honestly, any shortcomings this game may have did not hamper my enjoyment of the experience and it's absolutely charming characters.", "timestamp_created": 1504832568, "timestamp_updated": 1504832568, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34804286": {"recommendationid": "34804286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088328714", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 1204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490045404}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 Would go gay for Bryce", "timestamp_created": 1504825741, "timestamp_updated": 1504825741, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34794010": {"recommendationid": "34794010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104421660", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512362998}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8981\u662f\u82f1\u6587\u597d\u7684\u8bdd\u5c31\u4f1a\u53d1\u73b0\u5267\u60c5\u633a\u4e0d\u9519\uff0cScalie\u798f\u5229\u554a...\n\u76ee\u524d\u8fc7\u4e863\u6b21\u7ec8\u4e8e\u901a\u8b66\u957f\u7ebf\u8fbe\u5230\u597d\u7ed3\u5c40\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b......", "timestamp_created": 1504789673, "timestamp_updated": 1504789673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34779110": {"recommendationid": "34779110", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042539556", "num_games_owned": 618, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 349, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504717019}, "language": "english", "review": "I have questions about the birds and the bees now....", "timestamp_created": 1504716540, "timestamp_updated": 1504716540, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34767611": {"recommendationid": "34767611", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998981530", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 825, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510556463}, "language": "english", "review": "This game, all of my feels...\n\nSo I've played nearly 8 hours already in 24 hours, 2 hours when installed, 6 more when i woke and continued, and I can't hold all these feels.

Auchh basierend auf den Fakt, dass ich bezweifelte mich mit solch fremdwirkenden Charakteren identifizieren werden zu k\u00f6nnen.\nDie Geschichte im Spiel ist perfekt dramaturgisch aufgebaut. Ein etwas langsamerer einf\u00fchrender Start f\u00fchrt einen zu einen heftigen Anstieg in der Handlung. Es gibt, wenn man es genau nimmt, viele passende Kllimaxe, welche weder zu vorhersehbar, noch zu unpassend sind. Die Geschichte ist nat\u00fcrlich hierbei auf abh\u00e4ngig von den eigenen Entscheidungen, die man trifft und die [i]zahlreichen m\u00f6glichen[/i] Enden sorgten bei mir schon einige Male f\u00fcr ein Gef\u00fchlschaos.\nEine der wichtigsten Faktoren f\u00fcr mich in diesen Spiel ist die Zuordbarkeit der Charakter.\nJa, man [i]kann[/i] in diesem Spiel mehr als nur ein bisschen Mitgef\u00fchl entwickeln und die Charaktere wirken alles andere als fremd auf einen. Jeder wichtige Charakter hat eine fast einsch\u00fcchternde Tiefe und ist auch nicht zwangsweise \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfig logisch gestrickt. Das ist f\u00fcr mich einer der [i]wichtigsten[/i] Aspekte, da somit die Figuren realistischer wirken.\nJetzt mal ernsthaft; wie oft habt ihr schon ein Buch gelesen, wo die \u00dcbertriebenheit der Durchf\u00fchrung eines logischen Handels jeder einzelnen Person - ohne auf die Spontanit\u00e4t und Gef\u00fchlsvariet\u00e4t des Menschen zu achten - daf\u00fcr gesorgt, dass jemand zu berechenbar oder eindimensional wirkt? Hier ist dies zum Gl\u00fcck [b]kein[/b] Problem.\n\nDer Rest meiner Erfahrung zum Spiel ist einfacher in einem HGF zu beantworten:\n\nDie erste Visual Novel, die du [i]tats\u00e4chlich[/i] gespielt hast?\n- Nun ja, viele Leute, die schon mal Visual Novels gespielt haben kennen das Motivationsproblem. Erst recht die Leute, die eigentlich keine allzu aktiven Leser sind. F\u00fcr diejenigen, die genau deswegen zum Beispiel noch keine Visual Novels gespielt haben, kann ich dieses Spiel nur empfehlen. Seid von der Genre nicht abgeschreckt; sonst seid ihr selber Schuld diese Erfahrung hier zu verpassen.\n\nDas Spiel scheint an Furries gerichtet zu sein; Glaubst du echt die Allgemeinheit kann sich hier irgendwie identifizieren?\n- Quasi mein Ernstgedanke vor dem Kauf in Kurzform. [i] Kann man sich damit identifizieren [/i]?\nIch w\u00fcrde nach meiner Spielerfahrung so gar sagen, dass das Game nicht mal an Furries gerichtet ist.\nSelber habe ich, was dieses Hobby angeht, auch ein paar Identifizierungsprobleme, da ich selber mich an der Schwelle zwischen Furry und Nicht-Furry befinde. Allgemein bin ich sonst mit diesem Thema nicht gerade offen, aber hier ist das f\u00fcr mich wichtig auszusagen: [b]Nein, man muss [i]kein[/i]Furry sein, um das Game irgendwie genie\u00dfen zu k\u00f6nnen und seid nicht zu voreingenommen gegen\u00fcber dem Spiel[/b].\n\nDie verschiedenen Enden verlangen ja auch mehrfaches Durchspielen. Wie wirkte das auf dich?\n- Generell bin ich jemand, der andere Spiele nicht mehrfach durchgespielt hat. Generell war ich auch h\u00e4ufig entt\u00e4uscht, wenn dadruch die Spielerfahrung f\u00fcr mich als \"beendet\" galt. Hier jedoch ist es, vorallem um di Charaktere \u00fcberhaupt richtig kennenzulernen und die wirklich positiven Enden \"freizuschalten\" notwendig, es mehrfach zu spielen. Ich hatte noch nie so viel Motivation dazu, auch wenn ich zugeben muss; nach meinen ersten Durchlauf hatte ich durchaus eine Motivationsl\u00fccke und kann dazu nur sagen: Gibt bei schlechten Enden nicht auf ;).\n\nWelchen Aspekt am Spiel hast du am meisten gemocht?\n- Ehrlich gesagt stechen f\u00fcr mich zwei Sachen deutlich hervor. Die Handlungslogistik der Charaktere und die Identifizierungsm\u00f6glichkeiten mit den Charakteren. Ich kann es nicht h\u00e4ufig genug verdeutlichen.

Instead this is a very character-oriented choose your own adventure soft sci-fi novel. In fact, it is literally the best sci-fi novel I've ever read (and I've read a sizeable number).\n\n\n\nHmm? You don't trust a random stranger on the internet?\n\nWell, I almost didn't buy it because of the name. Now here I am writing a lengthy review for it that my friends and family may or may not see and make certain... assumptions. Even more, I don't actually like visual novels that much, it's really just that good.\n\nI'll limit any spoilers to whatever is covered in pre-game narration or in the screenshots above, or else I'll vaguely describe a few things that you will find out regardless of the choices you make and which aren't intended to be a surprise in any way. Be assured, this is the sort of game that you don't want spoiled.\n\nFirst, the 'dating' elements...\nA very good comparison for this Mass Effect: there is some flirtitious dialogue and highly seductive poses but with no explicit material (I actually don't even think there is any swearing in this game). If you take things any farther then you get a fan service image with artistic censorship where necessary, then the camera fades to black and the rest is strongly implied. I actually don't think it's possible to go that far with all of the main characters, and it's pretty clear from an early point that, while the characters are unusually amorous and blush with startling frequency, this is not the full breadth of what this game has to offer.\n\nNext, the setting...\nWhy the author chose dragon-people in particular baffles me slightly, but it's clear a hell of a lot of thought was put into their society. They explore the full ramifications of their different physiologies. It goes so far as to even explain why, for example, the doors you see in the screenshots above are still human-sized even though many of the dragons hunch or are quadrupedal. One of the ongoing mysteries from the very start of the game is how their society could possibly be so similar to our own.\nAs far as being a sci-fi novel, it is very clear that the author(s) did their research. While not completely ironclad, their explanations for how things work are at the very least convincing and often close to our actual understanding of things. If you're comfortable not overanalyzing, for example, a movie like Star Wars or The Minority Report, then you're going to be able to suspend your disbelief here.\n\nAs for the characters...\nThey all display impressive depth-of-character relative to the amount of 'screen' time they are given. All of them have very realistic flaws and insecurities and very admirable strengths. What's more impressive is that all of their interactions with other characters and their place in the setting are very natural and appropriate. Particularly given the extreme degree of...\n\nPLAYER AGENCY!!!\nAgency, or the ability of the player to control the flow of the story (e.g. who you decide to save, kill, or piss off, as well as what happens that would not otherwise have happened as a result). True agency is impossible to achieve in videogames with complicated storylines, so there are always compromises.\n\nSome games try to eschew storyline in favor of a sandbox approach, and are typically procedurally generated. These games generally don't have good depth, or else have a single deep-but-linear storyline amidst many shallow side quests. Other games have a single fascinating story which gives you some leeway, but which always has certain events transpire regardless of your choices. There is no avoiding this, to at least some degree.\n\nThat is where this game is truly astonishing; the degree of interconnection between your many, many possible choices and the events of the story are as flawless as feasibly possible. There are not just many endings, there are many in-betweens. There is a staggering amount of content in this game that you may very well never see, just so that the content you *do* see on even your third or fourth playthrough can be somewhat unique. What's more, the game has a very intuitive set of UI tools which allow you to skip ahead past parts you've already seen and explore new dialogue trees, making repeated playthroughs very unfrustrating. This game gives you a level of agency in the developing story which I have frankly never seen before.", "timestamp_created": 1502851354, "timestamp_updated": 1502851354, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.652548", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34263524": {"recommendationid": "34263524", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326543743", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5195, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502970143}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely worth the money spent.

The game takes up a quick pace right afterwards, with plotturns, twists and a surprisingly deep storyline offering some loose ends for a sequel as well as leaving room for speculation.\nThe topics inside the story are surprisingly deep and soundly made, and while being quite mind-boggling in the beginning, reading carefully reveals a lot of interesting things going on in the world.\n\nBut well, how well does the game a job of 'getting feels'?\nIn my opinion more then well. The topics for the characters revolve around common social problems many of us can relate to, often taken a few steps further then other mediums would dare to which is only possible because most of the protagonists aren't human.\nThe endings definitely manage to move people, I've yet to see a 'serious' Let's player not shedding tears at least once while playing trough the game, so that should speak for itself.\n\nAs downsides thought: The game mechanics are fun and simple, but clearly made in a way that even someone unable to solve any sort of major puzzle can see the whole story, there is no thinking process involved besides understanding the backstory itself.\nThe game offers options for interesting routes as playtrough, not utilized thought, making the 'worst' ending one can do a rather empty feeling thing while it could have been used to enhance the storyline and emotional connection to the world an characters even more.\n\nAll in all it's probably one of the most emotional games I've ever played, and definitely sporting a story which is able to resonate personally far easier then most books, movies or other games ever could.

It has elements, but it isn't horrifically in your face about sexing things ala HuniePop or Hatoful Boyfriend. Each character has their own side story arcs, and it isn't really about banging them. I nearly cried when I was told about one character's depressing backstory. Anna's good ending is the most bittersweet story I've heard in my life.

The story will leave you intrigued, and when you finish you'll be pining for the sequel to continue on the story. If you do play, get yourself some tissues. You may need to wipe up those tears. I really cannot reccomend this game enough, it's incredibly well made, with a skip system that lets you speed through things you've done before on your reruns to explore the whole story of the game, and the skip system makes sure you dont skip things that have changed since the last run, as the game world changes with each run you play. By this game.

This was a surprise. Awful name aside, this abso-fucking-lutely blew my expectations out of the water.\n\nSpoilers. It's impossible to talk about this game without them, sorry.\n\nIncredible. I genuinely did not expect the depth this game went into. I thought it would be a cheesy, shoddily-written and plothole filled sterotype for furries/scalies. [b]It is none of these things[/b]\n\nSo, the game started with an essentially wornout 20XX megaman reference and an on-screen text exposition dump with a quiet background tune. Don't get me wrong, it made me roll my eyes. However I might call it a necessarly evil to get into the meat of things. Within five minutes of actually interacting with the characters their genuine charm and uniqueness shone through. Their semi goofy character art and animations give them all a quirky visual quality that is irresistibly endearing. The depth of each character you encounter is surprisingly excellent; they're all with very distinct personalities and (back)stories and are all sublime to interact with thanks to the great writing. The occasionally rather subtle character expressions are a really lovely touch, particularly with characters like Bryce and Seb, whom might only get a slight brow twitch or hint of a smile. The lack of more than four or five of these per character does eventually cause them to loop them repeatedly, which is a tad distracting and a shame.\n\nThe surface level plot is fine, but it plays second fiddle to the true plot; an Undertale-like mechanic of resetting the timeline at the end of the (admittedly short) story. You don't have the chance to fully interact with all the characters, only one or two. Some choices, which I haven't fully realised still, actually do carry over as well. What you end up with is a web of things you want to try to see the impact down the line, to see how characters interact with each other if you do something just a little bit different - and it works. What is heartbreaking is that every single one of the main characters, and even some others, can meet rather unfortunate ends either by accident or by your own choice, which is especially awful when you realise your neglect of one character caused them to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or to do something reckless. \n\nFor those that got this far: Yes, you can romance some of the dragons. It's seriously handled quite well in a usually tasteful way and lasts only one interaction. There's no overtly lewd descriptions or depictions, and isn't touched upon thereafter. It's perfectly fine and [b]is not[/b] the reason to play the game, though you may need to do it to get the true ending, I haven't checked despite actually getting it. \n\nAll in all this game came right out of the blue and swept me off my feet. It's the kind of game you need to play, and play through several times to truly appreciate it rather than be told the reasons why its good.

A few screenshots won't do this game justice. The story had me immersed early on, and it kept me coming back for more so often. It was one of those few games that made me truly feel like I WAS the player, experiencing all these events, rather than controlling the player character. And the characters were so loveable, despite the fact that it was a bit painfully obvious who were the dev favorites and who the writers had little faith in.\n\nBut despite everything, the overall plot was... well, it wasn't exactly phenomenal, but as I've stated previously, it was written in such a way that I truly felt like part of the world. It's too bad I can't call this one of my favorite games of all time, because it does have some unfairly steep competition, but I really can say, with honesty, that I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and that it's the kind of quality that I, personally, would hope to be able to put into a game or story myself one day.\n\nAnd now comes the part of my review that should be taken with a grain of salt: the art. I'm not an artist. I can't draw, I can't visualize, nothing. Thus, I should be taken as no authority when I compliment how great the art is. While, like most visual novels, most of the \"visuals\" were left to the imagination, what the game did offer were pretty nice. (Except Lorem and his roommate. I don't know why, but their busts feel like they conflict with the rest of the characters for some reason. That's just me, though.) But for those special scenes, with their own special photo accompaniment, THAT was when the game really felt like it came to life. And let's just say... some of the scenes had their \"desired effect\" on me as a player.\n\nOverall, very strong and solid title, and would recommend it to others without a moment's hesitation.

I got some stuff to say if you will listen.\n\n\n\nBut since I'm writing a review for this game of all things, and since you're reading it, I think we both have some explaining to do, just so we're clear...\n\nIt was a Summer night, 11:20 PM, and I was thinking to myself, \"Hey! You know what'd be cool right now? Game with dragons!\" Pretty normal stuff. Searched \"dragon\" and found a bunch of crappy RPGs. Then I stumbled upon this game. Now, I don't know about you, but when saw that title, I was kind of curious. I certainly didn't expect to be looking for a visual novel. But I was curious enough to click. And what I saw... well, it didn't impress me. I thought I'd found a weird sub-culture dating sim. The information about the game on the side seemed to suggest that the plot was some sort of fan-fictiony trash. But, to my confusion, it seemed to be positively received. To me, that made me think that something was up. I looked throught all of the photos, and the last one made me stop for a second. It's nothing really special: Tons of visual novels are plots involving murder. But I wouldn't expect that from a dating sim. Something was clearly going on here, so I read some reviews. They were so... positive! It seemed to indicate that this game is some sort of anomaly. Something that supposedly made people who had bought and played it as a joke very invested in the story. People who had no expectations for it found themselves brought to tears... Looking at this game, it just felt strange that it could invoke this much emotion. People praising the plot, the characters, the ideas of it all. It made me so... curious. I bought it. Now... it seems to have gone full circle. Maybe my little story there puts it a bit more into perspective. However, it doesn't tell you much about this game. So how about some of that?\n\n\nI can't tell you much about the story because... well, it's a visual novel. It's a book with some pictures and choices. A book with pictures and choices that can take thirty hours to completely finish reading. But I can tell you this: You might expect this story to involve lots of fantasy elements, but it doesn't. Like, not at all. Believe it or not, the plot is pretty much completely sci-fi, as odd as that sounds. But you'll find out soon enough. Telling you more is doing quite the disservice. In fact, even talking about a core part of the gameplay and story is a massive disservice! I'll leave that topic by saying that there aren't many types of these plots that are really good, or free from massive plot holes, but this one sure did it well! Now, onto the gameplay! I can't talk too much about this either because the gameplay works in tandem with the story. I'm sorry, but that's just the nature of this sort of thing! Now you play as a generic protagonist. Whenever they have control, they say mostly neutral things, but that's all fixed by the choices you make. I may have mentioned before that you make choices, and boy do you sure do make choices! Have I said choices enough to get across the point that there are branching paths in the gameplay and narrative? 'Cause there sure is! Anyway, the options given to you normally cover anything you would actually want to say in that given situation... and some other shit too... (Seriously, what the hell?) Also, a funny thing about those choices that the game doesn't actually warn you about: Many things you say or do can make certain characters think differently about you. That's pretty much a given, but you can actually check this in the status menu when you pause. From worst to best, the statuses are: Abandoned, bad, neutral, good, impressed. If your status with them is bad or abandoned, they won't talk to you. Just in case you wanted to know!\n\nNow, something that might be on your mind, and maybe the reason you are here: Is this a dating simulator? Whether you hope it isn't or maybe you hope it is, you wouldn't really know given what information is available on the page here. So, let me enlighten you! The answer is: Maybe. Now that's a very vague answer that deserves some explaining. Basically your asking if you can have sex with a dragon and now I'm telling you maybe? What the hell man! Ok. So, if you wanted to \"romance\" a character, you could. However, you can only get that option if you really, really tried. And you don't even have to. The game never forces you into romantic situations. But, if you really want, you sure can try. Basically, it's your choice! Don't worry about accidently getting... intimate, because it would be very difficult to do so by accident. You'd have to know a character very well, and at that point you could choose not to get anywhere close if you don't want to. However, even if you do it by accident, you can ALWAYS turn them down. You might worry that this will make them hate you, but nah. Nothing wrong with just being friends. Anywho, if you really went for it, you could. But the option is always yours. Then end goal isn't to get into romantic situations, and you can one-hundred percent complete the game without ever being romantic. No endings rely on it.\n\nSpeaking of endings, this game has quite a few. That means you gotta play the game over and over and over again to get all of them. You might be thinking, \"Wow Admiral, that sounds really boring! I already beat the game and now I have to do it ALL over again to get the ending I want? Ugh!\", but hold onto that thought for a second, Sonny Jim! On subsequent playthroughs, you have the option to skip straight to the nitty-gritty. You can skip through areas with lots of branching dialogue chains that won't tell you much more about the plot if you've already read them. Speaking of already read, you can also skip right to important choices and new stuff. This takes away all of the tedium that would otherwise be involved with playing the game all over again. Of course, you could just play over again without skipping anything at all to get every dialogue option, but you have the choice at any time to not.\n\nSo the art is pretty decent. Better in some places, of course, but doesn't at all detract from the experience. In some places, the art and backgrounds looks... really good! You probably also don't need me to tell you the story and characters are good, but they really are. I can say NOTHING about that though. Dialogue is good too, of course, 'cause it's hard to have good story and characters when the dialgue and text sucks. One more thing: The music in this game works really well. I know I'm saying \"really\" a lot, but I have to get the point across suffeciently. The music sounds great and sets the tone perfectly. I certainly wouldn't mind buying the OST someday.\n\nNow, just one final note: This isn't a very happy game. There's a whole lotta murder happening here. Kinda important. And people will die. All our beloved characters have at least one way to have their lives brutally ended. In fact, YOU have a few ways to die. You don't have as much plot armor as you think, bud! Be careful! With characters dying and suspicion thrown around, you'd have never thought it would come from this of all games. Looks like a bloody happy dating sim, but now all of my friends are dead! Even the happy endings involve severe tragedy! But with a way for everyone to die, you'd think that it would just be misery all around. Not completely though. Everyone's deaths can be prevented with the right courses of action. That's right, your choices matter here too! Crazy right?\n\n\n\n\nAnd that, finally, is all I have to say, and hopefully, all I need to say for you to decide whether to buy it or not. I've never written a review this long or this heartfelt, but I just had to, as you can probably tell. There really is nothing quite like this out there!

The music in this game compliments the scenes very, very well, and is genuinely amazing.\nThe characters. Their designs, personality, everything about them is unique, lovable, and they are all fun to chat with.\nThe artwork. It's pretty. The game has very pleasing visuals.\nThe writing. It is amazing.\nThe feels. As of this review, I have completed the game three times, and gotten three different endings. Each of them were great. My third playthrough was the most heartbreaking though, and that was one of the good endings.\nYou can lewd the dragons. That's right, you can sex up dragons in this game. It is censored, though.

This is easily one of the most complex and compelling storylines to any game that I have played before. Despite being a scaly and having a thing for dragons I can easily put that down and let alone say the dragon romance aspect wasn't even needed at all given the dedication put behind this. But I'll leave it as a bonus.\n\nEssentially upon buying this game I had a feeling it was going to be rather generic and just wanted to give it a shot. And well, I was in for a real surprise. There are many endings... 14 I believe. It has a true butterfly effect component that any game even AAA titles couldn't give. I feel it's a shame this game hasn't gotten more attention and praise. You will need to play this... a lot. Over and over but you'll feel compelled to given you crave a final solution; let alone a good one. There is a lot of scientific dialogue that maaay throw some people off who aren't great with understanding it; but even the average Joe will understand a good portion of it.\n\nSpeaking of science; there are some potholes in the plot but given how complex this storyline is it's impossible to make it absolutely perfect. Let alone much of the \"potholes\" people point out will be explained in the true conclusion. Otherwise this was carefully thought out and carefully put together with such a delicate and complex main topic I won't spoil. All I can say is this is so worth the purchase.\n\nTl;dr\n\nPros:\n-very powerful and well thought out storyline\n-great characters and emotional connection (definitely can be non-romantic)\n-a massive plot puzzle you believe you've got down that will only stump you later (which will be explained in the end)\n-amazing art and soundtrack\n\nOKs:\n-dragon romance, it isn't forced but could have been excluded for those not into this stuff\n\nCons:\n-some scenes can drag on a liiiittllee too long but luckily you will later have a skip and fast forward option given when you have to face them again.\n\nOverall, please do buy!

Now, I can honestly say I could not recommend this game seriously in a public setting while holding a straight face. It's really bad, and that may throw you off if you're looking at this game or well, visual novel as a potential buy.\n\nThe other most obvious thing is that this game is marketed as a dating sim with dragons. While there is that in the game, it's really not what you'd expect. Sure there are some good romantic scenes that occur but some of the 'dates' you will not even get to date at all. It's really kind of second hand in some plotlines.\n\nAnyways, onto the game and the story. For being a dating game and all that and how it plays it honestly does not feel like one in some of the paths. The dating takes a sort of back seat to the story of the game which is pretty good. I honestly enjoyed the setting and questions I had about the setting kind of answered themselves throughout the game or with a little thought put into them. \n\nThe characters themselves are fantastic. I've never seen or felt such depth in any games dialogue before. I love nearly all of them but one ending will leave you wanting, while the others will absolutely break your heart. This game is an absolute rollercoaster of feels. I teared up multiple times throughout the game as I played it. One of the most tear-jerking moments in the game is the good ending with Anna, and it fucking hurts if you've ever had to deal with a similar situation in your life like I did.\n\nI will aside here to give slight spoilers as to get Lorem's best ending because it's kinda weird. You need to get his friends Sphere pieces. Search the pavilion 3 times in a row and the police station waste basket. Bam, \"\"\"good\"\"\" ending unlocked.\n\nAnyways, back on point, I have a few minor complaints. The options and dialogue for the main character at some points is a bit meme tier, but otherwise it's alright. I would complain about repetition but they give you some tools to avoid it and speed up the tedious stuff. Trust me, tab is your best friend after you \"\"\"\"beat\"\"\"\" this game the first time. You'll understand what I mean after you play it. ;)\n\nPersonally, this is the best and only dating simulator I ever played but it undoubtedly has one of the best stories I have ever seen in a video game. I give it a 10/10 but by God do I wish I could tell my friends about this gem without looking like I'm some sort of sexual deviant.\n\nCome for the dragons and stay for the feels folks.

Like i said this is my first visual novel and made an entire flip on how i think about them, Since i only know about the total Hentai ones. that beeing said for the me the only downside was that most of the characters are dragons, Even though it allows you to romance some characters, This was kinda wierd and downsiding. But in the end This was in no way compariable with the amount of emotion i got from this game, The feeling of how well it felt for to play and how confusing everything also felt. all in all a great visual novel that i wouldn't have played if i hadn't been gifted to me. and saying that my past self would smack himself not to play it.

You either got this game because you're a furry/scalie, or for the lulz.\n\nThere isn't much gameplay in this game with it being a Visual Novel, mainly just clicking on a choice that pop up time from time. Some of these choices don't affect the story much/at all, but some choices can have dire consquents later on.\n\nWithout going in to many spoilers. The story doesn't change much each play through even if you chose different choises. [spoiler]Differnt dragons will die depending on what you do[/spoiler] but the main plot is the same, with the ending being different wether you got a good or bad ending with different characters.\n\nThe characters are amazingly writen. Their hopes and dreams are interesting to read into and you can feel that a lot of thought was put into this area, which, in a visual novel, is one of the most importaint aspects to get right.\n\nThe script is properly the only downside to this game, but it's not a major downside to this game. Many times the diolog felt cut off, or ended abruptly. But as far as that goes the game is very polished.\n\nThere are alot of achevements in this game. Most of them are just the possiable endings that can happen while others are for completing silly little objectives. The game also throws in a few reverences including Ace Attorney (Objection!), Pokemon (I wanna be the very best), JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (But is was me __!) and a few more.\n\nOverall the game has great replay value with the amount of diferent endings there are. Interesting story line (At least for the first play through). And very interesting characters to learn about.\n\n[spoiler]10/10 would cry on Adine's bad ending again[/spoiler]\n\nOverall I rate this game a 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1499008771, "timestamp_updated": 1499089445, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580838", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33126424": {"recommendationid": "33126424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313431265", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1892, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499160522}, "language": "german", "review": "Das beste Spiel was ich empfehlen kann.\n\nAls erstes war ich nicht interesiert, aber gegen Ende haben mich viele \u00fcberzeugt.\nMan bekommt gute Artworks geliefert und dann noch eine gef\u00fchlsergreifende abwechslungsreiche Story. \n\nIch w\u00fcrde es jedem empfehlen, der Drachen und Novels mag, da es mich direkt ins Herz getroffen hat.", "timestamp_created": 1498993893, "timestamp_updated": 1498993893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33124078": {"recommendationid": "33124078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048907098", "num_games_owned": 219, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1039, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500707155}, "language": "english", "review": "I OD'd on painmeds and broke the universe.

I say without hyperbole they may be one of the most promising storytellers of our era. I regret not being prophetic enough to have supported their crowdfunding campaign- the community that did should be thanked by everyone else. (So for any members of that community reading this: THANK YOU, for helping this to exist.)\n\nHere's the thing... I don't like visual novels as a format at all, and I especially find so-called \"dating sims\" awkward and off-putting. Heck, in all honesty these days I'm not even a huge fan of retro adventure games or RPG's with heavy amounts of text and no voice acting. Those kinds of games just don't hold my attention anymore, and haven't for a long time.\n\nAnd this game is unashamedly all of those things- a simple visual novel interface, with an openly dating sim vibe, and literally over 100,000 words of text with no voice acting at all. It's basically a choose-you-own adventure book with motion comic artwork, and with a premise that's more than a little odd-sounding on top of it all.\n\nAnd yet this now easily is on my shortlist for one of the most unexpectedly impressive games ever.\n\nI don't seem to be unique in this. You see lots of reviews from players and critics that have either never played or, like me, even actively dislike other games superficially similar to this one- yet love it. That's a heck of an achievement.\n\nAnd I think it's because the game is really not much about sex or even romance, although it has some of that in it. It's not even entirely about the story, despite having a frightfully intricate one. At it's core what this game really is about seems to be exploring different types of connections that can be made between people. It's not just about finding the \"right\" thing to say or do- on the contrary the whole mechanic of the game essentially revolves around figuring out how to connect to characters on an emotional, intimate, vulnerable level. It does that really, really well... And it turns out that's really, really important to storytelling.\n\nThrough the course of searching for those connections you may find yourself with tears in your eyes at 2 in the morning because of something you can't stop from happening to a 2d, non-animated, non-human character.\n\nI did.\n\nI almost feel like it shouldn't be possible, but it happened.

[/spoiler] I haven't encountered any cons in the game yet as I'm still in Chapter 1 but I am sure to update this if I find any. \n\nRight now I got to say this is a great game so far, it's totally worth picking it up during the Steam Summer Sale.\n\nUpdate!\n\nSo now I have just finished the game. Spoilers ahead! [spoiler] I of course in my first playthrough of this magnificent game got a neutral ending. How I was going to be sent back but then the portal was mysteriously broken. Stayed for some more, talked to Remy and helped him organize his books aswell as break a priceless artifact (sorry!) and break his game on the computer (sorry again!). Talked with Lorem about his game he was making along with his room mate (real nice fellow). [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] Then I set off to talk to Adine, played some sort of game from a magazine, of course I had fun doing it. She's real nice, I like her. I wish I could have talked to her more before the end. Lastly I talked to Bryce. Talking to him about Reza at the bar, he's a real nice dragon and honstly was fun to hang with. Had a nice drinking contest which ended with him winning and me passed out on the ground. [/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler] And last but not least it was Chapter 5, the end. The fireworks show was beginning, making my way to the portal I found Sebastian dead (NO! One of my favorites and Reza killed him!) and hopped down into the lab underground where I finally met Reza, that smug a-hole. Some talk ended with the place destroyed, humanity doomed as well as the dragons. Found out that the dragons were a civilization that The Administrator somewhat created on Earth and a comet wiped them out and that the future civilization. 20XX was nearly wiped out by a solar flare. [/spoiler]\n\nEnough talk about the game aside, all in all this was a damn good game. I mean I really enjoyed it. I liked the art style, I liked how you could be a complete d1ck in this game, which I chose not to, I'm a friendly guy. I especially liked the different responses you could give, I laughed at a lot of them (not that they were stupid, just laughable). \n\nThe con is that the game is short, but I think the con solves itself with the different endings it has and the replayability, so I guess no cons.

For me, it was Remy. I adored Remy my first time through and spent all of my time with him. I still consider him to be my all time favorite character, but when I finished my first playthrough, I got his bad ending...it's been so long since i've had a game punch me in the feels so hard. You really do grow attatched to these characters! You want to help them with whatever it is they're struggling with and save they're little world when it comes down to it. I know it's just artwork on a screen, with characters that aren't real, in a non-existant world, but damnit! Why is it making me feel so emotional?! The writing is incredible. The artwork is amazing. And the atmosphereic pieces set the tone prefectly. \n\nSome people may find having to replay the game for different endings to be tedious, but after you've already viewed a certain outcome, you can skip particularly drawn out sections by just holding down the tab key to get straight to the moments that matter in fulfilling a certain ending's requirements. Oh...and don't be ashamed of using a guide, with all the emotions that this game will have you feeling, wanting to get the good ending and see that character end up in a better spot overshadowed my pride. I looked up a guide to get Remy's good ending right after i got his bad one...was in tears. Christ i love this game.\n\nThe true ending is also something truly special, as it ties every loose end togethor from the other endings and finally lifts all of the tension off of your shoulders. It ends in the best way possible too, a more than satisfying conclusion.\n\n 10/10 Please, do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this amazing world, and fall in love with theses characters like i did.

Dragons were the big draw for me, drawn pretty cutely. \n\nGiven that pretense, I am 100% satisfied with this game! The characters are real enough to have me completely immersed. The world is well-built despite being a small-medium length game (and I hope there can be a spin-off or sequel to this to develop it even further). The story is intelligent and very well written; it doesn't dumb anything down for you, but presents information through these characters in various ways that puts together a complete picture. I was continually surprised, through to the end of the game, with the quality of storytelling and character development. Treat this like an actual novel, and you won't be disappointed. \n\nPraise to the developers for producing a game that I not only enjoyed, but fell in love with.

Surely it is, nobody can deny it, but if this was the only thing, I wouldn\u00b4t be that amazed how I am. This game is soooo much more! The whole place lives! And it\u00b4s an incredible feeling, to discover this new world with dragons. All the people with it own problems, joys and feelings.\nOverall the whole place, all dragons that lives there, the interaction they have in this world, works. Not perfectly, I have to say, but it gives a real feeling about this world.\nI can\u00b4t say this game is for everyone, you have to be openminded. But if you do, this game will certainly have an impact on you. For me, it was a remarkable experience.\n\nAlso I can recomment to play it more then once.

I know, it\u00b4s not perfect, you clearly see some problems in this world, too. Anyway I want to say, some people could learn from it. For example the incredible tolerance, that\u00b4s also necessary, when you think about the many different species, that life together. Things like that changed my point of view in some issues. I have more hope in things and be more positive about it.\n\nIt\u00b4s incredible what a single game could do. For me it\u00b4s perfect. Thanks for doing this game, it gives me so much.

You could call it a bias, but I don't even connect to foxes (my favorite animal) anywhere close to as with dragons. Dragons in games are important to me, and this is no exception.\n\nThe writing (as a writer myself) is top-notch. The story is woven delicately to tell a story of multiple main characters. It truly unfolds when you play the True Ending (by getting all 5 good endings, one with each main character).\n\nThe characters are all loveable and have personalities that are enjoyable. Even with characters such as Maverick, [spoiler]who seems to hate you for most of the game[/spoiler] I just wanna give him a big hug and say I'm sorry he feels the way he does. I can't say which dragon is my favorite because all 5 are so close in different aspects. I've fallen in love with all of them...\n\nThe illustrations are beautiful, and the backgrounds are detailed. Even the backgrounds (why they use buildings, chairs, etc) are explained by a plot element. All the gallery pictures, dragon faces (especially when they blush!) are so charming and heart-warming.\n\nThe game isn't all sunshine and rainbows, though. It's possible for every character to die, sometimes in multiple ways. If you want the true ending... you'll see your favorite dragon die. More than once. It's heart-wrenching, and it hurt me a lot to see, but... I can say that in the end, the outcome is worth it.\n\nThe Skip function makes your second and consecutive playthroughs way faster because it stops the text at any decision and at any text you haven't seen before. You don't have to worry about skipping things you've seen or redoing the large parts of the game if you're going for certain endings.\n\nDifferent timelines, replaying the game over and over again, is a part of the game. You have to unfold the whole story and every outcome before the True Ending can be unveiled. Like with Undertale's true ending, if you play this game... play it to the end. Get the True Ending (even if you have to use guides!) and you'll thank me.\n\nI love this game so much that I bought the deluxe edition for the soundtrack/extras, the level 5 badge, the foil badge (which cost me $200) to proudly show on my page forever, and I got every achievement in the game, making Angels With Scaly Wings my FIRST and ONLY perfected game on Steam.\n\nDo yourself a favor: buy this game. It's a rollercoaster of emotion, and for a game made from a kickstarter campaign (and only 10,000 pounds) you would be surprised how good the quality can be. I'll take games like this over huge 100 million dollar Triple A games any day!\n\nWe need more beautiful, touching games like this.", "timestamp_created": 1497598163, "timestamp_updated": 1497598323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601343", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32416532": {"recommendationid": "32416532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148034501", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498068984}, "language": "english", "review": "I just finished all the endings. only two endings failed to bring a tear to my eye.

The story is bizarre, the characters are quirky, and the premise of the story and the origin of this dragon society are just plain [b]*zany*[/b]. The story's tone frequently crosses the line between serious/somber and lighthearted silliness without care.\n\nHowever, once I got over the shock of how weird the premise is, I found this game to be a lot of fun. This game knows how silly it is, and is filled with jokes and easter eggs that had me chuckling pretty often. The individual characters are for the most part fun, unique, and well-written. Most are likable at some level and have their own demons that give them depth and make them relatable. I think this is where the game is at its strongest, and it makes the game worth it.\n\nBeing an interactive visual novel, the player is given many choices in the story. There are many endings. Each of the five main characters has a good and bad ending. There is also an additional bad, neutral, and true ending. I would say the [i]majority[/i] of choices impact either your relationship with a character or the main story in a substantial if only minor way. It's nice to see the game reference an action you took far back in the story (or even an earlier playthrough; yes, the game has meta-narrative elements). As the game requires several playthroughs to achieve the true ending, it is fortunate that you can skip any scene. You can also blaze through text you have already read, and the game will stop automatically if the dialog has changed from any prior playthrough. You'll be using this feature a lot if you want all the endings. You can save also save at any point, and the game offers plenty of save slots.\n\nNow the mystery elements. Again, if you can suspend your disbelief and get over the bizarre premise (why is an alien ambassador who appeared mysteriously from another time only watched by a single unarmed bodyguard??), there is a fun little mystery to figure out here. Figuring out how to achieve each character's good ending is compelling enough, but the true ending I think is where the game could have done a little better. Instead of playing through the game several times to figure out a specific set of choices that will result in a good ending for everyone, you simply need to achieve each character's good endings in separate playthroughs. From there, the true ending more is more or less automatic. You basically run through the story as you normally might, and most of the bad stuff that can happen pretty much just prevents itself from happening. When you get to the end you are simply given the option at the end to say \"OK I want the true ending now\" (to be fair, there is an explanation for this, albeit an outlandish one). You are then given some additional cutscenes and all is revealed. Because of this, the game is less so about solving a mystery and more so about achievement hunting.\n\nBecause of how the mystery is solved, [i]I would say this game is a dating sim with mystery elements rather than the other way around[/i].\n\nMy only other complaint is the disparity in quality/style of art used throughout the game (as mentioned by many other reviews). Most of the backgrounds are professional-grade stills done in an anime style, and there are also some very nice looking stills of the characters that are shown in different scenes as well as the gallery (I really like these) outside of the story. However, the character art for the dialog screens is done in a simple cartoony style that I find clashes with the rest of the game's art (Lorem for example always looks so out of place). It took me a bit to get over this. Also, it's obvious that the backgrounds are stock and were not made with the game in mind in order to keep costs down and save time. For example, I'm pretty sure most dragons in this world would not be able to sit in a restaurant booth (at all?) clearly desgined for humans. I understand the game is targeted at a small niche and only costs only $10 at full price, but I feel this won't stop it from this problem bothering most players.\n\nIn regards to music, there are some nice although generic ambient tracks in here. I'll be checking out Crinkles' other work in the future.\n\nOverall I had a lot of fun with this game and am very happy with it. It has its shortcomings, but it holds a special place in my heart as a unique experience that dared to be something so strange with strong passion behind it. It's a silly dating sim in which you get to know some suspiciously human-like dragons from an alternate reality but with some mature and relatable themes. If you are interested in a unique story-driven experience and have an affinity for cartoon dragons, I think you'll find something to enjoy here. Otherwise, it's hard to know whether or not you'll enjoy this--it's too bizarre and incoherent thematically.", "timestamp_created": 1496115958, "timestamp_updated": 1496199809, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31924976": {"recommendationid": "31924976", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038737769", "num_games_owned": 206, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496027005}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:  Cute and incredibly heartwarming game\n\nCons:  I cried like a baby through most of the endings", "timestamp_created": 1495575658, "timestamp_updated": 1495575658, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555747", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31912716": {"recommendationid": "31912716", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073127505", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 462, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495516111}, "language": "english", "review": "Angels with Scaly Wings is by far one of the weirdest games I have ever played TO DATE. The story is weird, the characters are weird, the setting is weird. The entire premise is outlandish; you're a human, teleported to a world where dragons essentially take on the role as humans. Every bit of human culture that is present today is present in their world, almost completely unchanged.\n\nDespite all of this, it has been one of the most exciting and funny visual novels I have ever gone through before.\n\nThe choices you are offered to make are incredible, and the game, as any game should have that  boasts so many choices, has a multitude of endings to discover. Thankfully, thanks to the skip feature, you can automatically skim over dialogue you've read before. It stops the skimming at the new dialogue.\n\nThe story is outlandish, but it works. And the characters are fantastic. Each one unique with it's personality. Every chapter, you have the choice of visiting 2 characters, from a list given. Which characters you decide to meet, and how many times you decide to meet them, is completely up to the player. On my first playthrough, I visited no one else but Ana and Adine every day. On future playthroughs however, I decided to go different routes. Meet with different characters, or meet with characters I had met before, but simply making different options, which can greatly affect the outcome. As far as I know, each character has a good or bad ending.\n\nThe game knows how incredibly silly it is; I mean, you're a human, going around dragon-town, meeting dragons, and finding out the bottom to a crime plot. The game is filled with a number of jokes, and hidden easter eggs, as well as funny self concious humour. These were some of my favorite moments of the game, and the game doesn't hesitate to break the fourth wall, or make a [url=https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/771651069830006784/6E4CFEFE9AA415A8A609C029FC65E727EFC1A497/]reference to anything.[/url]\n\nThe game's average runtime, for a first playthrough that is, is around 7 hours. [u][b]I strongly encourage anyone who is willing to play the game to NOT look at any spoilers of any kind.[/b][/u] Like most visual novels, it can be completely ruined if you know the ending, or anything of the sort. Don't ruin it for yourself.\n\nOverall, this game surprised me. Greatly. I thought it was all going to be fun and games, playing a silly dragon dating simulator type of thing. The story took me by surprise with how serious it was, and all of the hidden, deep morals and moments littered around it. The game is charming in it's own, unique way, and I love it.

Dialoge an viele verschiedene Orte und Einzelschicksale der Charaktere gebracht.\n\nMan ben\u00f6tigt seine Zeit, um alle (relevanten) Enden des Spiels durchzuspielen, der Ausgang immer davon abh\u00e4ngig, welche Entscheidung man im jeweiligen Spieldurchgang macht, welche aber auch wieder davon abh\u00e4ngig sind, wie zuvor laufende Spieldurchg\u00e4nge liefen. Man spielt also nicht immer wieder das selbe Spiel von vorne, sondern erlebt signifikante \u00c4nderungen mit jedem weiteren Spieldurchgang. Das ganze wird hierbei absolut gelungen in die Story eingebunden. Stichwort: Science Fiction.\n\nUnd so erlebt man, wenn man sich auf alle Enden einl\u00e4sst, zum Schluss das \"wahre Ende\", welches eine komplette Aufl\u00f6sung der Geschichte gibt und all die bisherigen Storyelemente aus den vielen, vorherigen Spieldurchg\u00e4ngen einbezieht.\n\nDie Charaktere der Geschichte sind gro\u00dfartig. Nachvollziehbar, tiefgr\u00fcndig, mitf\u00fchlend. Der Slice of Life Aspekt des Spieles und der \"Dating Sim\" Abschnitt sorgen f\u00fcr durchaus spa\u00dfige Spielstunden. Die Vorauswahl an Dialogen, die man treffen kann und die M\u00f6glichkeiten der Beziehungen, die man an den Hauptcharakteren eingehen kann, sind oftmals sehr awkward, urkomisch, zum lachen aber ebenso auch tragisch. Jede Geschichte, die die einzelnen Charaktere zu erz\u00e4hlen haben, ist sehr ausgefeilt, dynamisch und in Hinsicht auf den Hintergrund des \"gro\u00dfen Ganzen\" - also dem eigentlichen Hauptplot -  sehr interessant zu verfolgen.\n\nUnter der Pr\u00e4mi\u0323sse, als Mensch durch ein Portal in eine Welt von Drachen zu geraten, die sehr \u00e4hnlich der der Menschen in all ihren Lebensgrundlagen ist, erwartet man nicht so viel, wie die Geschichte letztendlich hergibt. Die musikalische Begleitung ist ebenso eine Erw\u00e4hnung wert. Diese passt in jeder Szene und wirkt - auch wenn man sehr lange an einigen Szenen zu lesen hat - niemals nervig. Sie l\u00e4uft dezent und passend zur jeweiligen Szene im Hintergrund ab. Die Zeichnungen selbst sind sehr sauber und das Design der Drachen nat\u00fcrlich doch sehr niedlich getrimmt.\n\nEin Mix aus Feel Good, Studio Ghibli Film & klassischen Science Fiction Elementen machen [i]Angels with Scaly Wings[/i] zu einem sehr tollem Spielerlebnis, sofern man sich auf die Geschichte einl\u00e4sst oder zumindest vielleicht f\u00fcr dieses Game Genre mehr \u00fcbrig hat. Halbwegs gute Englisch-Kenntnisse sind hierbei auch vorausgesetzt. Man hat viel zu lesen.\n\nTolles Spiel!

Como inicio numa id\u00e9ia de \"namoro de drag\u00f5es\" e no fim acabando numa id\u00e9ia de uma \"novela de drag\u00f5es\", assim demonstrando que o jogo poderia oferecer bem mais do que ser um jogo gen\u00e9rico de namoro. \n\nA hist\u00f3ria do jogo (sem spoiler aqui) \u00e9 complexa ao meu ver, em certos momentos tentei anexar um fato ao outro, mas n\u00e3o consegui, e pensei que a hist\u00f3ria era ruim... mas me enganei, assim que finalizei pela primeira vez, os fatos come\u00e7aram a fazer sentido, e depois de muitas tentativas, chegando no final verdadeiro (sim, necessita fazer cerca de 80% do jogo pra isso) a hist\u00f3ria se encaixou perfeitamente, mesmo no meio daquela confus\u00e3o que me confundiu no come\u00e7o.\n\nJ\u00e1 em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos drag\u00f5es, n\u00e3o tenho nada a falar de ruim, posso ter n\u00e3o gostado de dois ou tr\u00eas, por n\u00e3o fazerem meu estilo, mas mesmo assim foi \u00f3timo cada momento de conversa, sendo f\u00e1cil de entender, engra\u00e7adas as vezes... tristes... sentimentais... realmente houve uma boa aten\u00e7\u00e3o ao ser feito isto, dando para notar a dedica\u00e7\u00e3o do autor que escreveu as falas de cada um, dando para lembrar de cada momento marcante de cada personagem. Alguns finais ficaram meio vagos, deixando para voc\u00ea um gostinho de \"quero mais\", mas devido a limita\u00e7\u00e3o da cria\u00e7\u00e3o do jogo, n\u00e3o podendo oferecer mais que isso. \n\nEm conclus\u00e3o, o jogo vale cada centavo, pode parecer simples, ou para alguns, pacato.

If you try to romance someone but haven't figured out some crucial backstory and puzzle to their character, you get some tragic ending which motivates you to figure the game out to get that happy ending.\n\nRepeat this core gameplay loop where you unravel the main story and all its mysteries relationship by relationship and you get to the meat of this game.

I don't make that statement lightly, as I am in such conflict over this. Honestly, this game is something of an enigma to me. For every good thing it does, something that could have been improved on is in the next door.\n \nI'll start with the negatives first, as to end it on a high note.\n \nThe most glaring of the problems with this story comes from the fact that it's too reliant on you seeing different endings and there is too much telling. Like, if you were to see one ending, and then get another, you have vastly different outcomes. In a bad way. I feel like this game was made to have an order in which you get the endings for first, as some of them explain things you already know or something along that line.\n\n \nWhen it does get going, however, there is too much telling. The most infamous scene people seem to know about is when you first talk with The Administrator, who goes on an 15-30 minute plot dump. And its black screen, so you have no interesting pictures to look at. It's like reading a book \u2013 which this is supposed to obviously be \u2013 but it's presented as a game. A visual medium. So staring at a black screen forever made me want to slam my head in the desk. I was streaming this entire game, and I wasn't the only one who felt this way.\n \nIn fact, that's the biggest problem with the narration; the black background parts. Each character has a scene or two where you figure out their biggest secret, and its told in the same way The Administrator drones on in. Thankfully, not as long, but its still a glaring oversight. A picture or two to show what was going on would have vastly improved the weight it was trying to carry.\n\n \nOn the subject of art, some of the drawings are a bit awkward in angles. The most glaring I can think of is one of Remy's and the one in Anna's good ending. A bit more polish and it would have looked good. I understand perspective issues, and for the most part it works, but some should have had a bit more editing.\n\nSame with the writing. For the most part, its good (I'll get into that more later). However, there are times where it could have been edited more. There is one part of Bryce's third date where every sentence or two has the word 'even' in it. And this went on for at least five minutes worth of dialogue. Being a writer myself \u2013 and no I'm not going to take the high-ground \u2013 I have the same issues with that word. Everyone has one of those words, but a bit more editing would have really helped. I'm not going to nitpick every spelling mistake, either, as on a whole it wasn't too noticeable.\n\nFinally, some of the endings flat out didn't work. Both of Lorem's endings were rather blah, and I oddly found Adine's bad ending to be much better than her good ending. I won't go into spoilers, but when you see them, you'll understand my point. In addition, once you get said endings, you just forget about the character. And if one is to die during anther's dates, they won't act like they died. It's a lack of continuity in some areas that makes it stand out.\n \nSomething I should mention that doesn't really count as a negative is that some things are really obtuse to get. To get Anna's good ending, you have to do something you'd think might piss her off. Or get all the way to date three with Remy. Getting the good ending for Remy is also near impossible on a first playthrough. However, that is part of the fun. It's just that it could have been a bit more telegraphed in some areas. At least, that's how I felt.\n \nNow, for the good parts.\n \nThe five main characters are five points in their own. Each of them are interesting in some way and they are different enough to leave a lingering impression. My favorites were Anna and Bryce, but I certainly didn't hate any of them. The only one that dragged on in locations was Lorem, but that was mostly his second date and I had already seen some of the stuff it was implying.\n\nEach of them have their own problems and situations you gotta address, too. Mostly because if you don't, they all die. And yes, it is possible to kill them all. I liken it to the gif where the guy comes in with the pizza to chaos, except it has all the characters dying in their respective ways. They are all romanceable (even if I only managed to do it with Anna and Bryce).\n \nThey all have different endings, as previously said. The best ones I found were Anna's. Her good ending is downright depressing. It left me cold and hurt, as any good story should with the situation she has. It even managed to overcome the back screen of doom I mentioned before! Remy and Bryce's good endings were also quite good, with the former's bad ending also being very depressing.\n\n \nI really cannot stress this enough, though; for all of the faults I have with the game, these characters are so interesting that I want to go back and explore each and every option with them to find any hidden details.\n\n \nSomething to help you get to the true ending is the ability to skip past scenes. Sometimes, you don't want to do it. But it helps you save a bunch of time on subsequent playthroughs. As such, it's not as big of a problem to get everyone's endings.\n\n \nFinally, the way the dragons are explained is very interesting. I won't give it away, but it made a lot of sense. When it isn't plot dumping you, the plot itself is interesting and the way they explain the resets to get each character's endings is clever.\n \nNow, before I give my grade, I want to explain how I do this. For me, a 5 out of ten means its average. Not bad, but probably not something you'd tell your friends about. Anything above it is above average. I don't like the way game reviews are these days, where if its under a seven it's absolute shit.\n \nWith that said, I give this a 6.5. Each character is easily worth one point. However, the flaws with this game/story are too glaring to ignore. With a bit more polish, and possible patches, I think this could really shine.", "timestamp_created": 1490590366, "timestamp_updated": 1491100144, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 4,

It then proceeds to tear your heart out of your chest, smash it into a million pieces in front of you and force you to collect those broken pieces and put them back together just so it can smash apart your heart again and again, each time killing you more and more inside.\n\nI was stupid enough to play through the entire thing in 2 days (offline, so ignore the glitched time spent playing it; Volvo, plz) and I'm not afraid to admit that on more than a few occassions I may have shed more than a few manly tears and left with a feeling of terrible hollowness, dread and sadness.\nAnd yet still, I would recommend this because it's an experience.

The possibilities I thought were quite open and the story had a good plot to it though it seemed a bit.. missing pieces.

The aspect of 'dating' isn't as literal as people may take it, sure there are qualities of it, getting to go out and know and even fall in love and feelings for characters HOWEVER in my personal opinion? That didn't seem like the main focus point of the game for its story. Yes, it plays a vital role to get to KNOW them and help them on a personal level with their hopes and dreams and intentions, and maybe even change fates for them, however to officially romance long-term with any one in specific I don't feel is the highlight here.  It's all pieces of a puzzle and it does take some thinking and time building trust, friendship and just being there for those you love or would call a friend truly. \n\nThis is what has touched me most espcially coming to the conclusion of the game, sitting at 98% achievements (I think the one is bugged at my attempts) I have pretty much cleared it all, and would HIGHLY recommend it to those who'd like to delve into a rather well thought out story.\n\nThe only seeming long part that may or may not be an issue for anyone, is that one does have to practically do everything to accomplish and the dialogues are different to where you cannot 'skip' unread dialogue however you can use that for future assistance if needing to repeat a scene or quick through it and just make choices selectively. \n\nGetting to know the characters has touched my heart, and I truly hope there is a sequel as from what I grasp, there is much potential for such!

I apparently announced that I'd purchase and play the game if the people gave me a bunch of money. Somehow, this descended into a full week of me streaming the game, inviting various people into a call to voice the characters, and generally making a community activity out of it.\n\nDespite me and 40 people spending seven hours a day streaming this game for a solid week, I still have no idea if it's actually [i]good[/i]. Like, it walks this sort of strange line between being legitimately good, so bad it's good, and legitimately bad. The game is this bizarre checkerboard mix of good and bad execution which, to its credit, is much more than I expected from a dragon dating sim I was literally paid money to play. However, in more than one instance it comes [i]tantalizingly close[/i] to being extremely impressive, and that near-proximity frustrates me to no end.\n\nI think the biggest issue I have with this game the metagame - or more specifically, the amazing metagame it briefly [i]looks[/i] like it has. Like, relatively minor spoiler you learn after the first playthrough: the game involves [spoiler]a time travel loop[/spoiler]. There's this point around your third playthrough ([spoiler]or I guess \"third loop\"[/spoiler]) where it really [i]feels[/i] like it's going to involve exploring the different paths, learning the effects of your actions, and discerning the perfect combination of moves to facilitate the best possible outcome. One of the characters talks about this as though it is the goal, and there's even a relatively unique spin on it with the discovery that you can [spoiler]carry physical items but not complete memories back through time[/spoiler] (something I thought was a glitch until I realized it was an intentional gameplay mechanic necessary to solve problems). The problem is, when you get a good ending, that character's problems get solved on all subsequent playthroughs. What seems to be a game where you try everything in order to puzzle out the perfect combination of actions instead becomes a game where you do everything and then... just sort of win, because you did everything at least once. \n\nThe end result is that you basically just end up ignoring a character after they've been \"solved\", and this choice really hurts the game's later parts. Like, don't get me wrong, the individual character endings were written very well - and not just \"well for a game\", I mean [i]regular well[/i]. Each had a good climax, their conclusions ranged from very dark to sugary sweet, and there was an ending in particular that made one of our voice actors cry like a little bitch. However, instead of building up to some grand finale in which you successfully figure out how to utilize a limited amount of time to facilitate a single ending that solves everything, the game basically just concludes with \"now that you've solved everyone else's problems, let's fix this big one\". It tries to drop some reveals that tie the various plotlines together, but rather than producing a playthrough in which these threads weave together on their way to a satisfying conclusion, the reveals are thrown in as a veritable afterthought in the final scene. \n\nAnd the worst part is, there actually [i]is[/i] a very specific combination of actions you can do that will keep all the main characters alive until the end, even without the game remembering your previous playthroughs. Similarly, there is a specific combination of actions through which you can make every main character [i]die[/i] before the end - and the behaviors it requires are [i]much[/i] darker than the so-called \"evil\" ending, which basically just involves [spoiler]being a socially inept idiot to everyone[/spoiler]. There was an amazing opportunity for the game to build on these de-facto best/worst endings, letting them both be taken even further (e.g. [spoiler]using Remy's death to take down Emera, or figuring out the big reveal about Remy's daughter and using it to save Anna[/spoiler]), but this is foregone in favor of best/worst endings that are almost completely untied from your actions in that playthrough. And yeah, I [i]get[/i] that there is an in-lore explanation for that occurring, but that doesn't change the fact that a potentially cool puzzle ends up being ignored in favor of what is basically achievement hunting.\n\nWeaknesses in the gameplay may have been more acceptable had the writing been better, but much of the writing falls into the trap of being [i]intolerably[/i] verbose, especially early on in characters' arcs. Like, I'm struggling to keep this review within Steam's 8000 character limit, and I [i]still[/i] found this game way too fucking wordy. There's more than one scene that's just people arguing in a circle for way too long about who should do something, as well as a couple instances where someone asks if you understand a concept, only to explain it to you in great detail [i]no matter what you reply[/i]. A disappointing amount of the dialogue is just a miserable slog through a character explaining something you either don't care about or have already heard. There's one main character I feel is built around this premise as a character trait (complete with numerous dialogue options to call them out for it), but way too many other characters that inadvertently fill the same role. \n\nIn general, the game offers a choice between either A.) sitting back while a character explains something in excruciating detail, or B.) telling them to shut up and go to hell. What feels strangely absent are options to [i]push the conversation forward[/i] when it gets stuck on something uninteresting or redundant. Like, if someone is delving into a lengthy explanation of the shitty real-time-strategy game they're going to make someday, there are [i]tactful[/i] ways to move the conversation forward - e.g. saying that you'd rather just experience it when it's done, and ask what they need from you to complete it. Or, if someone is embarking on a daunting sojourn to explain their complex theory of time travel, moving the conversation past that should be as simple as the words \"You mean it works like in Chrono Trigger?\". I get that the main character is a biologist/sociologist who would be interested in a lot of these topics, but their education should also enhance their ability to confirm they understand what people are saying, and push the conversation to the next point. \n\nAdmittedly, the verbosity was probably more detrimental for us than most players, since we were actually reading the dialogue out loud for an audience rather than skimming through it at reading speed. But even read ordinarily, a lot of the dialogue just feels unnecessary, avoidable, or sometimes outright detrimental to the mood of a scene. I mean, if a mortally wounded character is trying to tell you something before they die, they [i]really shouldn't[/i] start at the very beginning of their long backstory - especially when the important parts are in the last two sentences. There's an urgency there that just doesn't get conveyed. \n\nLike I emphasized above, this is not a [i]bad[/i] game. I feel bad [i]rating[/i] it bad, since a lot of the writing in it is disconcertingly good - much of it in places the average player will never see, like being an ass to someone after you've become their most trusted confidante. If it had either a better metagame or more concise/avoidable dialogue, I would rate this very well. With the absence of both those things, though, I'm settling on Not Recommended. It's something with shockingly good parts for what it is, but they're too buried between flawed things. I think most people I could recommend this to would get hung up on the flaws before they ever saw the parts I liked. \n\nBut I guess it's a worthwhile purchase if you're an exposition fetishist who wants to fuck a thirsty dragon and then be sad when everyone you love is murdered in front of you.", "timestamp_created": 1489393645, "timestamp_updated": 1489583477, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 114, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745910", "comment_count": "19", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30477672": {"recommendationid": "30477672", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094393007", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 806, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512394464}, "language": "english", "review": "A very great game!!

Compared to Hatoful Boyfriend's, the endings are really lacking in making them feel really different from each other. The real difference between the ending are which character shows up, other than that they take place in the same place and usually end up the same way, especially the bad endings.\n\nA feature that is in other visual novels is the skip/fast forward. While im not sure how other visual novels use this besides, Hatoful boyfriend's where it's just a fast forward that will go through all text and stop at a choice or scene change, this game uses both skipping and fast forward. The skip is very useful on repeat playthroughs when getting endings but can be annoying when trying to get everything because when you skip if you got the good choices, it will automatically pick those if it involves a character. The fast forward is useful when getting all endings and achievements since it will stop at any choice and it will also stop when you get dialog you didn't see before no matter how small it may be.\n\nThe music is good but not exactly memorable . It's there as background noise and to help with whatever mood the game is making. While compared to Hatoful boyfriend, each character has their own music which, even though it's just stock music, really helps the characters stand out.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game especially if you don't look see this as a buy it as a joke game and just see it as a visual novel where almost all the characters are dragons instead of the generic anime girl who has boobs.", "timestamp_created": 1488864080, "timestamp_updated": 1488864080, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517389", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30354791": {"recommendationid": "30354791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125605091", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1043, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488978344}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is certainly something, in a good way.

In fact, as long as you don't outright hate dragons and visual novel format games... You'll probably like this game!\n\nThe story is wonderful. It's a tad cliche at points, but the game seems to be at least a little bit self-aware of said cliches and it doesn't detract from the story as a whole.\n\nThe five dragons themselves are fantastic, believable characters.\nThe music is pretty good, with plenty of variety! Although I wouldn't call it super memorable since there's just so much of it, that's not really a minus.\nThere's a surprisingly high level of immersion in this game that I honestly didn't expect from a visual novel about something so... 'out there.'\n\nIt's not without its flaws, every now and again a drawing or background might look slightly out of place, and you can start to notice the limited amount of art for some of the less important characters.\nThere's also an incredibly stupid \"\"feature\"\" that only pops up once that i'm aware that prevents you from undoing a decision you make. This decision is completely 50/50 whether or not you pick it and forcing the player to stick with that decision is something I wish I could kick someone in the stomach for.\n\nHowever, that's a very minor criticism, and it does go away and let you choose the correct option next time.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game an 9/10.

It does well I think and I was interested the whole time. There are some really nice twists that will blow your mind and it continues even after the first playthough. You have to kind of conform to the characters to figure what they want.\n\nAlright, let me touch on the artwork. In game it is OK. The animations are hardly animations though but it does well to illustrate the story. There are some detailed works that are done really well. You get to see them when being introduced to a character and throughout their stories. The art style as a whole can vary but it is not to dramatic to be a distraction. (at least not for me)\n\nThe sound track is nothing to brag about but again it does well to set the mood for each scene by being subtle and pleasant at times. \n\nSo yah, everyone has said it, this game will kick your heart right in the balls. And you have to play through all of the so called \"good\" endings to get the true ending. \n\nHalf the game is the dating sim. Which still is necessary for the full playthough. It is fun and very PG-PG13. They all have some unique kind of story but also follows their character. The dateable NPCs are kind of unique, as in they wanted everyone to have a character that they could like. My only question with the dating sim is why add the character Lorem? He was about as exciting to \"date\" as a fish out of water, with little depth and no real satisfying ending (happy or sad) it felt like completing his story was more of just a grind point to get to the true ending. \n\nPros-\n Plot story and character stories (80% of the whole game)\n Still artwork\n Dragons :3\n A really good variation of dragons\n Repeatability in order to complete all the endings\n Adine is the best\n You get to go gay for Brice\n You will laugh and you will cry\n\nCons-\n You have to date Lorem to see the true ending\n The deluxe pack is not worth it\n There are a few points that do not transition well, NO.1 being at the end of everyone's \"last\" date.

dragons there is and a few colors there is along with all the characters there is and with the customization there should be 2 able genders in the customation so the possibility to marry seb or bryce

If you are, you'll love it.\n\nI do think it requires at the very least a modicum of open-mindedness. With that, though, you're going to have a marvellous time!

I figured \"It's probably some cringy garbage, might as well pick it up\". While the artwork can sometimes be a little to anime-esque for my taste, the story is phenominal.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about this game is how it doesn't necessarily forces interaction with the main characters, but encourages it. And when it comes to it, all the characters have their own pasts, what makes them... them. It's a touch you don't see in most run-of-the-mill visual novels. Most authors and creators have an approach of \"MAKE THIS GUY LIKE YOU, MAKE THEM HATE YOU\" etc. AWSW wraps the mystery of the story cleverly with the pasts of Bryce, Remy, Adine, Lorem, and Anna to the point where you WANT to get to know them better. And that is a key stand out for the game.\n\nYou WANT to know them. You WANT to find out what is going on. You WANT to solve the mystery. But you don't technically HAVE to.\n\nAll in all, this game is phenominal. After buying the original game and choking up a multitude of times, I went back and purchased the Deluxe Edition because holy HELL is the soundtrack terrific. It's one of those tracks where it works very well with the tone and style of the game, but is not offputting to listen to as a stand-alone. \n\nMy verdict on this game is: Buy it.

Nachdem ich also ne halbe Stunde durch das nervige Steam-Interface gew\u00fchlt habe, bin ich \u00fcber diese kleine Kuriosit\u00e4t gestolpert. Der erste Eindruck war, zugegebernerweise, etwas mager. Ich dachte, das Spiel w\u00e4re wieder nur einer dieser trashigen Dating-Sims, nur eben mit Drachen. Aber da ich ansonsten nichts gefunden habe, was mein Interesse geweckt hat, und ich an sich dann doch irgendwo ein Herz f\u00fcr VNs und Drachen habe (Mystische Wesen sind nun mal mein Crack), riss ich ein weiteres Loch in meinen Paypal-Account und... habe mir ein anderes Spiel gekauft. Tja, das war Anfang des Monats, das Spiel hab ich inzwischen zur\u00fcckgegeben, und mich \u00fcberkam nun wieder das unangenehme Gef\u00fchl der Langeweile. Also dachte ich mir: \"Was solls, probierste es einfach mal aus.\" Ich bereue inzwischen wirklich, diese Visual Novel nicht fr\u00fcher gekauft zu haben. Es erinnert mich wirklich etwas an die Geschichte mit Undertale. Ich sah das Spiel f\u00fcr 10\u20ac, sah die positiven Bewertungen, aber kaufte es erst nach ein paar Wochen mit der Voreinstellung, das es M\u00fcll w\u00e4re. Nun, am Ende entpuppten sich beide als eine der interessantesten Spieleerlebnisse, die ich seit l\u00e4ngerem hatte. Ich g\u00f6nne beidem die Verk\u00e4ufe, und schreibe deshalb auch die Review in Deutsch, damit ich vielleicht ein paar Gleichsprachige, die sich noch nicht sicher sind oder sein werden, zum Kauf dieser tollen VN \u00fcberreden kann.\n\nNat\u00fcrlich muss man sagen, das dies eher ein Nischentitel ist. Wer mit VNs und/oder Drachen nicht viel anfangen kann (oder einfach zu faul zum lesen ist), der wird hier wohl auch nicht wirklich seinen Spa\u00df haben. Allen anderen m\u00f6chte ich es wirklich ans Herz legen. Die Charaktere und ihre jeweiligen Storylines sind toll geschrieben, und es macht Spa\u00df, die Geschichte jedes Charakters herauszufinden. Der Mord-Mystery-Part ist spannend umgesetzt, und h\u00e4lt einen auch nach einigen Playthroughs mit neuen Entdeckungen und Informationen bei der Stange. Mein einziger Kritikpunkt in Sachen Charakteren sind die \"Romanzen\". Bei einigen Charakteren f\u00fchlt sich dieser Aspekt eher an, als ob man eine enge Freundschaft anstatt einer Romanze aufbaut. Das ist nicht wirklich etwas schlechtes, aber doch etwas schade, wenn man bedenkt, dass dieses Projekt seinen Anfang mit dem Titel \"Dragon Dating Simulator\" gemacht hat. Aber wer wei\u00df, vielleicht wirds im Sequel st\u00e4rker umgesetzt werden *wink wink nudge nudge*. \n\nDas Spiel arbeitet viel mit Zeitreisen und deren Einfluss auf Geschehnisse, d.h. man wird die allgemeine Haupthandlung mehrmals wiederspielen, wobei bei jedem Playthrough die Geschehnisse aufgrund deiner Entscheidungen und Ereignisse ver\u00e4ndern, und da bietet die VN dank ihrer tollen Story und Charaktere einen gro\u00dfen Wiederspielwert. Zwar gibt es bei einigen Stellen ein paar Ausrutscher, wenn z.B. etwas angesprochen wird, was zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch garnicht stattgefunden hat, aber ich pers\u00f6nlich finde, man kann dr\u00fcber hinwegsehen.\n\nNat\u00fcrlich will ich nicht nur \u00fcber die Story sprechen. Die Musik ist sch\u00f6n und setzt sich gut in Szene, und die Artworks sehen gro\u00dfartig aus. Alles in allem eine gelungene VN, bei der ich an keinem Punkt bereut habe, meine 10\u20ac ausgegeben zu haben.\n\nAlso, wer sich noch unsicher ist, dem kann ich nur sagen: Hau raus. Wer mit der Pr\u00e4misse etwas anfangen kann, der kann bei dieser Visual Novel eigentlich nur gl\u00fccklich werden.", "timestamp_created": 1488042685, "timestamp_updated": 1488217236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.514558", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30170220": {"recommendationid": "30170220", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122932312", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494348280}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Cuando lei un poco sobre este juego, no dud\u00e9 en ning\u00fan momento compr\u00e1rmelo. Se trata de una novela interactiva, mezcl\u00e1ndolo un poco con un \"simulador de citas de dragones\". Y la verdad es que no me ha defraudado en nada. Hablando de la novela como tal, se podr\u00eda clasificar f\u00e1cilmente dentro del g\u00e9nero de ciencia ficci\u00f3n. Eres un humano que act\u00faa como embajador dentro de un mundo poblado por dragones, pero adem\u00e1s podemos hablar de portales, tecnolog\u00eda avanzada, ciencia... La verdad es que este componente ficticio se trata muy bien, y est\u00e1 presente a lo largo del juego. \n\nRespecto a la jugabilidad, no hay que esperarse mucho. Es una novela audiovisual, pero tambi\u00e9n te tomar sus propias decisiones (el conocido como \"efecto mariposa\", como dir\u00eda yo, aunque no se la verdad es si resulta apropiado). Las decisiones que tomas con un personaje tienen sus repercusiones en el futuro, ya sea aumentando su amistad con  \u00e9l o incluso, llegando a ganarte su odio o en otros casos m\u00e1s remarcables... Su propia muerte.\n\nEn lo que respecta a la parte de las citas, es cierto que muchas de ellas tienen sus puntos. Algunas resultan mucho m\u00e1s \"picantes\" que otras, otras tienen referencias a X cosa, resultan amenas... Pero puedo decir como m\u00ednimo que enfatizas mucho con algunos personajes. Las personalidades de algunos (especialmente, de los principales, aunque es cierto que tambi\u00e9n se dejan entrever las de algunos secundarios) est\u00e1n muy bien tratadas, pr\u00e1cticamente siendo la de cada personaje \u00fanica y diferente.\n\nComo contras... A los jugadores que no sepan ingl\u00e9s no se los recomiendo (de ah\u00ed la parte de \"novela visual\") ya que un juego de lectura en ingl\u00e9s en la que la historia, as\u00ed como las acciones que tienes que tomar, todo se presentan en ingles, y es algo realmente pesado para aquellos que no est\u00e1n adecuados a este idioma. Por otro lado, siempre puede ser un refuerzo positivo para aquellos que lo quieran practicar un poco. Al ser un juego que se basa en el ensayo y el error, adem\u00e1s, puede llegar a ser un poco mon\u00f3tono, a pesar de tener la opci\u00f3n de pasar determinadas escenas ya jugadas).\n\n\nEn pocas palabras, se lo recomiendo a todos aquellos jugadores que quieran pasar un buen rato, tom\u00e1ndose su tiempo y disfrutando de esta novel visual y... Que le gusten los dragones.\n\nDesde un punto de vista personal, he de decir que, como he dicho antes, enfatizas mucho con determinados personajes, llegando hasta el punto de pr\u00e1cticamente haberme emocionado mucho con... Determinada historia.

I want to draw a parallel between both of these stories, though.\n\nBoth games use mystery to drive the plot and encourage you to explore the characters around you, but where Danganronpa focuses on a battle of hope and despair caked in psychological horror to motivate the player, Angels WIth Scaly Wings does this through compassion and curiosity alone.\n\nTo avoid spoiling anything, I'll simply say this:  I have not shed this many tears over a story since Undertale and I expect to shed many more, both joyful and sorrowful.

Not just the major ones but so do the minor ones and you can even have a meeting with these minor dragons and see more of their character.\n+Both the plot and world building of this game is finely turned. The world feels like it's a world tailored for dragons rather than just the dragons you see and the plot has an interesting mystery behind it that further unravels hidden depths with each ending.\n\n-The backer characters and creator made characters are a bit different in art style making them stand out a bit too much. It's only minor compared to the other two flaws though...\n-The protagonist is overall a weak character. I can understand what the creator was going for, he was trying to go for a midpoint between a vague character which the player can project themselves into and a defined character with a distinct background and personality. This backfired, the protagonist knows things and has plans the player doesn't which increases the disconnect and with the character not being too defined to make them more relatable, we overall have a flat main character we feel more like we're a guide to rather than in the role of. And while visual novels can usually get away with a faceless protagonist, there are two incidents in the game which would favoured the protagonist having an avatar.\n-The last issue is linked to the final ending of the game. While most endings have good payoff, the last one does not answer enough questions raised by the game. This was ripe for a \"Where are they now\" ending that would fit perfectly! Hopefully an update in the future fixes this issue. (I won't go into too much issue about this issue as that would be major spoilers)\n\nOverall, this is one of the better visual novels I have played no question but it's hard to get the two noticeable flaws out of my mind.

If you have a dragon you like and you get to the parts where you learn more about them, you do actually gain a lot of insight into how they became the kind of person they are today and why they'd be so suddenly desperate to want to be a part of your life. A lot of them are really human, like Bryle and... um... Adile I guess. Which was kinda nice because from that point it was one of those stories that just felt like a people story but replace people with dragons. \n-the art is pretty alright (for the most part.) while it's true that the art has a tendancy of being inconsistent, I attribute that more to laziness on  those few moments rather than the game as a whole. Drawings of characters, backgrounds, and those really uncomfortable sexy pans all look nice and I never felt any ire toward them. \n-The story was weirdly consistent. Spoiler alert: If you wind up getting to the part where you learn you're in a time loop, you may notice that each character's ending contributes to the story differently. New events may happen and entirely different people may die or live causing your character to have to take different actions when returning to the previous timelines. Those even present themselves in other endings (not in order, but that's not a bad thing.) and you can piece together when things happened. That's a neat touch. \n-I like the ability to skip through scenes you've already done in subsequent playthroughs. Really saves time because the game is actually surprisingly long for the genre. \n- the game is really fun to achievment hunt through. There are a lot of achievments and side things to do. It's a nice touch \n- Spoiler alert: You can get remmy to kill himself. That's pretty cool. Fuck that guy. \n\nCons: \n\n-On your first playthrough when you're trying to learn about the world, you run into a moment that shakes everything you've been thinking that whole time without even meaning to. Spoiler alert: until around the chapter 3 arc, you assume you're just some guy from earth. Probably our earth. Your buddy dresses like a normal dude, and you're just some guy. It turns out that your planet was struck with solar radiation equal to the equivilant of 1.3 billion hiroshima bombs and pretty much destroyed humanity when it was at it's most vulnerable. I'm gonna ignore forever that 1.3 billion hiroshima bombs would wipe out the earth (just 1 almost wiped out a population.) and instead get to the fact that you had no reason to believe you came from an apocolypse. It is straight up explained to you that you come from a mad max world and all semblence of reason and logic have flown out the window as everyone is scrambling to fill unnamed and made up power vacuums. (not the story making them up, society is. Which is fine.) So then why are you a normal dude, and your partner is also basically a normal dude? Sure, he goes on a murder rampage, but who wouldn't? The problem is, he didn't seem like the kind of guy who would. \n\n-Some of the art is really bad. Characters like Lorem and the college guy suddenly have really gross, heavy outlines around them that clearly seperates them from the more restrained rest of the cast. That includes Sebastion who stands right next to Lorem in Lorem's first scene. \n\n- There are two really weird moments when your character is uncharictaristically rude to people. The first being when you meet the college guy, and the second being your fourth scene with Lorem when he offers to buy you pizza. \n\n- the \"friendship\" meter or whatever in the status bar should probably be represented outside of checking the status bar. Mostly because of trying to get the good ending for characters like Anna. \n\n- I'm not a fan of the fact that if your relationship with anyone turns \"bad\" for any reason, you can never talk to them again. You can't even try to bring it back to neutral. Which is a shame, how you can sway a character to be your friend again after they decide they don't like you is often a great way to learn more about what kind of person they are. I'm not saying every character needs it, but Bryle certainly does, and so does Remmy. Probably Anna as well. Actually, absolutely Anna. \n\n- there's a very uninteresting plot dump with a character in a mask at some point, and to really give you a feel for how long it is, I want you to grab a stop watch and get to that scene on your second playthrough. Don't skip the scene itself, but after you're asked to skip the scene, hit the fast forward button where it just shoots through the scene as fast as it can. You'll be amazed at not only how long that scene is, but also how few times anything visually changes. That's a good half hour on your first run at least. \n\n- I think Maverick could have used more flushing out. I found his character the most interesting but you only learn about him in snippets. He has the most to lose and the most investment in what's going on. Hell, you even go to a barbeque with him like nothing's wrong and I just want to know what he's thinking. \n\n- For some reason, only in interactions with Remmy, you can continually solicit him for sex. You're never given that option for any other character, so I'm made to believe it's cannon that your character is most sexually attracted to Remy. I wouldn't even have a problem with that if there weren't only two characters you could have sex with, spoiler alert, and remmy isn't even one of them. \n\n- I think Lorem's story and progression in general are very weak and poorly handled. Which is a shame because I liked his character in meetings 1 and 2. He came off as someone who had goals and was new to exploring them. Then in 3 it's like \"let's have a treasure hunt.\" and you do and learn nothing about Lorem in it. In 4 he comes to you with an existential crisis that sounds completely out of nowhere, then you solve it, then he comes at you with a second existential crisis that also comes out of nowhere and you resolve that too. \n-Lorem's good ending is incredibly bullshit to stumble upon. \n\nConclusion. \n\nI'm only clicking \"not reccomended\" because I genuinely wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone but people who think the pros are ok. I had fun with it, I'm sure you'll maybe have fun with it. The main cast are all so interesting and varied in their own ways you'll find someone you like... but that's about it.

Although the gameplay essentially consists of selecting options from a text box, this does not in any way take away from the excitement created by making decisions that can dramatically alter the storyline and the fate of your character. It is also worth noting that there are a few puzzles in the game, which are entertaining yet simple. The soundtrack offers some variety and is reminiscent of standard video game ambience with a few sound bites that bring the action to life.\n\nThis is definitely a game you will need to play more than once to get the most out of it. The game boasts a total of 11 different endings, which sounds like quite a task. Luckily, the game makers kept this in mind and after your initial playthrough you are able to access a skip button that allows you to pass dialogue you have already seen and stops when you must make a choice. You also get the option to skip certain scenes entirely, which you \u201chave passed in a satisfactory manner.\u201d This option however will skip the minor choices, which could impact your relationship with characters, but not necessarily the ending.\n\nRead the full review here - http://www.gamingcypher.com/angels-with-scaly-wings-review-for-pc/", "timestamp_created": 1487113216, "timestamp_updated": 1487113216, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501661", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29927078": {"recommendationid": "29927078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243589030", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 226, "playtime_forever": 1161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499627058}, "language": "english", "review": "A very good visual novel with great art, a very facinating story and Unique characters \nand lets not forget about the alternate ending giving you a reason to play it more and more\n its a 10/10 for me\n\nthe only thing i dislike is the music which is kinda repetitive but i kind just turn off music so its not really a problem for me\n\nand FYI to whoever thinks the dlc brings more stuff to the story it doesnt ....its just art, music and behind the scenes stuff", "timestamp_created": 1487100024, "timestamp_updated": 1487100024, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.468066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29926758": {"recommendationid": "29926758", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982902089", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489182317}, "language": "english", "review": "Went in for the dragons, stayed for the surprisingly solid writing and art.

Come in, read a bit.\nAlright, this game is one of the few that I'll actually review. This game is HUGE (in length and scope), so I'll only break down where it stands in relation to most modern games, and suggest this to anyone who is tired of games that pander to you, and try to be what you want. This game doesn't care what you want, and it'll make you love it for what it is.\n\nThe short and sweet:\nThis game breaks down what human society is, with a focus on intimacy. Intimacy is an integral part of any society, and AWSW, beyond anything, nails that. As well, for any lover of sci-fi, Isaac Asimov himself might as well have drafted the technical details. You can eat your heart out, Mass Effect.\n\nThe not so short and barely sweet:\nAWSW approaches science fiction and character relations in a way no AAA game would dare, or really has. There is no magic here, and if you see a plot hole, chances are you're not reading the text. There are also adult themes, but nothing explicit. The character are who they are, not token insert personalities, and no dumb excuses are made for characters who do conform to stereotypes. The characters don't need a reason to be a certain way. some do, some don't. And boy, when I say maturity, do I mean it. This game just barely escaped Mature ratings by being indie, but it's not about mature stuff. Intimacy is an integral part of any society, and this game nails that. Once again, eat your heart out, Mass Effect.\n\nSTORY:\nOH MAN. \nif this is what you want in a game, play this game. no spoilers here, except that it's a sci-fi, and approaches the entire topic with a thouroughness only expected of Isaac Asimov himself. Bravo. This is the only area where the game truly shines.\n\nThe characters can be a little bland or stereotypical, but beyond that, they each have their own charm, and a personality that feels substantive. They make decisions, and rope you along, and some aren't afraid to be a little rough on you, emotionally. There are a couple quick inserts from high sponsors, but that's a given, This game needed to roll in something just to release at this quality. With more funding, their stories may be expanded.\n\nART: \nwith the exception of a few assets, the art here is fantastic. Most visual novels use blurred out photos, but for the most part, the backgrounds here are handmade in a variety of ways. It was clear, though, that if it had gotten maybe five times the funding(the entire thing was made with under 12k to fund two years of development), Full animations may have mde it into the game.\n\nMusic is a bit odd at times, but truly fits the themes, I would have liked a bit more variety, Though, too much would be a bit overboard-calm is good here.\n\nSound assets are absolutely fantastic. As a sound designer, I would love to know how they were obtained. They're used very well to puntuate the story, without being obtrusive.

It\u2019ll have a storyline that\u2019ll grip you in and have you awake all night, telling you to play the game until you\u2019ve found the true ending. It\u2019ll make you cry when a tragic event happens to your favorite character.

I with many others felt as if this was rushed. A true/final ending is supposed to ensure satisfaction in that you have finally finished your long and tough journey having to witness the hardships of life and death while even feeling emotions of sadness and hate. Sure, this ending revealed all the secrets we needed, but it didn\u2019t give us insight on what happened to the main dragons next. Let\u2019s not forget that one character that constantly dies in all of their endings. If the game gave us an insight on what their happy future looked like, then we\u2019d definitely be satisfied, but I guess that\u2019ll have to wait in a mod or potential sequel.[/spoiler]\n\nAlright, now here comes my rants on other reviews. I\u2019ve seen some short reviews of \u201cThis game was fun and I loved it.\u201d, but going onto metacritic, there were some pretty bad and misleading reviews from actual critics. Why were they misleading? *sigh* Because this game didn\u2019t have enough \u201cadult content.\u201d This game already DOES have enough adult content, look at the darkness this game give! You certainly wouldn\u2019t find this dark stuff in a T for Teens game. Unless they are complaining about there isn\u2019t enough sexual content in the game, then they shouldn\u2019t be critics at all. If you wanna wank off to a game, just use the tag \u201cSexual Content\u201d on steam and then find a game to wank to, or just get an account on a rule 34 site and let your inner preschooler out. End of mini and pointless rant.\n\nWith that being said, this game certainly changed me. Though I\u2019m taking a break from this community for reasons why, I\u2019d certainly recommend others to try this out for themselves. This is certainly a game worth getting into a conversation with friends and family about and telling them how they should try it as well and see what they think.\n\nMy total score?

Either way don't let the trailer trick you. \n\n= Seriously you can spend days on this game and eventually grow pretty attached to it\n\n= The game will also send you into one big emotional rollercoaster, rocking you up and down making you wonder whether you have packed your stuffs for that feel trip \n(that was so bad, I'm sorry xD)\n\n= Overall: 10/10\n= For a 10-buck game I can say it's worth it (at least to me)\n\n'Aight so let's move on to some pros and cons:\n\n+ The plot is just ... wow. I gotta say it's [b]big[/b].\n+ Charles Dickens should be proud of how good it thickens.\n\n+ The artworks are just decent\n+ The ingame arts are even better as they reflects the mood of each characters pretty well\n- On a side note, [spoiler]Remy seems to be blushing in situations he shouldn't be blushing, uh...[/spoiler]\n\n+ The music (might not) seem very impressive / memorable at first, but it fits the feels perfectly and you may just grow to like it before you know.\n+ [spoiler]Check out Zhong's records, tho. Maybe those tracks could change your mind about the music entirely[/spoiler]\n\n+ The skip mode is pretty neat and awesome\n- The transition between ingame art and cutscene art is quite bugged?\n- Or sometimes when you're skipping, the animation on the cutscene/background art will keep going while the ingame art stays still.\n\n+ The characters are pretty unique\n+ Like, can't you see how adorable / handsome / beautiful they are?\n+ [spoiler]Would go gay for Bryce any time[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]How come I can't date Sebastian? He's a rather cute guy for a police officer <3[/spoiler]\n\n+ I love how the game deals with some of the more... unconventional matters. [spoiler]Probably to keep the protagonist gender-neutral[/spoiler]. And [spoiler]there are no pornographical materials, you perv. Unless you count a censored pic as one.[/spoiler]\n\n+ I also love how a lot of lifestyles / identities / orientations are presented in the game. Kinda like how all the characters come from different walks of life, but regardless they're still treated the same (based on their personalities, of course. Eg. you're hated for being a jerk, not because of who/what you are. [spoiler]otherwise you're pretty much screwed since you're a human and not a dragon like the rest of them[/spoiler])\n\n+ It's much like our world.

As much as I'd hoped to be after waiting 2 years of my life for it. I really, really wanted it to be a 10/10 game. I still like it overall, it starts off strong and does a few things right, but it falls flat halfway through and has some serious, glaring problems. Though it is important to remember that this game was basically made by one guy with outside contributions, and it's pretty good for a 1-person indie game. If you just want to buy it for the sole fact that it's the only non-vaporware dragon VN in existence, it'll be worth your money. But there's not much else keeping it afloat. [b]Warning:[/b] Very mild first-hour spoilers ahead. Proceed as you will.\n\nThe biggest issue I found with this game is one that I've seen many times before, in games like Wildstar and Abzu and every Blizzard game in the last 10 years: it doesn't know how serious it wants to be. You can already see what I'm talking about by watching the trailer video in the store page, which plays again when you start the game. The music is muted, the text is all dark and melting, and it parades a bunch of pastel cartoon dragons in front of your face, juxtaposed with \"deep\" and \"profound\" words like \"black holes\" and \"somatic barrier\" and \"refracture syndrome\" with absolutely no prior effort made to make those words actually [i]mean[/i] anything to the player. It just kinda struts around like it's as complex as The Great Gatsby without actually [i]doing[/i] anything to earn that complexity. Honestly, the first time I saw it I burst out laughing. Compare this to the trailer for, say, Undertale. Most people who played it feel that Undertale is a really deep and touching game. Yet, you see how upbeat and ideologically humble the trailer is? Undertale was a game that worked in part because it knew how serious it wanted to be. It was self-aware of its own cartoonish nature and allowed the meaning to come out through humor and personality and breaking the 4th wall rather than trying to make things super down-to-earth and logical. And don't get me wrong, realism is an equally valid angle. But you have to go all in on it, which this game does not, as explained below.\n\nOnce you get inside, the pattern continues. When you first get there, you're a [i]literal alien life form[/i] that represents a scientific revolution. If that happened in our world, there would be an entire army designated to retrieving and guarding it and the portal it came from. The dragons do start off in a [i]generally[/i] realistic direction, transporting you under cover of darkness and assigning you a personal bodyguard, but then not even [i]one full day[/i] goes by before they just start letting you walk around by yourself, in broad daylight, and start giving you your own authority over their intelligence department. Few if any people stop to question you. The entire police department and general populus just kinda has complete, unwavering, undeserved trust in you from day 1, even after they see the actions of the only other human on the planet. \n\nAnd occasionally they'll randomly flip flop back to serious, when it's convenient, like when your bodyguard can't walk you home because he has to \"write a report\" [spoiler]\"Day 3, stayed inside writing reports instead of protecting the priceless alien again\"[/spoiler], but in general the citizens of this world don't adhere to any logical system. In fact, one of the main antagonists in the game is a \"bad guy\" for being the only cop who actually cares about doing his job and questioning what he's told. [i]Everyone[/i] gangs up on him for it. How can I take the game seriously if even the characters themselves don't? It might seem petty, but these kinds of little details matter in order for the world to feel grounded and consistent, which is a prerequisite for a genre like murder mystery that depends on such overtones.\n\nMoving on to the next major issue. As I said in the overview, the game starts out strong by introducing you to lots of characters and environments, but after you play through it once with your favorite waifu/hazubando it begins to feel very, very empty. The general story stays exactly the same through every single character, with the only difference being a handful of personal 1 on 1 scenes with them. And then you have to go through all their bad endings, which change even less. Your character's behavior adapts very little, and the ultimate point of your being there never changes at all. Most of the important information is hamfisted to you in an excruciatingly long neutral scene on your first playthrough, with no tact whatsoever. Environments get recycled from the neutral scenes. None of the characters are interconnected for any reason that affects your present actions in the story. Ultimately it results in this hours-long meaningless grind you have to go through to see the true ending. Which, though I won't spoil, I will say was short and underwhelming and a [i]lot[/i] more could have been done with it. It has no longevity and little growth other than the occasional extra paragraph of text.\n\nThe last thing that's really wrong with it is the software itself. There are typos, even though the release was delayed an entire month explicitly to iron out things like these. There's an \"Idle Mode\" button in the main menu that doesn't actually work and doesn't check the box or do anything if you try to click it. And though this won't affect you if you're just now purchasing the game, achievements that were earned on launch day (1/31/2017) don't show up in Steam unless you reset your entire save file. And it's not my responsibility to delete everything I did just for Steam credit.\n\nBeyond that, there are some things that are either a mixed bag or just entirely neutral. For instance, the artwork at times is really good, like in the backgrounds or the gallery images that the game gives you for connecting with certain characters. Then there are things like the sergal student dude [i]almost[/i] knowing how to smile, or Lorem being weirdly undershaded compared to everyone else, or Remy looking like an amorphous bloodsucking worm about to consume your face in one of his personal scenes. The music is largely the uninspired gentle piano that you hear in every VN ever. The overall plot is passable and contains a couple genuinely surprising twists (the first time you hear them), but won't make you feel like you \"learned\" anything or \"changed\" at all from completing the game.\n\nNow for the things it does objectively well. Firstly, it managed to create actual in-canon continuity between individual playthroughs (even though it's only utilized to a token extent), something I've never seen before in a VN and something that was very fluidly incorporated. It also invented its own card game with classic 4 suit playing cards, or at least showcased a game I've never seen before. It had a few cute and humerous moments. And of course, it did what so many of us have been longing for for so long, what no other game was brave enough to do: satisfied our need to date dragons. The creator of this game saw that something people wanted didn't exist, got off his butt, sat back down on his butt (in front of a computer) and [i]made[/i] it exist. And he actually finished it. It's easy to take that for granted now that it's all said and done, but that alone is commendable.\n\nOverall, this game is far from perfect, but I think the pros outweigh the cons and I would recommend shelling out the 10 dollarydoos to play it. For a first major game produced largely by one guy, it's amazing, and I look forward to seeing what he makes in the future (especially a sequel). Solid 6.5/10, one of the best JRPGs to ever come out of triple-A gaming. \n\n[spoiler]Sebastian is not fully dateable, -500/10 worst game ever made by anyone.[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1486618422, "timestamp_updated": 1486618422, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.556027", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29795124": {"recommendationid": "29795124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086049805", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2251, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512284406}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally have feelings again. \n\nI definitely recommend this game for anyone who loved hatoful boyfriend.

Sure, maybe the writing is not always up to its full potential (e.g. overexplanation), but that I can easily overlooked here.\n\nI found some topics raised to be bold in a positive way and while this is not a pornographic game - really, NSFW content would take away from it - the creators manage to get the right amount of innuendo, grown up humor and difficult topics in there to make it a well rounded experience.\n\nThe settings, the artwork, music, details about how the different species cope with their strengths and weaknesses in daily life, show me that the makers of this game gave a lot of thought to it.\n\nUltimately a game like this lives and dies with the characters, though (pun intended) and wether or not I can empathize with them. I can only speak for myself here of course, but I will say this: I could easily empathize with them and I want them to survive and be happy. In fact I have to admit that at one point I wanted the good ending of one character so badly, that I looked up the steps in a guide here and discovered that this character\u2019s plotline can go a third way and I know I will never have the heart to chose this third route for him. \n\nI like how all of them have a reason to be the way they are and that these backstories can be found. It is these interwoven fates together with a lingering threat that makes it a thrilling and captivating experience.\n\nThe technical realization seems spotless to me. The game allows to easily skip over passages of text and scenes that have already been seen, allowing for rapid repeated playthroughs. Autosaving works great and I did not encounter a single bug yet. In general the makeup of the game is very fitting and sympathetic (UI, sounds etc.).\n\nNeedless to say that a game like this is not for everyone, but I am not even half through and got more than my money\u2019s worth out of it. Surely it helps a lot when you like dragons, I mean, what other audience does it aim at?\n\nI already gifted the game to some friends and bought the deluxe edition upgrade, because it well deserves supporting\n\nThe game raises the right topics and sent me on an emotional roller coaster more than once. After all it does not go easy on the player.

This is my first time doing a legit serious review so I'll start the basic stuff then later on the more nitpicky stuff.\n\n\n[h1]First Thoughts[/h1]\nFirst of all, I never thought I'd ever play a visual novel where it would involve dragons or let alone see one, kinda niche like Hatoful Boyfriend (which I have to [b]PLAY MORE[/b] altogether, but it doesn't do justice with save and loading unlike Ren'py, will explain later), and by niche I mean, this one's more aimed towards scalie lovers/enthusiasts. Me, being one actually sold on me.\n\nWhen I opened the game first, seeing in-game FMV on Ren'py software was basically the first to ever happen, at least on my eyes, thus the in-game's trailer sold me even further. So my expectations were \"I am going to have a good time with this visual novel\".\n\n\n[h1]Artwork[/h1]\nSome of the artwork was really nice... but in pure honesty, what hurt the most was how mixed it was.\n\nMaybe the artstyle on the Gallery was meant to be entirely different, which I approve, it gave it a nice tiny touch and feel to the characters when unlocked at the end. But my major complaint is how mixed the scene vs full-body portraits vs the backgrounds were. It felt like a huge pile scattered all over the place, mainly the backgrounds; some being 3d rendered with Google Sketch, some being fully drawn well, and some just \"What am I even looking at?\".\n\nBut knowing how some visual novels do the same formula for artwork, I'll let it slide under me. It only works when done extremely well. FYI. I'd massively improve the backgrounds and the character full-bodies.\n\n\n[h1]Character Development[/h1]\nThis was the heavy hitter and it did wonderfully amazing. I have never felt satisfied how from each character; from bad ending to good ending [spoiler]even to the true ending[/spoiler] do this emotional connection with you. Really made me remember some of my friends, and feel bad for their current issues trying to fix in the end.\n\nSome of the good endings made a small impacts in me, mainly [spoiler]Anna's Cancer[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Remy's Adoption[/spoiler].\n\n\n[h1]Story Development[/h1]\nHonestly, this has a lot of ups and downs. Let me start with the story progression, it feels wholesomely linear at the start until half-way then it starts to branch just a bit. At the end [spoiler]with the whole time travelling[/spoiler] and [spoiler]multiple timelines[/spoiler] it started to feel more of a treasure hunting chore with less story telling and more trial and error choices. The character \"romancing\" events smoothed that issue out, sometimes.\n\nIt did a good way to tell and express how the dragons lived and communicated, how humanity was being faced with, etc. So I'll give it bonus points for that.\n\n\n[h1]Player Choices[/h1]\nIt can be improved, honestly. Some of the choices were either too outlyingly obvious or massively crude. While it meant to have some comedic/shock value, it didn't do some of its job well. (See Investigation #1)\n\nThe painful obvious choices were too easy to discover even if the PDF about Making Dragonland said it was meant to be \"to make you think\", what I said about Story Development is the same way how I feel for the choices and clashes well. Also the neat little spoofs (Yeah RIP, et. al.) were fine when thrown sparringly, but don't overuse it. Otherwise it becomes more of a meme game simulator with dragons.\n\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\nI'd say this is some rather amazing soundtrack, really fitting for a lot of the scenes. I'd totes buy the Digital Deluxe Edition for $5 extra bucks to listen the track for a few hours.\n\n\n[h1]Other Miscelaneous Parts[/h1]\nSince I don't wanna go too much on detail with these parts, I'll give it my short summary:\n[list]\n[*]The PDF in the Digital Deluxe could have been better, I suppose, more in-depth would have made it amazing.\n[*]The [b]System[/b] was a quirky way to add something was in control. [spoiler]What made me get scared at the first time is how it broke the \"game\" by telling you that this is a corrupted timeline, a la Undertale.[/spoiler]\n[*]Like most Ren'py software, it gives you lots of save slots, which Hatoful Boyfriend lacks of and its massively needed for visual novels like this.\n[*]The main menu/pause template is god-like amazing, probably the best for a Ren'py software.\n[*][spoiler]The Secret Ending puzzle was just eh, probably because Ren'py failed to render the buttons and images properly since there were a thousands of them displaying at the same time; giving so much fps drops and delays. I had to cheat there since I gave up with the software being this broken. Sorry guys. :([/spoiler]\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Veredict[/h1]\nQ: Can this game be improved?\nA: Yes, a thousand yes. Improve the story development by making it a bit more branched, make sure the artstyle has some consistency and if it is meant to have a difference then don't make it [i]clash[/i] within the gameplay, and improve the choices with less cliche and niche options. After those 3 issues are fixed then the game is perfect for my eyes.\n\nQ: Do I give this visual novel my thumbs-up?\nA: Despite being dragon enthusiast and not wanting to feel like this is one-sided... yes I do give this visual novel my thumbs-up, it made me last longer and made me play until I [b]101[/b]% that game.\n\nQ: Do I recommend it for others?\nA: While it has some niche moments, just don't take it too seriously and think its a dragon dating sim because this game will throw you off really hard. There are some questionable scenes and content throughout, if you are not a fan of it then I don't recommend it. Otherwise, go nuts.\n\nQ: Did this visual novel reached my expectations?\nA: One word, yes.

I apologise.)\n\nThis was quite a surprising game to be honest. I obtained the game as a gift from a friend, though I would've bought it myself too as the game has motherfrickin' dragons in it. I've never played a visual novel before, so I went in expecting it to be something like the infamous Hunie Pop, as it was the closest thing I had to it. Boy was I wrong though.\n\nAngels with Scaly Wings started off with a simple yet interesting premise, before quickly blossoming into something much more complex. The characters were wonderful to intereact with. Sure, they aren't anything unique, but the game made me love and respect them. The art style was appealing and cute, and overall I was very invested in the game.\n\nFor those who don't want minor spoilers, I'll say my overall review here. I'd give it a good 9/10, as it genuinely made me feel things, and I yearn for more. Happily, the developers hinted at more being made, so who knows. If you're a person who likes dragons, or likes getting a bit deep in lore, or even likes getting attached to characters, I'd recommend this game to you. \n\n-Minor spoilers from here on, mainly pointers of what you'll be getting into-\n\n\n\n\nNow, these aren't major spoilers or anything, but if you want to go into the game completely blind, then don't read on. So, one thing I didn't realize at first is: You will not get the best ending the first try. In order to get the best ending, you have to keep playing until you have every character's good ending. Another thing: The game will toy with your emotions if you like these characters. It is NOT kind in this regard, and will screw with your feelings. The story will quickly spiral into something much more complex than it originally seemed like through little exposition moments, so you'll want to pay attention if you want to remember it all. Thats about all I can suggest, really.

I hit the character limit and couldn't fit them into this post)\n\nSomeone bought a friend of mine this game as a gift to troll him, and after watching the trailer, we thought it was corny and might get a laugh out of him playing it on the big screen. Having played several visual novels, already (mostly on console or handheld, I'm not big on PC), I somewhat knew what to expect and was curious about how this game would handle its premise. I mostly expected it to be laughable, semi-pornographic bait, and was ready for it to be either amusingly bad or over-the-top in obviousness of how badly the creator would have been attracted to their own characters. \n\nInstead, I was treated to a much more thoughtful and wordy experience than I could have expected. Within an hour of him starting his game, I was already asking him to stop so I could go and play a copy I'd just bought, privately. For the next few days, I was hooked, spending huge portions of my day playing it and finding myself deeply involved in both its story and characters. I kind of ended up falling in love with the game, and it's arguably my favorite visual novel, at this point (provided you don't consider Shu Takumi games visual novels, just adjacent to them). \n\nAngels with Scaly Wings is a visual novel that is a tad more verbose, grounded, and dry than many of its peers, but I feel this ultimately works in the game's favor, in some ways. I know it may sound ridiculous to call a game with a muscular Dragon wearing a police badge around his neck who you can engage in relations with \"grounded,\" but I genuinely believe its characters to be far more founded in realistic, down-to-earth personalities than that of comparable games who typically lean toward ridiculous exaggerations of their personality types. While most other VN's with dating sims element reduce their characters to their appropriate \"type\" (i.e. tsundere, genki, nerdy), I feel like this one had a lot more depth and facets to its characters, should you be willing to sit through a lot of relatively ordinary conversation with them. \n\nFor many, I'm sure this means they'll complain about the characters being either too boring or too uninteresting (I'm sure some will call the characters by their stereotypes - alcoholic cop, clumsy introvert, etc.), but I feel this is because the game is more focused on fleshing out the characters through dialogue and companionship than it is defining them through larger-than-life events you'll experience, together. Despite an overarching plot that contains a lot of intense drama, most of your time spent with the characters defines them through mundane experiences. You're never offered particularly dramatic moments to prove yourself to them, and your relationships are strengthened almost exclusively through emotionally compatible dialogue. \n\nFor me, this is a wonderful change of pace and allows me to feel closer to the characters - it's almost as if they were people I knew. For most people who play games to feel constantly empowered, I feel like this might leave them cold and having less empathy towards the characters because of the lack of forced drama allowing them easy opportunities to feel more superficial connection. For example, another visual novel might allow you an opportunity to stand up to a bully to protect an introvert and use that as a point of bonding with them - in Angels with Scaly Wings, however, simple opportunities to quickly build character like that are largely absent and replaced with lots of talking about yourselves. \n\nFor everything you see in the world that doesn't initially make sense, you'll tend to get a (generally lengthy) explanation for it. Dragons using human-looking furniture and buildings was rather ridiculous to me, at first, and something I was having trouble dismissing, even though it was likely just an excuse for environmental art to be easier. It does end up being explained with well thought out reason, however, and so do most other indescrepencies and loose ends. It tends to do so in casual dialogue with characters more than it does in huge exposition dumps, leading a lot of it to feel naturally explained to the player, rather than beaten over their head - of course, there are still some large exposition dumps.\n\nLike many visual novels, this one tends to work on a mechanic that revolves around restarting your experience with minor knowledge of previous events, and it uses this narrative device much the same way that other games that use this do. If this is something that tires you, by now, I can't say that you're really going to be turned around on the concept. I understand why they used it, however, and feel like it does ultimately end up adding to the story - but this is a personal feeling, and at the same time, I feel like it's almost impossible to use a device like this perfectly elegantly. Subsequent playthroughs become more about dating, and lose a significant amount of the grip that the drama had their first time around, because you're skipping through what you've already seen. The game is, at least, very good about its skip features. \n\nI found the art done for the game to be perfectly adequate, and didn't find problems with the quality differences being jarring, as some others seem to have. The dragons are cute, the detailed transitions in more serious moments are nice despite the obvious change in artists, and, overall, I felt it to be a largely pleasing game from a visual standpoint. Full disclosure, here - I'm a furry, and though not really a particularly big fan of dragons, I do like them. Whether or not you think this indicates a bias is up to you, but I've played through several visual novels I've enjoyed despite not liking the character designs (I nearly loathe the modern anime aesthetic, especially how it depicts women), and feel like I would have still greatly enjoyed this with worse art or human characters. \n\nThe music is also surprisingly good, and there's a shocking variety in the amount of tunes to keep things from ever getting stale. Some compositions feel like they were banged in an hour or two while a few others feel as if they had more work put into them, but the sheer number tends to ensure that if you don't like a few songs, you're going to be rarely hearing them, anyway. Many lower budget visual novels often suffer for trying to find someone to score their game and end up losing a lot in terms of mood, but there's a definitive victory scored here in terms of both quantity and quality. \n\nUltimately, I feel like you should pick the game up or give it a chance if gripping, somewhat slow-moving drama with surprisingly rounded characters is your type of thing. Or, y'know, if dragons are your thing. Cuz this game's sure as hell got dragons. I honestly found myself growing significantly more fond of the concept of dragons over the course of playing the game, and felt like the overall tone of Angels with Scaly Wings was one of compassion and empathy. More importantly, it's about such sensitive things without constantly beating it over your head, and it develops them slowly, subtly, and for me, ultimately more meaningfully. While there are moments that player avatar compassion feel forced, and the game obviously leans toward you doing good, I feel like this doesn't diminish the work put towards those positive feelings being ultimately genuine and with more depth than its peers.", "timestamp_created": 1486331044, "timestamp_updated": 1486334255, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705169", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29713441": {"recommendationid": "29713441", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075631566", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2877, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492574413}, "language": "english", "review": "Allows me to enter a polyamorous relationship with five to ten dragons.\n\n10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1486284803, "timestamp_updated": 1486284803, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541730", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29710844": {"recommendationid": "29710844", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106216084", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504072820}, "language": "english", "review": "If I had to summarize the game in one sentence, it'd be this:\n[h1]THE END IS NEVER THE END[/h1]\n\nAnyway, I got more out of this game than any of the TellTale one I've played, so you get the idea of its polish.", "timestamp_created": 1486273402, "timestamp_updated": 1486275473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.482176", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29710356": {"recommendationid": "29710356", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985273280", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486651775}, "language": "english", "review": "This game ended up being a roller coster of emotions in all the right ways.

I came to see the dragons, and I have had a rather enjoyable experience with it. First off, let's start with the usual ratings:\n\n[u][b]Graphics[/b][/u]\n\nFirst off, I will say that the backgrounds are rather well-drawn, with nice vivid colors. The characters' artwork might not be top-notch quality that you'd find coming from popular artists at, say, DeviatArt or other similar gallery sites but I found them to be very reasonable and pleasant. The \"cartoon\" style fits well enough, and outside of Reza, it is nice to see very little if any anime influence (nothing against anime, I just feel it is overdone).\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n[u][b]Sound[/b][/u]\n\nMost of the audio in the game that you will hear, is ambient soundtracks, though there are sound effects that are sparsely added in during some scenes. The sound effects are about what one would expect (though the gunfire sounds a bit quiet and distant, even if it should be close-by). The music, though... there were a few earworm-ish tracks in the game that I rather enjoyed, and even those I didn't notice straight away were pleasant enough. No complaints here.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n[b][u]Controls/Gameplay[/u][/b]\n\nThere's not much to say on this subject, because this is a Visual Novel afterall, however I did find the Skip Feature to be cool, it allows you to replay the game without having to spend hours reading large text dumps of things you've already seen. The only thing I wish they had done, was give us a rewind ability, or the ability to replay a chapter if we screwed up, or forgot something but that's a minor issue. It isn't too hard to be lazy for the rest of the playthrough if you missed something, and if you use a lot of skips, you can get through a whole playthrough in <5 minutes so I suppose it isn't too big of an issue.\n\nScore: 7/10\n\n[u][b]Difficulty[/b][/u]\n\nIt's not easy to try to rate the difficulty of a Visual Novel, however with this being a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" type deal, there is a small amount of difficulty in figuring out how to get each character's Good Ending. Some of them, from the sounds of a guide I leafed through, are somewhat obtuse. I'm going to avoid spoilers here, but the game makes it clear from early on that there's never a situation in which you are going to die outright. Other people you care about.... well, that's a different story. I feel that the game isn't too easy, but yet isn't too hard either, even if I feel that some of the puzzles are a little on the obtuse side. But then if you check every single possible combination of things you're allowed to say, you'll eventually suss it out. It's more of a battle against your patience, really.\n\nScore: 7/10\n\n[u][b]Story[/b][/u]\n\nI saved the most important bit for last: the game's story. Average players who aren't passionate about Visual Novels should enjoy the game's story for what it is, but enthusiasts and hardcore story people might not like the plot holes the game presents. It is difficult to explain without spoilers, but the game places you (or, well, the character you play as) in a position where the player might wish to do something that he/she knows he/she should be able to do, but the game simply does not allow that option (it could be difficult to code? Don't know the reason). This opens up a plot hole, because to be quite honest, the in-game character [i]should[/i] be able to do the things the player would think up of... but can't, because the game doesn't give the choices to do it.\n\nSome of the game's events would/should be hugely affected by this, to the point if it weren't for limitations with the game itself, the entire story could be turned upside down if only the game would allow.\n\nHowever, I don't think that is such a huge deal, but people who are hugely into story and don't like plot holes might not enjoy that aspect as much. I'm willing to hand-wave it, but YMMV.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n[u][b]Overall[/b][/u]\n\nIs it worth $9.99? Well, that depends on two things:\n\n1). Do you respect work that is put into a game?\n2). How much do you value $10?\n\nThe artwork and music alone is easily worth $10. You can tell the game's developers crafted the game with care and love, and they put forth a genuine effort to give us a game to enjoy, and a story, world, and characters that we could relate to, connect to, and immerse ourselves in. Despite the aforementioned plot holes, I found myself developing an attachment to at least a couple of the characters in it, and I find myself re-playing the game again and again working for that \"True\" Ending I know must surely be there, as I'm missing many achievements just yet.\n\n****Please read the update below.\n\n$10 these days barely gets you a lunch, but buying this game gives you a memorable experience. I would recommend it to anybody who likes dragons, who enjoys fantasy, and those who are willing to hand-wave minor imperfections in a story's plot. The game's story easily leaves enough room for you to insert your own headcanon, and I think that adds to the value of the game itself.\n\nShould you give this game a try, I do hope you will enjoy it as much as I did!\n\nUPDATE 02/05/2017: So I've played through a couple more endings, and the aforementioned \"Plot Holes\" are not actually plot holes, the reason behind the way things are is actually explained in a reasonable way in the game universe, well, kinda. I still feel there are options that are not covered, but the plot holes are nowhere near as big as I first thought. I was actually impressed that they did actually explain it, BUT, you only see this explanation in one (maybe two?) of the endings, so it is easy to miss your first time or two through the game, depending on who you take a liking to the most.\n\nUPDATE: 02/09/2017: After seeing 99.9% of the game's content, including the two secret endings, I very highly recommend this to anybody who likes visual novels or even just plain novels. This game gives you a nice vibrant world/universe, concepts, and characters that you can easily go wild creating headcanon for. This experience will remain with me for a long time, long after I've exhausted the game's content. I might come back a time or two and do another playthrough, though like many visual novels, replayability is not particularly high once you've seen all the stuff. But still, it was very fun and highly recommended for people who like this type of material.", "timestamp_created": 1486189285, "timestamp_updated": 1486671152, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550021", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29684497": {"recommendationid": "29684497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029264030", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 966, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487030422}, "language": "english", "review": "Ever since I saw this game on Indiegogo, I was sold.

The characers weren't bland or drawn out, but made me care for them, and the fact that anyone of them could die or lose favor in you made it seem personal to try and save them.\n\nWhat threw me off was the inconsistant backgrounds: some would be painted and drawn, other looked like they were thrown through Maya or Blender. Maybe cause drawn or painted took to long or cost too much, I'm not sure.\n\nSomething that I've seen too, in a ton of visual novels, is when a game mechanic or feature is mentioned by the characters, trying to play meta.

I even feel as if I risk something by having my friends see this, but honestly I don't care. This game has had an impact on me.\n\nWhen I first got told about this game from a friend of mine last night, I was already interested since it involved dragons and the reviews were all positive. Something about the game initially felt as if it was going to be a waste of money... although I see now that it definitely was not. After playing through around 3/4 of a single run I decided to go ahead and stop playing for the night. I sat in the main menu for a second, listening to the music, realizing how much significance the backround for said main menu meant for the storyline. I felt like I was doing something wrong in stopping the game at that moment and even thought \"Man, how much I would give to see a real dragon like the ones in this game\". So I played for another 30 minutes before eventually falling asleep.\n\nToday I managed to finish the ending \"Adine's bad ending\" and boy, it really WAS a bad ending. It left me completely shocked as [spoiler] everyone that I had gotten to know had died right there in front of me. All carried out in detailed images of my favorite mythical beings shot to death. [/spoiler] Believe me, the developers (Or developer) have done an amazing job planning out the many plot lines, personalities, artwork and when to use the right music. You get so attatched to the characters that when something bad does happen, it hurts you as well. The way the game responds to previous decisions also works really well, the humor is enjoyable at times too. The \"status\" tab in the menu proves to be very helpful if you want to see how your relations are with others. At this moment, I have finished 2 runs and I can easily say that this game is one of my favorite games I have ever played. \n\nSure, it might have some assets where you can 'date the dragons' as the devs say, but I think that is just how you get to know the characters better. All in all, I have enjoyed this game and plan to finish all of the endings. I feel like the developers have made a game about these creatures that I have come to love. Dragons have been a thing I have been interested in for nearly a year now, and it is good to finally see a game that provides such an amazing storyline centered around them. I hope this convinces some people to buy this game, even if you feel skeptical like I was.\n\nEDIT: Bryce is certainly my favorite of all the characters. Or maybe its Maverick. \n\nEDIT #2: (Contains spoilers about Maverick, don't say I didnt warn you) [spoiler]Maverick is an interesing character and seems to have gone through a lot of trauma especially after having to kill his brother due to a degenerative disease that he had.. It was quite sad to see this scene play out on its own. The other problem is that there is no real way to befriend Maverick to help him through what he went through happened. He just stays being cruel to everyone along with not trusting the humans. In one of the chapters in the beginning, it reveals the \"hint card\" of Maverick lying down on the ground with the word \"Loss\" under it, reminding me of him loosing someone he loved to something he couldnt possibly control. The last thing is that in end of every path, he either dies horribly with two *detailed* shots into his head or he ends up threatening to kill the main character because you did something that is extremely bad for him (causing Bryce's death) or you end up shooting him yourself for attacking The Administrator (probably the worst of them all for me).This essentially means that Maverick dies living a cruel life of killing his own brother at a young age, losing the trust of Bryce who is one of his best friends, never really getting to prove to everyone that he was right about the humans (except the part where you shoot him) and ending up losing his girlfriend because his job was taking up most of his time. [/spoiler]\n\nSorry for those of you who are annoyed by a big wall of black text, but this is literally killing me as I cant sleep without thinking about the game. I just wish there was a way to get Maverick to trust you, and help him along through his suffering. Hopefully the devs read this and think about adding some DLC to the game that adds more content, because as of now I feel like I cant do anything.

However, my negative review still does not change as I have a very hard time seeing someone who isn't a furry having an emotional attraction to a dragon (It's like asking a furry to have a relationship with a human.) This game would best belong on another platform other than Steam, and I believe the price is incredibly high, shown namely in the mediocre art styles and free music as the soundtrack, when the developer raised well over 10k euro on IndieGoGo alone. A smaller price would be better accepted, maybe around $5 USD. The story is predictable, so buy this game if you want a dragon dating sim.\n\nAbove all, this game confuses me.\n\nAs a rather avid fan of dragons, I picked this game up release day not knowing what to expect. Well, I did expect a rather generic visual novel with dragons as the main interactions in game. And I did get mostly that.\n\nHowever, this game has some really nice storyline work, and while it is a very popular concept (You're thrown into another world with a huge conflict to solve, and you can either save it or f*ck all of the NPCs) the developer uses dragons as actual story elements, and even though there isn't a lot of depth in the story, it doesn't feel like a cash grab.\n\nArtwork in general is praise-worthy. Most of the drawings look great, especially the backdrops. I'm not too fond of the faded-out looking backdrops of typical visual novels. In this game, you get a sense of where you actually are, so not all of the attention is focused on the characters.\n\nAnd now for the bad bits. While the art is nice, it awkwardly switches styles at sometimes. While I do understand that this was to put less of a burden on the artist and add more character expressions at a lower price, it's rather annoying. The soundtrack is nothing special and I certainly wouldn't consider purchasing the special edition upgrade. The characters themselves are cookie cutters. They act exactly how they look, and don't have much depth to them. The nerd is the nerd, the muscle is the muscle. Finally, the main issue I have with this game is that it doesn't do too much to stand out. [b]Without the dragons, this visual novel would be nothing.[/b]\n\nUnfortunately, I can't recommend this game. Despite my love for dragons, most of the characters failed to grab my attention. Like I said before, dragons are what this game uses to stand out, and yet at the same time they are its biggest flaw. I applaud the developers for putting so much time into this game, but they put that time into making a dating sim and less of a \"compelling sci-fi visual novel.\"\n\nSo why am I confused? I don't know who this game is trying to appeal to, the average visual novel player, or the furries and scalies. If it [i]is[/i] trying to appeal to the latter, the store page certainly doesn't sound like it.

It's true, that as a person with a dragon for a profile icon that I'm biased, but if I encountered a stranger on the street, and somehow magically knew that said stranger would consider buying a visual novel/dating sim, I would recommend this game even if their full name was Human-Muggle McNotascaly. \n\nThe Good:\nThe characters are all great and I adore each and every one of them, even the ones I hate, with the possible exception of Reza. He could have done with more characterisation (we see him one time in the beginning and one time in the end despite his critical importance)\nThe story follows in the best traditions of soft Sci-Fi. The world they've built is incredibly interesting and I can't help but entertain about 20 'what if?' stories surrounding it. I really, really hope the creators build off of it in future projects. That said, it's about as soft as sci-fi comes, so be sure to check any education in physics or cosmology at the door.\n\nCriticism:\nI would have liked a few more scenes with characters. Two more would be fine. As it stands, the time budget is a bit too strict and you can't really explore your options beyond a love interest and a friend-friend (of course, it has multiple endings so multiple playthroughs are expected)\nThe pacing of the story could be a bit more even. You seem to spend a large part of the game in a holding pattern as far as the plot is concerned. This may just be a quirk of the genre\nCertain situations could do with some more dialogue options.

Not perfect, and not really saying much since we're 2 months into the year, but easily my favourite game so far\n\nActually, somewhat badly spelled review:\nSo, as of writing, I've put 8 hours into the game. Gotten 2 endings, a bad and a neutral one. That's just 2 of 13 endings, so keep in mind what I say may differ between endings, and quality may change. I dunno, I haven't seen everything yet.

As I mentioned before, the investigations were a really fun thing that I enjoyed, but there just isn't enough of it to enjoy.\n\nYou seriously do not get enough of a choice. I understand that you can't write something for every single possible choice, but there are probably 2 or 3 times every hour where I disagreed, or outright hated, what my character chose to do, and it was almost always something that I could have had the choice to say. (For example, in my bad ending, my character decided to go back to his homeworld, fucking literally everything up despite another character giving them a perfectly valid other option that, whilst not perfect, would of been better. I guess that's where the other endings come in though, if so I'll probablt retract this point when I get to those endings)\n\nOverall, whilst I have bad things to say about it, I honestly don't think it's bad overall. Just assume that everything I didn't mention here is basically perfect. It has it's annoyances, probably due to my own fault, but it's still fun. It's the only visual novel that's really made me want to get all of the good endings\n\nPS: If you were wondering, no, you don't actually get to fuck the dragon, or, there's no images of that happening anyway\n\nThere is no porn here you filthy thing you", "timestamp_created": 1486064569, "timestamp_updated": 1486406808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29652756": {"recommendationid": "29652756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003994421", "num_games_owned": 193, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511029445}, "language": "english", "review": "I finally got the True ending after 25 hours of gameplay (I got adicted to it after buying it the day it came out). \n\nI have to say that this Visual Novel game was well worth the $10 I payd for it, and then some!

This made me laugh, cry, become shocked, cringe, and so many more various emotions the deeper I got into it. Not to mention how fustrated I got at times with Resa.

But that just makes it all the more incredible in my eyes, because in reality, the same is true. Little decisions can have huge impacts, while bigger ones are rendered useless by circumstance. There aren't a lot of obvious \"right\" or \"wrong\" answers, which forces you to make decisions based on what you think is right, rather than what you think the creator thinks is right.\n\nThe characters are really well-done actually. Each main character has plenty of personality to them and are really quite unique when compared. Of course one of the main draws of this game is you get to date dragons, and while I can't really give you details on that, because experiencing it yourself is the best part, I can say that you won't be disappointed. While there is certainly [u]no[/u] [i]explicit[/i] sexualness, [spoiler]I can guarantee there is at least one (optional) [b]steamy[/b] shower scene[/spoiler]. [spoiler]And yes, that was a pun.[/spoiler]\n\nThe music was fitting, and quite nice to listen to, but my standards comprise of Undertale OST, Terraria OST, and the original Halo trilogy OST, so don't expect too much praise from me in that regard. And on that note, the SFX was really well-implemented; it was never over-the-top and always added to the scenes, either to set the mood or just because it seemed to fit.\n\nOh, and while I'm mentioning Undertale, if you've played it, you'll be familiar with the whole 'actions carry over despite loading save files' mechanic, and 'actions from previous playthroughs affect the next one'. Yup, expect to see a fair bit of that. In fact, one of my favourite parts is that you can skip over lengthy exposition dialogues you've already read before, or scenes that have been done to a \"satisfactory standard\" in subsequent playthroughs.\n\n(Edit: Just realised I completely neglected the story, so I added this in) I'm a sci-fi fan, and consider myself pretty science-savvy, so believe me when I say this game's storyline is coherent and completely plausible. The author does an excellent job of explaining everything in an easy-to-understand way, so even if you're not an ultra sci-fi fan, the chances are you're still going to understand the whats, hows and whys. I wouldn't go so far as to call the story totally unique, but it definitely puts a few twists on any cliches and adds in some very original ideas that I've never seen before. And plot twists, a few of those too.\n\nMy first playthrough took me ~4 hours to complete, and the remaining playtime was me trying to figure stuff out; getting different endings, playing different character routes, getting all the achievements (trouble synching them with Steam atm). In fact, at least an hour or two of it was me staring at the screen, thinking really hard while I tried to uncover some hidden little secrets within.\n\nFor the content it provides, it's worth the money, in my opinion. I didn't even want to play the other character routes, but the story is so enrapturing that as soon as I did, I changed my mind. And of course, some of them have their secrets and may not be who they appear to be...\n\n\nAnd on that note, I conclude my review. Hope y'all enjoyed it.\n[spoiler]Adine is the bestest most adorablest dwaggy waggy in the entire world[/spoiler]", "timestamp_created": 1486015096, "timestamp_updated": 1486125393, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546588", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29642188": {"recommendationid": "29642188", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161779314", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510447418}, "language": "english", "review": "this game.... feeling is real. it makes you conntect to the characters in a way most games have forgoten to do it acually makes you sad when it ends cause it is a reality that you connect to on a emmotional level. if your thinking of buying it just be prepared some of you might cry some of you might not i can not say but one thing i can say is that you will feel connected to them emmotionally. number 1 on my game list.i must ammend this due to a recent discovery of the true ending of game... it ended and this is the type of game you dont want to end. i have playedthis game for hours on end and in that time i have come to love the characters in it theirs storys their pasts... their struggles you learn them all you love them all and in the end when you see the final true ending... it changes you this game... its not a game its a work of art this is somthing no one else has ever tried or if they did nothing will compare to this game. you cant not love them every time you play through a new ending with every choice you make for better or worse you learn and in doing so you become part of the game.... if i ever wanted a game to made into a vr type of game or even better this game made real i would do it in a moment everything about it is a work of art.. please if the creator reads this and if my words can do anything let it be one this please keep making games like this and i promise you will allways have atleast me buying them and thank you this game.... is somthing no other game can do", "timestamp_created": 1486011784, "timestamp_updated": 1486104947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508052", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29642163": {"recommendationid": "29642163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021841506", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3303, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492884525}, "language": "english", "review": "I for one, dislike visual novels, after a horrible experience with one of the  \"sakura\" titles.

For a 10$ visual novel, I think it is well worth it.  \n\nThis being said, i aim to write an unbiased review.  \n1) This is a visual novel, centered around a human entering a modern dragon society (nice! this is actually original!)\n2) Besides for a few grammar mistakes (as of 2/1/17) the sentences are well thought out, and the plot comes across nicely\n3)seems to be alot more male dragons, though there are plenty of females (not really a problem)\n4) Involves romancing dragons of various attitudes (premise of the game perhaps?!)\n5) YOUR CHOICES MATTER! The Game will remember your save file!\n6) I was outraged by the story's ending. then i realized.... oh.... time travel is involved. So it may seem confusing at times, but the plot does not stop with the ending you get. BTW, Theres several.\n\nI enjoyed this game. I am not a furry, or any other form of the hobby.

I don't want to spoil too much but this is the most intriguing visual novel I have played yet and there seems to be a ton of secrets. I see myself spending quite a bit more time with this one.\"\n\nThe definitive Corydonn Review~\n\nThe \"You should buy this game\" Pitch\n          I really -really- recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of dragons, visual novels or even just are a fan of games that remember your actions and give you tough consequences to chew on mentally. I bought this for the novelty of dating dragons but I found this game had so much more and few games, Heck even few mediums of fiction rival Angels with Scaly Wings in the emotion giving department. It's hard even to put into words dangit.\n\nGameplay -\n         This is surprisingly good for a visual novel and felt more like a puzzle game rather than just a visual novel you replay randomly selecting different choices to see the outcomes. There are multiple clues to each path if you pay attention and you are given a few tips early on through achievements and the starting sections that sometimes doing the same command can yield different results. I had no trouble going through the game and achieving all I wanted to achieve in the story. I did have an issue where I was missing an item I thought I grabbed long ago but that was of my own fault loading a saved game before I actually saved having the item in hand. A handy status screen was able to point out what I was missing near the end so I could figure out myself on what I forgot to get.\n\nStory/Writing - \n       Definitely the meat and stength of the game. You start out as an ambassador from a world of humans to a world full of dragons. You have five main characters and five minor characters to choose from and multiple playthroughs to do them in. If you can emphasize or sympathize with any of the characters in the game, You are going to have a great time if not one wrought with \"feels\" and deep thought over the actions you take and the events that occur. \n       Another quick point I want to highlight in the writing of the game is that the game has a few characters that highlight a great introduction to many scientific concepts and beginners psychology. If you find yourself liking these characters I would highly recommend doing more research on these topics yourself. The game isn't too pushy about the subjects but does give you geniune interest in some of these very fascinating topics that I think more people should get into.\n\nSound/Music -\n         It's hard to judge the music in a visual novel because unlike a more action based game you really can't put the music to a specific battle or moment. The music was nice and atmospheric but not too memoriable in that if you gave me all the themes I doubt I could match them to the scene or character. There were also a few issues when using the skip commands to fast forward where the music and sounds would become a bit interlaced but moving onto the next chapter or section would have the reoccuring sounds vanish and the game would play normally.\n\nThe Bottom Line-\n       I really think this game has a good shot at being my Game of the Year for 2017 for PC even though it lacks multiplayer, a competitive aspect, or much action at all.

The kind of Visual Novel that I actually enjoy playing. A community that has changed my view towards this game over the months.\n\n[b]The Game itself[/b]\nThe Game is unique and was the first of it's kind that found their way in my library. I was unsure at first, it was my first Visual Novel and I never knew what I should think about it. A text-based game where you do decisions but nothing else? Sounded boring to me. Well, the first planned hour of gameplay quickly turned into a full night. This game is addicting, it's breath taking and it's quite... bonding. I have to admit I never thought I would enjoy some virtual dragons the way as they are presented here.\n\nWith that, this game has found a place in my heart. The story is simply amazing, confusing and sometimes just very interesting. The way this game plays with your feelings is just amazing. I would have never thought that I would cry because of a game, but I did - plenty of times, tears of both joy, relief and also sadness and regret. If you don't know the core story and this is literally your first playthrough, every second of it is simply stunning. You will quickly realize that this is not just a dating  simulator, but it's a whole story full of sadness, joy, betrayal and bliss.\n\nIf you like Visual Novels, don't hesitate to add this game to your collection. Even if you aren't a fan of dragons, this game has such an amazing story, it's simply worth it, especially for it's price.\n\n[b]The Community...[/b]\nA community that was created by me that now works against me unfortunately has changed my way of thinking towards the game. This is basically the reason why I changed my voting to negative. The way you get betrayed in the game is unfortunately also the way you get betrayed in the community. I do not hate it, not at all... But this community is responsible for the way I think about this game.\n\nDo I recommend the game? Yes, most definitely.\nDo I recommend the community?

I backed it on Indiegogo solely because I wanted to have a dragon dating visual novel sitting in my Steam library for people to oogle at. So color me surprised to find the game was actually pretty fantastic. \n\nThe story isn't completely new, but it did a far better than average job of being believable. A lot of things won't make sense, or will feel contrived until you reach a few \"ah hah\" moments of realization. Some have criticized the [spoiler]time travel[/spoiler] mechanic as overdone, but it was executed very well here. Some of the characters will give you their own interpretation on what's going on, but really what you believe is up to you. I've got my own ideas about how everything is actually working, but I won't repeat them here. You should generate your own opinion about how the whole thing works.\nThe story is also full of tragedy. That's all I can really say. There's a lot of up and down to the experience, and I spent a lot of time just staring at the screen going \"Oh... That's absolutely depressing...\". There's plenty of good to balance, but some of the feels really stuck to me for a while.\n\nThe dragons are pretty human acting aside from some unique behaviors stemming from various physiological quirks [spoiler](this should be expected though, given their origin)[/spoiler]. They all have their own views, personality, and problems. I didn't always agree with their choices and behaviors, but they were all generally likable.\nThe only exception to all of this is Reza. The guy is seriously disturbed and acted unlike anyone I'd like to know. We don't know much about him, so maybe he really does have a good reason for behaving the way he does, but it would take a lot of character development to dig him out of the hole of irredeemable personality traits.\nBut to balance it out, there's my favorite character, [spoiler]Izumi[/spoiler]. I can't say much without heaps of spoiler tags, but suffice to say there's a lot of hidden complexity behind this character, and I wish she had more presence in the game.\n\nAs far as general gameplay, the devs knocked it out of the park. The whole experience is silky smooth, and there's just enough puzzles (both explicit and implicit) to keep you thinking without being a burden. There's a boatload of UI attention to detail, like the skip system and the tarot card hints, that just blew me away. Add on the fact that the game is aware of itself in some circumstances (it's hard to explain) and you just feel like the devs thought of everything. Top notch polish.\n\nI avoided the romance scenes at first because I didn't want them to sour the experience, but after seeing a couple of them I think it's safe to say they're as mild as possible while also doing the target audience some level of service. I cringed harder at the romance scenes in Mass Effect.\n\nSo if you like dragons (even if you don't like them like THAT), alternate realities, mystery, depression, weird game titles to pad your Steam library, or even [spoiler]ice cream[/spoiler], then I can highly recommend this game.", "timestamp_created": 1485922908, "timestamp_updated": 1485922908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.629766", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29617791": {"recommendationid": "29617791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040671155", "num_games_owned": 319, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 1907, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486495549}, "language": "english", "review": "I originally backed this game on IndieGoGo but lost my account and unfortunately had to wait for full release.

As much as I loved books, they just never got to me.\nBut this game appealed to me on all levels.\n\nI am a dragon adorer. I'm fascinated by mythology. I may even go as far as to admit that I believe in dragons. In fact, this game is EXACTLY the \"truth\" I believe in. I won't spoil it.\nI was so happy to pick this up on launch. I'd been dying to try it.\nI've barely gotten anywhere and I've found myself deeply enjoying the story. It is very unique, and has multiple endings by the looks of it, maybe thousands. I haven't ventured deep into the game as of the time of writing.\n\nI quickly met a few characters and began to understand who they are and what they do. They're all unique and also are quite pretty I will admit. I was told by a friend that I [b]will[/b] fall in love with a character.\nHe wasn't wrong.\nI found a character who I felt deeply related to. He's quiet, doesn't have many friends, supposedly doesn't have a family, he's shy, he loves mythology, and he loves video games and aspires to make one. He's literally a dragon version of me! I felt attached almost instantly. I had to get to know him more.\nI progressed to try and understand him to see if my first thoughts were correct. And they were. I feel inticed to discover more about him --- and every other character in this game.\n\nBut I can't bring myself to be mean to people, as that's a given option to do so.\n\nIn this game you can really be yourself. Usually you don't get many choices but I felt like they would pretty much be the generic choices of a person anyway, not something absurd.\n\nI can't wait to delve into this game more and uncover every last word of its multiple storylines.\n\nFor now, I will happily give this game a 9/10 purely for its depth and story, as well as character design. I will update this review as I continue, so stay tuned.\n\nEDIT:  progressed through the game entirely and achieved the ending.

One of the developers recently friended me on Steam, but I don't know them outside the context of bug reporting.[/i]\n\nOn one hand, [i]Angels with Scaly Wings[/i] is a slice of life comedy about hanging out with dragons in their suspiciously humanlike society doing things like getting drunk, playing video games, and going on a scavenger hunt for pizza coupons. On the other hand, it's a mystery where you're trying to track down a serial killer and prevent the apocalypse, and even the good endings are somewhat bittersweet. In some ways, though, that incongruity worked for me, creating an atmosphere where the serious parts weren't too heavy and I was willing to suspend my disbelief for the more handwavey sci-fi elements.\n\nThe art's inconsistent, as well. It's pretty common for character sprites and CGs to be drawn by different artists and even in a different style, but the decision to introduce characters with their CGs before showing their sprites makes the contrast rather jarring. The amount of artwork is nice, including character sprites for even minor roles and bonus artwork that unlocks when you reach certain scenes and endings, but I wish there was also a gallery for the in-game CGs.\n\nSpoilers for story structure: [spoiler]the story is based on a time loop, where you must use the knowledge you gained from previous loops to affect events in this one. Blurring the line between the protagonist's perspective and the player's metagame knowledge of characters and events is an effective way to justify unlockable choices and paths, so even though it might be an overused premise for visual novels, I like it and I don't care.[/spoiler]\n\nThere's more gameplay than the average VN, with lots of dialogue options in conversations, story choices, and a few random minigames. You can skip read text with the tab key or use a menu option to jump past entire scenes you've already viewed, which makes replaying to find all the endings and secrets a lot less frustrating than it might have been. As a fast reader, it took me a little over 10 hours to get all the endings and most of the achievements, and with the exception of one event [spoiler](that stupid sphere in the park)[/spoiler] I found it easy to see the way characters and events interacted across routes and figure out what to do without a guide.\n\nUnfortunately it looks like the demo is no longer available due to changes in the final version, so I'd suggest checking out some gameplay videos on YouTube.

I was partially \u201cinvolved\u201d in the game creation process, providing some idea input and beta testing. However, I\u2019m not financially involved in this project (besides funding it during the Indiegogo campaign). So, this review is based purely on my personal point of view, I also keep it [u]Spoiler free[/u].\n\n[b] tl;dr version for anyone in a hurry: [/b]\nI would recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a nice story with a quite unique touch. I personally really enjoyed the mix of scientific & slice of life aspects. \nThe characters appear authentic to me. The main story was thrilling due to the healthy mix of casual storytelling and drama and the conclusion (or let\u2019s say \u201ctrue ending\u201d) was very satisfying. \nOverall, be prepared for an emotional rollercoaster ride (if you are willing to sink into the story), I can confirm that you can spend at least 10h into this game, but it\u2019s 10h well spend.\n\n[b] Longer version: [/b]\n\n[i]Foreword[/i]\n\nWell, by now I\u2019ve spend about 48h into this game, due to extended beta testing and protocolling. I can say, this was a handful. \nI\u2019m a great fan of Indie games, however, a visual novel is relatively new to me. Therefore, I\u2019ve ended up giving in to the story, maybe more than I could initially handle. However, it was an experience I would like to repeat (and please do not recommend Clannad that\u2019s something I\u2019ve already covered)\n\n[i]Artistic design[/i]\n\nOverall, I was satisfied with the mix of artistic elements. I usually pull music & art together since they generally synchronize in videogames and create a holistic impression. I personally liked the music It was quite fitting in most occasions, not boring over time and changed & transitioned with a healthy pace. \nI also liked the overall art design, I can imagine that it\u2019s quite a challenge to get facial expressions for something like dragons but I feel like it worked out well in the end. Unfortunately, one thing I\u2019ve realized after showing this game to a friend, the art assets are relatively limited and re-cycle a lot. It\u2019s nothing really bothering me, since I know that Indies with smaller teams are usually limited in their resources, but some people might think differently.\nHowever, my personal concern about this would be mainly the fact that some backgrounds appeared to be rather \u201codd\u201d. For instance, while some buildings appeared to be ok in the setting, others, well\u2026 I know its canon but some background choices were too \u201chuman\u201d (weird to say). Thankfully, the irritation is not consistent and only a smaller subject.\n\n[i]Storytelling[/i]\n\nAs mentioned before. I greatly enjoyed the storytelling. The story transition was fitting and not too irritating. I also really liked the individual character design. I felt like every character had their own specific personality and a broad variety of characteristic dimensions. Overall, it was pleasant interacting with each main character. I was also able to feel into their story and understand their motives and viewpoints. Unfortunately for me, this also amplified the drama factor.\nI\u2019ve perceived the story as very thrilling in general, I basically soaked up every different story path.\nHowever, I eventually felt like I got stuck at a certain point. I don\u2019t want to spoil it but I can only recommend you to explore different paths and don\u2019t try to continuously focus on one character.\nBe aware that in order to find the \u201ctrue ending\u201d you might encounter a point where the story telling \u201cdrops\u201d and you find yourself skipping a lot. I\u2019m not sure if this is some common element of visual novels, but something I\u2019ve noticed towards the end.\nI\u2019ve also ended up, being really confused during this game. And I mean \u201cclusterfuck\u201d level confusion. All I can say, Its normal, Its part of the reward.\n\n[i]Conclusion[/i]\n\nOverall, it was quite a story experience. Something I would recommend, not necessarily to all my friends. But to people who like to see something different for a change, like emotional & drama rich stories (or just adore dragons). I think this VN is something quite unusual and I respect the people behind this for having the guts to push it until the end.

I will keep this review spoiler free.\n\n- Game Overview -\nFirst of all what is it? - Angels with Scaly Wings is a Visual Novel (Interactive story if you are unfamiliar with the term) where you are a human ambassador sent through a portal to a world filled with dragons. You are there to ensure the deals and negotiations between the the races go smoothly. You make decisions and hang on as mysteries arise and the relationships you make with your new friends, enemies and\u2026 frenemies? become the one thing you know you can rely on.\nAlso yes you can date dragons if you want but you don\u2019t have to. (I mean it\u2019s a visual novel it\u2019s practically the law you have to be able to date someone in one.) You can stay just friends with them but in my opinion if you do you are missing out.\n\n- Music -\nThe soundtrack is really good. There was a track that I liked from the earlier demos that while I don\u2019t think it made into the final game (I may have missed it) is still in the soundtrack with the deluxe edition! I can\u2019t think if at any times when the music detracted from what was going on and it was definitely enjoyable to listen to and helped set the mood appropriately.\n\n- Art -\nThe art is really nice, if you want to look at some visually distinct and appealing dragons then you won\u2019t go wrong here. Each dargon has a few expressions and they help flesh out the conversations and show how they feel. The quality of the art varies a little bit, the new art seems a little nicer than the older art but it\u2019s not an issue just something I noticed. It\u2019s all still really nice.\n\n- Characters -\nThe characters are all really interesting, they are all unique and complex. It is a really well crafted world. You might meet a dragon and know what they are like as an acquaintance but only through either spending time with them or someone else will you find out what drives them and why they act as they do. This means you will not necessarily learn everything about a character in one playthrough, even if you are pursuing their route or not.\n\n- Plot -\nI can\u2019t talk about the plot without spoiling things, so I will keep this brief. I found the plot engaging, at times tense and while it would be tedious to replay sections you have seen before there is an option to skip sections you have seen before so multiple runs through the story are a breeze.\nI should also mention that each characters story is compelling, None of them feel similar even though each character has interweaving stories. It just works to sell the whole thing as a narrative that you navigate through one piece at time set in what feels like a world that never takes a break even if you do. Each character has unique personalities with their own ambitions and troubles that you find out as you get to know them.\n\n-Length -\nIn terms of length, a single playthrough wont take you very long (depending on how quickly you read), I wish it was a little longer in that regard but with so much replayability it will take a while before you can see everything, I mean there are one or two things I haven\u2019t seen yet despite having completed every major characters story to completion. So I have no complaints about the overall length, it will keep you busy for a good while, I guess I just wish you could spend more with each dragon in a single playthrough.\n\n-System Requirements -\nI should also mention that because it is a Visual Novel it will run on basically any hardware - pretty much if you can read this review you can play it for yourself! (Unless you using the steam app on your phone (I think you can read reviews on it I\u2019m not sure though) but I have heard rumours of an android port of the game in the future so who knows!)\n\n- Final Thoughs -\nOverall it\u2019s a quality experience and as a backer of the Indiegogo campaign it\u2019s great to have finally played it. The team behind it have delivered in full. It is the complete package that is above what was promised from the goals outlined in the campaign. I fully recommend it. It was thrilling yes but also quite dark at times. Also consider the deluxe edition - you get the full soundtrack (Jammin\u2019), a making of PDF (Historical), a fair bit of artwork (C'est ne pas un dragon) and things like backgrounds and icons (Accessorise!)\n\nI also want to finally have a quick shout out to all involved with making Angels with Scaly Wings to say thanks for a great game. (And thank you to the other backers for helping to fund it) I thoroughly enjoyed it and I can\u2019t wait to hear more news from the Devs, whether it be more about our dragon friends (Haha) or new projects.", "timestamp_created": 1485887327, "timestamp_updated": 1485887327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.473989", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29610505": {"recommendationid": "29610505", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121218959", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508631472}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game.

Overall, I would have to say this is a phenominal game, one that is very unique and has a story that is fairly original compared to what we see now adays. I know many of you have read this before, but I bought this game as a joke with some friends, assuming that it would just be some weird dragon fetish dating sim(which dont get me wrong, it has those sexual elements in the game, but it isnt as exagerated as I would have thought.) After my first ending, which took me around 3 hours, I could not get enough of this game, and every story brought happiness, while nearly every ending brought pain and sadness. This journey sends you on a rollercoaster of emotions, and hits you with some twists here and there, and as a whole, I believe that this game had passion and care put behind it.\n\n(THERE WILL BE SOME SPOILERS BELOW, NOTHING MAJOR)\n\nOverall there are 13+ endings(the extra one is a little secret), a good and bad ending for each of the 5 main characters, and then a true, bad and neutral ending. While as you can guess, the bad ending end up with pain and emotional stress, you may not think that many of the good ending send you on a heart wrenching journey full of sadness and emotional trauma. Each of the characters are unique in their own ways, and you truly feel that each one is perfectly hand crafted in order to make this game come to life. While I had heard many negative comments about the true ending, which I feel came from the lack of more, we all want to see happily ever after, but this game only makes you long for more content and interaction. At the end, it tells you to keep your save files for future use, which makes me hope and believe that there will be something more to this game, other than the secret true ending(which is just a slight modification to the original true ending). There are a few side characters, some that you can go on a single date with, some you cannot, and while I would really love to see more about them, as some are very interesting, you cant expect everything from a game with little funding and a small team.\n\nNow keeping in mind that this game only received around $12000 dollars in funding at the end of the Indiegogo campaign, and with that small amount of money(and I assume some personal resources), the creator, M.B Saunders, has crafted something that will go down as one of the most unique and meaningful games I have ever played. In the future, I hope to see what can become of this story, and if the future holds something even greater than this game. When you look into this, you can tell that this was not some kind of money grab, or scam, but a passion project that took passion to create, and today, we dont see this kind of love very often.\n\nThe art for this game could have been better, but there are some illustrated pieces that are a great addition, and the gallery offers images of the various characters that you meet throughout the game, some of which I have chosen to keep as a wallpaper for my computer. The backdrops for the game are fairly well made for a game like this, some are drawn and some seem 3-D modeled, but overall, they fit with the style very well, and help to add atmosphere to the game. The music choice here is wonderful, it adds to the overall ambiance of the game, and the atmosphere it helps to construct is beautiful, and the sadness that it can bring is also phenominal(although the sadness h u r t s).\n\nNow, this game is not for everyone of course, and if the dating sim and inuendos were removed, I feel this could be great story by itself, although without the in depth character interaction the game would seem lacking. There are many paths to choose, some will be great sadness, and some will leave you feeling touched(sometimes literally *wink wink*), but in the end, it is up to you what path you will choose on this great adventure that has been set before you.", "timestamp_created": 1516056010, "timestamp_updated": 1516056010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39350651": {"recommendationid": "39350651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081063675", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3125, "last_played": 1516228228}, "language": "english", "review": "It's just amazing, the whole story. \nThe backstories of the characters, their issues, how they deal with them, how you affect them, how they affect you, finding those little bits that one character said and in another playthrough finding the other character they meant.\n\nDespite the characters mostly being dragons their personalities are very human, realistic and believable. \nThis game covers some very heavy stuff, death will be something that is brought up often and you can't avoid it, push through, learn everything and be ready to have your heart feel heavy.\n\nThe music in this game is largely wonderful, with some tracks that are quite awkward to listen to, but they are very few in the overall soundtrack. The piano tracks are among my favourites within the game. The track Nostalgia being my definite favourite.\n\nI managed to get every achievement in near 20 hours of playing this game and I just want more, the game closes off well, you learn a lot about the characters but it just gives you that longing of wanting to know more. I haven't had a game make me feel this way in ages.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who wants to experience a deep story with much tragedy in it, regardless of if you have any interest of dragons or not, any relationship scenes can be avoided by simply telling the prospective interest that you are not interested or are simply friends, no relationship past being friends is forced for any achievements or story progress.

Mit und mit lernte man die Charaktere kennen, ebenso die Story und immer wieder dachte ich mir \"fuck...\" - \"FUCK\" - \"GODMANIT FUCK SON OF A!\". Irgendwo lernt man die Charaktere zu lieben. Man will nen Happy end. Aber man bekommt es nicht, zumindenst nicht direkt. Sogar die \"Guten enden\" sind verdammt deprimierend.

This would not be a huge issue if the game did not try to explain how it works in detail, but then just won't stay consistent about it. At least it makes more sense than in most other games/movies that i have seen. The \"true ending\" is kinda ruined by that though. They were working on \"the one\" good ending, where everything goes as planned, and they could have just continued onwards until they got it, but then they decide to leave it be after a while.\n\nThe game forces you to date every datable character before you can see the \"true\" ending. Lorem, one of the datable characters, is very useless for the story. You can date him, sure, but apart from that he has no real influence on the story.  Bryce takes a huge part in the story, and even Adine and Remy do some things in the background as well so that i'd say it is justifiable for them. But Lorem... pretty much does less for you than most side-characters. It just seems out of place.\n\nOverall it's a pretty decent game, if it just didn't drag on for so long and had a reasonable ending.

I saw the reviews, everyone said it was great, but I was cynical.\nHowever, being the furry trash that I am, I decided to just go for it and buy the game while it was on sale.\n\nI do not regret this decision.\nFirst and foremost, let me make this clear: This game is not a dating sim, and there isn't any truly lewd content (aside from occasional, questionably flirty text options. No visuals for sure.)\n\nThis game has a plot, a story, and a setting, and a damn fucking good one at that. It answers almost every question I've had, and even blows away my initial criticisms. To start with (Potential spoilers):\nThe opening intro seems heavily cliche'd and rather meh. You're given a simple explanation: Sci-fi future for humanity, humanity finds portal, portal leads to land of anthropomorphic dragons that speak English and have a human-esque society. Seems really coincidental huh? I thought so to... But it's not. My very first criticisms were as follows:\nA: The backgrounds of every scene include human furniture, chairs and such, that very clearly wouldn't be compatible with these draconic species. It'd be awfully uncomfortable to sit down on a human chair with a massive tail behind you, or with four legs.\nB: The rest of the dragon society isn't very dragon-efficient at all. (Most of my criticisms in general were about the sheer convenience of it all)\n\nGuess fucking what?\nThe cheeky dev did this on purpose. There's an actual explanation. This isn't a dumb game made by someone that overlooked a common cliche that most modern media producers fall for as well.\n\nCleverly enough, you aren't told the full story at the beginning. Not even of yourself, or humanity's current condition... You have to learn it by playing futher into the game. And some things, you can't learn without playing it again. The game delves deep into discussions about teleportation, philosophy, time and space, a lot of scientific sh*t I for sure wasn't expecting- and it doesn't do so incompetently. The story is incredibly rich, the options are varied, the choices you make change A LOT of factors, the writing is intelligent and I've only spotted one grammatical error after multiple playthroughs. The few minigames/puzzles that are included are short and entertaining, and don't feel lazily hamfisted into the game. \nMost importantly though, the characters are all three-dimensional (figuratively speaking). They all have motives, pros and cons. Even characters that can initially be characterized as stereotypes aren't necessarily so. The personalities are varied, they act coincidentally human. There's twists and turns about each and every person, how they act, why they do it. It's shockingly well-crafted, it's clear that whoever made this put a lot of love and effort into making their visual novel a genuine visual novel, not just some sappy fantasy story to appease those who have interests in non-human characters.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd give this game a good 8/10 for what it's trying to accomplish, I'm pleasantly surprised. \nI typically justify a game's price by hours in enjoyment. If I can spend at least thirty minutes to an hour enjoying myself per $2, I feel satisfied. For $10 (Although I bought this on sale, mind you), I feel the game is well worth it's price. There were a few moments where I was bored, but the majority of my current playtime and future playtime (I'm still playing it now!) have been mostly enjoyable, and it's definitely one of those games that you quite simply can't stop thinking about, once you're done playing. I've had it on my mind for a while now, even during breaks and such. If you don't like visual novels, the game probably isn't made for you, but as someone who's generally indifferent towards them, I'm extremely pleased!\n\nEdit: For the record, nobody is the bad guy. People will shit talk each other like Anna, Emera, and Reza especially, but when you get to know characters... You learn to understand their motives, why they do things. They all have a reason for it, they all have a reason to be considered the 'good guy', and yet you can blame them for ethical wrongs all the same. There is no clear good guy or bad guy, it's all based on what you think and choose.", "timestamp_created": 1515269386, "timestamp_updated": 1515298326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39125366": {"recommendationid": "39125366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134990120", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 815, "last_played": 1515083277}, "language": "french", "review": "Ce jeu est probablement le meilleur visual novel auquel j'ai jou\u00e9, les personnages sont sympathiques et tu as vraiment l'impression que tu es choix compte Je ne serais pas comment vraiment d\u00e9crire ce jeu sant le spoiler, mais je pense que la phrase \" j'ai pleur\u00e9 pendant 4 jours \u00e0 cause de ce jeu\" sera le plus proche que je puisse faire\n Cependant, j'ai pu observer quelques probl\u00e8mes en jouant  \n  \n\nV attention spoil V\n\n-Ce jeu [spoiler] doit \u00eatre recommenc\u00e9 au moins 6 fois pour avoir la \"bonne fin \" ce qui ne pose pas de probl\u00e8me en soi ...Ceci cr\u00e9\u00e9 un d\u00e9sint\u00e9r\u00eat d\u00e8s ta 3e run, et je te parle pas d'essayer de d\u00e9bloquer tous les secrets [/spoiler]\n\n- [spoiler] Ta 1er run est la plus longue run (environ 6-7 H) et tes autres runs seront \u00e9norm\u00e9ment plus courts \" environ 2-3 h) ce qui est dommage en soi ceci cr\u00e9e une sorte de d\u00e9cadence ( et le fait que le jeu te demande tout le temps de passer cette sc\u00e8ne et tr\u00e8s enevant parfois) [/spoiler]\n \nCe jeu fut g\u00e9nial et mon seul regret est que je ne peux y jouer pour la premi\u00e8re fois qu'une seule fois \n\n\n\nNon s\u00e9rieusement ques ce que tu fais \u00e0 encore la , prend ta carte bleue et joue y part toi-m\u00eame , tu ne le regretteras pas", "timestamp_created": 1515260292, "timestamp_updated": 1515260360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38997556": {"recommendationid": "38997556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198798616700", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 390, "last_played": 1515448733}, "language": "english", "review": "amazingly well thought out story line and clever jokes/referances.

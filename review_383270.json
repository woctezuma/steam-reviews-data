Each level adds its own little gimmick, which helps keep the puzzles fresh, although they still get a bit repetitive. There are some \"platforming\" sections which give the game a little action between the puzzles, but they're all very similar, you just have to keep changing colors to make your path. There are also long, empty sections between areas which are there solely for the purpose of listening to the narrator while traversing them. The first time they're fine, but if you're backtracking to get the collectibles they're just very boring.\n\nAnd now, we get to that. The backtracking. I understand that getting the collectibles is completely optional, but if you put something optional in your game, you better make it worth it, right? I think the backtracking in this game is completely pointless. Most of the time, the collectibles are behind a wall with a color you don't yet have, so you have to go back after getting it, completing ALL the previous levels of that area. What's the fun part about repeating the same puzzles you've already solved, in the exact same way? Having new colors doesn't make you able to complete previous levels in different ways. That is how it should've been, if they wanted to put backtracking in. At least make the backtracking interesting, and not repeating the same puzzles and going through the same long, empty sections, with nobody narrating anything.\nThere are a handful of collectibles which are actually interesting to get, which don't involve backtracking, but figuring a way to get to a certain place, solving \"a puzzle within the puzzle\". I think it'd have been much more fun if all of them were like this.\n\nBesides that, the game is alright. The story seems interesting at first, but then doesn't really get developed at all. The soundtrack is nice and chill, and gets more intense in certain sections, which is cool. The graphics are simplistic and pleasant.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 7.5/10, as a game.\n\nAs a product, I don't think it's worth the full price.

Instead of doing one genre well, they did both poorly.\n\nThe game features a lot of slow walking around, especially during story segments where you walk through a boring environment while the story is narrated to you. The story is fine, but having to walk through a long hallway to kill time is annoying.\n\nThe platforming segments are just frustrating - they present no challenge to either your brain or your reflexes, and instead feel like pointless filler. The same exact type of platforming section is repeated multiple times within the game, sometimes even back to back. It almost feels patronizing considering this is supposedly a puzzle game.\n\nThe puzzles are okay, most are of average quality and the difficulty curve is fine. They never get challenging though - right before you might ramp up the difficulty, a new color or game mechanic is introduced and the difficulty curve starts over. Instead of iterating designs with the elements they had, they just added more elements.\n\nWhat really annoys me is the lack of a proper checkpoint or rewind system - if you make one mistake in a room and die, you have to start completely over from the beginning of the room. Many of the game mechanics are deadly, such as spikes, lasers, thwomps, bottomless pits, etc. and you will die a lot from simple mistakes. The worst part is that I frequently knew exactly what I needed to do, but a simple mistake in execution meant I had to die and start completely over from scratch. I feel like a different choice of game mechanics could have made for a much more fun experience with a lot less death and restarts. At the very least, being able to rewind a few seconds or create quicksaves would be a much appreciated band-aid. The game recommends a controller but I really don't see how that would help.\n\nAnother major annoyance is that when you are selecting a color, your character keeps moving in the same direction even if you let go of all movement keys. Time is slowed down but it's still very annoying that you have no control over your character while selecting a color - the slow motion is very useful in execution-based situations and is completely ruined by the lack of control. Many of my deaths are attributed to this, and the game requires this kind of quick maneuvering frequently.\n\nThere are collectibles in the game, but their placements intentionally hostile to the player. You will frequently see an obvious collectible in a level that you don't have the right color to access until later in the game, meaning you have to backtrack or replay levels to access it. This is beyond lazy - none of the collectibles require any challenge or puzzle to access, so requiring the player to replay levels to reach the spot once they have the right color is just insulting. The fast travel system in the game only lets you travel to the start of huge sections of the game, there is no way to travel to a specific level without replaying all of the levels before it.\n\nThe color palette seems to have too many similar colors. These are not your typical shades of colors as you would expect from opening up MS Paint or Photoshop, these are hand-tuned colors to fit the theme and art style of the game. While it does make the game consistently look pleasant, it also makes it really hard to discern colors. I am not colorblind, and I frequently had trouble telling apart yellow from orange, pink from purple, and yellow from yellow-lime green because they were so close in shade, especially when various elements tweak the shade slightly. This meant I frequently selected the wrong color, half the time resulting in death.\n\nAs for the story, it's okay. Just okay. It explores some interesting ideas but never follows through with them, instead stopping short to move on to a different topic.\n\nOn the bright side, the art design is beautiful, and I'm a big fan of it. The music is also pretty good.\n\nOverall, I'd rate the game at 5/10, which is average and not a bad score, but I can't recommend it for the asking price.

It probably came from one of those. That said, this review will short.\n\nHue is a game that explores the ability of incorporating colors into puzzles. Say you need to get through a blue wall. If you have the blue piece of the ring, you can get through it. This can apply to just about any object, making just about anything of color invisible. This gets more and more complex as you go, as there are lasers, balloons on crates, springs that change color when you step on them, even boulders of various colors rolling after you.\n\nThere were a few moments where I had to use the \"Restart Level\" button from the menu. This does detract from the experience, and it gave me this feeling that I had done something wrong, when I had merely been going through the process of trying to solve the puzzle. There aren't many levels that will do this to you, as I can only count about 2 or 3 that were particularly specific in how the game developer wanted it to be solved. Most times, you are never painted into a corner that says you can't undo what you've done. Because you are able to push and pull crates with the action button, it gives you a lot of forgiveness in pushing things too far to one side, or needing to drag a crate here or there.\n\nThe music is amazing. It seemed to capture those moments that were dangerous, without overplaying itself. It also blends well into the background, so that solving the puzzles doesn't become difficult with a distracting background music. The voice acting is also great. There is a feeling of real emotion in the words, and it helps to draw a connection to the characters, as well as give a new insight, through the writing, on how we perceive colors.\n\nI won't give away too much more with this game. It didn't require me to go outside of the game to find solution for it. I recommend it to those that are keen on solving puzzles of a creative nature.

Specifically, your character, a boy oddly named Hue, has the ability to change the color of the background, which has the side effect of making any onscreen object that matches the background temporarily cease to exist; barriers disappear, deadly lasers vanish, and crates that were formerly being lifted up by colored balloons fall to the ground. You start out with only one color available to you, but as the game progresses, you\u2019ll gain access to a full rainbow of eight.\n\nThis may not sound like wildly inventive territory for a puzzle-platformer, and to be honest, it\u2019s not; while I\u2019m not aware of another entry in the genre that uses this specific color-switching mechanic, much of what you do still boils down to pushing Block X onto Switch Y, or getting a key to unlock the exit to the room you\u2019re in.\n\nBut while Hue doesn\u2019t reinvent its genre, it does what it does with ample polish. The difficulty curve is wonderfully smooth, with new puzzle elements being gradually and carefully introduced to ease you in. Checkpoints are forgivingly spaced at the beginning of each puzzle, and time slows down while you switch colors, giving you plenty of time to avoid a laser or solidify a crucial platform in mid-air. And while the story is simple - Hue embarks on a quest to rescue his disappeared inventor mother - it\u2019s well told, through excellent voice-over narration. My only real complaint is that two pairs of colors (pink/fuschia and orange/yellow) are a tad too similar to consistently tell apart in the midst of gameplay, resulting in a few unnecessary deaths.\n\nFor any fan of puzzle-platformers, Hue comes highly recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1509574274, "timestamp_updated": 1509574274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36193642": {"recommendationid": "36193642", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119867990", "num_games_owned": 135, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509547626}, "language": "french", "review": "Un petit jeu sympa, dans lequel on investit pas une fortune.\nVous commencez avec un monde enti\u00e8rement gris puis vous d\u00e9couvrez les couleurs au fur et \u00e0 mesure de l'avancement du jeu.\nPuis, c'est une suite de casse-t\u00eates o\u00f9 vous devez jouer avec les couleurs.\nLe jeu en lui-m\u00eame est vraiment sympa, original, avec un bon gameplay; mais ce qui renforce vraiment, c'est l'histoire qui est vraiment intriguante et qui fait qu'on veut savoir la suite.\nLe jeu est peut-\u00eatre un peu long, je l'ai fini surtout pour la fin, mais ce n'est que mon avis.\nFranchement, si vous aimez les jeux du genre, vous allez adorer celui-l\u00e0.", "timestamp_created": 1509547816, "timestamp_updated": 1509547816, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36177183": {"recommendationid": "36177183", "author": {"steamid": "76561198217788343", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 435, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509814133}, "language": "english", "review": "I first saw this with my brother and his roomates, i was amazed by how it all worked, the concept was brilliant, not to mention...

Basically you can change the color of the background to make objects of that same color blend into the background, which makes them temporarily disappear. The developer did a great job of filling the world with fun puzzles in a vivid world.\n\nMy only complaint really is that the structure ends up being very repetitive. There are eight colors, and each color's gauntlet is essentially structured the same. First you are forced to walk through a maze while a voice-over reads the story, but there's no way to skip this or reach the end of the maze before the voice finishes. Then you solve the puzzles, which can sometimes be a bit too easy and repetitive as well. And then you obtain the next color for the next area.

And moving boxes. And moving even more boxes.\n\nNormally, I don't write reviews for games I don't especially like since they aren't worth the time to dole out a simple 6 or 7 and be done with it. They're mediocre, but never offensively bad. Hue is the straw that breaks the camel's back and is everything wrong with indie platformers in this day and age. It's all frills and dressing, but no substance. It's all about flash and pomp, but as shallow as a puddle when it comes to gameplay.\n\nYou play as the eponymous Hue, a kid who's looking for their missing mother and along the way, discovers the power to render the world in specific colors to get by obstacles and clear rooms. On paper, it sounds like nothing special but with a lot of room for potential. However, I don't think I've ever played a game that so undermined its own concept to the point where the puzzles are both tedious and mind numbingly easy. Boiled down, puzzles are based around the concept of making certain props vanish or appear based on the color you select. Instead of having creative enemies, platforming, color combinations, or anything remotely in-depth that would require strategy, the developers present the player with two types of puzzles. Reflex puzzles, which can be fun but are still relatively easy, where you switch colors to avoid obstacles and jump from platform to platform. These are okay.\n\nBox puzzles, which make up the vast majority of puzzles in this game, are not okay. These puzzles require you to push or move boxes in specific colors or ways, sometimes swapping the colors four to five times just to reach one end of a platform to another to block a specific laser from zapping you, in order to reach a key, and then repeat that in reverse order, spending a good minute or two getting through it while thinking over the puzzle takes no more than 10 seconds to figure out. I don't understand why the developers would limit themselves to puzzles that remain the worst aspect of other puzzle games such as Professor Layton, but without any ounce of charm, endearment, be it through visuals or music.\n\nFrom a graphical standpoint, the game relies too much on minimalism to hide the lack of thought and effort that went into the game. Details are limited to prefabricated tiles, backgrounds, and occasionally items in the world, and partway through, I found myself somehow wanting to play Fez instead. Fez, for all its faults, had gorgeous artwork and environments that still hold up today. Hue, on the other hand, is like looking at a sheet of charcoal with bright primary and secondary colors interspersed through outlines and empty space. Normally, I'm not too hard on artstyle choice or graphics, but when the gameplay is irritating and dull, it makes me wish I was playing a Professor Layton game instead. At least those games had a wonderful variety of puzzles, charming characters, and a cozy aesthetic with wonderful soundtracks.\n\nIn other words, if you like games that try to dress themselves up as being particularly deep or introspective without having an ounce of anything fruitfal, or if you have a particular fondness for puzzle games that are more like chores than actual puzzles,  then maybe this is the game for you. Otherwise, I cannot recommend Hue to anybody in particular. It does too little of anything to leave an impression and too much tedium to make it worth revisiting. Avoid it and save your money.\n\n3/10.", "timestamp_created": 1500776587, "timestamp_updated": 1500776587, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33733041": {"recommendationid": "33733041", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074745580", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 37, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500736770}, "language": "english", "review": "Feels like limbo, but not as much as dark.\n\nI really liked the concept of changing the colors to solve puzzles, definitely would play more of this.", "timestamp_created": 1500770305, "timestamp_updated": 1500770351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33715006": {"recommendationid": "33715006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071045300", "num_games_owned": 338, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500785488}, "language": "english", "review": "An absolutely lovely game with a gorgeous soundtrack, soothing voice acting, a unique concept and smooth gameplay.

It's up to Hue to use the powers of color , solve puzzles , and find your mother. All while unraveling the story as it goes on.\n\nPros:\n-Game has a great simplistic art style that makes the colors pop.\n-Gameplay feels damn good, tight controls , the color wheel feels fantastic esp with a controller.\n-Game is a good 5-10 hours , unless you're some sort of wizard. I have seen some 3-4 hr runs listed via reviews.\n-Puzzles range from super easy to absolute pain in the a**. Esp by the end of the game ,  some of those last few puzzles will make you rage.\n\nMixed:\n-The music is fantastic but there's too much of the same song looped over and over. I get there's supposed to be some tone set with this , but do I really need to solve challenging puzzles to somber piano music or just small drum beats?\n\nCons:\n-Map feature is garbage. You have to pause the game to go into the map and it's just icons with numbers representing how many secret beakers you found , should be somewhat more in depth. I kinda wish they'd consider changing it. This would also help a lot with people who want to collect all the beakers. And in general just help with the flow of the game. I actually screwed up and went a different route and had to redo a series of puzzles to get back to the lighthouse area.\n[spoiler]-There's a puzzle near the end of the game where there's a purple and a aqua spout that move back and forth , and theres a lever and a switch. The team actually changed where the switch was initially and made this puzzle really f'ing annoying to solve. Watch a lets play and you'll see what I mean.[/spoiler]\n\nHope that helps.

Other game developers must be green with envy because of what Fiddlesticks Games have accomplished. If you haven't guessed by now, Hue is a game about puns. No wait, that's not right. Hue is a 2D puzzle-platformer that involves the region of the electromagnetic spectrum between the wavelengths of 400 and 700 nanometers. It's a game about color, and it is excellent.\n\nIn Hue, you play as Hue, and change the hue. What a delightfully simple concept. Charmingly voiced by Anna Acton, who gingerly guides the player with some conveniently-placed letters, you will be treated to a loosely-defined story about love and perspective. You must find the author of these letters who has found themselves trapped outside the monochrome world. The young boy, Hue, must find eight colors: red, orange, yellow, lime, aqua, blue, purple, and pink. As Hue stumbles upon each, he gains the ability to change the background to that pigment at the press of a button. Changing the color of the background is surely a novelty. You can't make a platformer based on that alone, can you? Well, color me impressed, you can.\n\nWhenever the background changes, all items in the world matching that color will effectively cease to exist. Boxes, ledges, balloons, lasers, and deadly boulders disappear from the world until the background is switched again. To get through a red wall, Hue can switch to red and now there is no wall. So, basically, Hue can give himself the red carpet treatment at any time. This color swapping is used well for both puzzles and platforming.\n\nOn the puzzle side, you might have to place an orange box behind a yellow one by making one invisible and dragging the other through it. You can use these boxes to trigger pressure switches that open doors by cycling through the palette. Later, Hue will need to deal with lasers that instantly kill and nozzles that spray paint to change the color of objects. There are even platforms that will cycle through to the next color each time Hue jumps on them. In all these cases Hue will need to consider his surrounds and swap to the correct color(s) to complete the puzzle.\n\nWhile the puzzle side of things sounds basic, the implementation is nearly perfect. If it weren't for a few boxes getting caught on flat surfaces and dodgy ladders, there wouldn't be any issues with the mechanics. The gradual introduction of new devices matches the need to think in multiple colorized dimensions. Most of the puzzles take place in fairly small rooms, often with a key that needs to be acquired to open the exit. These contained areas ensure the puzzles are fairly manageable despite their purplexity. Most puzzles cannot be broken, so the game allows players to try bad solutions, before moving onto greener pastures.  While the game world is not strictly linear, the acquisition of colors and their corresponding areas tends to follow a direct route for a smoother experience.\n\nThe hectic platforming sequences are interspersed between these chains of puzzle rooms. Platforming challenges require much faster switching between colors, as you avoid deadly obstacles. Fortunately the swapping of colors slows time, providing a fraction more tolerance to make the required jumps. Nevertheless, some of these sections are tricky. Ledges will crumble and boulders will tumble. You need to quickly determine whether you want a specific color enabled or disabled. Pick the wrong color and you'll be black and blue all over. \n\nThese faster platforming sections can take a minute or two to complete and have a small margin for error. The tolerance for making some vertical jumps is fairly low; Hue might need to quickly swap colors after jumping up through an invisible platform. Horizontal jumps are sometimes made in advance of seeing what color needs to be disabled or enabled. In both cases, the main caveat is that the background cannot be changed when Hue is inside an object, so there is a little bit of dexterity involved. Platforming is also made a little harder because the swapping color wheel can obscure nearby ledges. While there will be a few deaths during platforming, the difficulty is quite fair when contrasted with the slower puzzle challenges.\n\nThese two main parts of the game provide a good balanced mix. None of the puzzle mechanics are overused, and the same is true with the slightly different faster challenges. Both elements get slightly trickier as the game progresses, following the general blueprint set by similar platformers. The game will take around four hours to complete, with more time needed to backtrack and collect some achievement-related objects. It\u2019s a good length and there is plenty of variety. \n\nFiddlesticks Games have done the impossible\u2014they've hit a purple patch after creating only one game. Hue is a 2D platformer that cleverly integrates the switching of background colors. Switching between each pigment will make objects invisible or visible, necessary to complete the good-sized puzzle rooms and leap onto ledges in the frenzied platforming sequences. Mechanically it is quite sound, with only a few red flags linked to boxes and ladders. After finishing Hue, there will be no grey area\u2014this is a blue ribbon experience worth every cent of your greenback-equivalent.", "timestamp_created": 1498874383, "timestamp_updated": 1498874383, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.759692", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33055939": {"recommendationid": "33055939", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971639656", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498416217}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it, easy and cool.

It is a charming, inventive little puzzle platformer and you surely have not played anything like this before. However, don't go in expecting the best puzzle game experience you have ever gotten - the game has its down moments.\n\nHue revolves around a clever color changing mechanic where you can control the background color of the stage. However, in my opnion the game falls short on discovering this mechanic to its fullest potential. The game tries to add more complexity by adding more colors to your wheel but ends up using only about 5 of the colors in the later levels. When most of the wheel colors have been opened, I had to turn on the colorblind mode to make things clearer.\n\nMost of the game is moderately easy - you can proceed with flying colors. During the last hour of the game the difficulty ramps up. Some of the puzzles near the end are great, some just make you frustrated for other reasons than not figuring out the solution. \n\nAll in all, the game sort of fails to surprise player with its puzzle design. Nothing that Hue 2 cannot fix. Still a unique experience that is worth having.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1498403296, "timestamp_updated": 1498403296, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508627", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32773319": {"recommendationid": "32773319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152968608", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 365, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498347978}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't help but comparing this game with limbo, even tho there's not much else to compare other than the genere. \n\nI loved this beautiful, but short game.

It's a challenging, charming game at times and the initial hook is pretty decent. It's also for the most part fun. There's a story there but it's paper thin and the music is basic but nice enough. It's a good game for a quiet change of pace.\n\nHowever, once the story is over, it's not worth playing again. The collect-em-all side quest which can't be completed until you finish the story really is a showcase for the games flaws. You repeat the same puzzles over again, areas where the collectables are do not offer any new challenge and are usually hidden in inaccessable holes in already completed puzzles. Without the story, the bits which had the exposition are now shown to be long featureless, puzzleless corridors, something you don't notice on the initial playthrough, but are very apparent and shows a bit of disappointing programming and you eventually realise how repetitive this game can be at times. \n\nThat's not to say it's not fun. It really is. But only once, because of this and the length of time to complete the game I would recommend not getting it at full price, wait for a bundle or a sale, but I would say \u00a36/\u00a37 is about the most you should pay.\n\ntl;dr Fun puzzle game with flaws that are hardly noticible the first time you run-through, very much so when going for 100%.

You play as the small boy Hue looking for his lost mother.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe art in Hue is rather stylistic and vibrant. Some graphical elements are little amateurish, but overall the game looks quite beautiful and unique.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\nThe sound effects and voice acting are decent enough. Music is quite nice too, even if slightly repetitive.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nPretty much all the puzzles and action sequences in Hue are built around the color switching mechanic. Any map elements that match the current color of the background simply disappear temporarily and you can freely pass through them.\n\nThis mechanic is then used in various puzzles and more action-oriented platforming sequences. While the color switching itself is quite an clever idea and the game keeps adding more potential colors to the mix, the actual puzzles remain fairly simple. I would have liked to see bit more depth and complexity with the puzzle design myself.\n\nOne minor annoyance is also the lack of checkpoints during the levels. Some of the larger levels take a while to go through and the game has quite a few hazards that can kill you.\n\n[h1]Difficulty[/h1]\nHue is a rather easy game, only the last few puzzles are slightly more complicated.\n\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\nControls are somewhat floaty and not terribly precise on a gamepad. At least the game doesn't really require precision jumping.\n\n[h1]Story and Writing[/h1]\nThe writing is solid enough and the story is fairly interesting, if rather short.\n\n[h1]Bugs and Glitches[/h1]\nBoxes can sometimes get stuck on other objects when you push them around.\n\n[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]\nHue is a pretty decent puzzle platformer with an interesting color manipulation mechanic and decent visuals.

Muy estilo Limbo, pero sin sustos, y con algo de color \ud83d\ude0a \n\nVamos, en resumen, que el juego es amor \ud83d\udc9a", "timestamp_created": 1495751678, "timestamp_updated": 1495751678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31958055": {"recommendationid": "31958055", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122859224", "num_games_owned": 7678, "num_reviews": 69, "playtime_forever": 576, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496219130}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5173\u5361\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6700\u540e\u624d\u6e10\u5165\u4f73\u5883\n\u521a\u521a\u89c9\u5f97\u89e3\u5bc6\u6709\u4e9b\u6210\u5c31\u611f\u65f6\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\n\u5173\u5361\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u73a9\u6cd5\u7684\u6316\u6398\u5e76\u4e0d\u900f\u5f7b\n\n\u6709\u4e9b\u5173\u5361\u4ec5\u5355\u5411\u901a\u8fc7\uff0c\u8fc7\u5173\u4e86\u5c31\u65e0\u6cd5\u56de\u5934\n\u800c\u9664\u4e86\u5927\u573a\u666f\u7684\u77ac\u79fb\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u65e0\u6cd5\u9009\u5173\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5168\u6536\u96c6\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5236\u4e8c\u5468\u76ee\n\u521d\u89c1\u80fd\u6361\u5230\u4fe1\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u914d\u5408\u8bed\u97f3\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u6bb5\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u8dd1\u8def\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u518d\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5f88\u65e0\u804a\n[spoiler]\u60f3\u5168\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u5148\u770b\u653b\u7565\uff0c\u5927\u6982\u786e\u5b9a\u6536\u96c6\u7269\u6240\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e[/spoiler]\n\n\u97f3\u4e50\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u7531\u4e8e\u6bd4\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u4f53\u66f4\u65e9\u5c31\u8fdb\u8fc7Groupees\u7684\u97f3\u4e50\u5305\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6ca1\u5fc5\u8981\u518d\u8865\u4e86\n\n\u53f3\u6447\u6746\u6362\u8272\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u8f83\u9f20\u6807\u4f4e\u5f97\u591a\n\u53cd\u6b63\u6211\u73a9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0cX\u548cA\u88ab\u6211\u6362\u5230LB\u548cLT\u4e86\uff0c\u5168\u7a0b\u5de6\u624b\u624b\u67c4\u53f3\u624b\u9f20\u6807\u901a\u5173\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1495740034, "timestamp_updated": 1495740034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31893469": {"recommendationid": "31893469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005509015", "num_games_owned": 1042, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 288, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495831153}, "language": "english", "review": "A fun puzzle platformer with interesting views on color.", "timestamp_created": 1495414202, "timestamp_updated": 1495414202, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31885348": {"recommendationid": "31885348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022883422", "num_games_owned": 468, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495388657}, "language": "english", "review": "Highly reccomended, the game revlolves around building atmosphere and it just... works.

This concept is way more interesting than it might sound, I suggest to watch a video to fully understand it. The gameplay is fun, the controls are very good even with k+m (although the devs recommend a controller). The difficulty and variety of the puzzles rise with time perfectly. The lenght of the game is perfect for such a game in my opinion. It took me ~5 hours to beat it. The visuals are minimalistic yet charming but some people might not like it. The music and dubbing are pleasant.[/b]\n\n[b]STORY[/b]\nThe story is okay. It is linear and quite simple as you'd expect from a puzzle game. You are looking for your lost mother. The story reveals mainly through monologues of the main character's mother. You can interact with most of the characters in the game if you want to know more about the Hue's world or just to hear a funny joke. It has no impact on the story though.\n\n[b]GAMEPLAY[/b]\nIt is the most enjoyable part of the game. The devs recommend a controller to play the game but I have played with keyboard and mouse. Still, it was a lot of fun. I had to get used to controlling the character with WSAD but it wasn't much problem. Have in mind though that you will probably have to control the character with left hand too because you will need the mouse to change the colors of the background. I haven't checked if the keys are rebindable. The lenght of the game was perfect for me personally (~5 hours) but some people might be disappointed it is too short. The puzzles' difficulty was rising with time perfectly but generally it isn't a hard game. New features appear systematically so you won't get bored with the same kind of puzzle over and over again. The puzzles require a bit of thinking and a bit of reflex.\n\n[b]VISUALS[/b]\nPersonally I liked the artstyle of the game but it is a matter of one's taste. For me it fitted the concept of the game (changing the background colors) perfectly. If you are a demanding gamer in terms of graphics just check the screenshots to see if it is something you will like. The variety of levels' design was okay.\n\n[b]SOUND[/b]\nThe music is minimalistic but charming and pleasant. The only dubbing you will hear is mother's voice reading the letters to her son. The rest of the characters are quiet but you can interact with them.\n\n[i]Don't mind my recommendation because it is only my subjective opinion which shows if I've enjoyed the game or not.

You control a little guy named Hue that is running around, collecting colours and on his way he finds out about his mother's research about colours. The world they live in is black and white and his mother \"discovered\" colours.\n\nThe concept is so nice, I have never seen another game like this. There probably is, but I may not know of it. Do not expect a fully blown story about whatever thing, it is short, but really nice to listen to and it sometimes rises some questions inside your head. I never expected that this game would blow my mind with just simple statements or questions.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing and really calming, the colours are really nice to look at and, overall, the art style is stunning. Simple, but stunning. All the little details are really cute and immersive. For example, when you hit something that is hanging from the ceiling, it will move and make a specific noise. The attention to detail is amazing.\n\nAs a puzzle game, I, personally, found it easy, I did not struggle to find out the solution, but as you progress, they do get from hilariously easy to challenging ones, that make you think even a little bit.\n\nSomething I did not like about it was the fact that it was so short. I did not try to get through fast, not at all. I would have liked it to be a little bit longer.\n\nI want to thank the developers for bringing us such a nice little game and so many interesting concepts that I, for once, never thought about.

Pero vamos, que he conseguido este juego con otros 4 por menos de 4 euros.\n\nAl principio no me hab\u00eda llamado demasiado la atenci\u00f3n, hasta ver en Game Maker's Toolkit un v\u00eddeo hablando de sus mec\u00e1nicas. A priori me record\u00f3 mucho a Nihilumbra que me hab\u00eda gustado, pero le faltaba algo.\n\nLo compr\u00e9, lo empec\u00e9 a jugar y me enganch\u00f3. Aparte de un problema con el fondo negro del juego \"sucio\" que no s\u00e9 si es algo del mismo juego para darle algo de textura o un problema de mi pantalla, en general no he encontrado nada malo en el juego, lo que por desgracia a estas alturas (y pendiente de rese\u00f1ar Reigns, Dusty Revenge y Valiant Hearts) es algo a agradecer.\n\nMe gusta que no tiene complejas instrucciones ni tutoriales largos, el juego te va ense\u00f1ando lo que necesitas y vas mejorando y consiguiendo nuevos colores y se van usando de formas diferentes seg\u00fan avanzas. Para el que no lo haya visto la mec\u00e1nica es sencilla, puedes cambiar el color del fondo para ocultar objetos de ese color y mostrar otros de otro color. Sin m\u00e1s es el t\u00edpico plataformas de puzzles, que es un g\u00e9nero que me encanta.\n\nYo he encontrado algunas dificultades extra, pero me temo que era m\u00e1s por mi torpeza o por mi mando, en las zonas en las que hay que cambiar r\u00e1pido de color, pero con repetirlas suficientes veces se superan.\n\nLos coleccionables (las pociones) no siempre son f\u00e1ciles y obvias de encontrar y yo opt\u00e9 por mirar en una gu\u00eda en que puzzles aparec\u00edan para no perder m\u00e1s tiempo a\u00fan registrando cada pared. Luego descubr\u00ed que en el mapa puedes volver a zonas anteriores sin tener que caminar hasta ellas (el \u00fanico problema de no tener instrucciones o tutorial).\n\nLa historia no es nada novedosa para alguien de mi generaci\u00f3n que se ha pasado gran parte de la infancia siguiendo a Marco en su b\u00fasqueda de su mam\u00e1. Pero yo agradec\u00ed mucho que una vez que acabas y puedes seguir jugando cambie el aspecto de la ciudad y los di\u00e1logos de los PNJs.\n\nMe han sorprendido mucho los di\u00e1logos de los PNJs, que tengan tres interacciones diferentes y que te den algo de informaci\u00f3n y te cuenten algo gracioso le da un plus al juego.\n\nTengo que reconocer que he tenido que buscar ahora en youtube porque no recordaba la m\u00fasica del juego. No molesta y es relajante, invita a concentrarte tanto que ni te acuerdas de ella.\n\nMe fastidia sobre manera que he perdido mucho tiempo en la \u00faltima pantalla por intentar resolverla de una forma mucho m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de lo que era, y en algunos puzzles me ha pasado que me costaba ver la soluci\u00f3n mientras otros me parec\u00edan muy obvios pero no era capaz de hacerlo por falta de habilidad.\n\nPara a alguien que le guste el g\u00e9nero de puzzles creo que es un \"must have\" y seguramente se juega mejor en episodios y no todo a la vez como hice yo, que acab\u00e9 bastante quemado, pero muy satisfecho al conseguir acabarlo todo de una sentada por lo mucho que me engancharon sus mec\u00e1nicas y su atm\u00f3sfera.", "timestamp_created": 1491295470, "timestamp_updated": 1491295470, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616624", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30938319": {"recommendationid": "30938319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122465583", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 313, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492876411}, "language": "english", "review": "That is my first review on steam.

I hope the developers continue to make games like this which are both story rich, simplistic and unique.\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1488653071, "timestamp_updated": 1488653071, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30317227": {"recommendationid": "30317227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021959875", "num_games_owned": 6675, "num_reviews": 250, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488642245}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u9019\u662f\u7528\u904e\u6ffe\u984f\u8272\u4f86\u555f\u52d5\u6a5f\u95dc\u7684\u89e3\u8b0e\u904a\u6232\uff0c\u6709\u4e0a\u767e\u5c0f\u95dc\uff0c\u5206\u516d\u5927\u5340\u57df\uff0c\u6bcf\u5340\u57df\u90fd\u5404\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u8272\u7684\u6a5f\u95dc\uff0c\u524d\u56db\u5927\u5340\u76ee\u6a19\u5728\u6536\u96c6\u4e03\u7a2e\u539f\u8272\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u70ba\u904a\u6232\u53ea\u6709\u6ffe\u6389\u55ae\u4e00\u984f\u8272\u4f86\u9054\u6210\u76ee\u6a19\uff0c\u89e3\u8b0e\u4e0d\u96e3\uff0c\u7d04\u56db\u5c0f\u6642\u7834\u95dc\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u65bc\u524d\u671f\u56db\u5927\u5340\u6709\u984f\u8272\u4e92\u9396\u7684\u554f\u984c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5148\u89e3\u958b\u984f\u8272\u518d\u56de\u982d\u6536\u96c6\u96b1\u85cf\u7269\u54c1\uff0c\u60f3\u5168\u6210\u5c31\u7b49\u65bc\u662f\u8981\u8d70\u5169\u904d\u3002\n\n\u904a\u6232\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u984f\u8272\u5207\u63db\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u6703\u6709\u500b\u6162\u52d5\u4f5c\u6642\u9593\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9999\u83c7\u982d\u65b9\u5411\u4f86\u5207\u63db\u984f\u8272\u5f88\u6d41\u66a2\u3002\u9ed1\u8272\u9285\u677f\u756b\u98a8\u7684\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u51f8\u986f\u4e86\u80cc\u666f\u8272\u8abf\u7684\u9078\u64c7\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f\u6771\u897f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89f8\u78b0\u7d30\u7bc0\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u8a2d\u8a08\u5230\uff0c\u800c\u8f15\u67d4\u8212\u7de9\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u92fc\u7434\u914d\u6a02\uff0c\u66f4\u7de9\u7de9\u5e36\u51fa\u4e00\u500b\u5c0f\u7537\u5b69\u627e\u5c0b\u5abd\u5abd\u7684\u6b78\u9014\u611f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1488642154, "timestamp_updated": 1488740013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686815", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30315084": {"recommendationid": "30315084", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043554063", "num_games_owned": 119, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 92, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488731354}, "language": "english", "review": "If you liked Limbo and you liked Super Paper Mario or Fez-like mechanics, this is a great game.

You have a color wheel, and you can use it to change the color of the background. Any objects in the foreground that match the color of the background will dissapear. Not just invisible, but completly cease to exist (if you've ever played Runbow, this probably sounds familiar). They can easliy be brought back into existence by changing the background color again. You'll have to use this to solve your way through lots of tricky scenarios and avoid deadly traps. The game gets more advanced by adding not only more items to interact with, but more colors to use on your color wheel.\nThis game looks fantastic, and since the game is based on colors - and therefore visuals - it's really important that it does! The art style is great, most of it being silhouttes (they can't exactly use colors, after all).\nThis game's pacing is incredibly good for a puzzle game. The game can kind of be divided into three different kinds of levels:\nMostly, there a puzzle rooms. These are rooms that present you with a challenge to solve at your own pace, using the tools you have.\nOften, you'll get a break from puzzles and have to get through what I call an action room. These rooms don't require solving - instead, you'll need to use your color wheel to dodge obstactles and navigate platforms (think of Runbow, except you control the color of the background). There are a lot more puzzle rooms than action rooms, but the bursts of energy sprinkled about the game can help give you brain a break without losing your engadgement completely.\nLastly, there are narrative rooms. This game does have a story, and it tells that story by having you walk down an effortless hallway while narration happens. Not the most interesting way to tell a story, but the story is pretty simple, and actually pretty touching at times. A majority of the narration is letters that you're \"reading\" (listening to), so it feels a lot like flipping through diary pages more than a heavy plot. A lot of the entries explain backstory, but some of them are just sweet, and a surprising amount of them are pretty deep. Nothing that will radically change your life, but interesting food for thought nonetheless.\nOverall, this game has a fun new puzzle machanic, gorgeous visuals, great sense of pacing and a story that is enjoyable enough that it doesn't feel like it gets in the way.

[/h1]\n\nYour mother is missing. She is a brilliant inventor\u2014perhaps [i]too[/i] brilliant because as a result of her tinkering, she now resides past the visible colour spectrum in what is known as impossible colours. You must use the Amular Spectrum\u2014a device your mother created that can shift the very colour of the world around you\u2014your problem solving hat, and your lightning quick reflexes in order to gather up all the colours, find your mother, and live happily ever after.\n\nGameplay consists of a series of areas in which you need to solve a puzzle in order to continue to the next area. Progression is blocked off by obstacles that are a colour (or two) not yet found on your Spectrum and so you\u2019ll need to find the appropriate colour before you can proceed. This forces you to approach the game in a linear fashion, which makes sense because Hue is heavily story-driven. More on that in a moment. \n\nPuzzles are intuitive and, more importantly, satisfying to solve. They are challenging, but not impossible after some careful examination and reevaluation of your approach. They come in a few flavours:\n\n[list][*]The standard move from point A to B. Whether that means moving boxes to maneuver your way up, activating a series of switches, or working your way through a labyrinth of colours, these are the most common types of puzzle.\n[*]Mad dashes, during which you\u2019ll avoid obstacles from above and below. The ability to change colours on the go, which subsequently slows time a smidge, allows Hue to employ some very intuitive puzzles. Revealing and jumping to the next platform while the one you were just standing on disappears and making falling objects disappear harmlessly into their corresponding colour has never been more satisfying.\n[*]Order Puzzles, in which you need to move coloured pillars onto switches or underneath obstacles in such a way that changing colour will either activate the correct switch or make it so that you can jump onto your impromptu platform respectively.[/list] \n\nEvery so often, a new element\u2014different shapes of block, spigots of paint that will change the colour of said blocks, lazers, etc\u2014is added, which keeps gameplay fresh. I found myself smiling on more than one occasion when I figured out how several elements worked in conjunction with each other.\n\nThe mixture of puzzle solving with stretches of less taxing platforming during which your mother speaks to you while you press onward is effective in fully immersing you in the worlds of Hue. Your mother serves as the narrator, communicating with you via letters scattered throughout the world, and the tone and pace of narration is just lovely. \n\nIn fact, the soundtrack as a whole is a wondrous, somber collection of melodies played on classical instruments that fits the game\u2019s atmosphere to a T. It\u2019s reminiscent of a more upbeat [i]Limbo[/i] where no horrors lurk in gloom and tasked with adding a splash of colour to the shades of gray. It also embraces [i]Limbo[/i]'s instant-death formula where taking damage ends Hue\u2019s life.\n\n\n.Pros.\n[list] [*] The game is gorgeous. From the aesthetics to the soundtrack, it\u2019s simply a treat to experience. \n[*] The story is wound throughout gameplay organically and aids in immersing you in the world.\n[*] Collectables that reward your exploration. Picking up all 28 will require you to backtrack.\n[*] Puzzles segments are satisfying to solve.\n[*] New areas add new elements to puzzle solving, keeping things fresh. [/list]\n\n.Cons.\n[list] [*] The game is rather short for the asking price. Even though I struggled at the end, I clocked around 5 hours and I\u2019m no puzzle expert. \n[*] The difficulty ramps up towards the end. This was very frustrating after having such a serene and atmospheric experience up until that point. This is a personal gripe.\n[*] Checkpoints exist at the beginning of a stage. Insta-death means that messing up in the slightest (even if it\u2019s at the very end of a puzzle) starts you over from the very beginning. \n[*] \n [/list]\n\nHere's some gameplay: https://youtu.be/mmJzegyqugA\n\n.Bottom Line.\nHue is great\u2014an indie gem that should be in your library. Period. There\u2019s a lot to like here and, though the asking price is kind of steep considering the game\u2019s length, the experience you\u2019ll be embarking upon may be worth it. It\u2019s up to you.\n\nThe gameplay is fluid and intuitive, the atmosphere is fantastic, and the story is the cutesy feel-good kind you\u2019d expect from a Pixar flick.\n\nIf you\u2019re still reading, buy this game.\n\n [code]If this review helped you, please give it a thumbs-up.

The game caught my attention right away, and I completed the entirety in one sitting.\n\nThe way Hue is played is different than most platformers in the manner used to solve the puzzles that you must get around. Your means to solving puzzles requires use of color, hence the title of the game. As you progress along, you will gain the power to morph the background colors of the world you are in. Doing so will cause any objects in the foreground to disappear if they share the same color as the background. You will unlock new colors as you play the game, and you can shift to any of them using a color wheel that pops up for your control.\n\nThat right there is pretty much the crux of gameplay for Hue. While it is also a platformer and requires some running and jumping, most of the puzzles do not force you to perform tight-knit platforming actions. They are usually more focused on the actual color puzzles themselves. A large amount of the game is easily doable, at least it was in my opinion, and not many of the puzzles will confuse you too much. But that did not make me feel bored, and the puzzles were not bad. In fact, I prefer when I can figure out most of the puzzles, instead of feeling like I would need to look up suggestions or answers.\n\nThe game does progress in difficulty as you go along, so everything is not the same. Each new area that you enter adds in a different level design, along with new obstacles in your way. For instance, later in the game will have some puzzles with colored gel spraying (like Portal 2), which can paint boxes into other colors, requiring you to figure out which colors need to be used to set boxes in correct places for holding switches or blocking lasers.\n\nIn terms of difficulty, however, the game does get a sudden spike in the final area. And the increase in difficulty here was not exactly positive for me, as it seemed like the puzzles suddenly degraded into being tedious and not as fun as the rest of the game. While I was a little sad with some of those puzzles, I still completed the game and overall enjoyed the experience greatly.\n\nImportant to the gameplay is the controls, and I will let you know that keyboard and mouse work completely fine. The game recommends controllers at startup, but I usually try games out with keyboard and mouse anyway. I had no problems whatsoever with the controls in the game. Everything worked perfectly and I could move around and react efficiently. In fact, the controls and motion of the game are extremely fluid - everything is smooth.\n\nThe art style helps show that too, with how your character moves, other objects bounce around and move in great motion. Graphics are amazing in Hue! You can see from the screenshots how the monochrome world can look, along with the changing colors. Other NPCs you meet, the puzzle objects, level layout with buildings and design - Hue is one of the prettiest games I have played in a long time. All of the colors fit together in such a beautiful way.\n\nMusic and sound are also quite amazing. I really love the background music as you play, with the soundtrack of the game having a decent amount of songs to cover your time. It really surprised me how comforting the noise is to the point that I want to listen to the soundtrack again right now. The only downside I had is that the game occasionally gave loud, bothersome audio fuzz or distortion noises, which doesn't occur with anything else I have played recently. It got better after I closed and restarted the executable, but it still didn't go away entirely. I really hope that gets fixed, because it damages the beauty of the game's audio.\n\nBesides the music and sound, there is also some voiceover mainly related to narration of the story - and the story is something I have not gotten to yet. The reason for delaying my story commentary is that I was actually disappointed with it. While the narration you hear is pretty nice in voice quality, the story premise of Hue is nothing exactly new. Hue seems to act like it has a big philosophy... as if the story has large depth and great points about the world.\n\nSome people seem to think that the story is amazing, but all it really does is try to argue about perspectives of the world. The main character's mother is researching this color technology, the ring itself that you control to shift the world's background as you play. She is challenged by a Dr. Grey at her university about the power of the colors, as if she is ruining something about the world by wanting to shift it from monochrome to colorful.\n\nI honestly do not think the game actually gives you any new revelation or philosophy, though it seems like the developers think it will. And in fact, the game wastes a bit of your time because of their thoughts about the story. You \"learn\" about the story after every handful of puzzles in the game by finding letters that trigger narration sections. What the developers do here is have the narrator talk for a minute or two; and, in order to force you to hear it all without doing anything too confusing, they have you run through almost empty linear sections with no puzzles. The paths of these sections are intentionally boring and long enough for you to hear the entire narration without getting to the next puzzle. One of the sections is even a poorly-done maze.\n\nThose narration sections intentionally waste your time, which is one of my big criticisms to the game. Similarly, the game has hidden collectibles called beakers, which also are meant to artificially bump up your gameplay time if you wish to find them. The collectibles do that because each area of the game requires a set of colors to get through the puzzles; but usually the areas will have one or two colors blocking certain pathways - colors which you have not yet received. What you will need to do is receive those colors from the NEXT area of the game, and you must return to the previous area, replaying the same exact puzzles until you find those previously-blocked doorways.\n\nA shorter way to describe the above collectible complaint is this: Say there two areas of the game, A and B, with many puzzles that take a while. You must complete A entirely, complete B entirely, and then return to A, replaying almost all of its puzzles (with no difference from before), but use colors from B to find a couple of collectibles. It is a poor artificial way to extend the length of your gameplay.\n\nAltogether, the game took 5 hours to complete, but that is with some idle time as well as those bad collectibles just mentioned. Further, certain puzzles in the game are rather lengthy for a single room, and if you die during them, you will typically repeat all of the easy portions over and over until you finally complete the more difficult part. I would say that the game is actually 4 hours or less, so it is not quite a long game for its price.\n\nDespite the criticisms I have laid out for Hue, I would still recommend that you try the game out, as I greatly appreciated the experience.", "timestamp_created": 1485137063, "timestamp_updated": 1485137992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507495", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29424399": {"recommendationid": "29424399", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020171012", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486075594}, "language": "english", "review": "The sound design and the soundtrack are outstanding (although having the soundtrack available in flac as well would have been awesome), the art is pretty cool, the theme and the attention to details is SUPERB, the tutorial is VERY GOOD, and the level design is very good as well.\n\nOverall a pretty cool piece of ART.

The puzzles were fun, with concepts being introduced to help equip you for solving some of the later, which were naturally more difficult.  The controls were intuitive, simple, and felt really good.  I did not try it with keyboard/mouse as the game suggests a controller at the start.  I am glad I followed that advice because it just felt right.  Especially when you alter the colors from the color ring (wheel).  Just a slight movement of the right stick on my gamepad and the color ring is up for you to choose the needed color to solve the puzzle.  The slow-mo of the game during the color changes was also not only useful for solving, but a really fun element to play with.\n\nTo round out the game, I found the story to be interesting and special with an almost mystical element paired with science and personal perception.  A complete game where the story and puzzles are one.  I would personally be hesitant to make any Limbo/Braid comparisons.

I love platformer games, and this one's aesthetic similarity to Playdead's classic, LIMBO, caught my eye. Add to that a color-based main mechanic and a narrative-driven story, and you've got Hue. If you're into puzzle-platformers, this is a real winner. \n\nThe color wheel mechanic (as seen in the trailers) drives the puzzles in the game: when you change the background color, any objects of that color disappear, allowing you to move past them. It seems like a one-trick-pony at first, early in the game, but Hue makes very good use of it and includes a great deal of variety, as well as some very challenging puzzles (the final level in particular is quite difficult). It also may seem like using the color wheel (which you control with the right thumbstick on a controller) would get in the way of the flow of a platforming game, bu it actually runs  very smoothly, slowing down your character as you use it so that you can change colors even in midair. Which you will have to do during the game.\n\nThe game's story mode took me about 4 hours, but a lot of it will depend on how quickly you can make it through the puzzles. There are also collectibles in the game, which will require you to return to previous areas after you've unlocked additional colors to access secrets, ala Metroidvania games.\n\nThe music in the game is beautiful. I've only ever bought the game soundtrack for one other game (that being Undertale), but I suspect this one may not be far behind.\n\nThere's even a colorblind setting. Kudos to the Hue developers for nipping that potential problem in the bud. So even if you have colorblindness, you can still play this game and enjoy it.\n\nIf I were to pick out one weakness in the game, it's the story. The narration is beautifully spoken and offers interesting commentary on the various colors, and there's always times to listen whenever you reach a room with narration. It's only that the actually conflict of the game ends up feeling a little weak at the end. Also, the game would occasionally minimize and go back to the desktop. Not closing down or losing progress, but forcing me to click back in (however, I have no idea if the game is at fault for this, or it's just my computer). But these are minor complaints. Overall, this game is worth the money, and deserves any bit of attention it can get. \n\nI really enjoy puzzle platformers, and the indie products I've played in this genre (LIMBO, INSIDE, Thomas Was Alone, and now Hue) keep me coming back for more.", "timestamp_created": 1484726288, "timestamp_updated": 1484726764, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29326259": {"recommendationid": "29326259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042485131", "num_games_owned": 751, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 222, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484689490}, "language": "english", "review": "Hue is a game were you control a big-headed boy in a side-scroller, you must accomplish your objective by solving the puzzles in this dark and perilous world, thus, growing and losing your innocence, no, wait, that is Nihilumbra; no, wait, that is Braid, no, wait, that is Limbo, no, wait\u2026\nYou get the idea, this is a completely overdone and unoriginal concept, the reason game designers keep making those it's because they almost always win awards. Loss of innocence is such a touching topic, but after playing dozens of games like these, I've grown to kind of despise them.\nBut this is not the main reason I disliked this game, I'll get into that a bit later.\n\nIn Hue, you live in a monochromatic world, but nevertheless normal. Now, your mother didn't invent colour, but she invented something to perceive it, and this research basically drove her mad and uncaring of her family, and the University she researched the useless idea of colour exiled her for trying to change the laws of reality, until the day something probably went wrong and she disappeared, well, she was warned, after this the University destroyed her possibly world-ending artifact and scattered the pieces. But your mother didn't disappear completely, she leaves letters that you can read, so she asks you, a little boy named after her research (Hue), to risk your life and commit the same mistakes she did so you can find her, so you venture out into this perilous and monochromatic world to save your degenerate mother.\n\nBut there is something worse that the unoriginal story, this game is nail-bitingly pretentious, my God, you get a new colour and your mother starts to be all philosophical, but she just spews things that the developers probably saw in the colours VSauce video, she also likes to describe trivia about impossible colours and visible wavelengths, things not usually known by the general public, but not impressive at all, her British accent also doesn't help, but maybe I'm just projecting. The thing I hate about this game is the same thing that makes me hate the Matrix series. Don't try to make your games, movies, or books sound smart and complex to impress people, when in reality it's actually something pretty simple and sometimes overdone.\n\nThe gameplay is clever, I give the developers that, so, you've got a ring of colours, and when you pick one, it changes the background to that colour, and everything on the foreground with the same colour, stops existing, and this game nails it on puzzle design, it's all really simple, and sometimes rather easy, except for the last few levels, where the levels start to get longer, and when you die you restart, if gets frustrating when you hit a spike by mistake and have to do the puzzle again. Also, the game's got some rather lackluster collectibles, you just get them for the sake of the achievement, that's about it. The games seems like a browser game at times, I've played really clever sidescrolling free puzzle games on my browser when I was younger. Yet this game will set you back 15$.\n\nThe graphics are also really good, all the characters are well drawn, and the scenery looks nice, the colours really pop out,, also the music is good at times, specially at the Electricity level. But it kind of feels that it works against the atmosphere the world is building, as in, your mom is missing and probably DEAD, but this lime colour is real cute though. Maybe the boy is happy by losing his workaholic mother, you never know.\n\nOverall, the game is really unoriginal, almost like a Limbo clone, but still, it's got some really good puzzles and scenery, and you can always mute your mother's voice and turn off subtitles, that'd actually make it a good game. But the price tag of 15 dollars makes me unable to recommend it, but I also don't think it's a bad game, I'm neutral towards it in the end.\n\nRead more video game reviews at cassus.org", "timestamp_created": 1484694567, "timestamp_updated": 1484694567, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461987", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29325480": {"recommendationid": "29325480", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109368805", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 510, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484690036}, "language": "english", "review": "Hue is a really nice, enjoyable, puzzle-platformer. \n\nIt's extremely intuitive, and aside from one or two difficult timing sections, there's nothing that could come that close to making you 'rage'.

As you can probably tell from the Steam store page, Hue is all about colour and that forms the basis for the puzzle and platforming mechanics. \nDespite this, although I never used the option myself so I can't judge its effectiveness, there is colourblind support, which I understand use symbols instead.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant to look at and the music is amazing, and at times almost soothing. This helped make Hue relaxing to play. The storyline is also a very good one but, perhaps crucially, doesn't get in the way of the platforming & puzzles and instead serves alongside them to provide a brilliant game to play.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Hue to anyone, especially people who enjoy Puzzle games and Puzzle Platformers.

[/h1]\n\u201cHue\u201d puzzle-platformer. This is an exciting adventure with a touching story about the search for the missing mother. The game is reminiscent \u00abLimbo\u00bb.\nThe protagonist - boys named Hue living in black and white world. His mother is stuck in a colorful world.\nWe need to collect the pieces of the ring to save his mother. This ring changes the colors of the surrounding world.\nThe puzzles are not hard. We need to choose the right color, which will help remove the obstacle or show thing.\nBarriers disappear if the color matches the color of the world (background). Some objects are hidden from view (doors, etc.). Such items are visible when you change color. Also you can move some items.\nThe flasks are scattered on the levels. You open the corresponding achievement, if you collect all.\n\nEverything looks great and stylish. Music and sound great. The mother's voice is very pleasant with a touch of sadness. It leaves a deep impression and it is remembered.\nBeautiful game with colored worlds, unusual gameplay and good story that touches the philosophical arguments about the perception of the world.\nThis game is a little masterpiece!\n\nGameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CZWM3s6AV0\n\n[spoiler] If you are interested in reading and discussing reviews.

Hue will grab your attention right away, amuse you with it's novel puzzles and pull you along for the ride. Toward the end the game becomes a little tedious as the color puzzles go from novel to tiresome. Solid little puzzle platformer that can easily be completed in under 5 hours, and for that reason, the price is quite a bit high. On sale or rebundled, a solid 8 out of 10 in my eyes. \n\n[u][b]Story[/b][/u]: 10\nThe narrative draws you into the story of a mother and son, their relationship, and the omninous presence of Dr. Grey, the \"enemy\" of color. Restore the project your mother was researching in order to save her. In the process, discover a bit about how perspective colors your world and how a single piece of information can change your viewpoint. \n\n[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u]: 7\nGameplay is extremely intuitive and well thought out. Nothing seems awkward, though timing may irritate the player from time to time. Toward the end the game starts to feel as if the designers were struggling to come up with new challenges that made the puzzles go from interesting to solve to hurdles to deal with. Somewhere along the way, the equation of fun got lost, though when a puzzle is solved there still is some sense of accomplishment. However, overall game play is very well done.\n\n[u][b]Soundtrack[/b][/u]: 10\nExtremely peaceful and lends itself to the game's environment and puzzling. The voice actors perform quite well and they blend seamlessly into the overall presentation. \n\n[u][b]Controls[/b][/u]: 9\nThis was one of my few gripes about the game. While a controller is recommended, and I played that way (Xbone), I would have preferred to remap movement to the d-pad and not use the left analog stick. This, however, was not possible on my controller. I tend to prefer the precision control that a digital off/on state allows on the d-pad and that one doesn't quite get with a stick. Sure, there is a point when the game recognizes that you've activated, but why would I want this on a platformer? It's like trying to use a Red Cherry MX switch and find the edge of the platform with less than ideal tactile feedback.

So basically suppose there is a pile of rocks or a wall with say orange colour and you turn the world orange that pile of rocks or the wall would disappear and you can pass through. You get the colours as you progress through the game. Once ou get a few colours the puzzles are basically hiding objects of various colours by changing the world to the appropriate colour. The puzzles involve switches over which coloured blocks can be placed, walls of different colours,lasers and so on. The puzzle design is good and there are a few interesting puzzles to solve but the game becomes quite repetitive till a new mechanic is introduced which are very few.\n\nAlso few of the puzzles make you believe that they need to be perfectly timed but that is not the case. Every puzzle has a way without involving any precise platforming which is not explained well until you figure out that this game is pure logical puzzles and does not involve any precise platforming. There are a few obvious places and the game has a mechanic where time slows down so that you can change to the appropriate colour. \n\nPros\nExcellent music which keeps you playing through the various levels\nGood puzzle design\nHeart warming story if you care about it\nNo precise platforming required it is purely logical puzzles and the time slowing mechanic is good and negates any precise \nplatforming required\n\nCons\nA bit repetitive\nNew mechanics are combined in a way where it is not explained in advance though the tutorials prior give you an idea\n\nRecommended if you like puzzle platformers with good logical puzzles which are not too hard. The puzzles are fairly easy and do not require mind melting solutions. It is fairly casual game which is very easy to get into it. This is not a hardcore puzzle platformer like Braid or recursed which require out of the box solutions and involve game changing level design. buy iy for a stressfree puzzle platformer experience.", "timestamp_created": 1483360155, "timestamp_updated": 1483360155, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28937020": {"recommendationid": "28937020", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972852165", "num_games_owned": 625, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 571, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483472488}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent mix pf puzzle and platformer.

You are able to switch between colors to reveal hidden platforms, doors, and other obstacles like lasers and paint to solve puzzles. The difficulty curve starts off easy to get you accustomed to switching between colors, and the switching mechanic is very fair, as it slows down time while you pick colors so you don't have to have split second timing (though at times you do need to think quickly). The difficulty increases steadily as more colors are added, and the last few puzzles are very thought-provoking but never impossibly hard. Save points are well-spaced and fair. There are several \"run away and switch colors many times omg!!!\" sections where you have to think on your feet but most you can take your time and plan. Music is great; very atmospheric. Honestly, my one complaint is that during the voice over story bits, instead of leaving you idle or doing them over actual puzzles, you traverse through a long maze of ladders, stairs, or jumps with no point except to keep you busy and to listen to the story. This means that you can be just holding arrow keys for a long time without any purpose except to get to the next area. Annoying, but not a deal-breaker.\n\n10/10.

It won't take your breath away like a more realistic game like Steep but it has charm and a glorious use of colour that the whole game is based on. \n\nThe gameplay itself, is rather intuitive and new mechanics are introduced throughout which helps to keep it fresh. Changing colours - the main gimmick of the game - is a simple and fluent process, the developers have incorporated it well into the gameplay. There is a little bit of momentum which can be annoying at times (\"Goodness! Stay still box!\"). The levels do get increasingly complex as the game progresses but except for one or two levels, they are intuitive and not frustrating. I really do wish it was longer though!\n\nThe music - very calming, very soothing (much wow), it really suits the game.\n\nThe plot is told via letters is thought-provoking, poignant and a touch philosophical. There isn't much substance behind it does raise a few interesting ideas.\n\nAnd another completely relevant point - it's Hue, a game focused on colour. The pun deserves credit.\n\nI really enjoyed playing Hue. It's a game that is very relaxing and although it does have a little short-term replayablity (you could probably play in a years time when you forget all the levels), it can leave a lasting impression. Would I recommend paying the full-price? Maybe. But if it's on sale and you want a short and well-made game?

I don't know if anyone else mentioned it, so I am. I don't know about full colorblind, but you can play this if you're partially color-blinde! Go to options, under video, and check the box! The option comes with symbols that distinguish the colors. Also, because it took me like 10 minutes the very first time I opened the game, ALL your options are under ESC. Hit ESC to get the map, quit, video, audio etc. This is very important as game set-up is defaulted to WASD which is insane to get used to. You hit ESC and go into \"Options\" for the arrow keys instead. (it also lets you change controller keys).\n\n10/10. BEAUTIFUL GAME. It took me days to finish. At first it's really easy, and then the levels get super hard with a few easy ones in between. Unless you're really good at puzzles-I had to play with my friend who kept solving it. Made my life easier. But it is no less fun. I'd say about 6 hours, and I'm not the only one. So, 6 hours of game play. \n\nThe graphics are great. I love the colors, and they're easy enough to control to switch in between each other. The music is beautiful. The only annoying sound was the death sound because I hate crunching noises and I heard it frequently tbh. Especially 2 specific chapters near the end. The moms letters range from really good to kind of stupid and pointless, but mostly I loved her letter. Each color you find (one at a time) reveals a new segment of her letter. With on by the professor, second to last. I'm not really sure what the point of the game or the letter or the game is-I don't know why she didn't just come home by herself. I guess she was only able to come back with Hue? \n\nIt was a fun game though, and hard enough (and fun enough) that once you finish the game, replaying it won't be that bad. The only achievement I haven't gotten was finding all the beakers. I'll have to continue playing the game now that I'm finished, for that.

Avant m\u00eame d'\u00eatre sorti, il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 gagn\u00e9 7 r\u00e9compenses dans divers comp\u00e9titions et festivals. Le principe est simple, on doit se servir des couleurs pour r\u00e9soudre des \u00e9nigmes et autres puzzles. Il est possible de changer de couleur (7 couleurs sont disponibles) et ainsi afficher ou cacher certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments du d\u00e9cor. En jouant avec les couleurs, il sera possible \u00e0 notre brave hue (h\u00e9ros de notre aventure) de retrouver sa m\u00e8re disparue il y a peu.\n\nHue est un jeu au gameplay simple mais \u00f4 combien efficace. On se d\u00e9place dans un monde limit\u00e9 en couleurs \u00e0 la recherche de notre m\u00e8re et on va devoir explorer diff\u00e9rents niveaux pour y trouver des couleurs. Ces dites couleurs nous permettront de voir la vie... en couleurs! En effet, si l'on s\u00e9lectionne la couleur bleu clair, on pourra voir tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du d\u00e9cor comme des plateformes ou des caisses des autres couleurs. Il faudra donc changer souvent de couleurs pour comprendre et analyser les salles contenant des puzzles afin de trouver une cl\u00e9 et d'ouvrir une porte se trouvant dans le dit niveau.\n\nUne id\u00e9e simple mais ca se complique tr\u00e8s vite!\n\nHue commence donc tranquillement avec des salles simples qui nous permettent de nous acclimater avec le concept du jeu. On arrive \u00e9galement assez vite \u00e0 certains endroits inaccessibles car utilisant une couleur que l'on a pas d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9. Le jeu nous permettra donc une fois fini d'explorer \u00e0 nouveau son monde afin de trouver des myst\u00e9rieux gobelets secrets d\u00e9bloquant un achievement. La progression est logique m\u00eame si on a le choix de l'endroit o\u00f9 l'on souhaite aller. Il n'arrive jamais que l'on soit perdu ou bloqu\u00e9, on retrouve toujours son chemin et la voie du succ\u00e8s!\n\nHue ne se limite pas aux seuls puzzles logiques, il va \u00e9galement mettre \u00e0 rude \u00e9preuve nos r\u00e9flexes et notre sens du timing. En effet, certaines phases de plateforme viendront donner du piment au jeu et nous \u00e9viteront une certaine monochromie, heu non monotonie pardon! Ces phases sont assez simples et souvent dr\u00f4les, il s'agit surtout de choisir la bonne couleur au bon moment et de changer rapidement apr\u00e8s par une autre. Il faut savoir que le jeu est permissif et nous propose de geler un peu le temps lorsque l'on utilise la roue des couleurs gr\u00e2ce au stick droit de la manette.\n\nUne belle histoire aussi mine de rien.\n\nAu niveau de la r\u00e9alisation, Hue est un jeu au design \u00e9pur\u00e9 et qui peut faire penser aux jeux Game and watch. Il tourne donc sur de tr\u00e8s modestes configurations ce qui vous permettra d'y jouer m\u00eame avec un grille pain carburant \u00e0 une geforce an\u00e9mique. La maniabilit\u00e9 est parfaite et si on rate son coup, c'est uniquement de notre faute. J'ai toutefois eu quelques soucis de choix de couleurs avec le stick droit mais c'est un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne plut\u00f4t rare.\n\nHue n'est pas qu'un simple concept amusant et prenant, c'est aussi tout un environnement narratif et une ambiance au top. Mention sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la bande son que je trouve fabuleuse et qui se fond parfaitement dans l'esprit du jeu. Elle est certes calme et presque monotone mais elle apporte un r\u00e9el plus au jeu dans sa dimension narrative. L'histoire est \u00e9galement excellente avec des lettres \u00e0 trouver dans les niveaux et qui racontent ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 notre m\u00e8re. Tout est doubl\u00e9 magistralement par d'excellents com\u00e9diens, un pur r\u00e9gal!\n\nP\u00e9tard mais je suis un g\u00e9nie!\n\nHue propose un challenge de qualit\u00e9, ni trop simple ni trop abscon. On est souvent surpris par l'ing\u00e9niosit\u00e9 des puzzles et par ces doux moments on se surprend soi-m\u00eame! La dur\u00e9e de vie est plut\u00f4t bonne pour un jeu de cette gamme de budget, il m'a fallu 7 heures pour tout finir et d\u00e9bloquer tous les achievements! Je ne suis rest\u00e9 bloqu\u00e9 que sur un seul puzzle avec des plateformes dot\u00e9es de peinture mais apr\u00e8s r\u00e9flexion et l'aide de mon fils, j'ai trouv\u00e9 la solution! Tout est logique et on se demande parfois pourquoi on s'est compliqu\u00e9 la vie sur certains puzzles.\n\nHue est une magnifique surprise pour moi, je n'ai d\u00e9couvert le jeu qu'apr\u00e8s avoir achet\u00e9 la bande son et je suis tomb\u00e9 sous le charme. Le jeu n'est ni trop dur ni trop facile. On s'\u00e9tonne soi-m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9solu des puzzles sans que le jeu devienne frustrant.

The mechanics in the game are intriguing and fun to work with; and the design of the entire game fits with the game very well. Though some people may think that the story was over ambitious or the puzzles were too easy or repetitive, I personally loved the story and thought it was very well executed. Though later puzzles were quite frustrating, most puzzle games are so I wouldn\u2019t call it a criticism. The only criticism that I would give this game is that the running time is quite short for a game that is going to cost the user \u00a312; the audio can also become quite repetitive, but it is the puzzles that are supposed to be intriguing, not the soundtrack.

Hue is a platformer puzzle game based around altering the world around you according to color. It has a very philosophical narrative to go along with it, along with beautiful music and smooth, fairly cute visuals. The animation actually somewhat reminds me of one of my favorite games, Super Paper Mario. I didn't fully understand every aspect of the story, but I was able to follow most of it and it was profoundly interesting.\n\nHue is extremely polished. I can think of one or two things that will likely be patched, but you might not even notice on your playthrough. For example, there's one puzzle (and I do mean one puzzle in the entire game) where you can trap yourself in an area with no way out except to restart the room from the pause screen. However, you can only really trap yourself if it's at the beginning of the puzzle, so you don't even have to reset very far.\n\nOverall, Hue is a very enjoyable and unique experience, and I'm very glad I purchased it. I loved that when you reach the final puzzle there are multiple indications, such as the music changing, that let you know that you're on the final puzzle, and thus fill you with determination.\n\nHue is a fantastic play.

You are given a palette of colours and an array of obstacles, interactable objects and hazards in these colours. Each time you change to a colour, all of the objects of that colour disappear and you can move yourself and other objects through them. The core gameplay consists of switching through colours and manipulating objects, phasing some in and out of existence in order to make your way to the end of the level.\n\nUnlike many puzzle games, however, these puzzles are always intuitive and never infuriating. You will usually know exactly what to do very quickly, and even if there is a little thinking outside the box involved, these levels are not particularly long or complex, so even later levels will not take more than ten to fifteen minutes in total to figure out, and can be completed in thirty seconds once you know what to do - though there are quite a few curveballs where you get close to the end and realise things aren't going to work the way you intended, so it's back to the drawing board! They are also well-designed; each level has a few hazards, but dying will never take you back more than a few moments. There are also very few situations where you will be stuck and need to reset the level. The end result is that you will never be too frustrated at a level. You will always know where you went wrong and what to do to proceed, and you will never feel that your deaths were unfair. Many times I entered a level, looked at it, and thought 'oh no, this is going to be a rigmarole' and was always proven wrong by how intuitive and simple it really was. The levels are always fun and interesting to play, throwing in new mechanics every few levels so you never get bored or complacent. There are also a few short pure platforming sections mixed in to shake things up a little and keep things varied.\n\nAs well as exemplary gameplay, Hue also exhibits a fantastic soundtrack and aesthetic. A simple, cartoony art style with snappy animation makes everything stand out, and really helps with making the levels intuitive. The soundtrack is an eclectic acoustic mix of mostly slow piano tracks, with the odd bouncy, fun song mixed in to keep the mood high. The sound design is also snappy, with everything having its own distinct, fun sound.\n\nThe one area where the game is not so great is the story. There are many sections where you are merely wandering down a corridor, listening to some narration. The story is a little interesting, but the writing is not fantastic, often very simple philosophical musings that don't really add anything to the game. The voice acting is great, but while these sections are short, they take a minute or so each, which is quite a lot in a game like this where levels are also short, and only serve to slow down the pacing.\n\nOverall, Hue is one of the few puzzle games I have played in which I never got frustrated or felt the puzzles were unfair or padding (apart from the story sections). The levels being short really helps the gameplay, so that you are never stuck anywhere for too long. The level design is some of the best I have seen in a puzzle game; always intuitive and simple, but still making you think differently every time.\n\nHighly recommended and one of the best puzzle games I have played.", "timestamp_created": 1472894023, "timestamp_updated": 1472894562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579549", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25313615": {"recommendationid": "25313615", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091105589", "num_games_owned": 491, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 822, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495928067}, "language": "english", "review": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgobwW1MXGg\n\nI love this game.

Hue isn't like that, though. I feel I have enough time to make the correct decision and any mistakes I make are through to not thinking the puzzle through rather than not pressing a button at the exact millisecond it requires.\n\nI think my only minor complaint is that it might be shorter than I would have liked, given how fast I'm picking up chievos.

As the story goes Hue's mother is a scientist who, with the help of another scientist named Dr. Grey create a ring called the Annular Spectrum. The ring is used to alter the perception of color. Unfortunately Dr. Grey gets paranoid of the rings power and Hue's mothers obsession with the project. Dr. Grey steals the ring and destroys it. This accidentally sending Hue's mother into a shade-like area making her invisible. This is where your story begins. You have to find all shards of the ring, put it back together and find your mother. Throughout your adventure you get to collect letters left behind by your mother. These letters explain what happened to her leading up to the accident.\n\nThe art style of the game is beautiful and full of color. The game might start out black and white but as you collect new colors, the game really begins to fill out and looks amazing. The level designs are right up there with the art style. They looked great and are very creative. Everything down to the way the levels look, to the way they were layed out, to the platforming and how the games unique color changing mechanic was incorporated into everything couldn't have been done better. \n\nThe soundtrack to Hue was surprisingly large. The steam page says that there are 30 tracks in total. Most of the songs I remember hearing were very calm and soothing, which was very helpful for later on in the game when the puzzles start to get a little harder. Even in the beginning, the sound track to Hue made for a very casual feeling game. I personally didn't find Hue to be a casual game though. Maybe at the start yes but later on you are tested on your puzzle solving skills. The sound effects were very realistic. You get to hear a wide range of things from running waterfalls, to falling bolders, to flaring fires, to the creeking sounds of gates opening and even the simplistic sounds of moving a box. All of it sounded real.\n\nThe Good\n\n- Controller compatable.\n- No crashes or frame drops throughout the entire game.\n- Awesome voice acting.\n- Great story and build up with narroration from the mother. Could have been a very generic story if not for the extra explanation from the letters you collect.\n- Narroration made me involved with the characters. Both Hue and his mother.\n- Amazing controls. Responded very well. With one minor issue. (In \"The Bad\" Section)\n- Very unique and fun puzzle solving mechanics.\n- Difficulty progression is great. Later puzzles get more challenging and really test your problem solving.\n- Fun and challenging platforming mixed in with their unique game mechanics.\n- New ways to solve puzzles added throughout the game so the puzzles don't get repeatative.\n- Collectable beakens for completionist that you can later go back and collect.\n- 4 to 5 hours long.\n- Great conclusion to the story.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- No replay ability outside of achievements and collecting beacons.\n- Colors didn't always register if I tried to change them quickly.\n- Price 16.99, A little high for my liking. Personally more around the 10.99.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nConsidering I went into Hue expecting a copy and paste like a lot of other games in this genre, I was more then impressed. I completely recommend Hue. I would prefer a lower cost but to be honest the games story and overal gameplay experience would be worth the buy.\n\nIf you're interested - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw9VH3h4ot8", "timestamp_created": 1472598654, "timestamp_updated": 1473865513, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582820", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25258617": {"recommendationid": "25258617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020125851", "num_games_owned": 8674, "num_reviews": 718, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471939849}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]A Story Driven Puzzle Platformer[/h1]\nhttps://youtu.be/-GNMww9esPo\n+ The gameplay is fun and very unique.

It\u2019s so expensive!\u201d -- NO, SHH. LET ME TELL YOU WHY.\n\n[i]I played this game for 3 hours straight in awe of the beauty and the story, the motivational words that it had for me and the deep expansive psychological intellectual content that it threw at me in tiny bits of little letters I could find.[/i] In the 3 hours that I played I thought I finally came to the ending of the game but it was only the beginning, I\u2019m not even done yet, I was just given a different mission. But because I don\u2019t know when this game ends, even for the time I\u2019ve played, I would buy this game and I\u2019d be happy.\n\nAbout halfway through I became sad, knowing that this game might soon end and that Fiddlesticks Games may never revisit or make a sequel. In the time that I\u2019ve been a gamer and a Youtuber I\u2019ve kept a list of games that have a special place in my heart. Hue is in my top 5, along with Bioshock: Infinite and Life is Strange. It\u2019s up there with big games from big companies, for good reason.\n\nSince the beginning of this game I was reminded of the old timey cartoony style that this game kind of hints to, which is one of my soft spots. I [i]adore[/i] Steamboat Willie-type stuff and it directly ties into the historical aesthetic of Bioshock Inf, my top 1 game of all time. But enough about how beautiful this game is.\n\nThe gameplay is top-notch. There is a minimal tutorial that shows you everything you have to do to get levels done. There is a very gradual slope up of difficulty and there is the runs, THE RUNS THAT TERRIFIED ME but they were sequenced so well with the music and the story that I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how these people didn\u2019t make more groundbreaking games like this one. Once you play this game, you\u2019ll know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nWhat I really think is interesting: even though the game only saves the level where you\u2019ve started - making for some deaths halfway through a certain puzzle - I did not become [i]triggered[/i] or felt like this was in any way a rage game (although in one part there was a spiky roof that didn\u2019t have to be there, see ep 3 of my YT playthrough, but it\u2019s forgiven). It was challenging in the best way.\n\nExtra notes: [b]If you love Bioshock Infinite[/b], buy this game. There is so much psychology and intellect being thrown at you in Hue.\n[b]If you love Limbo, buy this game[/b]. It might remind you of it and it does a good job of being challenging.\n[b]If you love collecting things, buy this game[/b]. There are chemistry that you can collect and a bunch of achievements.\n[b]If you love casual, puzzles, good & smart story and a game that won\u2019t piss you off[/b], buy this game. \n\nPay for the things that are worth it in life, help out the devs their bills and maybe fund a sequel for this game. You might be missing out on a first hand experience of this game for a long time.\n\n[strike]But for those of you who really want to regret not buying it, and because I love giving choices, here you go:[/strike] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktV6w17sq2k\n\n~", "timestamp_created": 1472582803, "timestamp_updated": 1472582941, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.471432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25254074": {"recommendationid": "25254074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087152738", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473643104}, "language": "english", "review": "\\\\ Review to be update as I play through the game.\n\nFirst Impressions -\nThis game draws you in right from the start, the monochromatic world is very intriguing and once you start being able to paint the world with colour it really brings the whole game to life.

It's a story with professional and captivating narration. \n\nYour goal is to search for colors and find your missing mother. The only way to accomplish your goal is by solving puzzles. The puzzles start off being simple and gradually increases in difficulty as most puzzle games do. What makes this game unique from other puzzle games? The more colors you have, the harder the puzzles become. \n\nDon't worry, you won't find yourself solving puzzles monotonously. It's not just a room of puzzles followed by another room of puzzles. You'll solve the puzzles AND stay for the story. \n\nSince I haven't finished the game yet, I've rated this game a 9/10.

The puzzles themselves are of a nice balance, im so glad i'm not stuck their for hours on end trying to get passed an area because i couldn't figure it out. However, the puzzles aren't necessarily easy either. Those that are easy to solve, are required to be solved quickly as tense, frantic moments of struggle can occur when running through corridors of falling skulls, lazors and rocks whilst simultaneously figuring out how to survive. \n\nThe story itself has no cutscenes however is in the form of \"My Impossible Colour Girl\" telling me in parts how she ended up in her state and her relationship with Dr Grey. Although some may find this monotonous, i found it as my personal reward for getting through a stage of puzzles, as i always wanted to know more. Also, colour facts!\n\nAtlast, i have yet to finish the game so i cannot give a full verdict as for whether or not it's worth the price but if you enjoy a peaceful, tranquil puzzle game, that is aesthetically pleasing on the eyes than you WILL enjoy this game. I am concerned about the length of the game as i have just collected all the colours 2 and a half hours in but there could be more to it as far as i know and on top of this, there are collectables that require harder puzzles to solve to gain to help further the gameplay if needed.\n\nIf you're not sold and want to see more of the game mechanics at hand than check out this video.

I can highly recommend Hue.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay footage, you can watch the first 20 minutes of the game here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-JSczd6s_E", "timestamp_created": 1472576225, "timestamp_updated": 1472576225, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467184", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39466584": {"recommendationid": "39466584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044581155", "num_games_owned": 533, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 241, "last_played": 1516388756}, "language": "english", "review": "Hue is a small puzzle platformer that wastes a good idea without developing or branching much of its potential.\n\nIn Hue, you change the background color with your right analog stick (or a popup wheel if you use the mouse), and foreground items of that color will blend and disappear only to reappear once you change again. This means you'll be able to do things like avoid lasers, going through blocks or swap the order of boxes if you blend them in the background.\n\nThis comes with a few decent puzzles among a majority of uninspiring one, mixed with some rooms that are more reflex tests than puzzles. You won't remember any of the rooms after a few hours of having finished the game, but you'll mostly enjoy them while solving them.\n\nUnfortunately, while the background color as a game mechanic is a great idea, it doesn't do much with it from a visual design standpoint. No real visual surprises come up, no creative vistas with ever changing colors... It's mostly black contours/foreground and there really isn't much going on. The ideas presented in the forgettable story are interesting but recycled and not well explored.\n\nA similar thing could be said of the puzzles. Many other puzzles have implemented fade-in/fade-out mechanics in the past; adding more colors doesn't necessarily mean you'll have a better or even particularly good game.\nYou get 8 colors by the end, but usually you'll use at most 4 in each puzzles, the others will be \"the other colors\" that simply don't matter. A vast majority of the puzzles would've worked with just 2 colors, and even then the mechanic isn't explored in depth.\nTo make things worse, two sets of colors are really hard to tell from each other: yellow+orange and fuchsia+purple will cause you more than one unwarranted death.\n\n\nIt's a decent puzzle platformer, but get it or play it only if you crave one right now.\nIt won't blow your mind.", "timestamp_created": 1516393321, "timestamp_updated": 1516393321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 20, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 545, "total_negative": 30, "total_reviews": 575}}

so if you start the game on normal you can just put it on epic to spice things up. \n\nin overall i recommend this game alot and i am looking forward to the 5th installment :)", "timestamp_created":

The music by Pyhrrna, an indie music developer, is legendary, The game is both very merciful and hardcore at the same time, allowing you to run away from battles at any time, (With some rare exceptions) but requires plenty of planning and of course, heavy strategy to beat most enemies on harder difficulties. The combat is complex and it lets you upgrade the characters how you see fit via equipment and skills, making each leg of your journey easier or harder depending on your decisions.

Quite surprisingly, I've fallen in love with it entirely, from the quirky antics that the group always gets themselves in, to the in-depth lore that the creator (Matt Roszak. Bless his soul) has put into. \n\nGameplay wise, it would play out as what you would expect from an RPG-esque like game. Statuses, buffs, debuffs, elemental weakness, spell levelling and so forth. And with four different characters to play around with, though you can only have three of them at one go, it can get kind of hectic at times. Not to mention the plethora of equipment that each of them use. Despite the numerous spells/equipment and such, you can go whatever playstyle you like. From a brute dmg build to more of a casual runthrough. Though I recommend building around enemies weaknesses and strength on the higher difficulties cos they would be hitting you really hard. \n\nDesign wise, I enjoy it. It's whacky, colourful and sets the theme of every location just nicely. The design that the creator used for the story is also very cute. The game doesn't take itself too seriously at times, given the numerous times the group would idly talk about. Heck, even the initial casts of some of the spells make it seem like they don't take things too seriously.

Playing this series is the best kind of nostalgia for middle school me. Flash games may be near-death nowadays, but I remember playing the second and third game in this series on Kongregate back in its heyday. \n\nThe best way to describe EBF4 is that it's a love letter old school RPG's while creating it's own unique identity. While the humor is wildly dated now, and never the drawing point in the first place, what really makes me love this gem is the intricate combat systems and heavy-tactic battles that it's nailed time and time again. There are numerous skills, elements and systems built into this game, and for someone starting out fresh it can be a bit overwhelming. Overlooking a single system, such as changing your equipment for battle or forgetting to cast debuffs at the beginning can make or break later fights. This game has no definition of \"cheese;\" you earn your victories from beginning to end, because it's the enemies that are overpowered. There are confrontations in this game (specifically in the steam-exclusive challenge areas) that can take upwards of an hour to defeat, with a single misstep spelling defeat. It's thrilling, and a bit draining.\n\nWhile it is called the fourth one, you do not need to play the first three to enjoy this one. The original games were definitely fun, but they are rough flash games that provided the basis for this one. This is the culmination of those games in it's own charming way, and it's improved in every possible light...except for the writing. Please be aware that the humor is insanely grating, childish and mind-numbingly sexist at certain points, but that is not where the value is. It is not a perfect game, and if you are looking for an RPG with any actual story, I highly doubt this will satisfy you. While the story structure isn't inherintly bad, and the paper cut out cutscenese a treat, the characters and general dialogue are filled with outdated memes and middle school level sex jokes that gave me the worst kind of nostalgia. If this is a dealbreaker, I completely understand.\n\nAs far as a game goes, however, there is some serious meat on this beast. I'm a bit irritated that steam does not keep hour logs when playing offline, but my play count for this is easily towards the 40-50 hour range. There are so many secrets and collectibles, with a varied, intricate vania-style unlock system that there is always new equipment and abilities to find and try out. Even after beating the game, I was still finding new secrets things, although my enjoyment had waned at this point. The artstyle is surprisingly cute, and there is an insane variety of enemies and bosses. I cannot emphasize enough how gratifying the challenge areas are, as they actualize everything you have learned to that point, and can be tackled at any time without reprocussion. The concept that the enemies scale to your level means it will always be difficult, but balanced if you go in with some forethought. \n\nAll in all, this game has aged phenomenally well, aside from the elements previously mentioned. It's been almost five years and the new one is on it's way, so it was a treat to revisit. I will most definitely be trying out EBFV, but in the meantime, this game is absolutely worth playing. Keep an eye out for a sale is my best suggestion, or if you want to see if it's your cup of tea, the base version is still available to be played for free online.

There's something to be had with both casuals and hardcore RPG fans.\n\nYour party in EBF4 consists of 4 party members, and they all have various skills, equipments and weapons. Each focusing on a different stat more than the other. Example:\nMatt is the sword user with the highest physical damage and physical defense.\nNatalie is the mage of the group and uses a variety of healing spells and magic attack, as she has the highest magic attack out of the group.\nLance is the gun wielder who plays a support role with minor healing and Dark & Bomb skills that the others lack.\nAnna is also a support, and like Lance she performs minor healing aswell, difference being she has different type of support skills and she dishes out more Earth, Poison and Wind skills.\n\nThese are just minor examples to give you an idea how each character is different.\n\nEach biome you come across are filled with different types of enemies and sometimes mini-bosses and at the end of the biome, a boss. All of these enemies and bosses have their respective elemental weaknesses and strengths, and status infliction weaknesses and resistence too.\nEach biome also have hidden secrets like various loot and treasure chests that contain new weapons and such.\n\nBoth your party members and the enemies function the same way in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Obviously you have basic stats like Evade, Attack, Accuracy, HP etc. \nBut depending what type of equipment you put on, including weapons, hats/helmets and outfits, you'll be giving yourself different sets of resistence or weaknesses.\nExample: If you give a party member an electric type weapon, armor, pin and hat that boosts electric armor, then there's a chance your electric resistence is great depending on the percentage.\nHere's how elemental resistence percentage works:\n0% = Nothing special, normal damage taken.\n+100% = No damage taken from said type of damage.\n+Above 100% (such as 150%) = Healed from said damage type\nAnything in the minus zone (-100% etc) = Weak towards it, avoid it.\n\nNot trying to write a strategy guide here, but it IS quite in depth.\n\nI've played all of the EBF installments, and I'm waiting anxiously for EBF5.", "timestamp_created": 1511703722, "timestamp_updated": 1512046841, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698652", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37645236": {"recommendationid": "37645236", "author": {"steamid": "76561198258065111", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511690796}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing", "timestamp_created": 1511690538, "timestamp_updated": 1511690538, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37622817": {"recommendationid": "37622817", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273380045", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 871, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496126353}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6700\u65e9\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u4e00\u4e2aflash\u7f51\u7ad9\u73a9 \u5b58\u6863\u4e22\u4e86\u4e24\u6b21...\n\u6ca1\u8bb0\u9519\u7684\u8bdd \u5927\u6982\u662f\u53bb\u5e74\u7684\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u5165\u6b63\u7684\u5427\n\u975e\u5e38\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\uff01\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4eba\u8bbe \u97f3\u4e50 \u8fd8\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u672c\u8eab\n\u867d\u7136\u6ca1\u6709\u6c49\u5316  \u4f46\u82f1\u8bed\u591a\u591a\u5c11\u5c11\u8fd8\u662f\u770b\u5f97\u61c2\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\n\n\u671f\u5f85EBF5\nMatt\u52a0\u6cb9", "timestamp_created": 1511674645, "timestamp_updated": 1511674645, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37594403": {"recommendationid": "37594403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050493174", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12794, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 995, "last_played": 1516203279}, "language": "english", "review": "Insanely tough on EPIC, but I'm going to do it!

Wie auch schon viele andere hier geschrieben haben kann ich es nur wiederholen, das Spiel sieht nicht gut aus, allerdings ist das Gameplay perfekt. Es macht einfach Spa\u00df sich auszur\u00fcsten und Gegner zu zerschnetzeln ohne eine aufwendige Story dahinter zu haben die einen immer wieder aus dem Spielgeschehen rei\u00dft. Ich kann es jedem empfehlen der nach einem spa\u00dfigen Spiel sucht, bei dem er auch noch gleichzeitig Discord oder Skype im Hintergrund anlassen kann, da es keine ultimative Konzentration fordert und es kaum Dialoge gibt. Um das Grundlegende zu erkl\u00e4ren, Ihr habt eine Gruppe aus Helden die alle unterschiedliche F\u00e4higkeiten haben und Ausr\u00fcstungsst\u00fccke tragen die man auch leveln und austauschen kann. Dann gibt es Gegner die alle Schw\u00e4chen und St\u00e4rken haben. Im Grunde ist es ein wenig wie das Nino Kuni System oder andere vergleichbare Titel, Ihr k\u00f6nnt eure F\u00e4higkeiten durch das Levelsystem und die getragene Ausr\u00fcstung verbessern. Nochmal, lasst euch nicht von dem etwas \u00fcberladenen Men\u00fc, der Grafik und den unwichtigen Dialogen ablenken, der komplette Spielspa\u00df kommt aus den K\u00e4mpfen, der Erkundung und dem Levelsystem.

The game's plot and dialogue are mostly there to be humorous.  Don't expect to see some intricate story or a bunch of character development.  The game's biggest strength lies in its deep combat mechanics.  The music is also pretty good as well.\n\nThe game starts with you in the first town and in control of the new main character for this game.  You'll eventually find the 3 other characters.  The map for the game takes place on a 10x10 grid.  The game consists of 3 towns, 5 main environments, a side environment, and a bonus environment that takes place off the grid called battle mountain.  You'll spend most of the game venturing through these areas killing enemies, fighting bosses, opening chests, and getting quests.  Each of the three towns contains a weapon/armor shop, forgeable item shop, and a health/status item shop.  Main environments contain enemies (all viewable) on a main path to that environment's boss that you will have to kill to get to it.  Once killed, these enemies stay dead forever.  Enemies off the main path usually guard chests and are optional to fight and respawn upon going to a new environment.  The side environment contains an optional boss and some items.  The battle mountain is a bonus area which contains all the enemies throughout the game, upgraded versions of each of the game's main bosses, and some unique bosses.  You get no exp/gold going through this area but do get item drops and access to unique equipment/skills.  All environments contain 1 or more quick travel points, so getting around quickly usually isn't an issue.  The game autosaves on every screen transition and can be saved manually any time outside of battle.\n\nEach of the game's 4 characters have access to their own unique set of skills.  You'll be able to upgrade these throughout the game but unlike EBF3, you'll be unable to fully upgrade every skill by the endgame unless you feel like grinding, so you need to choose wisely when upgrading.  New to this game are equipable skills.  You'll find new skills (including limit breaks) throughout the game that 2-4 of the characters will be able to learn.  Once you attach that skill to a character, only that character will be able to use it unless you choose to have that character forget the skill (wasting spent skill points).  This allows you to give characters spell types that they normally don't have access to.  Each character can equip a weapon, armor, a hat, and 3 badges.  All equipment can be leveled up by forging.  Equipment works in a unique way.  Instead of giving simple stat upgrades, such as +30 attack, they instead give bonus multipliers to a character's base stats, such as multiplying health by 1.1, attack by 1.15, etc.  Each equipment gives different multipliers to different stats as well as different elemental/status defenses, and many of them have unique abilities attached to them such as automatically casting revive or dropping mammoths on your enemies.  This means that even your starting equipment can be just as viable to have on as something you find towards the end of the game.  What you want to equip will be based on what elements enemies are weak against, what elements/statuses you want to buff yourself against, what stats you want to buff, and what special abilities you like.  Badges are useful in covering weaknesses that your normal equipment didn't cover.  They do things such as give elemental/status resistances, special abilities, or buff stats.\n\nThe game has 4 difficulty settings that you're free to switch between throughout the game without any penalty.  I only played on epic difficulty (the hardest one) and I found the game to be very fair on it.  There was no point throughout the game where I had to grind levels at all to continue on, though I did have to skip 2 of the optional minibosses and come back to fight them later.  Combat with the regular enemies feels just right and the bosses are incredibly satisfying to beat, especially the more difficult upgraded versions on battle mountain and the final boss.  I got my ass handed to me several times, but changing up my equipment/strategy/tactics was enough to overcome any failures.  The only time I might recommend switching difficulties is when fighting the regular enemies on battle mountain.  These fights usually come in waves of 8-10 whereas normal battles are usually 1-3 waves.  I stayed on Epic throughout and some of those regular battles on battle mountain can take anywhere from 20-40 minutes to complete.  If you ever do feel a need to grind, you can always switch the difficulty to easy as enemies give the same XP no matter which difficulty you play on.\n\nAs for combat, there are plenty of enemies types and plenty of variations on those types, each feeling pretty different.  There are 10 elemental types and 12 status effects, so you can never cover everything.  Status effects and buffs/debuffs matter alot.  Bosses require both tactical and strategic planning.  You'll often find yourself in situations where you have to make meaningful decisions rather than just spamming the same moves over and over every round.  Combat animations are quick, so outside of limit breaks, you're not sitting around for 10 seconds watching characters cast spells or watching enemies dance around for no reason.  Characters can be swapped in/out during combat.  Only 3 of your 4 characters can fight at once.  I  wasn't sure I was going to like this as I thought it meant someone was going to get left out, but I grew to enjoy it.  All the characters are useful, so you will switch characters in and out based on various things.\n\nI really don't have much of anything to complain about.  My biggest issues were occasional slowdown in some battles and I had the game freeze up twice, once halfway through the final boss which was real lemon timing.  Also, the spacesuit armor is pretty good but its special power can be annoying.  It calls in 'Scanbot' to scan enemies during battle and can activate multiple times over the course of a battle.  Once you've scanned an enemy, you retain its info permanently, so when it does it multiple times it's just wasting your time.\n\nA great RPG, wish more of them were like this.", "timestamp_created": 1506405612, "timestamp_updated": 1507510561, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694845", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35206987": {"recommendationid": "35206987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118823406", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1410, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512864771}, "language": "english", "review": "Really awesome game, a nice turn-based JRPG with a fair amount of strategy but not too much to make the game complicated, keeping in-line with its simple, clean interface.

Characters also get three accessory slots this time, some of which have interesting effects like replacing weapon status effects.\n* Some of the medals are more lenient this time around, especially the treasure hunting medals.\n* Battle Mountain is a good way to test one's skills against equally leveled opponents.\n* The skill system allows more element variety for the characters. For example, Matt can now learn thunder skills to take advantage of his Golden Dragon sword.\n* The summon system adds more depth to the battle system, since it costs SP that's obtained from killing enemies.\n\nMixed:\n* Like the previous games, the dialogue and story is funny, but not particularly deep. That said, the main antagonist of this game is more interesting than the previous one due to their motives.\n\nCons:\n* There's currently a memory leak due to leftover status icons. The game has to be restarted every now and then to avoid crashes.\n* No explanation is given for the party's level reset this time. Though Matt (the character) did mention that he didn't work out enough recently, which implies the old party is rusty.\n\nSome features that would have been nice:\n* Level scaled versions of the final boss and glitch boss.\n* Resolutions that match Youtube's preferred pixel height.\n* A backlog that records recent dialogue.\n* A way to disable automatic attacks and counterattacks.\n\nTips:\n* Finish Battle Mountain before fighting the final boss. Without the Battle Mountain equipment, the final boss is about as hard as the fourth boss rush. With that equipment, the final boss will be a lot easier to defend against.\n* Take advantage of the tired and weaken statuses against bosses, since most of them have 50% resistance to normal stat lowering effects.\n* Don't neglect stat items, since enemies gain more per level than the player otherwise. This is especially important in Battle Mountain, where enemies scale.\n* For normal boss rush, beat the boss while they still have weak minions on the field.

I went into the game expecting a higher tier RPG maker like game, but it was so much better than those.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 is basically a grid movement based game with a JRPG combat style that follows from the events of Epic Battle Fantasy 3. That doesn't sound incredibly interesting from the description (which is what I thought as well), but the gameplay, progression, and secrets make it so fun. Oh and don't forget about the witty 4th wall breaking humor. The enemy difficulty scales up perfectly, and often times you will be challenged or have to rethink your fights as you go along (assuming you didn't grind). You can always turn down the difficulty as well if you are feeling too pressured, especially for some of the boss fights.\n\nEBF4 actually has an incredible amount of things to do, stats, and items. There are 8 different elements, and 8 different kind of status effects (if I recall correctly) that you will learn to deal with. Each region has a different main enemy type. Once you scan an enemy, you can attack or use spells according to their weaknesses. Not only that, but there are a bountiful amount spells and abilities to learn amongst your four playable characters (of which only three will ever be fighting at once). Aside from that, debatabely the best part is how the designed the levels and layouts. Certain parts of the grid cannot be accessed until you get a tool, like the hammer to destroy rocks. Even in the very first area you are in, there are things you can do once you progress further into the story. Basically, you can go back and visit your earlier regions and get some good treasures! The game has strategical warp points as well making it not much of a hassle to get from part of the map to another part. As for the visual and audio side, the game has excellent music, good sounds, great fight animations, and nice but childish looking character and landscaping.\n\nThe one flaw of this game that I found extremely annoying was that when I ran it in fullscreen mode on my laptop (4k res), it lagged like hell and crashed often. The game has a really weird fullscreen mode (at least it did for me), and I wish they added better support to higher resolutions.\n\nOverall, a really fun game that I would recommend. I might even go through a second playthrough because there is still some stuff that I missed in my first one.\n\nRating: 8.7/10\nRecommend Price: $9.99 or below", "timestamp_created": 1502670618, "timestamp_updated": 1502670618, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694444", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34215074": {"recommendationid": "34215074", "author": {"steamid": "76561198156644561", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 2989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502653183}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Simplesmente amo a franquia EBF, jogo desde o primeiro e esse superou minhas expectativas.\n\nPr\u00f3s:\nVariedade ainda maior de monstros, equipamentos e status.\nBalanceamento de inimigos\nNova \u00e1rvore de talentos e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de pontos\nInvoca\u00e7\u00f5es de monstros pra ajudar na batalha\nVarias piadas e refer\u00eancias :v\nTradu\u00e7\u00e3o pt br <3\nA historia desse completa a do game anterior (EBF3)\n\nContras:\nNenhum\n\nEspero ansioso para o lan\u00e7amento do proximo jogo da franquia.", "timestamp_created": 1502634597, "timestamp_updated": 1511407458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34201704": {"recommendationid": "34201704", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302321834", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 81, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501603053}, "language": "english", "review": "I feel conflicted about this game.

Elemental damage/resistances, status effects, buffs, and equips all play a major part in how your party performs in battle.  Each player gets one action every turn.  An action is using a skill (attack, buff, defend, etc), changing equipment, or using an item.  Enemies follow the same mechanic on their turn, except they don't switch equipment or use items.  In a nutshell, you hit the enemy until it dies.\n\n[h1][u]Map[/u][/h1]\n[i]Epic Battle Fantasy 4[/i] has a large map consisting of areas and tiles, which can be traversed using point-and-click pathfinding, or using a keyboard.  Areas are big sections of tiles which make up larger sections of the map.  Areas are inter-connected, and walking off the edge of one brings you to the corresponding area.  There's also map-based puzzles, such as pushing blocks (sounds boring, right?) until they clear a path to a chest, which can then be looted.\n\n[h1][u]Story[/u][/h1]\n[i]Epic Battle Fantasy 4[/i] has a storyline.  'nuff said (I'd rather not spoil anything).  There are also side-stories in which characters make jokes, and just talk in general.\n\n[h1][u]Rating[/u][/h1]\nI would give [i]Epic Battle Fantasy 4[/i] at least a [b]7/10[/b].  It has more than 60 weapons and 60 armor pieces, not to mention about 60 flairs (a special equipment type that any character can use).  There's four different difficulties and 'Battle Mountain', a place outside of the storyline where you can push the challenges to the limits.  Endless battles, foe rushes, boss rushes, new optional bosses, etc.\nNewgame+ is a feature that allows you to continue your profile with all your stuff, but enemies are higher levels to accomodate for you being a higher level.  Sadly, this caps at level 50 (but Battle Mountain scales with your character level, so it doesn't).

Klar, die Trailer und Cutscenes waren recht lasch. Allerdings bemerkt man die Besonderheit dieses Spiels erst, sobald man sich dazu entschieden hat es zu spielen. Zumindest war es \"EINDEUTIG\" besser als die Vorg\u00e4nger. \n\nEin recht typischer RPG, aber au\u00dferordentlich episch.\n\n\nEs hat mich 75 Stunden gekostet alle Achievements zu finden und das Spiel auf 100% abzuschlie\u00dfen. Gegen Ende habe ich Werte von bis hin zu 600-800k HP gehabt und einem Offensiven Angriffswert von 26k und bei Nat einen Magischen von 34k. Mit solchen Werten war auch \"Epic\" kein Hinderniss mehr, wodurch 3x durchspielen + \"Battle Mountain\" das optimale Ergebnis w\u00e4re.\n\n\nPro:/ \n\n- Typisches RPG Action Gameplay.\n- Sehr gro\u00dfe und \u00fcbersichtliche Ansammlung an Skills und Ausr\u00fcstung.\n- Gut ausgebautes Ressistenzen und Schw\u00e4chen System.\n- Unterhaltsamer Humor und Puns.\n- Viele Achievements zum sammeln und lieb haben.\n- Enth\u00e4lt in dieser Version den \"Battle Mountain\" welcher nur neue Herausforderungen mitbringt. \n- Einige Nebenquests, welche leicht etwas Abwechslung bringen.\n- Epic ist ein ernstzunehmender Schwierigkeitsgrad.\n- Wirklich angenehme Musik.\n\nKontra:/\n\n- Zu viele nacheinander folgende K\u00e4mpfe, nur viel zu viele irrelevante Gegner blockieren einem den Weg.\n- Viel zu wenig Dialoge, da diese durchaus sympathisch waren.\n\n\n\nF\u00fcr ein Spiel dieses Kalibers war es dennoch unterhaltsam, wer ein Sch\u00e4tzer solcher Spiele ist, wird hier gewiss auf seine Kosten kommen. \n", "timestamp_created": 1499528289, "timestamp_updated": 1499528289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483092", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33358903": {"recommendationid": "33358903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045630312", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499474158}, "language": "english", "review": "Ehh game sux but i will still play it because i like epic battle fantasy. i would recommend playing the 3rd one for free before playing this.\nAlso why does it suck?

Time flies.\nWhat is this game about? How the description on the store page says, this is a turn based rpg with cute graphics and stupid humor, how i like it. At first the gameplay seems simple but the game tells you from the first battle to scan every enemies because elemental weakness and resistances are the core of this game.\nThe game gives you a lot of equipment because to succeed you need to change your gear before starting an encounter or between waves to not be overwhelmed by your opponents. This is a good layer of strategy alongside the usual buff your party and debuff your enemies.\n\nThis brings another point i liked of this game, the forging. It's quite simple here, you need to have the materials acquired by slaying enemies or bought by stores to increase the atrritubutes of your gear and some also have passives like random chance to summon a belly flopping mammoth on an enemy each turn, auto cast buffs on your party or a damaging spell after attacking. So try equip and upgrade different piece of gear for some nice combos, don't focus on what looks the best!\n\n\n\nThe plot is quite simple and funnily enough it serves just as a background for our \"heroes\" to adventure on the map and acquire gear while doing stupid stuff. That's the charm of this series, the party is a bunch of goofballs with barely working brains. As Anna said: \"I have no idea how they survived this long with no survival skills\". Quite a different tone from your usual RPG.\n\nFinally, the soundtrack, which is free by the way, is really good. It set up the pace perfectly with happy tunes while exploring the grass areas or fighting the early enemies, to dark tones in the toughest fights. The composer is really good and she made EBF3 music too, check that out!\n\nNow, after praising basically everything, i will nitpick a couple of complains. First of all, some fights will drag a lot, expecially on higher difficulties, where the stats of enemies are increased, and when i saw an encounter was composed of 7 waves i was already rolling my eyes after finishing another long wave or a boss fight. I don't think it's boring, but i tended to overthink my strategy and equip for each wave and probably my brain was melting.\nSecond problem is that the game offers 4 characters, but unfortunatly it's best to focus on 3 and two slots are occupied by Matt (warrior) and Nat (Mage) for their highly specialized stats so the third slot is contested by Lance (Gunner) and Anna (Archer) that overlap a bit on their utility but many guides and myself went with Anna in the end since she is the newcomer and brings a bit more on the table than Lance (cough, evasion buff).\n\nTo conclude my fanboy review, i say this game gave me more than 30 hours of enjoyment for just 1\u20ac, and i plan to play   new game+ on Epic difficulty, but i can say that i should have bought this earlier, even at full price (11\u20ac.... not a lot) because it's a bargain for someone that enjoyed in his youth Final Fantasy and other turn based rpgs in the PSX era. Just don't let the \"anime\" graphic, \"childish\" humor and flash coding influence your opinion on this game.\nIf you aren't sure, you can play this for free on Kongregate or Newgrounds, the only thing you will miss is Battle Mountain, another end game with extra loot, but unrelated to the main quest, so you aren't missing any plot by not playing it. So you also have a demo, what more do you want?! :D\n\nNow, i'm waiting for EBF5, currently in development, and this time i will get it as soon as possible.\n\nTL.

The series is basically a parody of famous Japanese RPG games (mostly Final Fantasy). If you want some more preview on the older games, I suggest you read my review on previous game, EBF3 (which is also on Steam), if you haven't already.\n\nBut to keep things short, I'll just give you a small preludium: \nthe series started as free browser games that were made for fun and played to kill some free time, and even EBF4 itself can be played via your browser, but there's also an expanded, paid version (AKA the one I'm reviewing now), and it's not exactly cheap, 11,99 USD. Some professional games cost as much, and thus, the game will be judged like one.\n\n\nSo, first, what's the premise?\nAs a rather typical jRPG like game, you can expect the usual: explore the world, find treasures, both hidden and not, talk to stupid NPCs so they can give you their stupid quests, upgrade your skills and fight the enemies ( and there's lot of those).\n\n\n[b] The game world\t[/b]\nThe creator approched the matter with a safe and proven method: \nthe world itself is open, but it's filled with various obstacles and road blockers (such as rocks or trees, but also more absurd ones, like floating clouds) that make your road linear at first, but with time you acquire means of bypassing them, one by one. This not only allows you to progress, but also lets you find hidden treasures, enemies, and other content, so you will definitely be coming back to old places through your entire playthrough.\n\nAs I've said, it's a safe method that was used in countless titles. And it's not a bad thing really. Experimenting is good if you know what you're doing, but if something just works, I see no reason not to use it.\n\nThe world itself will charm you with its simple graphics (which are still a major improvement over the previous one) and varied environment, as well as subtle themes to be found, such as various references to other media and clever comments spoken by your team members.  \nOverall it may not be masterfully crafted, but it's full of its own unique charm.\n\n\n[b] Combat[/b]\n\nCombat has always been [u]THE[/u] core element of these games, and as such I'm very happy to say it spectacularly failed to disappoint me. \n\nNot only it's great on its own, it also improved on everything from the previous games without changing the basis even slightly.\nAside from the usual stuff like attacking, healing and using your Limit Breaks, there's 12 different status effect, 10 elements and over 100 unique skills which can be used BY you, or AGAINST you. Add shiploads of unique pieces of equipment and you've got EBF4.\nThat means a vast array of different strategies that you can use to defeat your enemies, and believe me, if you play on Epic (the hardest difficulty), you will want to spend some time thinking about them.\nWant to debuff your enemies to such point they can barely scratch you? Sure. \nWant to go full offense and counter your lack of defense by making your enemies unable to move? Guess that will work too.\nNaturally enemies have their strengths and weaknesses, and there's a whole lot of them (147, to give you the idea), so you will have to use everything at your disposal thorough the game.\nOverall it's just what a good turn-based jRPG should look like. Give the players freedom in their playstyle and let them experiment. I have absolutely no reason to complain.\n\n[b] Story and quests [/b]\nEach game has its pros and cons, and I've already explored the pros.\nNow, the story was never the main focus of these games, but it still deserves some attention. I can't really say much without spoiling it (as the story is partially revealed thorough the game). I'll just say that if you're enjoying the game itself, then the story will keep you interested, but if the game doesn't turn out to be your type, you won't stay just for the story.\nThe quests are just what they were in the previous game - that is, fetch quests. You are told to get some items, and you either get them from defeating monsters (or buying them from shop), or from some treasure chests, or from other quests. Simple as that. I can't say I expected more, but it certainly would be nice to see a more expanded and developed quest from time to time.

It's one of the few examples of a Flash game that's actually good. The story is silly and almost nonexistant, but the gameplay is satisfying and scratches that JRPG itch. The game is well-balanced almost all the way through, with almost no points that feel badly-designed. If you do pick up EBF4 do yourself a favor and start on the highest difficulty (Epic), as I feel that's the way it's meant to be played. You can always switch to a lower difficulty if it ends up being too much, which is nice.\n\nThe biggest flaw I can find with EBF4 is the 3-character party. There are 4 playable characters, but because there are permanent stat-boosting consumable items, the optimal way to play is to choose your party and completely ignore the 4th character for the whole game, because any stat-boosters would be wasted on them.\n\nOther than that, EBF4 is a great game that, while it may not be a masterpiece, is still a lot of fun and an homage to a genre that the game industry has long since forgotten.", "timestamp_created": 1489373151, "timestamp_updated": 1489374079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701710", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30478827": {"recommendationid": "30478827", "author": {"steamid": "76561198328937889", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514661328}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Otimo jogo com certa dificuldade", "timestamp_created": 1489349959, "timestamp_updated": 1489349959, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30477305": {"recommendationid": "30477305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075820042", "num_games_owned": 1891, "num_reviews": 198, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489345015}, "language": "english", "review": "Uniquely styled JRPG, it's ok.", "timestamp_created": 1489345030, "timestamp_updated": 1489345030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30443510": {"recommendationid": "30443510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028706850", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495539737}, "language": "english", "review": "Go see the bad reviews :\n- \"Nice, but I don't like this type of game\" (well, so you are biased, good sir)\n- \"Too much weeb shit, don't like it\" (You bought with eyes closed ?)\n- \"I can play free in flash version\" (Doesn't make the game bad, does it ?)\n- \"Good game but doesn't deserve high note\" (It's based on a yes or no system, so you say it's bad just to frack the global note... that's messed up)\n\nAll in all, the people voting against this game don't say it's bad.\n\nI loved this game when it was free, I still love it, I bought it just to support de dev, he deserves it.\n\nAnd, yes, my review is just ridiculing bad reviews, shame on me :)", "timestamp_created": 1489227172, "timestamp_updated": 1489227172, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.632813", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30434702": {"recommendationid": "30434702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109172060", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 5551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487739738}, "language": "english", "review": "A turn-based RPG with a somewhat unique take on the genre, at least in terms of the usual story vs. gameplay argument. I've never subcscribed to the idea that an RPG needs to have a massive, epic, complex story, and this game seems to agree with me. The story of this game is basically an RPG story template that hasn't really been filled in or built onto, though the details that are there are at least charming and lend a little bit of an identity.\n\nInstead, this game really seems to lean on its gameplay and its combat system. The weapons and armor that you equip can have a huge impact on your stats, and require different tactics to capitilize on their various perks and bonuses. There's a pretty good amount of enemy variety, and encounters are scripted instead of random encounters, leading to some battles that are created specifically to encourage you to take advantage of different armor and weapon sets.\n\nDefeating enemies gives you ability points, which you can spend to learn new skills or upgrade ones you already have. You've got a lot more control over the tools available to you than some other games give you, and I really appreciated that. However, the fact that better versions of skills are added on top of the weaker ones instead of replacing them, and the fact that some skills give you little to no reason to use them mean that the skill pool is smaller than it looks like it is.\n\nPlaying on Normal difficulty, I never found myself having to grind for experience or ability points to be able to move forward, but some enemies reappear when you leave and come back, so it's possible to save up some more EXP or AP if you think you need a bit more of an edge. Even when playing on the hardest difficulty, the boss fights never really pushed me too hard, though some of them did take a long time to beat. Worst case scenario: one of tne of the post-game bosses in the Battle Mountain area took me 47 minutes to beat, but I still managed it on my first try.\n\nBeating the game adds a New Game+ mode, scaling up the enemy levels and letting you replay the game starting with all of your endgame equipment. This opens up strategies you may not have had the first time through, and gave me a reason to play the game again. Beating New Game+ gives you New Game++, which just scales up enemies even more. it's basically just New Game+ again, so there's no real reason to play a third time unless you want all the achievments.\n\nThe game just endlessly repeats there. You can keep playing New Game++ over and over, and continue getting more stat-boosting items (whose effects carry over as well), leading to some absolutely ridiculous stat levels, and even the highest difficulty fails to provide any meaningful challenge after a while. The game kinda ends on an anti-climax, but the path there is definitely interesting, and given the price tag, it's worth a look, even for people who aren't super into RPGs, since the combat system is so well-refined and easy to get into.\n\nOh, and the music is just, amazing.

Gone is the abnormally intense grind to level your characters beyond all reason, as enemies and bosses scale to player level, and can be brought down using a variety of strategies based on equips, attacks, and status effects, all of which you continually obtain more of to keep the battle system fresh and flexible to differing playstyles. The story is limited but enjoyable, requiring no previous experience with the series to appreciate fully. And while the map progression is a little linear at first, various secrets and puzzles still make exploration rewarding, not to mention the lack of random battles means you can set your own pace with the game, choosing the order of battles at your leisure.\n\nThe addition of Battle Mountain to the Steam version was a welcome change to returning fans, and a great place to accquire game-changing gear to boost your battle tactics throughout the story and beyond. Not to mention, by the endgame, quite a challenge to clear all the boss rushes, making the last dozen or so achievements quite satisfying to get. All-in-all, a must-have for any RPG and/or Flash enthusiasts; the port from Newgrounds/Kongregate was masterfully done, with no noticeable performance issues on my end, as Kupo was thorough in addressing them into and well after release.\n\nIf the price tag is a little too steep for you, pin it on your wishlist for a while, Kupo's never modest about putting EBF4 for generous sales throughout seasonal events and not.

For example, not using fire-type weapons on Mr. Murderous Plant.\n-Some of the puzzles can be confusing, and irritating to solve.\n-Monoliths.\n-Expanding on the above point, that one battle where you cast Syphon 5 times, and it only works once, and the damn thing keeps healing itself and using charged attacks.\n-Expanding even further, RNG.\n\nMaybe not exactly a complete review, but it is 3:15 AM as of the time of me writing this, so excuse me for being half asleep.", "timestamp_created": 1486289587, "timestamp_updated": 1486289587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29656629": {"recommendationid": "29656629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094803808", "num_games_owned": 1376, "num_reviews": 1148, "playtime_forever": 188, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486142845}, "language": "english", "review": "Garbage Flash Game", "timestamp_created": 1486068865, "timestamp_updated": 1486068865, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.271968", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29646121": {"recommendationid": "29646121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057717230", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 1226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498503854}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played some web browser version of this game in the past.

Searching the web, this is a common issue. It's apparently a side effect of translating from a Flash game to an exe and the dev can't do anything about it.

Lo que los sigue haciendo especiales es que los puede realizar cualquier jugador en cualquier momento (porque las animaci\u00f3nes de la criaturas son muy bonitas y eso, pero en cuanto a mec\u00e1nica de juego no aportan nada). Otra cosa a favor es que el Contemplador vuelve como compa\u00f1ero para el equipo, lo cual es bueno.\n[/list]\n\nLa lista de cosas buenas es tan escueta como es, porque este juego es al anterior lo que el segundo fue para el primero: m\u00e1s de lo mismo pero mejor. As\u00ed que todo lo que falta por decir est\u00e1 dicho en la entrega anterior y no hace falta repetirlo.

Ser\u00eda mucho mejor un sistema con roles m\u00e1s definidos que siga permitiendo repartir algunas habilidades, pero sin dejarte hacer un desmadre. Porque al final acabas buscando consejo en internet de c\u00f3mo hacer una build que valga la pena en lugar de experimentar y dejarte gu\u00edar tal y como deber\u00edas hacer.\n\n[*]Hay [b]demasiados[/b] elementos. Esto es m\u00e1s cuesti\u00f3n de gustos, pero en mi opini\u00f3n con fuego, hielo, electricidad, sagrado y oscuridad basta y sobra. Humedecer a los enemigos para provocarles m\u00e1s da\u00f1o con rayo o hielo tiene sentido, pero ponerlo como un elemento propio teniendo ya el hielo se me hace redundante. Al veneno tiene sentido que se pueda ser m\u00e1s resistente o m\u00e1s vulnerable, pero no me parece interesante m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de ser un hechizo que haga da\u00f1o en cada turno, y en estos juegos los hechizos de tierra y aire siempre me parece que est\u00e1n puestos s\u00f3lo porque se los considera elementos en otros contextos y parece m\u00e1s completo, pero por lo general no tienen mucho sentido. Y considerar la bomba como un elemento propio (en vez de darle da\u00f1o de fuego y/o el\u00e9ctrico), es lo que el agua al hielo.

Everything from the characters to the anime references and memes are memorable. Gameplay is fair, it isn't too hard on normal, and although it is challenging to beat on Epic (very hard), it is not relentlessly so. This version also contains features that were not present in the Kongregate version, such as the Battle Mountain, as well as new pieces of equipment. The music is phenomenonal. Fitting for the scenario and masterfully made. Overall a great game.\n\nPros: Improves upon what made the previous version better and adds more replay value. Good music. Humourous. Great difficulty. Addicting.\n\nCons: The challenges imposed by Battle Mountain may be too rigourous for some, and that could lead to frustration (also, the final boss, lol).

About 50-100 hours of content. Fun and detailed art style, TONS of personality, a lot of scenario variety, and lots of humor.

It's light hearted, cheeky dialogue and enemies are very memorable and endearing.  I've played it through 4 full times and haven't gotten sick of it yet.\n\nPros:\n- The music is unbelievably good.  Phyrnna (the composer) is up there with the best in the business.  While the game is great, the single most impressive aspect is the music.\n- The underlying battle system is very well balanced and expansive.  Tons of skills, summons, items, weapons, variety and it also works well.  You don't find yourself having to rely on the same tactic over and over.  Different enemies require different tactics.\n- The dialogue is really enjoyable.  Many, many hilarious lines in this game.\n- Nice variety of achievements to add replay value.\n- Characters have strong personalities and are very unique.  Quite memorable.\n- Puzzles are fun, not too common and well designed.\n- The game itself is nicely designed and does a good job of rewarding you for searching for secrets (hidden treasures and stuff, nothing super important)\n\nCons:\n- Can feel a bit grindy at times especially when you get to the battles that have 3 waves.  Fortunately amazing music is there to take the edge off.\n- Not enough reason to utilize your 4th character.  It's too easy to just park Lance in the back up slot and never use him.  He's a fun character, but Anna is the better support character since she has access to the party defense up and reflex up buffs.  Lance just can't keep up with her and thus gets overlooked for important battles.\n\n\nOverall:\nThis is unquestionably a fun, well made game.  The game knows what it is trying to be and pulls it off extraordinarily well.  Kupo Games is a one man, independent studio who puts out high quality games at good prices.

The game is longer due to the bigger worlds so EXP and AP leveling is a bit slowed down it seems to make up for the larger worlds and more battles.\nPlenty of unlockables and pathways to go, however I find myself rarely using the new girl unless one of the original characters is dead and I am too lazy to revive them.\n\nThe puzzles are still a nice challenge, not too hard but not too easy but at the same time some of them are just time consuming and this is due to the slow down.\nEBF3 did not have slow-down but even with turning off animations and making the graphics as low as possible my game still slows down and seem to freeze when changing to a new scenary. Heck my game crashed on me after a battle even though I had nothing else running. Now I keep saving more than ever incase it randomly wants to break down on me.\n\nI enjoy the game but the lag/slow down issues need to be fixed, other on forums have reported this. It may be due to the game being larger in size then EBF3 but my game can handle much bigger and better games graphical-wise so the issue is just a massive let-down, specially when re-checking areas for 100% completion.\n\nI would still recommend this game, I have not even completed it once yet and still have 12+ hours clocked in on this and I know generally know what to do and know the enemies already so you do get your money's worth.\n\nOnly other bad thing to say is the fact Bestiary does not save over to other save-files unlike in EBF3 where they did and this was helpful because scanning was a pain. The scanning in this one is not so much of a chore but still annoying you need to rescan everything when you start a new game.", "timestamp_created": 1480633707, "timestamp_updated": 1480765186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678482", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28124261": {"recommendationid": "28124261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078217857", "num_games_owned": 127, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1692, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480835770}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo muito bom pra quem gosta de RPG no estilo turno\n\npontos positivos:\nJogo bem humorado (com certos toques de humor negro)\nMUITOS tipos de itens\n4 personagens jog\u00e1veis\nV\u00e1rias skills\n\npontos negativos\nGr\u00e1fico parecendo que tu t\u00e1 jogando jogo da dora aventureira euohaeuoheauoehaou", "timestamp_created": 1480616837, "timestamp_updated": 1480616837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28108596": {"recommendationid": "28108596", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309698290", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1012, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494170056}, "language": "english", "review": "Please make steam overlay work.", "timestamp_created": 1480546246, "timestamp_updated": 1480546246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28080602": {"recommendationid": "28080602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026931793", "num_games_owned": 274, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 115, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1459670612}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u044f \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0443\u0447\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u0432\u043f\u0435\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u043e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0434\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438, Epic Battle Fantasy 3, \u0432\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u0437 \u043a\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c \u0444\u043b\u0435\u0448-\u0438\u0433\u0440. \u0417\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0438, \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0431\u043e\u0438, \u0448\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u043a \u0448\u0442\u0430\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043c \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0440\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b -

Each enemy has their weakness and each character is good at dealing certain types of damage or being a certain type of \"stereotype\" role.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy is a homage to your good ol' JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game) and features a keyboard usage as well as mouse usage, depending on what your preference is. The EBF series also has a lot of connections (and easter eggs!)  with Japanese stuff related, especially anime. \n\nFor those who want a simple, yet fun RPG with tons of references to anime, J-games, this game will be fun for you!\n\nThe creator is also creating on a sequel of EBF 5 and spin-off bullet hell versions.

And the variety of weapons, armor, and accessories give a ton of options to tackling enemies. Then there's the fact that they can all be upgraded to be even more useful. \n\nThe art style is simple too, but also pretty clean and nice to look at. Basically, it won't turn any heads, but this game is technically several years old from the time of Kongregate. The characters all look really nice and have a lot of charm, especially in their idle animations that love to add in a few fun references. And the characters themselves also have some fun personalities and banter. I really only wish that there was a little more development involved in it.\n\nNext up is the music, which is very fun-sounding and doesn't get tiring to listen to. And considering the soundtrack is free, its definitely worthwhile. The only real complaint I have is that the tracks themselves don't seamlessly loop like you would expect, so it's pretty obvious when they do.\n\nOne of the biggest differences from the original browser version is the addition of Battle Mountain, a side world with extra-tough battles. And grinding isn't an option since levels scale (but try to come back later with more skills). It's a nice addition that will keep you coming back for a challenge, in addition to the game's already solid level of content. \n\nThis game is overall a fun experience, that while a bit dated, can still bring some chuckles and enjoyment.

EBF4 is the latest entry in the Epic Battle Fantasy Franchise, an RPG series inspired by franchises like Final Fantasy and Pok\u00e9mon. \nIt has an unique and recognisable artstyle and a quirky sense of humor. There is some story to be enjoyed here, but unlike some other RPGs, you will be playing this for the gameplay. You will be surprised by the lenght and depth of this game. One thing to note though, is that this is in fact a flash game, which means the game does require a mid-grade computer despite the games' simplicity and the steam overlay/keeping multiple tabs open doesn't work as well as usual. \nEven so, grabbing it for either a sale or the full price is a steal in my opinion. \n\n\nPros:\n-Quirky cast with the same tone of humor\n-Decent Story\n-Unique and colorful artstyle\n-Good Game Lenght\n-No random encounters\n-The ability to save anywhere outside of battle\n-Surprisingly deep and fun gameplay, while still being very a accessible RPG\n-A small party of well balanced characters\n-Tons of videogame and other references\n-Decent game config options\n-A good amount of saves and a autosave feature\n-4 difficulties to choose from, providing a good challenge for everyone\n-Side quests and Challenging extra content to get even more stuff and replayability\n-Good character progression/equipment system (you should find this out for yourself, discovering what I'm talking about    here is part of the fun!)\n\nCons:\n-Only on pc (although there are ways to get around this, including the web version)\n-Somewhat low frame cap (although it really doesn't matter for an RPG like this. Trust me, you won't even be bothered by this unless the game lags for you.)\n-No Shift + Tab Steam Overlay or F12 Steam Screenshots\n-Responds somewhat slowly when switching tabs\n\nOther things to note:\n-Good pieces of music, although there isn't that much music in comparison to the size of the game, which means it might get a bit repetitive at times when you've played the game this much.\n-There is some puzzle solving involved, although I personally think the puzzles add to the game rather than taking away from it. These won't change according to difficulty, but you don't need to be Einstein for this stuff.\n-The humor can get a bit weird sometimes (boobjokes, for example), which you will either love or hate about this game.\n-Because of the relatively large game size, you might lose interest before finishing everything. The percentage of people who finished the main story actually isn't that high. Whether this is good or bad depends mostly on the type of gamer you are.\n-Completing the game 100% requires a lot of time and mastery of the game. A lot. This might be annoying to some, but does provide a good challenge.\n\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who is open to games with semi-serious story. You don't need to be a hardcore RPG fan to enjoy this game at all, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. It happens pretty often that the ones playing these games become dedicated fans of the series. \n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 5 is currently in development and is shaping up to become even better. Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is also available for free on Steam if you want to get a good taste of the series first. Be sure to check those out if you're interested.\n\nI can't praise this game enough for what it is.

You mix up your skills and equipment to have the correct element to hurt them while trying to have defense that is resitant to the element they are attacking with.

It's a fun little Flash RPG, with silly humor and goofy battles, but with incredibly solid mechanics. The battles are fun and satisfying, and can also be pretty challenging on max difficulty. The only issues I feel are worth mentioning are the following two: the character balancing, and the graphics. It's not that the graphics are bad, I rather like the art style. But when you try to play on fullscreen, it lags like crazy, even on higher end PC's. As for character balance, it's hard to ensure all party members remain relevant throughout the game. In my experience, it's typical for people to settle on the three they like most and just roll with them the whole game. While this isn't really a bad thing, I think it would just be more interesting for each character to be built for a certain role, and perhaps to have all 4 fighting at the same time. Regardless, this game is very well made and I loved it long before it ever won any awards (which is hasn't, shamefully!), which is why I nominated it.

If not one of the best Turn-based RPGs of all time. Speaking as someone who has never played a traditional turn-based RPG prior to finding this game on Kongregate years ago (Unless Mario RPG counts, which i don't think it does.) I can therefore say that this game is a PERFECT gateway RPG. Just enough depth in it's combat system to make vetrans feel welcome, while not alienating newcomers like alot of other RPGS do (Xenoblade and Final Fantasy X come to mind)\n\nThe gameplay (once it gets rolling) consists of 3 party members (with 1 in backup).\n\n Anna is the support class with her basic attacks not doing all to much damage but having alot of skills to debuff enemies or inflict them with bad statuses.\n\nMatt is the physical attacker, with alot of non-elemental high power skills.\n\nNatillie is the Magic user / Healer with most of her power revolving around her ability to deal elemental damage or heal/revive part memebers.\n\nLance is the glass canon with not much defence or HP, but with a ton of enemy devestating moves.\n\n\nWhen you complete battles, you gain EXP and money (In this case, Choclate Coins) like other RPGs. You also gain AP which can be used to level up or learn new Skills or Specials\n\nThe difference between Skills and Specials is that Skills are character specific, whereas Specials consist of a pool that multiple characters can learn from. Each special can only be learnt by one party member. This makes for some intresting strategic opertunities as alot of arts are here. \n\nThis game also has Limit Breaks, which to be honest, are not that much different than in Final Fantasy 7. But for those of you unfamilliar, Limit Breaks are powerful attacks that can only be used once a character has taken enough damage. What's different here, however, is that limit breaks can be saved for later use as the attack command is still there, where as to do so in Final Fantasy 7, you would need to keep using Magic instead of attacking.\n\nThe equipment system in this game is in my opinion the best type of equipment system in any RPG. No 2 pieces of equipment are exactly the same, nor are there any that are inherently better than other pieces. They all have their own use with their own stats and resistances. I cannot think of any other RPG where i was never like \"Oh, this sword does more damage than that sword with no downsides. Better sell my old sword for this upgraded one\"\n\nThe music is annother shining point of this game. Phyrnna did an amazing job. Explaining it can't do it justice, so i suggest you listen to it for yourself.\n\nOverall, 10/10. If you are looking for annother good RPG that isn't too confusing to get into, look no furher than Epic Battle Fantasy 4.", "timestamp_created": 1479936840, "timestamp_updated": 1479936868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26866657": {"recommendationid": "26866657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034213886", "num_games_owned": 4314, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 213, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405636784}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun little Battle Adventure game.", "timestamp_created": 1479933466, "timestamp_updated": 1479933466, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529221", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26860617": {"recommendationid": "26860617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104207935", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487661028}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR:\n - game is a bit intensive on low-end computers\n + Lots of content (Summons, equipment, skills, etc.)\n + Tons of achievements (Just click Natalie's boobs and then leave that in your review)\n + 4 different difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard, Epic)\n + 4 unique characters\n + Free OST with the game\n + So much more\n\nI've been waiting some time time to do a review of this game, considering I still haven't completed it, but I can say I love the thought and content this game provides, as it is far more in-depth than its predecessor, Epic Battle Fantasy 3 (EBF3). This game brings forth so many more mechanics than EBF3, and I just love it to death. Some mechanics were even changed for more balance, which I am happy that ups the challenge, while also making it more fair (no more half health poison damage due to the poison stacking enemies could do).\n\nOnly downside is that the game is a bit intensive. Lower end computers might want to at least chanmge the graphics to medium (still might lose some frames).\n\nWith about 10 status ailments, a ton of summons and skills, tons of equipment, a vast amont of achievments, silly dialogue, a decent story, with all of this topped off with a fourth party member, I have come to truly love this game in the EBF series. I do highly recommend this if you enjoy a nice challenging RPG (especially in the major bonus area). Not to mention, you get a really good OST for free if you get the game so that's pretty nice. I also highly recommend just keeping an eye on the dev (Yeah. One guy made just about everything aside from the OST) as he is already working on EBF5 if I remember correctly. Check out his website: http://kupogames.com/\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading my review. I apologize if this review seemed to just go everywhere, but I really did try to express the joy I got from playing the game. I hope that I was able to express that joy into those reading this. To further express my joy for this game, I will state that I would even do an LP/Walkthrough? Some day when I get my PC back, I plan on LPing the game just because this series has given me comfort and maybe even a reason to live. Rambling aside, I hope you guys enjoy this game.\n\nP.S.

I'm 9 hours off to have 100 hours in total put into this game,almost beating the game a second time and now,at Temple of Godcat. Let's do this.\nSo let's get straight to the point,to me,and probably to the whole community the selling point was the humor and the artstyle. I also really like the voice in the trailer. Since i was younger,I was playing this game,even tough I was just clicking random stuff. But now that I actually UNDERSTAND how this game works,it's super fun! The vast choices of your spells,to figuring out wich one does the most damage. To scanning new foes,great bosses and so on. But the DLC actually gives you WAAAAY more playtime! (About 15 hours plus). And I love it! Now let's take a look at the Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n-Humor\n-Artstyle (Who dosen't love anime?)\n-The battle system and all the spells you can hit your foes with\n-The way encountering foes works,you don't have to get that chest or battle that random foe,just pass 'em like they aren't there!\n-You don't have to grind,you can but the foes level with you so it dosen't really matter.\n-The bosses are great,but the remakes on Battle Mountain are amazing!\n-The way Kupo interacts and let's their fans make some foes,and sometimes even bosses!\n-The creativity and time Kupo puts into this.\n-The songs! They're so great! And the soundtrack is free,how generous of him!\n-His games are still going strong,especially this one!\n-A fifth game is coming out! How exciting!\n\nAnd now,let's take a look at the Cons.\n\nCons:\n-He deserves just a little bit more attention.\n-The bosses take a little bit longer then they should.\n-The walking system is kinda bad. But there are Slime Cats to teleport you around,so it's not that much of a problem.\n\n\nI hope this review helped you choose if you should buy this game,and the community says hell yeah!

I've completed every single one - and most, more than once.\n\nWith all that said, allow me to attempt to explain why this game is good:\n-Elemental attacks\\resists system is very intuitive. Very much an old-school JRPG system.\n-Multiple difficulty levels, with the easiest one being 50% enemy stats and various attacks weakened to allow the weakest players a chance to progress anyway. Meanwhile, the most difficult setting gives enemies 200% stats and allows them to use their nastiest attacks, making for a real challenge.\n-Can be played for free on Kongregate for a try, if you're uncertain. The paid version not only supports the author but also includes a miniboss and boss marathon, as well as some new bosses to challenge players.\n-Everything in this game is beautifully drawn and totally adorable in every way; from the legless cats to the slimes to the shrubs and even the characters.\n-Jokes are well spaced out, and the game doesn't break the fourth wall too often to devalue it.\n-Multiple skills and abilities allow for varied strategies.\n-Good clock-time, with new game plus and new game plus plus to extend it even further for those hungry for more.\n\nNow, the cons - for almost every game has some. They are nit-picks, though:\n-The game has permanent stat boosting items, and while you have four characters only three are active at a time. This means that the most effective strategy is to dump all the stat boosts on three characters and leave the fourth as backup permanently.\n-Eventually your strategy will devolve into buffing your party, debuffing the enemy party and using one big all-target skill or spell for an attempted instant kill. You will be using different skills for different elemental types, though.\n-The higher difficulties don't offer increased experience\\item\\skill point rewards, despite taking at least four times as long (enemies have 200% health on hardest, to the 50% on easiest). This means most players will usually fight trash mobs on easiest and only fight the bosses on the hardest. Even that, only once, for the achievements.\n-The game has some of the \"but I might need it later\" with one of it's consumables (chilli bottle, which refills the limit break bar of a character).\n-The huge variety in gear does lend to some very slight inventory management, mostly just before bosses.\n\nI absolutely love this game. 9/10.\n-Sleepy", "timestamp_created": 1471816712, "timestamp_updated": 1471816712, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25055654": {"recommendationid": "25055654", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120803274", "num_games_owned": 708, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471687364}, "language": "thai", "review": "\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a \u0e21\u0e38\u0e01\u0e15\u0e25\u0e01\u0e40\u0e22\u0e2d\u0e30\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e17\u0e33\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1a\u0e1a\u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e21\u0e32\u0e14\u0e35\u0e21\u0e32\u0e01 \n\u0e43\u0e04\u0e23\u0e0a\u0e2d\u0e1a\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e41\u0e19\u0e27 rpg \u0e41\u0e1a\u0e1a turn-base \u0e2a\u0e21\u0e31\u0e22\u0e01\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e04\u0e27\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e25\u0e32\u0e14\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e35\u0e49", "timestamp_created": 1471794958, "timestamp_updated": 1471794958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502075", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25025975": {"recommendationid": "25025975", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017865688", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504905767}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un juego divertido, simple y con muchas horas de diversi\u00f3n por delante.\nJugu\u00e9 cuando estaba en la p\u00e1gina de kongregate y le tir\u00e9 unas cuantas horitas, en mi opini\u00f3n es una muy buena continuaci\u00f3n de su predecesora EBF3.", "timestamp_created": 1471668732, "timestamp_updated": 1471668732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25002650": {"recommendationid": "25002650", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097191854", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 1184, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473003727}, "language": "english", "review": "better than league of legends", "timestamp_created": 1471565403, "timestamp_updated": 1471565403, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.635208", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24990998": {"recommendationid": "24990998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021111894", "num_games_owned": 412, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438555014}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Esse game \u00e9 EPICO!

It's a basic RPG in the old school turn-based style, but a well-crafted one and full of charm. Great entry point for those inexperienced in turn-based JRPGs and curious to try them out, because of it's simplicity: Everything about the game is easy to grasp and satisfying to master. The combat and customization will never get you lost and yet decisions are not entirely brainless, the exploration is rewarding and backtracking never feels like a chore, the level and grinding curve is done just right. Seasoned veterans of the RPG genre may find it too basic, and they'd be right, but even them can find something to love about this game.", "timestamp_created": 1470333246, "timestamp_updated": 1470333246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24704729": {"recommendationid": "24704729", "author": {"steamid": "76561198165886604", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7777, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513453907}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're into RPGs that don't take themselves seriously, or if you're into pastiches of anything and everything, then this game is for you.\n\nIt plays really well. Only downside is that, as many people have complained to Matt Roszak before, you spend most of the game with a set of three characters, and leave the reserve one in the dust. Once you have a good enough skillset between three characters, there is no motivation to switching partners unless that partner's ability is ABSOLUTELY NEEDED for a particular battle.\n\nThe visuals look cute, I guess. I don't know if the cutesy style goes well with some dark bosses later on, but for the most part, it works. True to Roszak's style, the machines and mechanisms in this game are so well-designed. It's generally pleasing to the eye. The animations are fluid, and the Limits look really awesome. Also, given the certain types of characters that appear in the game, and certain types of armour and equipment you get in the game, I can presume that Roszak has at least done some research into them. So, good on that front.\n\nThe writing is class. There is no punny humour, but it still leaves you laughing mad. That's the kind of humour I thoroughly enjoy. I highly recommend players to not skip the dialogues because just reading them shows the amount of thought put into these jokes. Then of course, there are the occasional pop-culture references, so any future reviewer might say that this game is a product of its time, and a sort of mirror to what's going on at the time. There are certain things that aren't recommended for younger audiences, like panty stealing and the Pervert medal, so you'd have to be at a certain age level to be able to understand them -- but when you are, it really comes through brilliantly.\n\nThe other language I play this game in (out of curiosity, of course, and because I speak it as my second language) is French -- and the jokes by-and-large translate well, though there are a few lines that sadly, do not get translated well, or even at all. For instance, there's that one laser that's gonna SHOOP DA WHOOP if you're not careful. That line is put in, verbatim, in its English form, in the French translation of the game. And if a French-speaker doesn't understand what 'shoop da whoop' means, it's gonna be lost in translation. There are some parts where punctuation is missing. It's little bits like these that niggle at the player, and make all the difference between a well-translated game and a poorly-translated game. It's not \"poor\" by any stretch, but could use some work. And in the case where a direct French translation can't be found, a Bowdlerism might come in handy here.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice game. For someone who started out indie, this game has done well and managed to relate to any and all corners of society in some way, shape or form, and rightly so. If you're into RPGs, do try this out. If you're into parodies and pastiches, absolutely try this out. And if you're just browsing Steam looking for a game to try out, perhaps give this one a shot.", "timestamp_created": 1470302223, "timestamp_updated": 1470302223, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655383", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24650286": {"recommendationid": "24650286", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085468078", "num_games_owned": 396, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1019, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505002782}, "language": "french", "review": "Une s\u00e9rie que j'ai toujours appr\u00e9ci\u00e9, d'abord sur internet, en flash, et maintenant sur steam <3\n\nUn RPG au tour par tour, rempli de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences diverses qui me rappellent tellement de souvenirs...

The animation, for me at the time, was pretty dang good and he gained a fan from that moment on. I've played every other game that came out since then, other than the Bullet Heaven ones, and I loved all of them.\n\nIf you ever get to read this, Matt, I gotta say thanks for entertaining me for all these years. Hopefully, EBF5 will blow EBF4 right out the water.\n\n\nTl;dr - I'm a fanboy and this review may be a little biased. Also, this is my first ever review.\n\nNOW ON TO THE REVIEW!\n\n\nREVIEW:\nThis game was originally a flash game that was (and still is) free to play on sites such as Kongregate and Newgrounds. The only real differences between the free version and the Steam one/Kongregate's premium one are the additional weapons, armors, and badges and Battle Mountain. This is a little underwhelming for something worth $12 dollars, I have to admit.\n\nIf you've played any traditional JRPG games before, that's pretty much what this game plays like. This may be a turn-off for some, but for fans and newcomers to the genre, I think you'll be in for a treat.\n\nThe characters are all unique and interesting in their own way - even the NPCs, while not really memorable, have some choice bits of dialogue. As for the dialogue and text in the game, it's very humorous with loads of little nods and jabs to all things video games.\n\nThe plot is pretty linear, so NG+ is really only for maxing out whatever skill you didn't learn and trying out some new tactics.\n\n...That's all I can think of at the moment while typing this up so...\n\nOverall, 8.5/10 - needs more boobs", "timestamp_created": 1469409448, "timestamp_updated": 1469409448, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500132", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24489514": {"recommendationid": "24489514", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097430650", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470193470}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "jogo simples de turno porem muito divertido , cheio de skills e possibilidades", "timestamp_created": 1469318915, "timestamp_updated": 1469318915, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24465164": {"recommendationid": "24465164", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985038091", "num_games_owned": 151, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2038, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469291305}, "language": "japanese", "review": "\u6700\u521d\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8a33\u306e\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u898b\u306a\u304c\u3089\u5e73\u884c\u3067\u9032\u3081\u3066\u3044\u305f\u304c\u3001\n\u9014\u4e2d\u304b\u3089\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u3088\u308a\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u305d\u306e\u3082\u306e\u306e\u9762\u767d\u3055\u306b\u60f9\u304b\u308c\u3066\n\u52d5\u753b\u3092\u898b\u308b\u306e\u3092\u3084\u3081\u3066\u4e00\u6c17\u306b\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u7fd2\u5f97\u3084\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u3001\u6b66\u5668\u5f37\u5316\u3068\u3044\u3046\nRPG\u3092\u697d\u3057\u3080\u306e\u306b\u5fc5\u9808\u306a\u30b7\u30b9\u30c6\u30e0\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3001\n\u53ec\u559a\u3084\u30ea\u30df\u30c3\u30c8\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30af\u3001\u88c5\u5099\u54c1\u306e\u52b9\u679c\u306e\u8ffd\u52a0\u653b\u6483\u306a\u3069\n\u591a\u5f69\u306a\u653b\u6483\u624b\u6bb5\u3067\u6700\u5f8c\u307e\u3067\u6226\u95d8\u3092\u5168\u304f\u98fd\u304d\u3055\u305b\u306a\u3044\u306e\u306f\u3068\u3066\u3082\u3088\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\n\u307e\u305f\u3001\u88c5\u5099\u54c1\u4e00\u3064\u4e00\u3064\u306b\u30e6\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30c3\u30af\u3092\u6301\u305f\u305b\u3066\u3001\n\u30d3\u30b8\u30e5\u30a2\u30eb\u3092\u5909\u3048\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u308b\u306e\u306f\u5f53\u305f\u308a\u524d\u306e\u3088\u3046\u306b\u898b\u3048\u3066\n\u4ed6\u306eRPG\u3067\u3082\u306a\u304b\u306a\u304b\u304a\u76ee\u306b\u304b\u304b\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u3067\u304d\u306a\u3044\u3053\u3060\u308f\u308a\u3002\n\u5473\u65b9\u3060\u3051\u3067\u306a\u304f\u6575\u3082\u7d30\u304b\u304f\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\u3059\u308b\u306e\u3082\u3044\u3044\u3002\n\u30af\u30ea\u30a2\u3057\u3066\u4e00\u6bb5\u843d\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u3001\u30a8\u30ad\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u3092\n\u6700\u5f8c\u307e\u3067\u653b\u7565\u3057\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u306e\u3067\u3001\u307e\u305f\u3044\u3064\u304b\u3084\u308a\u76f4\u3057\u305f\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1469215250, "timestamp_updated": 1469215250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24441307": {"recommendationid": "24441307", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220039896", "num_games_owned": 277, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 812, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504604013}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u628aMatt\u5f53\u6210\u59b9\u5b50\u73a9\u4e86\u534a\u5929\u2026\u2026", "timestamp_created": 1469105136, "timestamp_updated": 1469105136, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24414044": {"recommendationid": "24414044", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162413831", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502084633}, "language": "english", "review": "Sadly this game is too choppy to play.

It is a remake of a flash game that was later greenlit. This game makes you think more than most current and past gen rpgs. Buffs and debuffs matter a lot in this series.

I've been playing this game with very little previous knowledge of the series and I've been loving it to pieces. EBF4 is a lovechild/parody of games like FInal Fantasy and other turn-based RPG's. So right off the bat, if you like those games then you will most likely love EBF4. Not a fan of JRPG's like I am? Then continue reading as this review will be based on that mentality.\n\nSo first thing you may ask is \"What if I'm not great at RPG's?\" No worries, EBF4 has multiple difficulty settings so you can either worry about resistances and stats or just use the flashiest move you have. So what is so different about this game that I shoud considering it worth my money? Well the game is not serious, like at all. The game is part parody after all so the game is very funny and makes a ton of jokes at RPG's and gaming overall. The 4 charecter's are all really interesting and have a ton of good lines. Other than that, there is the previously mentioned simple but intuitive RPG combat mechanics. Most of your attacks are in the form of spells and trust me when I say there are plenty of spells to customize your movesets out. The game is very straight foward too, NPC quests is are short and sweet and there are only two optional areas to visit. Yet despite the linar design, there is a ton of replay value. The main story is about 8-12 hours but you can play through the game multiple times with harder foes and do other stuff like collect all of the medals and weapons. To tie all of the game together there is simplistic but charming art style and one of the best soundtracks to a game ever, I'm not even kidding when I say that last part.\n\nSo overall, would I recommend this game to newbies of the RPG category, maybe. Would I recommend this to long-term RPG fans, definetely. Would I recommend this to those who just want to play a silly and fun idie RPG to enjoy,  yes. The game is cheap and I guarentee you'll like it.", "timestamp_created": 1468121194, "timestamp_updated": 1468121194, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.648069", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24200378": {"recommendationid": "24200378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198211524284", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468081569}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0411\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e \u044d\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u044f! \u042f\u0440\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0437\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435, \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0436\u0443\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 (\u0441 \u0432\u0435\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432, \u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u044d\u043a\u0438\u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443\u044e \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0445\u043e\u0442\u044f \u0431\u044b \u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043c, \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431 \u0443\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043e\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0445 ;) ).\n\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u0440\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0430\u0445, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0441\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0442.\n\u0413\u0443\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u044b\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044e\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043c; \u043f\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044b\u043c \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u044b\u043c, \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0440\u0438-\u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441 \"\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0439\".\n\u041e\u0442\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044b \u0437\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430. \u043d\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u044f, \u043d\u043e \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u044f. \u0418 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u043e, \u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435 \u044d\u043f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u044f \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1468047154, "timestamp_updated": 1468047154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24185715": {"recommendationid": "24185715", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075836667", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10168, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469360948}, "language": "english", "review": "The Epic Battle Fantasy series started out as just a bunch of flash game you could play on Newgrounds and Kongregate back in the day (and you still can). For the longest time, they had stayed in the top rated flash games for both of those sites, and for good reason. This series is pretty obviously inspired by them, and if you're a fan of turn based strategic combat in RPGs similar to old school Final Fantasy, you'll love this game.\nIf you're on the fence on whether or not you want to buy this, you can simply go on Kongregate or Newgrounds right now and play the free version. Now you may be wondering, \"If I can play this game for free, why should I buy the Steam version?\" Well other than supporting a series made by a developer who does [i]both[/i] the coding and the artwork, with a quality soundtrack by Phyrrna (aka HalcyonicFalconX) that comes for free upon purchasing it, the Steam version comes with additional content, including a new area with tougher challenges that yields extra equipment to help you out on your main journey, not to mention being able to keep your save files on the Steam cloud. I also recommend Epic Battle Fantasy 3, which is now on Steam, and is completely free.\nNow this game does have some intermittent performance issues when it comes to frame rate, but you can toggle the quality to deal with it, and other than that, I believe this is well worth the money. I usually wait for games to be on sale, but I bought this game as soon as it was available on Steam, and I don't regret it one bit. \nThe dev is currently working on EBF5, and I eagerly wait the next

I'm 17 hours in and still haven't beat it so there's definetely quite a bit of content here. The enemies all look different, yet are distinct to their element. The art all and all is very good, with limit breaks giving you these fun crazy destructive attacks. There is a bit of grinding and the combat is turn based, so if you don't like turn based combat this game isn't for you. The grind is pretty minimal and throughout the story are the fairly generic characters making funny remarks and conversation to keep you interested, but there isn't any award winning plot here, as the game doesn't take itself seriuosly, but that gives it creative freedom for some funny moments to keep it more fun than serious. \n               So overall this game is 8/10 which for 10 bucks is pretty good. It probably wont last more than 20 hours for most people though because I'm basically at the end, but overall I enjoyed it and I think it's pretty good. You can try the game out in the browser if you'd like to see if you enjoy it first, but the steam version has WAY more content and is definetely worth it if you like games from KupoGames. If this game is on sale for less than 5 bucks like it is at the time of the review, I'd say definetely get it if you're into this genre.", "timestamp_created": 1467700909, "timestamp_updated": 1479931600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.997501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24099768": {"recommendationid": "24099768", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069311958", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 555, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468472361}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7f51\u9875\u7248\u73a9\u4e86\u4e24\u6b21\u90fd\u662f\u4e2d\u9014\u4e22\u4e86\u5b58\u6863\uff0c\u8d81\u6253\u6298\u4e70\u4e2aSTEAM\u7248\u6765\u73a9\n\u8001\u5b9e\u8bf4\u548c\u5bb6\u7528\u673a\u7684RPG\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fd8\u6709\u4e0d\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u638c\u673aRPG\u6beb\u4e0d\u900a\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u8981\u89c9\u5f97\u662f\u4e2a\u7f51\u9875\u6e38\u620f\u79fb\u690d\u5c31\u5c0f\u770b\n\u540c\u65f6STEAM\u7248\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u65b0BOSS\u65b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b0\u88c5\u5907\u7b49\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u8981\u73a9\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u73a9STEAM\u7248\u4e86", "timestamp_created": 1467689060, "timestamp_updated": 1467689060, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24089089": {"recommendationid": "24089089", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201425789", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1455417126}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "I really really really love this game!!That was my first game of the series.

But perhaps I'm not part of the intended audience; I just can't imagine anyone over the age of 12 finding the humor or story compelling.", "timestamp_created": 1466823984, "timestamp_updated": 1466823984, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.381164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23775825": {"recommendationid": "23775825", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035430610", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493374155}, "language": "english", "review": "EBF4 is a wonderful little game available for free on browser.  While there is extra content, it's probably not worth the price of EBF4 on steam by itself.  I'd recommend trying out the game for free on Kongregate first.  Personally, I purchased the game on steam more to support the developer than for the extra content and have not regretted my decision.  The purchase convinced me to go through another playthrough which was very enjoyable and took a good 10 hours to run through.\n\nThat being said, the game has little immediate replayability after completing the campaign the first time around.  It's very possible to get through all of the content in one playthrough, and the story is very linear.  The mechanics and general gameplay are very fun for sure, but there is little to no incentive to come back and play again.\n\nOverall, 8/10.  Fun gameplay, great graphics, but little replayability.\n\nLooking forward to EBF5", "timestamp_created": 1466818893, "timestamp_updated": 1466818893, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.603153", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23771419": {"recommendationid": "23771419", "author": {"steamid": "76561198113683383", "num_games_owned": 265, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467048548}, "language": "english", "review": "Would like to know who are the 30 retards that put negatives reviews on this game.", "timestamp_created": 1466806936, "timestamp_updated": 1466806936, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.453733", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23756210": {"recommendationid": "23756210", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048792789", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 1234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514512235}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game!

Take right now for example, you're probably not just reading this review. If I had to guess, you're also eating lunch, catching up on your netflix backlog, listening to music, and browsing your favorite p... nevermind. Some jokes are just too easy to make, and that's no fun. \n\nThe point is, we're living in a time where all of our eyes, ears, and limbs have to be used at their maximum efficiency. On its own, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is a solid little RPG. While its threadbare plot and meme-filled writing won't win any awards; there is a certain [i]je ne sais quoi[/i] about the adventure. This might be attributed to the fact that boss-monsters tend to guard items that assist in exploration. The first boss guards an axe, which can be used to cut down all of the trees you might have passed by earlier. This is a linear game, but there's always an incentive to go back and collect treasure you couldn't reach before.\n\nEBF4 employs a lot of ideas specifically designed to keep gamers playing as long as possible. Alongside traditional avenues such as gaining experience, you also strengthen party-members by collecting materials and upgrading their equipment. Practically every weapon and armor has an element tied to it, and if you're playing on the hardest difficulty, you'll want to take full advantage of elemental strengths and weaknesses. To really get the advantage, you'll want to explore and obtain all of the rare stat-boosting foods as well. Since this RPG offers New Game+, which begins directly after the defeat of the final boss, you may find yourself caught in the cycle. This all-too familiar hamster wheel promises opportunities to make your party-members even stronger, and see those lovely stats & numbers get really, really high.\n\nUnless you're playing on the harder difficulties, EBF4 works quite well as a \"second-window\" game. While you're playing this decent little RPG, you can watch some videos, read a book, or do whatever else. There are a few charming cut-scenes over the course of this game that will draw your attention and remind you of what's currently going on. Otherwise your mind is free to wander onto other topics as you lead the heroes through the motions: Kill monsters, collect treasure, upgrade loot, etc. \n\nOne thing I have to nitpick about is how enemy waves are handled. Most battles tend to involve multiple parties of monsters. When you destroy the first set, another set will take its place. This is all well and good, but I have a complaint. If the last enemy in one wave is killed with a counter-attack, the next wave that appears will get a free turn. I figure that this is because it's still considered the \"enemy's turn\", but it's pretty annoying when it happens. Some of the references and dialogue are also dated and uber-cringe, but it's not that big of a deal. I mean, some of the lines are just plain dumb, but I've already forgotten most of them.

Either you're 100% behind the idea of leading a plucky group of adventurers in the pursuit of higher numbers, or you just want something to busy yourself while watching four twitch.tv streams at once.

YES.\nWorth your money? Yes. definately!\n\nIn this game, you control Anna, a ranger whom ends up tracking down the team of Epic Battle fantasy 3 on the accusation of them having stolen the gem of her village. You end up going on an epic adventure with them, going through adorable settings all over. The game is beautful with hand drawn settings that have tons of love in them, making every single area feel likable, even if it's not your favorite!\n\nYou'll be playing with a total of 4 characters, having 1 of them on backup in case your main team falls, and for me that meant that the person on back-up often ended up being forgotten in regards to stat boosting items and equipment upgrades, but that's how i like to play the game. The person in back-up gets XP just like everyone else in battle, as long as they are alive at the end of the battle. Switching someone out with the back-up is smooth and seamless at the single press of the button, and if you regret it you can always switch right back. The battles move at your own pace, as the enemies cannot take their turn until you are done with yours, making the game move however you want it, wether you wanna go fast and spam your strongest move or if you carefully want to plan out the next upcoming turns.\n\nThe game thrives on it's exploration, the humor and hidden references (which unfortunately had to be partially censored at least by name in order to avoid legal issues as far as i'm aware), but most importantly the music. Oh man, the music is great! It's often high tempo, but it calms down when it needs to, and it does a fantastic job att setting the mood for the current situation, which is really the only thing you'd truly want out of music for an RPG game.\nThe game also features a bit of puzzle solving and NPC quests (most of which are fetching quests where you give them crafting items of different kinds) but if that's not your slice of cake, it's not a problem because the quests are entirely optional as far as i know, and the puzzle solving, while mandatory in some parts, is never so difficult that you feel like you want to take a break because the puzzle is just difficult.\n\nNow, there is a free to play version available on the web, both on Matt's own website aswell as several different gaming websites, but there are a couple of differences. Mainly, on the premium versions on the gaming websites as well as the steam edition, you can access an area called Battle mountain, which features tons of bonus equipment, items, skills, summons and more. But most importantly, it features some very heavy challenges, ones that will have even the best of players on the edge of their seats as they lose over and over, slowly making progress towards that sweet goal, giving you a dark souls feeling of success when you finally complete the ordeal! That takes me to the difficulty of this game!\n\nOverall, this game isn't particularily hard in many ways. The puzzles aren't extremely complex for the most part, the battles shouldn't give you that much trouble, and there's plenty of oppurtunity to heal yourself in between battles (one of which is just to stand around, as you do have natural regeneration on both MP and HP), but here's the fun part.\nOn the options menu, you can instantly switch between the 4 different difficulties at any point on the world map, and since the battles are all actively triggered along with fleeing being 100% reliable, you can customize the experience according to how you like to play your games!\nIf you want to play through the game having a chill time, you could just cruise through on easy.\nIf you want to play through the game having a TOUGH time, you should play on Epic, which is when the game itself becomes so incredibly difficult at some parts that you might have to end up fleeing a battle, changing your entire equipment loadout and then trying again. However, if you feel that a battle is at any point TOO difficult for you, it's always possible to simply flee and turn the difficulty down.\n\nAs for equipment, there is a ton of variation in everything from weapons to armor and accessories.\nEvery character has their own type of weapons, and every type of weapon comes in a varied and unique form, ranging from a gun made of marble in the shape of a fist that will smite undead foes and steal health based on how much damage you do to a bow that will inflict random status ailments on each hit to a staff that is a literal incarnation of deaths' scythe, you'll find your favorite to use pretty quickly. However, even if you find the number one weapon you prefer, almost never will weapons feel obselete as enemies come in a ton of different elements and forms, and weapons almost always carry with them a special element, so ultimately, it comes down to deciding wether you want a weapon for its stats or if you want it because of the special effects it triggers. A lot of different equipment trigger special events before your turn starts, such as a random attack triggering before you get to act, or maybe a random positive buff on your character.\nThe armor is divided into two groups, one with male armor and one with female armor, since there's 2 of each in the game. This is nice as upgrading one set of armor could potentially benefit both of the specified users, however i feel this is also a slight drawback as if one armor set is used by one character, the other one has to use a different once, which can lead to trouble sometimes if you are for example looking for specific elemental resistances and you only own 1 armor piece which protects against it, as you'd then have to choose which one would be allowed to equip it.\n\nFurthermore, accessories are shared across all your characters, and they come in the form of small badges, and while the effect more often than not isn't extremely impactful, it's nice to get small additional bonuses from time to time.\n\nOverall, this game is alot of fun, any fans of RPG games or JRPGs will most likely instantly love this game, and for people that aren't into RPG's yet but are looking for somewhere to start, this would make a great candidate!\n\nRating for this game:\nVisuals: 9/10\nAudio: 10/10\nGameplay: 8/10 (my only problem is that i wish there was some other way to control the battle menu besides the mouse :C)\n\nFinal grade: 9/10\n\nIf this game is on sale, do consider buying it, as it will 100% garanteed (by me) be worth it.\nAlso, you gotta give him some credit, it's a single (not relationship wise) guy doing so much work, by both drawing everything, programming everything and man, you KNOW there's been put some blood, sweat and tears into this game! \nI love it!", "timestamp_created": 1462559219, "timestamp_updated": 1462559219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579470", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22791642": {"recommendationid": "22791642", "author": {"steamid": "76561197961652752", "num_games_owned": 286, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462357991}, "language": "english", "review": "It looks like the anime obsessed gaylins got me again with this one.

Anyway\u2026\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 is a turn-based RPG. This was not my entry into the series, I played this and its three predecessors over at Kongregate. Yes, that\u2019s right, I played this Flash game for free on Kongregate. And beat it. Several separate times. And when it came out on Steam, I bought it, and beat again. Yeah, you can play a slightly less content version of this game for free if you want. But stay with me for a little longer as we get into this recommendation.\n\nI\u2019m not going to deny the game is a little immature. I mean, \u201canime boobs\u201d is right there on the Steam page. But I will say it\u2019s not that horrible. The fan service isn\u2019t really overbearing, nor is it even all that present. A comparison would be, if you watch anime that includes fan service, then this game has less. If you think most/all anime is horrible and incredibly juvenile, then you should probably pass on this game. Just putting that out there.\n\nThe game is lighthearted and doesn\u2019t take itself seriously. NoLegs the cat has no legs (all the cats have no legs, actually), Matt is a big sword fan (in both meanings), etc.  Character dialogue (no voice acting) is humorous in a cheesy, silly way.\n\nLook, I bought this because I enjoyed the series, and wanted to support the developer. I do recommend getting this game on a sale. You want a demo? You don't want to buy it? Look it up online. Play it. You\u2019ll miss out on a little bit of extra stuff.

This is my first foray into the Epic Battle Fantasy series and have no other previous experience with other games in the franchise. \n\nGameplay is a simplistic RPG style view, with turn based combat for the fights. Controls are so simple; you literally can play the whole game with just your mouse. The game has a real \u201cPok\u00e9mon\u201d feel to it, as you explore you will find parts of the map you can\u2019t explore yet because you don\u2019t have the required skill, for instance, to cut a tree down or to smash a rock. Once you learn said skills, you can backtrack quite easily to explore and find treasure hidden in the previously locked area.   The game has well over a hundred different enemies to kill, and learn their strengths and weaknesses of.  My favourite part of the game play is easily the loot and item system.  The game boasts over 170 different items for your characters to use; you can upgrade these items through using the Forging mechanic which require you to use craft-able items to make the upgrade.   \n\nThe combat system is really well designed too; you have a party of four characters eventually, but you can only use three in a battle, the fourth acts as a backup in case one of your others dies. The Pok\u00e9mon element theme is a key mechanic too; making sure you use the correct weapon with the right effect on the enemy is an almost absolute must most of the time.  Characters can also learn \u201ccompanions\u201d which acts as like \u201cultimate\u201d attacks, and any of your characters can use them rather than having them bound to one of your party \u2013 the best and most fun by a country mile has to be the Super Nova, which just obliterates the entire screen. \n\nVisually, EBF4 is again, simple, but that comes across very pleasantly. The in game art style looks colourful and vibrant, and has a very 3DS look to it. The narration parts of the game are done in a beautifully, almost hand drawn style of art, as if they have just been pulled out of a children\u2019s book. I was enchanted by the visuals straight away as soon as I saw this. There is little animation in the game, given the 2D aspect, but the small amount of animation in the game is done really well, no odd movement cycles or strange looking attacks. There isn\u2019t any voice acting; however there aren\u2019t walls and walls of text to read through, so that can be forgiven. \n\nEBF4\u2019s difficulty levels can be changed on the fly, and you are almost encouraged to play on the highest difficulty until you start hitting a brick wall. I played the game on a normal difficulty and still felt sufficiently challenged by the fights. You can ramp up the difficulty to epic mode for those wanting to get extra achievements though. Once you complete the game you have the option for New Game+. Not to mention the Fire Mountain area of the game. This area scales with your characters level, allowing you to take on unique beasty bosses for extra special loot. This for me again, reminded me of the Pok\u00e9mon games and the Elite Four trainers. \n\nThe world, in which you play in, is full of extra little bits to do, with roughly 20 side quests to complete, which offer no real variety but still add a bit more game play. The quests are only collection quests, so don\u2019t expect to be getting really in depth quest lines like other RPGs. The quests will reward you with stat increasing items, or more equipment to make use of. There are also a number of NPCs scattered around the world that whilst they offer no game play advantage, they do have a bit of lore behind them though. \n\nEBF4 took me just under 20 hours to complete. I went into this game expecting it to be over in five hours. I am absolutely amazed at how much content and how long this game actually is. What really does this game the most credit is, I wasn\u2019t bored once whilst playing, and I wasn\u2019t waiting for the end of the game to roll around as I was having that much fun playing. There may not be a massive amount of replay ability given the linearity of the storyline, but the New Game+ mode will definitely cater for any people that are fans of the game play.  \n\nTechnically, the game runs in a much smaller resolution, whilst you can play full screen, it is a scaled up version. For some reason, I almost had a lot of stuttering during some moments in the game. This was fixed by reloading the game, but I couldn\u2019t quite work out what was causing it. Obviously the game isn\u2019t very taxing to run, given the 2D graphics, but still, I was dropping frames every now and again.  The game cannot be played using a controller without the use of third party software, but I would recommend people play this game with their mouse. \n\nTo sum up, I am absolutely amazed at the quality of this game. It is easily one of my favourite RPG experiences I have ever had. I remarked quite a bit in this review about the resemblances between EBF4 and Pok\u00e9mon, and that comparison really does this game justice. It is an absolute masterpiece of a game that looks so simple on the outside, but is beautifully and carefully developed on the inside. The game is so perfectly priced at \u00a38, 99 too, with hours of content and high quality content at that! \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n[b][u]6) This is a must play[/u][/b]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

The character designs aren't exactly good... Okay, since these are both one-man projects, I'll at least say that it looks much better than Undertale.

This is nothing like a RPG Maker game, it seems to use its very own engine (which, amusingly, is quite slow even on a high-end PC... Thankfully it's still playable). This has a lot of advantages.\nIt pays respects to its elders but never tries to be lazy about anything. My main complaint? It's a very difficult game... If you want to 100% it, you'll suffer. A lot. Be prepared to spend tens of hours on it. I'll just be happy with at least two thirds of the achievements. If you don't mind not getting everything, then... I get it's doable.

All in all if you truly enjoy the genre and/or series then I highly recommend this game! :3", "timestamp_created": 1455002203, "timestamp_updated": 1455002203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488087", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21058296": {"recommendationid": "21058296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198128236894", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6751, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499643926}, "language": "italian", "review": "My first buy, it's sooo awesome, I already completed the free version on kongregate, happy to start again", "timestamp_created": 1454956710, "timestamp_updated": 1454956710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21053267": {"recommendationid": "21053267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024226955", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497920154}, "language": "english", "review": "EBF4 is a great game.

I wanted something easy to play and comedic. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 was my pick.\n\nThis game concept is very interesting. It borrows a lot from the classical JRPGs of the old days, but it also adds its own flavor to the mix. The graphics are unique and are based on Flash animations, similar to lots of web games, which I loved.\nThe dialogue, and the battle system, is filled with humor, dark humor, internet humor, memes, references to classical JRPGs, etc.\nThis game was designed for internet-savvy audience to enjoy it. There is a lot to love about this game.\n\nI never played the previous games in this series, however, I can not wait to see what is next. I am striving to have a 100% achievement score on this one. This feeling is similar to when I used to play Pokemon, and gotta catch'em all vibe, it was tedious to do yet fun and we wanted to do it. EBF4 is definitely in that category of games. Players will not only enjoy its humor and battle system, but also will enjoy being completionists.\n\nI recommend this game to any RPG, JRPG, humor, internet, and anime fans. All of you will enjoy it.\n\nP.S.\nThe \"Pervert\" achievement was the best!", "timestamp_created": 1454686043, "timestamp_updated": 1454686043, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0,

Ap\u00f3s tanto tempo a sua quarta vers\u00e3o foi lan\u00e7ada no Steam mantendo o mesmo aspecto, por\u00e9m enquadrando a linhagem dos games casuais.\n\nDesenvolvido por Matt Roszak o game possui o mesmo estilo de seus antecessores, por\u00e9m bem mais completo. No jogo voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 trabalhar com quatro personagens cada um com habilidades e golpes diferentes no qual devem lutar e viajar pelo mundo para recuperar um artefato perdido que \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel pela vida de uma floresta.\n\nA explora\u00e7\u00e3o do game acontece em meio a cliques no mapa que \u00e9 todo em 2D, por\u00e9m ambientado em diversos locais distintos, al\u00e9m da varia\u00e7\u00e3o do ambiente os inimigos tamb\u00e9m mudam conforme o local criando assim uma fauna espec\u00edfica do game. O jogo faz a todo o momento refer\u00eancias a diversos outros jogos principalmente satirizando o estilo RPG. As mec\u00e2nicas de RPG incrementadas ao jogo s\u00e3o bem simples e consiste apenas em equipar o melhor item e saber qual a melhor habilidade usar em um combate.\n\nO combate do game acontece em turnos e durante essa luta existe ataque simples e sistema de vantagem sobre elementos, esse sistema \u00e9 muito presente nos RPG\u2019s, principalmente na s\u00e9rie Pok\u00e9mon onde \u00e1gua ganha de fogo, fogo de gelo e assim por diante. Isso tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 presente no game, por\u00e9m o pr\u00f3prio jogo te d\u00e1 isso de forma simples e f\u00e1cil, tornando o game muito simples mais uma boa iniciativa para crian\u00e7as que querem come\u00e7ar a jogar um RPG.\n\nO bom game cai para os jogadores mais acostumados justamente por ser muito simples e f\u00e1cil. Como \u00e9 um game casual n\u00e3o possui erros graves em sua programa\u00e7\u00e3o, por\u00e9m algumas coisas podem ser levadas em conta como o fato do jogador n\u00e3o poder jogar ele em tela inteira e poder apenas batalhar com tr\u00eas personagens por vez sendo que um sempre fica de reserva. Essa limita\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o faz sentido j\u00e1 que o game \u00e9 bem f\u00e1cil voc\u00ea sempre se esquece de trocar o personagem para faz\u00ea-lo subir level tamb\u00e9m.

You have no idea do you?\n\n\nThings to know:\n- Most males will worship Nat, they will give all the buffs to her.\n- Grind before obvious bosses.\n- Go for normal skills over maxed out elemental skills.\n- Save often.\n\n\nGive it a go; combat wise it's better than Final Fantasy 13.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1452091661, "timestamp_updated": 1452091661, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "20332325": {"recommendationid": "20332325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026400403", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 2273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456077188}, "language": "english", "review": "Beautifully funny.

I'm surprised by just how much I enjoyed this.\nThe skills are cool, and some are amusing (Like dropping a tank on top of your enemies), and I was playing simply to unlock more skills to see what they were like.\n\nThere isn't a lot of dialogue, and most of it's just random comments from the characters when you use new attacks are find something new, etc. Although not really bad in a game like this, it'd be better if there was more story to it, no matter how much seriousness said story lacks.\n\nIt's not all that difficult if you play on normal, most enemies are some kind of creature crossed with an element, and so have weaknesses, you get a scan bot that lets you see said weaknesses so honestly as long as you don't forget to keep your weapons and skills diverse you're going to be fine. Each area generally has a focus on one or two elements, so you can focus on those with your weapons as well.\n\nThe shop so far has been pretty pointless. I've not completed it yet, but I've literally only bought a few coffees from it before a boss, you don't really use items enough to use up the ones you find, and the weapons you find are generally good as well. Getting materials for crafting is simply a case of grinding as well.\n\nBetter quests would be good, it seems all the npc's just want food, even just a \"kill n monsters\" or something would keep it more interesting.

What followed was a shockingly good experience that I really didn't see coming.\n\nThis game is based on RPGs like Final Fantasy and Golden Sun, but where they can be very slow (the former, particularly), this one is incredibly fast paced. I've played a fair amount of FFxiii, but I managed to catch up to my playtime for that game in a much shorter span due to how enveloping this game can be; I've wiled away more than one night by just playing the story of this.\n\nGrinding is possible, but wholly unneeded. It seems most of the enemies have some kind of scaling, but maybe I was just at the perfect level for everything... Not being able to tell which it is is a very positive thing.\nIt also has a Game+ mode where you just restart the story with all your levels, skills and equipment. This is a nice feature, but I wish it had asked first as I was close to a few end game achieves that reset with the story.\n\nThe actual gameplay is, as I said, fast and flowing. A little less dependence on the mouse would have been nice (you need to click to exit combat, for example), but I still love the way this game controls. Although the interface is mind-bogglingly complicated when you first see it, everything has its place and all fits together surprisingly well for a system as detailed as this. There're skill trees, equipment collecting, weapon and armour modifications, 'flair' trinkets, stat boosters, element resistance, buffs/debuffs... You get the point. But by a few hours into the game, I understood the majority of it.\n\nCharacter balancing was a bit off for me... I dunno if it was bad use of stat items and skills, but my best fighter was also my best healer and had half the max health of my others. Due to the sheer number of options, I found it hard to keep it straight in my head which character should have which (I did consider making some kind of spreadsheet, but decided against it), but I managed to complete the game on normal difficulty without too much hassle. Don't think I ever lost a fight.\n\nEnough about gameplay, what about the story and tone? The tone is brilliant. Spot on. Phenomenal. It'd be worth playing this for the characters' interactions alone. It plays beautifully with RPG and gaming tropes, references are everywhere and as I said at the beginning, the art style is amazing. Cutscenes are done in a felt-style looping animation, battles are anime and overworld travel are chibi things. They all work surprisingly well together and give the game a very lighthearted feel that becomes all the better when the team encounter horrific atrocities.\n\nAlso there's a little easter egg that I stumbled upon entirely by accident, but could NOT stop laughing at. I won't spoil it. But damn. It just epitomises the game.\n\nOverall, this is a fantastic light RPG that is deep enough in gameplay to be elevated beyond the flash game it is and become one of my favourites. Resolution options are terrible, mind, and it isn't integrated with steam very well. Still.

My first experience with Epic was nearly getting killed on the first battle in the game, gg. What truly makes this game difficult is Epic is insanely hard, but you can adapt to it. You can get hit by the enemies and survive, and most things that the enemies can do aren't out of your power, unlike a lot of games you see today. It puts the player and the enemies on nearly equal ground, but manages to still keep the game reasonably difficult. That is a sign that the game's difficulty is well designed.\n\nThis game contains parodic references to almost every game in the book that your childhood was composed of. My favorite cluster of references is the graveyard in Graybone Cemetery, there are many tombstones on one screen, a few of them are damaged, but the ones that aren't contain jokes that are mostly references of some sort. This is only a pinch of what is included in the actual game, though. \n\nThe dialogue in this game somehow keeps a decent balance between \"Absolutely hilarious and cannot be taken seriously\" and \"Deep storyline\" despite the final boss being *SPOILER* a cat god.\nI think my favorite thing about the dialogue in this game is either the fact that there is a one-liner for nearly every skill in the game, or the fact that dialogue can randomly trigger when walking around the map, and these times it's at it's funniest. There is one cluster of dialogue where Lance is staring at highschoolers and Natalie calls him a pedophile. Another is a conversation between Matt and Lance where Matt seems to be trying to explain to Lance that despite all the cameras he apparently has in his posession that he uses to stalk Natalie, it's still stalking and over the top stalking at that. The items even get some of this amazing humor, every one having a one-liner for a description. Achievements even get thrown into this bucket, there is one that nearly everyone knows about for clicking Natalie's boobs.\n\nThe only negative that comes to mind is the lack of an optimized full screen resolution and no access to STEAM features ingame, besides syncing, achievements, and cards. However this is understandable for a game ported from flash.\n\nThere isn't much to say about art style, it's not super duper flashy, and it definitely doesn't try to be edgy. It just tries to be cartoonish, cute, and funny, as it should. \n\nI can't say much about the music, purely because music is almost never my main focus. Although I can say the music is definitely catchy and worth listening too, HFX definitely did a good job in my opinion.\n\nThis game has very nice replayability too, but the story isn't really the strong suit. I personally replay for the comedy and the challenge, and I do NG+ to get gear and etc. I didn't grab the first time around. \n\nOverall, Matt deserves much more attention than he gets, but should never stop being a semi-solo developer.

I actually enjoyed the silly story and the jokes were mostly awful but.. somehow still work. \n\nI did dislike the constant backtracking. Also, I played on normal and the difficulty curve was a bit annoying. Like the first third of the game there was pretty much no change of losing, and the last third felt a bit tedious since even minor fights took a while to finish. Example: pack of dogs that each spam heal to full health every turn while preventing you from casting spells, and unlike most monsters have very little vulnerabilities. Really annoying.\n\nAnd then there was the boss fight, which was stupid. I had one party member using resurrect consumable on another, damn near every turn.

It's a totally solid JRPG-style game. It's easy and intuitive to play, well-written, and a great way to waste five minutes or five hours. It plays equally well in short bursts as it does long sessions.\n\nAbout the only criticisms that can be made are that the game can be a bit anime-fanboy-crude, with emphasis on fan service with breasts and scantily-clad females, but the actual characterizations of the female characters are well-done, so if you can look past the lewdness, it's really not bad in that regard. The other thing is some battles can get a bit long and repetitive. Most of the time, combat can be over quickly if you're paying attention to your elemental damage, but then sometimes you'll be up against an enemy that has a ton of health, and while the enemy doesn't pose a huge threat to you, it takes a long time to kill. Still, a few battles turning into a bit of a slog isn't that big an issue, either.\n\nOverall, it's funny and well-written and the gameplay is just an absolute charm. There are a lot of elements between the equips and elements and consumables and upgrading of items, but none of these elements are overly complex to the point where thye become annoying. It's easy to find almost any piece of information you want, and the gane doesn't penalize you too heavily for forgetting to attend to any of the ongoing tasks.\n\nA solid installment in a solid series, heartily recommended to anyone who enjoys RPGs, anime style, humor, or casual gaming experiences.

This is a light-hearted 2D old-school style RPG that makes light and silly fun of many of the tropes we all know and love when it comes the the RPGs we've all played over the years.\n\nThe gameplay is very simple to learn, but you do sit and strategize a little bit when it comes to the attacks you want to use and what to equip for the best results.  It is very forgiving and easy to pick up for the casual player, you can save at any point you want and there is no rush.  You can go back an unlock previous areas you've been to for more exploration or items.\n\nAnd of the items, there are a great many in this game.  You will find an upgadeable crafting system here based largely upon random drops from enemies and chests.  There are also some that you can buy.  Weapons and armor are all fairly unique in the things they do an attirbutes that they have.\n\nThis game doesn't do anything especially new or different.  It is a comfortable and well-executed little game that you can sink hours into without realizing it has gotten dark out and you ought to make dinner or at least let the dog outside.\n\nThe $12 full price is not bad, I felt it was a reasonable cost for the game.

Requires a bit of strategy for optional things, but no too deep if you just want to enjoy it.\n\nI've actually played all the EBF's so far, and you don't need to play the others to play this one. Technically, you can play it for free on the website, minus some features, but the creator has done some amazing work on this title, so he deserves the money if you want to purchase it.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy has always been about adjusting your tactics to your current enemies, and 4 is no different. The game boils down classic turn based combat into a purely fun formula. Each battle, even bosses, you can run from at will, so if you find new enemies you can scan them, then flee to adjust your gear if you like, or just hammer on through if you can. Most enemies can be beaten by using gear with no downsides and the proper elements, but obviously you will get much better results, especially against bosses and larger enemies, if you adjust your gear to hit their weaknesses. Unlike most JRPGs, status effects actually matter alot in the game, and alot of them work well in conjunction. One of the best combos is the darkness status effect decreases stats over time, and increases weakness to holy...and the holy status effect reduces the other stats over time, and increases weakness to dark. This leads to combos, such as having an accessory that gives the darkness-only debuff to your weapons, and using that against dark enemies so they receive even more holy damage. The game is all about finding those neat combos and useful effects, and using them well.\n\nThe story is bare bones, but it doesn't need to be too epic (Despite the name), the summary from 3 to 4 as told in the intro is 'the heroes saved the world, so they thought they were entitled to everyones stuff, so they took it...that made people mad, insert new heroine'. The game makes light of typical JRPG tropes, without being too caustic. It also introduces new elements as you run into them, so it avoids any sort of tutorial. Sidequests are nothing more than gather materials, give to NPC.\n\nThe game has many things you can do to improve your characters besides levelling, optional skills that you can only give to one character, upgrading weapons/armor (of which there are plenty), accessories, permanent stat boosting items that can be hoarded through numerous NG+s, etc. While you can go through it on easy, the game does reserve the boss achievements only for beating them on the highest difficulty, which is an effort no matter when you do it. The optional area, Battle Mountain, is even tougher for it, as the enemies level up with you, so you have to rely on strategy (and maybe some stat boosting items) to win. Still, every group of enemies is unique in structure, and the difficulty ramps up well, a very well designed curve for the game. There is some backtracking as you gain new items, to collect old stuff, but you don't feel too put upon to do so.\n\nOverall, I highly reccomend this game if you like a good turn based RPG that requires you to think about how to handle each encounter, without getting into a mindless slog through weak enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1441557863, "timestamp_updated": 1441557863, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 31, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698687", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17913235": {"recommendationid": "17913235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077095584", "num_games_owned": 208, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2589, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502812236}, "language": "bulgarian", "review": "Can't wait for epic battle fantasy 5.", "timestamp_created": 1441551847, "timestamp_updated": 1441551847, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17911418": {"recommendationid": "17911418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148873348", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1456343431}, "language": "english", "review": "Pay no attention to the lack of play time from this review, cause I beat the free browser version already.\n\nThis game is awesome and you should buy it, well that is if you have the money...

Mentre si combatte se TUTTI E TRE sono messi KO, allora entra in campo il quarto, che pu\u00f2, se pu\u00f2, resuscitare i compagni (o meglio, due degli altri) e proseguire la battaglia.\n\nPurtroppo le battaglie sono un p\u00f2 il punto debole del gioco, imho. Come detto, non sono casuali, ma i mostri sono presenti sulla mappa e si decide se affrontarli o meno. Spesso sono a difesa di bauli, per cui bisogna per forza affrontarli per ottenere il contenuto di questi ultimi. \n\nInizialmente gli scontri sono abbastanza divertenti. Sono a turni, con i nostri 3 protagonisti che a turno fanno la loro mossa e poi aspettano con pazienza le mosse della CPU. Fin qui abbastanza ok. \n\nIl problema sono alcuni scontri che \n\n-si dilungano su ondate successive di nemici: ovvero, alla prima ondata ne stanno 3, li ammazzi e vi \u00e8 una successiva ondata con un altro gruppo. A volte le ondate si ripetono anche per 3/4 volte o pi\u00f9. E questo un poco rompe gli zebedei.\n\n-ci sono nemici particolari, come i boss o nemici pi\u00f9 forti in un dato gruppo, con DAVVERO TROPPI punti ferita. A volte scarichi il tuo arsenale per 3/4 turni e scalfisci la loro corazza di pochissimo. Bisogna metterci pazienza. Anche se si arriva con armi ed equipaggiamenti/magie giuste. Semplicemente imho hanno calibrato a cazzo alcuni scontri. Il combattimento con l'ultimo boss mi \u00e8 durato mezz'ora tra sbadigli e solite mosse. Non capisco cosa trovino di divertente gli sviluppatori, se non la loro inutilit\u00e0 di pensiero.\n\nAnche la gestione di equipaggiamenti ed armi e il loro livellamento: ad un certo punto ci saranno cos\u00ec tante cose che non si riuscir\u00e0 pi\u00f9 a capire cosa si sta facendo per upgradare qualcosa. Lo stesso per le magie, una confusione di numeri, finestrelle e simboli runici.\n\nIo sono andato sempre abbastanza a caso, e l'ho finito, per cui \u00e8 chiaro che anche qui la superficialit\u00e0 \u00e8 lampante (a che serveperderci ore a migliorare di un millesimo, se poi avanzi lo stesso sbadigliando?)\n\nVabb\u00e8, mi \u00e8 durato una ventina di ore, con il 60% di achievement trovati, ma a leggere gli altri li lascerei appunti agli stessi sviluppatori, che forse non hanno un cazzo di altro da fare nella vita (finisci il gioco 3 volte?

That nothing could have made this game any more perfect???\nWell here's the 4th game or this amazing serie.\n\nEBF4 is a classic-styled RPG : Turn by turn combats, \u00c9quipments, Magics, Element system, ALL the Items, Aventure!!!\nThe game's tags already spoil it all, nothing new.\n\nThere are only 2 things you find less often in that one game tho' :\n- Grinding.... ooooooh the grinding... very glad you didn't corrupt this game.\n- Random battles. Yes yes! YOU decide when the action scenes starts!\n\nThe musics are amazing, so much i'm currently listening to them from the in-game gallery. Amazing idea to have more than one battle theme too, it prevents them to get repetitive too much.\n\nThe game is funny and you might need a second playthough to spot and/or get all the references mentionned in the short but frequent character's lines.\n\nThe game difficulty can be changed at will in the game's settings, so it's hard for me to give a negative point by saying that the Epic difficulty mode really can make you remember to save after every fight. Of course you could flee the battle and come back later if they are too strong for you... but really sometime you simply don't see the insta-death attack coming. \n\nExcept for the bosses, the first 10 levels gives you short and enjoyable battles with basic tutorial windows that pop-up so new players aren't too lost. After you get to level 20-22 tho', battles can sometime get long and repetitive, especially with a high difficulty setting. Because the enemy monsters usually matches the current place you are in, it can happen that you just want to see some differant landscape in hope to see the foes also change accordingly... as you will stay in some specific 'biomes' for quite a few battles. \nThe generous amount of ready-to-be-opened-gold-trimmed chests usually help you to not get too tired of these long 4-waves battles. \n\nThe playable characters slightly lack some personality and backstory, yes, but i guess it's the perfect occasion for the 5th title to be even better that this one. Those who already played ( and loved ) the 3rd game should not see any problems with that tho'.\n\nThe price is fair, and the game deserves every single of the 9 points I can give out of 10.", "timestamp_created": 1437110462, "timestamp_updated": 1437110553, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17074353": {"recommendationid": "17074353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093721315", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501211148}, "language": "english", "review": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInteresting...

The story, while geared more toward the 12-25 age range, is still an enjoyable, simple story that lays itself out nicely throughout the story. The gameplay flows very well, and it is very easy to notice that there was time put into making the characters and abilities balanced and scale throughout the game. While the game can be very easy when using the corresponding elemental rock,paper,scissors equipment to fight enemies, the battles can still be very long and challenging, making the title of \"Epic Battle\" very evident, especially on epic mode.

It's cheap, too, so you should definitely pick up a copy!\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[h1][b]Pros[/b][/h1]\n+ RPG: It's oldschool!\n+ Options: All there\n+ Graphics: Cute, colorful, and with nice animations.\n+ UI: Remembering the last used spells is sooo convenient!\n+ Humor: Very much present.\n+ Price: Low, especially for playtime.\n+ References: EVERYWHERE.\n+ Variety: ALSO EVERYWHERE.\n+ Combat: It will keep you doing different things.\n\n[h1][b]Cons[/b][/h1]\n- Not higher resolution!\n- KB Mode still requires mouse\n\n[h1][b]Neutral[/b][/h1]\n+/- You'll have to fight alot of waves of monsters.\n+/- You'll also have to backtrack quite a few times. \n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy Four...now that's a name! Like its name, EBF4 seems to be a parody of all things RPG. It sports fairly good writing, self-aware humor, a wealth of items to find, and the equipment all has unique art assets. We're off to a good start! So what's the story like?\n\nIt's a bit like this. You're a girl from a small woodland village. Three protagonists from the previous titles in the series have ransacked your village, and its prized jewel is gone! You track them down and force them to join up with you, after realizing they didn't steal the jewel, as repayment for their pillaging. You then go on to the next village to find their jewel is also gone. Okay, you should grab some popcorn for this: The jewels are meant to be seperated, and when brought together could spell doom for humankind. This is because of Catgod. Yes. Catgod. Catgod created the world, and all its creatures. It created cats in its image, but became jealous of their relationship with humans, and decided to take the cats' arm and legs, and destroy their greatest works in the world. Now someone, maybe these cats, wants to even out the punishment! You must take your lovable band of misfits and stop them!\n\nSo, we're already in for an interesting ride. What else is there you ask? Read on!\n\nThis is the kind of game where the more I play, the more I appreciate it. There is humor in spades, which sometimes falls flat for me, but it's very self-aware, so I still appreciate it. Something also everywhere is references, and I LOVE references! Other things are also everywhere, such as: skills, summons, equipment, upgrades, monsters, quests, hidden treasure, and barriers blocking your path.\n\nThe graphics are cute, with much of the stuff in the game sporting decent and equally cute animations. There are plenty of options in the settings menu. There are overworld monsters, so when you feel like skipping battles, you can. The blockades barring your way actually keep things interesting, since your equipment will all remain useful depending on what enemies you are fighting, and everything in this game can be upgraded or scales with your level. This sets a great pace for exploration, and encourages you to find all the hidden unblocked treasures you can get your grubby hands on.\n\nProgression has a good curve. You'll level up, find items, get new weapons, and clear areas at a steady pace. There's also a lot of content to this game, for only 12$ off sale, so you'll get your money's worth, too. The game likes to parody cliches found in anime, games, movies, you name it. The humor will keep you going even if the gameplay gets old, and if it does, a quick break is all it ever took for me to fix that.\n\nFor example, I once started a battle with a woolly mammoth to then inadvertantly drop a woolly mammoth on top of it right after my party commented about how tough the fight would be. I was close to taking a break, but instead laughed plentifully and wanted to keep going. There are plenty of other nice things that will keep the game convenient and easy to play like the ability to scan monsters and instantly see their strengths and weaknesses, the ability to leave a battle without having to play a minigame or roll dice, zone teleports, instant healing slimecats, recently used spells list, and more!\n\nGetting around in Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is easy. The UI is simple enough, although slightly clunky. There are keyboard and mouse movement options, but keyboard mode still requires the mouse for battles, unfortunately, and there's no controller support. The game also maxes out at 720p, which is quite low for modern displays. There is also, on the negative end, ocassional lag and stuttering. There are plenty of settings to mess with so you can likely find a setting that fixes that for you.\n\nAll in all you'll want to experience this game for the story, humor, characters, references, varied battles, and sheer number of items, equipment, and potential upgrades.\n\n[h1]======================================[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1435286572, "timestamp_updated": 1435778826, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 65, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16708879": {"recommendationid": "16708879", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047754017", "num_games_owned": 688, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1942, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429097978}, "language": "english", "review": "really wish the other 3 were on steam as well. atlest 2 and 3 so you can get Lances back story. this game is one of my favorites of all time. played it on newgrounds saw it was gonna be on steam and bought it right away.", "timestamp_created": 1435273910, "timestamp_updated": 1435273910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16687925": {"recommendationid": "16687925", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122364174", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1996, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463446195}, "language": "english", "review": "EBF 4 is a turn-based RPG inspired by games like Final Fantasy and Golden Sun. It's the first of the series to be on steam, as the others were browser games on websites like Kongregate and Armor Games. I  remember playing one of the EBF games, although I don't remember which one. I don't remember much, so I wasn't sure what to expect.\n\nThere are quite a few unique mechanics in EBF 4. First, the backup mechanic requires one of your four people to be in \"backup\", and therefore not fighing, who can be switched in without using a turn. At first I hated the mechanic, but I grew attached to it and it does make for some interesting situations. Second, when you win a battle, you get AP. This is how you obtain and upgrade skills, as not a single skill is learned through leveling. Skills in the \"special\" catagory can be learned by two or more different party members, but only one can actually learn it. For example, Anna and Natalie can both learn heal, but if Natalie knows it, then Anna can't. Which, I recommend you do just that, but that's just what I do.\nThere is also \"waves\" system where if a battle has three waves, you have to clear out three screens worth of enemies. This is backed by the fact that all enemies are on the map, and you can engage them at any time and flee at any time, with the only punishment for flee being that the hurt or killed enemies reset.\n\nOne of the things I love about this game is that both hardcore RPG fans and newcomers to RPG's can both enjoy the game. There are ten elements and twelve status effects, every enemy has unique resistances and weaknesses to elements, statuses, and debuffs, your party's weapons give them elemental normal attacks and armor give elements and status resists and weaknesses, a complex upgrading system with a large array of crafting materials, and the HUGE amount of skills is insane! We've got buff spells, debuff spells, elemental spells, partially elemental and partially physical, spells that damage and may caused status effects, spells that damage and may debuff enemies, spells that take away enemy buffs, take away your team's debuffs, limit breaks, spells that element changes depending on the weapon you use, spells that power up in certain conditions, spells with lots of power but debuff your character, HOLY CRAP, I'm geeking out! At the same time though, the first time you use a certain spell, or get hit by a certain attack one of your characters says some, whether it be funny (most of the time because the spell speaks for itself and doesn't require explanation), or it be important information like saying the Barrier and Heal More spells are really important (which they are probably the game's two most important spells.)\n\nGraphically, the overworld looks much different than the battle graphics, but both serve their part well. The story isn't impressive, but it certainly gets the job done, especially considering the game is lighthearted and never takes itself too seriously. Until the final boss. That's some dark crap right there. Also, I feel the need to say this. I won't spoil anything, but I had Anna and Natalie at 31, Lance and Matt at 32, and didn't even use Lance. I changed my armor sets according to the different forms for maximum effieciency. The fight took me an hour, no joke. Speaking of the final boss, the music in the game is great. Not Shovel knight is Mega man levels of great, but pretty close in my opinion. Oh yea. The final boss theme is great. The game's lighthearted theme and humor is one of the things that kept me engaged. I loved laughing the hilarious and silly dialogue, as it just added a unique spice to the battles.\n\nIf I had to find some complaints I had, they would be few, but the one big issue I had that there is a bunch of optional content, and I wanted to do as much as possible, but it just wasn't as interesting as the main quest. There is a whole bonus area with upgraded versions of the bosses in the main story, but fighting the same enemy with better numbers and a few more tricks just... isn't engaging as fighting them for the first time. But the big kicker that killed my motivation for the bonus area was that you don't get any EXP, AP, or gold from the fight. If I got even a little, I might have gone a bit farther, but I didn't even feel up to getting past the second boss.\n\nOverall though, it's amazing. Definetly in my Top 20 or maybe 15 favorite games I've played. Top 10 would be a bit of a stretch, but it's possible. Get it if you are a hardcore RPG fan or want to start getting into RPG's. I mean, I've played RPGs ever since I was 6, I know a good RPG when I see one. And this is a good RPG.\n\nTL;DR Read the last few sentences.", "timestamp_created": 1435192569, "timestamp_updated": 1435192569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16687301": {"recommendationid": "16687301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091209551", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 3651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513127037}, "language": "english", "review": "I have never looked forward to a series more then Epic Battle Fantasy.\n\nNor have i felt so satisfied after beating a videogame ever.", "timestamp_created": 1435190098, "timestamp_updated": 1439755597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496506", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16678004": {"recommendationid": "16678004", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055833306", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1308, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435161197}, "language": "german", "review": "Im Sale gekauft habe ich mir erstmal (wegen der Grafik) nicht viel erwartet, aber das Spiel hat mich dann positiv \u00fcberrascht, sogar sehr!

If you don't believe me, you can always play the free version on Kongregate to see if you'd like it. Some of you might be wondering, \"Why should I pay for a game I can play for free online?\" Here are my two reasons: First, there is a lot of additional gameplay when you buy the version on Steam. It's the same version as the paid version on Kongregate, but this version comes with Steam Trading Cards, which obviously makes it superior. Second, I've been a longtime fan of the series. (My personal favorite is EBF3.) in some ways, I feel like buying this game was thanks to Kupo for all of the hours of fun I spent in all of his games. But seriously, play this game.\n\nIf you like turn based RPGs, this game will be perfect for you. The animations are beautiful, and the gameplay draws a lot from the Final Fantasy series. I also love how armor, weapons, and accessories called flairs affect the appearance of characters. It's a personal pet peeve of mine when RPGs have armor, but changing the equipped armor doesn't change what the character is wearing. You can see that a lot of effort went into this game.\n\nThe game doesn't take itself too seriously, so don't expect to be blown away by the plot. There are some immature jokes as well. Neither of these bothered me, but in fairness to the other games I reviewed, I felt obligated to list a con.\n\nRegardless, EBF4 is a wonderful game and you should definitely buy it if you like turn-based RPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1434900963, "timestamp_updated": 1434900963, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16546334": {"recommendationid": "16546334", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097629112", "num_games_owned": 166, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484399826}, "language": "german", "review": "hallo", "timestamp_created": 1434787969, "timestamp_updated": 1434787969, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16517175": {"recommendationid": "16517175", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126488296", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 573, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1434908999}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 would click4jiggle again", "timestamp_created": 1434695617, "timestamp_updated": 1434695617, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16514610": {"recommendationid": "16514610", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144266936", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490498124}, "language": "english", "review": "You'll notice that I'm here on Steam.

It wasn't RPGMaker so you obviously fail for trying to compare Kupo to a \"reddit RPG Maker /b/tard\". If anything since you know reddit so well that you used categories and seen for yourself how people are on there then you must be one of said \"/b/tards.\". \n\nThis game is literally an indie RPG masterpiece referencing all types of games and genres and heavily Final Fantasy referenced. I played this mostly on Kongregate and the moment it was on Steam I bought it. The OST is AMAZING. I listen to it all the time at work. Halcyonic Falcon X aka Phyrnna <3 I love you <3. You can get all the EBF4 music on her YouTube or Spotify channels. Maybe Pandora, I don't know because I don't use Pandora. You can also get the soundtrack from the Steamapps folder of this game too.\n\n I've been a long time fan since EBF1 and Bulletheaven. \n\nI can't stress how awesome this game is for what it is. There's actually A LOT to do in it and you can easily upgrade EVERYTHING. However I'm missing like 1 piece of armor I think, I can't remember but I read something about it only being available at a certain time? I forgot the full details of it. It's a well known question a lot of people have been asking about in the game because they can't 100% the armor collection. Still haven't figured it out yet. \n\nThe thing about this game is, if you want to speed through the game, you can change the games difficulty to easy. The only difference the game makes is the damage you receive from enemies and how much health they have. Basically just a stat difference. There isn't anything too significant unless you're trying to get all the achievements in-game. The game doesn't seem to give you extra rewards after battles, just the overall challenge of the fights. I usually find it easier when I'm trying to rush through the game to just set the game on easy until I get to a boss fight because a lot of the enemy fights tend to get pretty tedious over time the I crank up the difficulty to hard or something because I can't do epicyet and I'm on my second playthrough. This game does have pretty good replayability to it. Especially the fact that you need to clear the game 3 times in order to get the achievement. However that 5m damage achievement is insane. I can't seem to pull that off with the Revenge skill when everybody but Matt is dead and Matts near dead while atk buffed. I guess I just need to farm for atk stat boost items.\n\nI honestly give it a 9/10 for me only, because some of the non-boss battles can get really tedious and it does lose entertainment value after awhile.

I used to play games from Miniclip and other websites that provide flash games, but for some reason I didn't came across this one. Boy did I missed out. In case you couldn't tell, its a turn-based RPG. It has funny jokes, fourth-wall breaking and references to other games all over the place.\n\nLike every RPG, you go around killing enemies to get materials to upgrade equipment, doing quest and side-quest and buy stuff from shops, you know the usual stuff. And thats what makes this game great. Its a very nostalgic feeling of how a RPG should feel, but they removed one key mechanic that made this game even better.\n\nNO. GRINDING.\n\nItem drops from enemies for upgrades can be bought from shops so you can grind or if u have gold u can just buy it from the shops. This made me so happy to see because so many games rely on grinding to extend the gameplay which is extremely tedious. \n\nThe characters are great, the music can be better (tho i usually play the game with the music and sfx muted cuz i can play while doing something else) and the achievements are challenging and fun.\n\nRPGs lovers have no reason to not get this.

Before I get into the controversial stuff that I like... let me just say that the battle system in this game is amazing.  You can decide which characters get which special moves, you can level skills up that you want while leaving others in the dust if you choose, you have to level up your equipment (especially in later battles) to ensure you have a nice diverse set of resist gear to survive the challenging boss fights (depending on the difficulty you set it on).\n\nDid I mention that there are tons of hidden chests, quests for npcs (that aren't necessary for progression, just a bonus), an extra difficult bonus location for those of us that bought the game, and an amazing sound track?\n\nI personally really got a kick out of some of the commentary between the characters.  The story is obviously very light-hearted and the gimmicky chats between the heroes is usually comical - not to mention you can click on Natalie for a chuckle now and then.  \n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 for me was a breath of fresh air in a market that no longer caters to those of us who liked the traditional jrpg such as the early FF games/nes/snes rpgs of the past.  I like Skyrim and all of the clones of that new genre of rpg that are out, but I REALLY like the old style.

It is still moderately engaging, and doesn't just devolve to \"go here because we aren't gonna say\". At least I can still remember what happened in the game.\n6/10? 6/10.\n\nThe Graphics\nVery colorful, slightly animu style graphics that are all in all nice to look at. Also, goddamn, some of those abilities are amazing visually (mostly the limit breaks).\n8/10 m8\n\nThe Gameplay\nMy first runthrough was on normal mode, cause I'm a pussy. But I'm currently trying to get through the game on Hard and later on Epic, so yeah.\nBasically, this game doesn't fall into the common RPG problem of being able to just spam normal attack to win except on bosses or something, and actually requires a large amount of strategy to get through it. You actually need to be able to adapt to situations, and exploit certain weaknesses to be able to defeat certain enemies (ex. That Goddamn Cosmic Monolith) \nExploration is also awarded well in this game too. There are several points in the game where backtracking and exploration can be very useful to you, mostly after you get key items. As well, this game has two optional areas, one small and pretty easy, with the other being basically a super dungeon where the enemies scale to your level and you fight some really powerful bosses. (Again, fuck cosmic monoliths.)\nAlso, there are a metric ton of deifferent pieces of equipment to customize your character with, allowing you to find a way to fit almost any situation by the time you begin the New Game+ runthroughs.\nAlso, the two NG+ runthroughs cause the enemies to level up with you. That's pretty damn awesome.\n10/10 Am playing again\n\nMusic\nYou ever heard of Phyrnna? No? well you should listen to her songs. The EBF 4 soundtrack, along with the soundtrakcs for EBF 3 and 2 provide some of the best songs I have heard in a video game ever. Weshdoor Concert? Amazing. Derelict Factory of Twisted Metal? Amazing. Outside the Battlements? Amazing. The Rim of Battle Mountain? Amazing. Fallen Blood? Best final boss theme ever. Every single track here is amazing, and you should listen to all of it.\n10/10 would listen to Fallen Blood for the fiftieth time\n\nsrsly, get this game, also is pretty funny.\n\n9/10 am playing several times again.\n", "timestamp_created": 1426263183, "timestamp_updated": 1426263183, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14862559": {"recommendationid": "14862559", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037721844", "num_games_owned": 761, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 2286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426239911}, "language": "english", "review": "Epic Battle Fantasy 4 - The first thing that popped into my head when I heard of this game was, \"what kind of name is that?\" Going by the title alone, you almost expect this to be the most cliche RPG ever, and it is - in a good way.\n\nEBF4 is a bit of a parody of RPGs. You have turn based combat, level ups, and gear, just like in all your normal RPGs. You've also got characters that crack jokes at their own game, and much like the little indie game EvoLand, it likes to make reference to other games fairly often as you bash enemies over the head with oversized weapons.\n\nAt first glance, this game looks like the kind of flash game you'd play in your internet browser when you were little - the art is colorful but looks primitive and the controls aren't complex. Yet this is the kind of 'flash game' that someone poured hours and hours into, and it shows; the art style may very well be simple, but that's before considering how much you can customize your characters. Each and every helm in the game gives the characters a different hairstyle, for one - heck, I spent more time than I'd like to admit mixing and matching outfits to see what was both stylish and combat practical.\n\nThe game is very lax in terms of its rules. It could almost be said that it got rid of all the little bits that make RPGs frustrating - encounters are not random, running away is penalty free, all gear is useable once upgraded, grinding is not necessary (except maybe for Epic mode) and upgrade ingredients are plentiful. The game doesn't have you trecking an hour to get a single ingredient - everything progresses at a quick and painless pace.\n\nMake no mistake, the game is challenging on Hard and Epic modes. One's ability to arm characters with the right attacks and gear is mandatory for taking on the game's big bosses, even if said big bosses look too comical to take seriously.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant game, and there's no way I can't recommend it. It's not the kind of gripping story about trust and betrayal that will move you to tears, but it's a fun little title that does everything right, and should be recognized for it.", "timestamp_created": 1426241036, "timestamp_updated": 1426241120, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500105", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14848280": {"recommendationid": "14848280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030415682", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1426766181}, "language": "german", "review": "\u00dcberraschend besser als sogar die Kommentare erwarten lassen\n\nDas Takitikmen\u00fc ist einfach super, die K\u00e4mpfe sind nie Langweilig und das beste ist man kann nahtlos ohne Strafen den Schwierigkeitsgrad wechseln.\nZudem ist es witzig und ich will gar nicht aufh\u00f6ren dieses Spiel zu zocken.\nIch kann nicht sagen wie lange dieses Spiel geht, jedoch ist es kein kurzes Spiel. \n", "timestamp_created": 1426150472, "timestamp_updated": 1426150472, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500681", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14842871": {"recommendationid": "14842871", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066554218", "num_games_owned": 252, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 6594, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513927902}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is amazing, The steam version is totally worth it.

I played the Epic Battle Fantasy series when it was just an evolving flash series (with a really fun bullet hell offshoot) on Kongregate. I loved each and every iteration, and I loved EBF4 to the point I sat down and went full nerd-out on it with writing things down, calculating, minmaxing, the whole nerd-works. I loved it enough I actually put money towards the microtransaction it had. When I heard it was coming to Steam, I was super hype for it, but I never was able to get around to snatching it. Now that I have it, i've revisited it and am having just as much fun - if not more! - than I was on Kongregate. \n\nThe game itself is what I would call a tribute parody. The entire thing is self-aware of its genre, but also faithful to what it's parodying. Classic turn based combat with a rock-paper-scissors elemental / buff / debuff system, many items to equip to this end, a buttload of spells and abilities both natural to each character AND others that can be passed between each. Saving on the fly, resuming on the fly, overworld monster encounters instead of the random encounters we all are used to from classic RPGs, and those monsters tend to disappear permanently if they areb locking your main path. The scanbot allows you quick reference mid-battle to what an enemy is capable of, while also giving you a permanent bestiary entry for later reference. There are plenty of other features that really speak that an RPG enthusiast is behind the development, who has gone through the caveats and annoying nuances that many RPGs over the years have tossed at us that plenty a gamer have thrown their hands up at in rage. There is an abundance of humor, including puns, references, tropes and similar things that make fun of itself and its genre, and also referring to other games, series, memes, etc. without being overbearing and causing you to roll your eyes. \n\ntl;dr: This is an RPG made by, and for, RPG lovers, and I could honestly say you're missing out if you pass this up and are an avid player of RPGs.", "timestamp_created": 1425317439, "timestamp_updated": 1425317439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14726083": {"recommendationid": "14726083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198205828644", "num_games_owned": 8, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 23, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425314828}, "language": "polish", "review": "My favourite achievment \"pervert\".", "timestamp_created": 1425314838, "timestamp_updated": 1425314838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14724201": {"recommendationid": "14724201", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983531060", "num_games_owned": 571, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1565, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425604977}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought the game to show support for the dev after a twitter statement he made, didn't expect to like the game at all since I generally dislike jrpg style games but after testing it I ended up playing it for a few hours and then some more.

The endless battles, monster marathons, and boss rush modes can provide a mild challenge if you play on Epic difficulty.\n\nAchievement-wise, there are some very simple achievements along with your standard beat-the-game achievements. There's also ones designed for hilarity (click on Natz' bewbs and touch the chicken)! You can tell the person who designed the game has a good sense of humor. The only thing I didn't like is how tedious the game felt while going through the 3rd playthrough. Since I am an achievement hunter, I felt compelled to 100% the game and trek on through playthrough #3 in order to get one of my last few achievements. One thing that I felt could have been done better is some variety when it comes to consequent playthroughs. I found myself picking up chests which served no purpose because it gave equipment I already had. If anything, those chests you've opened on older playthroughs should have something else.\n\nI recommend this game to turn-based RPG fans. It's a good deal and provides 10-15 hours of fun on each playthrough if you casually go through the content.", "timestamp_created": 1425036496, "timestamp_updated": 1425037796, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.675832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14671761": {"recommendationid": "14671761", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068471336", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 5031, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473723686}, "language": "english", "review": "A pop-culter-referencing Indie RPG?

I have been following Matt (Kupo, the creator)and playing his games for a few years now. Bullet Hell, EBF3, EBF4, and a few other titles. I have to say, this fourth installment of EBF is the best. The game gets better every single time. each game has more equipment, strategies, monster and boss variety, skills, and medals. There is no way to express how much I really enjoy this game. There are tons of light-hearted jokes, and meme references. Also, there are a ton of referneces from old school games and shows - especially pokemon. \"Don't thing too hard - you may hit yourself in confusion.\" \"IM NOT THAT DUMB.\"........\" Weak generic bat enemy used wing attack!... It wasn't very effective.\" Littlle things like that (and there are tons of them) make this game so much more enjoyable. Also, Matt ridicules himself and the game several times through his characters. He doesn't take himself or the game too seriously, yet he makes every aspect of it near flawless. Its one of the few games I can actually sit through more than once and do it multiple times. Also, the ability to switch from easy to spic instantly is great. Some might think its cheap, but honestly, you only get achievements on epic... no need to fight 1000s of monsters that mean nothing on epic when on the bosses matter on that difficulty.\n\nPros\nSkill variety\nMonster variety\nEquipment variety\nStrategy (You will get crushed... especially on Epic difficulty... if you don't think before you act)\nHumor\nAchiements/medals\nEndless monsters and challenges\nPuzzles\nMultiple characters\nTons of secrets and hidden chests\nLots of quests\nGraphics (pretty intense for a flash game)\nMusic (and they say video games don't have real music)\nNew game+ and several difficulties, along with ability to switch difficulty whenever.\nLarge map. Seemlessly merges together once you open all pathways. Lots to explore and discover.\n\n\nCons\nSometimes choppy on steam. Probably not the game's fault.

Reminiscent of the RPGs of old, with unique new twists. Offers an arcadey experience with a plot as intricate as the Mario franchise, so you don't really need to worry about getting caught up or anything since anywhere you start is pretty much all you really need to know.\nLike I said, a very arcade experience for those who want good, strategic combat out of their RPGs. Multiple difficulty levels which can be changed outside of combat. Alot of the game will be you having epic combat in a fantasy setting, but I suppose the title could have told you that much.\n\nThis game gives plenty of replay value, despite the 28 hours I clocked in at the time of this review, I haven't finished a single playthrough yet. Provided, I did alot of mucking about with sidequesting and took my sweet time, and if I went straight for the final boss things could have been done quicker, but this game features a whole host of battles that aren't part of the main map and further enhances the whole \"arcade\" view point.\nAlthough, by no means is this game tedious just because you fight things alot; the main focus of the game is RPG combat, as referenced by the title, and it delivers.\n\nPeople have said there's a free flash version of this game, and there is; but it doesn't include the content this has. Said content is the particuarly large \"Battle Mountain\" portion which has a HUGE amount of content, and this version supports up to three newgame+ runs, with enemies scaling with player level each NG+. This also runs better than the flash version, which is a given due to being a stand alone client now. The dev also did a good job with the previous three flash installments, so why not show him a little love? Alternatively, you could purchase the \"full verison\" on kongregate and play it there, but I feel that's less optimal. It's cheaper, but it's still going to be in flash there and ultimately not as \n\nDespite not having a indepth story, which isn't a bad thing mind you, the characters were still interesting to me. Graphics are pleasantly cartoony and colorful, with lots of detail and style.\n\nAlso, unlike the flash version, this has cloud saving, so temporary internet file shenanigans won't muck anything up.\n\nAlso features comedy and good times!\n\nUltimately, this was a good buy.

Its tiny development team, headed by Matt Roszak (Whom is credited for design, art, story and programming).\n\nThis is a game which should be praised, for the amount of effort put in. The result is a well realised and full RPG experience full of character and heart.\n\nThe game retains enough nostalgia from old school RPGs but still manages to feel fresh and new. If you\u2019ve ever played any Final Fantasy title pre FFXI you\u2019ll be familiar with this format. \nIt gives a master class in how a turn based system should play along with all the usual elements you\u2019d expect, being able to cast magic, summon other creatures, use items and attack and it does this as well as any JRPG does. Its appeal for me was that this is a finely tuned machine of a game. Usually with turn-based RPGs you eventually become so powerful that nothing is really a challenge, except maybe some bosses but with a combination of a difficulty slider that makes a difference and some well paced scaling of foes, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 keeps you on your toes and makes you think a little bit.\n\nI\u2019ve always loved turn based RPGs when done well and RPGs in general, but turn based more so than Action. The reason being it brings an element of strategy with out reliance on quick time events [which i hate]. Epic Battle Fantasy 4 makes full use of the strategic element of the genre.\n\nIt does this through its use of equipment and skills. The majority of weapons have an elemental effect which will assist you in tearing through enemies that are weak to that element and each piece of equipment has a use, without the collect and discard method used in most games. Weapons can be swapped out in combat also but this will take up a valuable turn to do so. Not only that, you won\u2019t be receiving that free ride through an area.\n\nThe skill and specials pool is a very well implemented way of customising your characters and their skillset. Skills can only be learned by that specific character and specials can be learned by all, but only one character may have it at any one time. Once again, brings some difficult decisions forward. You can also equip the characters with items that will provide passive bonuses or abilities within battle, another little customisable option for balancing your team some buffing characters and some casting abilities at dice-rolled intervals. Gone, in this game, is any idea of an \u201cUltimate\u201d weapon. For me, that\u2019s refreshing. Each weapon can be upgraded as you collect items from combat or treasure.\n\nThe characters are well written and interact nicely. The personalities feel genuine and It seems like they are inspired by or based in some way on friends of the developer. At times they do act like close friends who have a lot of fun in each other\u2019s company. This game is no doubt a labour of love and the small team at Kupo Games must have poured a lot of time into this game. It is increasingly rare to see triple-A games give this creative warmth, probably due to the size of the teams but Steam lets this flourish.\n\nThere are a lot of small gestures and references that experienced RPG fans will appreciate showing a good dose of humour. From the snow covered Djinn from Golden Sun in Whitefall Town to the name of some of the achievements you can gain for using new items they flow through the whole game well.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy\u2019s achievement/medal system is well implemented. Some are very difficult to obtain, some pretty much laughing in the face at how ridiculous achievement systems are. When combined with the bestiary gives you that feeling of collection that a lot of games look past. It makes you want to collect them, this is important. \n\nA game by a turn-based RPG fan, for turn-based RPG fans, this will likely not appeal to those who only play Shooters or Wii Fit games but give it a chance and it may well draw you in. \n\nTo wrap up, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 is an absolutely fantastic game, made even more impressive by the huge contribution by Matt Roszak. \nIt is a game i\u2019ve played over the Christmas holidays and will likely play again soon. With a Newgame+ option it is set up well for this. The art is soft and friendly, the enemies range from menacing to adorable. The mechanics are solid, the story is well written, the characters engaging and the experience is enjoyable. \n\n\nIt can also be bought for next to nothing because \u2018Steam\u2019.\n\n4 Ferrets out of 5", "timestamp_created": 1420225769, "timestamp_updated": 1420225769, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13775808": {"recommendationid": "13775808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064581370", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1494925394}, "language": "english", "review": "It has a great RPG and fantasy atmosphere.

There isn't a single weapon or piece of armor in the game that is optimal for each and every battle (there are some that come close to defying this though).  You strenthen your weapons and armor through a basic crafting system that requires a hunt of scarce materials, but offers an item shop near the end of the game where you can buy the materials you might need at a hefty cash price.  There is even a achievement for poking...  Uh...  Nevermind.  The storyline and plot is pretty flimsy, but on the flip side, there isn't a need to grind to complete the game.\n\nI strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys console RPGs of the 90s, even if they didn't grow up in the 90s.

I haven't seen a lot of turn-based fighting RPGs like this one, but it really hits the spot.\n\nIt has excellent humor, and I often find myself laughing uncontrollably as I press space to advance through the chatting/cutscenes, seeing hilarious lines being announced by the characters, either in the arguing present everywhere in the game (because Natalie's boobs/Matt being a disgrace/Anna living in a tree/Lance having microcameras stored in his armor to \"look\" at Natalie's boobs), or in the battling of hundreds of enemies (because they are too weak/strong/disgusting/cool/tasty/scary, or because they resemble Pok*mon too much).\n\nThe characters are beautifully designed, and their personalities are constantly clashing with each other due to their differences, creating a constantly interesting atmosphere to get your mind off the battling and strategy if you're playing on Epic. There's things to like in all of them (and if you look at my profile you MIGHT find out which one is my favourite), and the soundtrack is amazing as well.\n\nAll in all, it sounds like I'm reviewing a GOTY title.

From what I remember correctly, enemies scale to your level.\n- SOUNDTRACK IS AMAZING!\n- Art design of world and characters are attractive\n- Can save your game anytime\n- ACHIEVEMENTS!\n\nNEGATIVES:\n- No gripping or remarkable story\n- For people who do not like casual RPGs, this is not your cup of tea\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing through this game again and experiencing the challenge of Battle Mountain!

Late game (on epic) has some 30-60minute+ fights which are all or nothing - very tense, and very rewarding. Because of the way skills work there are some which you have to choose which character to take them on - i.e. revive which is only way besides using an item to actually revive a dead ally (which is pretty important since most attacks in the second half of the game are one shots).\n\nThis remains one of the funniest, deep, and difficult games I have played ever. And if you are complaining about getting RNGed all the time - it's the kind of strategy which is beatable in all situations if you play it perfectly. The difficulty comes in devising a game plan and equipping the right items (which all do different things like random buffs). There are also multiple ways to build your party which can all work - a lot of people have Natz as a full carry mage for example, but she is on healer duty for me :)\n\nThe only bad part of this game is the first boss where you have limited options because you have no skills yet :A", "timestamp_created": 1419444302, "timestamp_updated": 1463600659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503457", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13539008": {"recommendationid": "13539008", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071609084", "num_games_owned": 424, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 18058, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490971048}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun and easy-to-play game.

Sorry, I was too busy playing EBF4.\nAnywho, EBF4 is an RPG where you control 4 characters but you only have 3 at once. That 4th character is your backup, so you're thinking \"Oh I have to take a turn to switch out and now it's going to get mulched by the enemy, great.\" but nope! Totally free, just take that action and you can still attack! (You can do this multiple times as well...for fun I suppose?) That's the thing with this game, it leaves out all the bull**** (Pardon my French) and leaves all the fun, such as no random encounters. But doesn't that make the game too easy? Ha ha, no. If the game is too easy, you can easily take on the upgraded bosses in the bonus stages but the normal bosses are hard enough. Considering that I always make sure to be two levels above the current boss's level, it's easy for me but I figure if I didn't do that, it'd be a challenge. A fair challenge, but a challenge nonetheless. The game is exciting and fun to play, there's always things to look out for such as hidden items, enjoyable character banter (Your mileage may vary, obviously), and so much more. It's only 5 bucks due to the sale but if it was priced on merit, I'd say it be 40-50$, 60$ would be stretching it but for a game like this, I sure won't mind coughing up the dosh for it!\n", "timestamp_created": 1419147896, "timestamp_updated": 1419147896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13489579": {"recommendationid": "13489579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072174860", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2986, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1457291324}, "language": "english", "review": "A unique, well-thought-out RPG featuring a classic battle systesm.

The story mode is fairly lengthy, taking anywhere from 15-25 hours on a normal difficulty run depending on completion and grind and features several optional challenges, with massive replayability including New Game + and Battle Island.

There's a lot of room for experimentation with gear and skills, and even bosses can be beaten through different approaches.\n\nThe soundtrack, as I said already, is AWESOME. No really.

Seeing the series evolve as much as it has, finally reaching an actual release on Steam? It's a great sight.\n\nI've never been a fan of JRPGs, but I never found EBF to be frustratingly difficult. It requires the right enough amount of micromanagement, planning, and strategy to appeal to both casual and hardcore RPG players. It's also got a very parody-minded sense of humor that's usually quite fun and rarely runs dry. One example in it's favor is South Park: The Stick of Truth, which I did like for it's humor, but the tongue-in-cheek delivery kind of killed it for me halfway. EBF doesn't do that, and I'm glad about that.\n\nWhile my only real complaint would be the relative lack of backstory to cover the events of past games for those who might be new to these games, it's never so drawn out and overly complicated to not pick up on quickly.

Even when I had played it 9 times it was still as fun as it was the first time I started the game. But years passed and one day in 2013 just before I was about to turn off my computer I just wanted to check my Kongregate and there it was, Epic Battle Fantasy 4.\n\nI played the game 2 times or so on Kongregate but never really took the time to beat it but then a half year later when it got to steam I instantly bought it and played it through. I'm currently at my second playthrough and it has been some time since I bought it now.\n\nLets get into the game shall we\n\nArt and Graphics: (10/10 absoultely love the art style)\n\nI personally love the cute anime based art style that the game has and the effects are well animated aswell as the world and items and don't forget all the monsters and characters all have high detail. You may wonder why I say that they are detailed while their not having that mush details like shadows and particles but that is becouse it has a perfect balance between being cartoonish and detailed so i would say that this is a kind of masterpiece.\n\nSound and Music: (11/10 its my favorite game music and I listen to it all the time)\n\nI think that the sound effects in this game fits perfectly with only some few improvements coming into my mind sometimes but thats just if I'm picky.\nThe music which is written by HalcyonicFalconX is absolutely stunning and as it changes from every region you visit it also changes the games atmosphere. From relaxing in the forest to intense in the factory aswell as epic while in the volcano. All I can say is that without the music the game wouldn't have such an impact on me as it had.\n\nGameplay (combat): (8/10 the combat is great but can sometimes get a bit repetative)\n\nThe combat system is that of any JRPG just that it is simple, highly detailed and fun but it does get repetative when going through an older region or before you unlock multi target skills. Anyhow the combat can make you quite impressed sometimes as some skills/attacks is simply epic.\n\nGameplay (exploration): (9/10 the world and exploration is so relaxing)\n\nWith a bunch of puzzles, easter eggs and a large variety of biomes to explore the exploration gets quite relaxing and at the same time interesting as you never know what you will find before uncovering the map.\n\nContent: (8/10 very mush content for having one developer)\n\nThere is a large variety of quests, skills, items and monster but its not as mush content as you will find in an AAA game but thats obviouse that it would not have as mush content. I'm not saying that the game is low on content of items etc. but when you reach high levels for example you might have acctually leveled all skills to max and uppgraded every piece of equipment to the max. There is still enough of content to satisfy any player but I'm just saying that you might end up with nothing more to level up other than the characters levels but you wont reach the \"no more upgrades\" untill your in New Game+ or New Game++.\n\nStory: (7/10 even without any focus on the story I still like it)\n\nThe game focuses on exploration, upgrading and combat but still offers a small story and its quite lighthearted and ammusing but still every time the game reveales a new part of the story you really feel like you are there in that offten wierd situation.\n\nFinal Score: (9.8/10 this game is a must buy)\n\nWhy such a high score well here is some ups and downs:\n+++ : The music is absolutely amazing\n++ : The sound fits very well with almost everything within the game\n++ : Exploration and puzzleing is very fun and can get you obsessed to clear everything to a 100%\n++ : The combat system is very strategic and interesting but its still simple enough to be played by a child\n++ : The sudden notices from the characters can get quite hilleriouse\n++ : The games easter eggs makes the game quite fun if you try to notice them all that is\n+ : The game offers New Game+ aswell as a large variety of items to use\n+ : Some skills/attacks can only be described with one word only: EPIC\n\n- : There is a large variety of Skills and Equipment but after starting New Game+ it feels like you found everything\n- : Going back to an older region does not provide with any supported combat untill you reach the next New Game+\n\nThis is a must buy for all RPG fans aswell as to all Fantasy and Comedy fans so I hope this review helped and that you might buy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1411658253, "timestamp_updated": 1419173932, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.714277", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12227230": {"recommendationid": "12227230", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069685070", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 906, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1403603411}, "language": "english", "review": "Your typical jrpg with a self-aware flair.

It feels like a new game. But, at the same time, I suppose instead of innovating, it's simply... more content. Coupled with a map that's of a decent size, yet feels surprisingly small. That, and of all the swords that we've got still in the game even from EBF1, no Soul Eater. My absolute favourite sword is not here. That makes me a very sad cookie. Soul Eater, featured in every game up until but excepting this one. Very fun because of the drastic reduction in survivability stats, but a huge increase in damage.\n\nI'm only 17 hours in, at the final boss, and I expect to be here for a while longer, simply because I'm gonna need to grind up a whole bunch more XP off... something, and a whole bunch more money, off... something, since I expect I am going to need a pile of it to upgrade every piece of equipment I need so I can finally beat the boss.\n\nNow let's get something straight. I don't mind grinding. I play Disgaea 1. Yeah, play. Not played. I'm still going.\n\nBut in EBF4... for some reason, I'm not really enjoying the grinding. I'm not really certain why. I spent hours upon hours finishing up EBF3, and it was incredibly satisfying to finally tick every box, but with EBF4, I'm struggling to work up the effort to beat the final boss.\n\nWhy do I recommend this game?\n\nI recommend it because it's a good game. It really is. It's a $12 JRPG-type game, it's great fun, and it's terribly, wonderfully simple in scope. It's exactly what it looks like, a turn-based JRPG. If you like turn-based JRPGs, you will like this one.\n\nIf your finger is hovering over that 'Add To Cart' button, and you're just not sure, then give Epic Battle Fantasy 3 a go.

It is originally a Flash game, but evolved to become what I think a great classic. It's combat in particular is what I think a high point in the game, the graphics and especially those auto cast skills that appear at random to bombard your enemies will always make you smile. You can have a hat that randomly calls in a tank to blast an enemy with its cannon, or a shirt that calls another tank to rain down machine gun fire to enemies. There's even an attachment that randomly calls a cat to charge at enemies, or radio in airdrop to give a medpack to someone, or cast some random element skills like poison gas, or even an airstrike that drops random stuffs, like a nuclear bomb.\n\nOf course, many boss units have some OP skills as well, like an orbital particle cannon, or some insane defensive skill that switch profile whenever hit by a skill. It is much more variable and over the top than the early FF games, yet maintains the same light heart atmosphere.

Your equipment and skill selection have a profound impact in battle, but they're all balanced against each other. Every one is useful in different situations, so you'll still be using some stuff from the beginning of the game by the end. Status effects are powerful and varied, and vital to many fights. The \"swap in the fourth party member at any time\" mechanic is odd at first but actually comes off really well. And if you crank up the difficulty to Epic, the game provides a mighty challenge indeed--even by the end of the first level.\n\nAs for whether you should play the free version or the paid one? Well, aside from rewarding creativity, the bonus area is everything you could hope for. You unlock it piece by piece as you progress, and it offers lots of brutal fights and unique items and skills (including rematches against alternate versions of each boss, some entirely new bosses and waves of tough enemies).

But unlike your average \"take that, Final Fantasy!\" mimicry affair, EBF stands on its own in every regard:\nColorful art design, imaginative enemies, and I can't think of an adjective for the writing that quite encapsulates the unique blend of self-depriciative humor. The protagonists have a \"band of idiots\" shtick that in any other parody would just come off as mean, but EBF manages to convey a genuine sense of chemistry, that these idiots have been working with and through each others' eccentricities. The humor really comes alive when EBF satirizes not just the genre but also its players, with Anna playing straight man to a trio of 4th-wall-breaking powergamers.\n\nIt wouldn't be a Japanese-style RPG without a story, and where the first three EBF games went for the \"here is a villain go fight him\" excuse to skip to the action, the fourth instalment has tried its hand at some actual worldbuilding this time, though at the cost of assuming players are familiar with the events of the third game. Returning party members Matt, Natz, and Lance are quickly discovering that the various save-the-world plots aren't as standalone and isolated as they assumed, and larger forces have been resetting their little pawns whie they were busy level grinding the Pickpocket skill.\n\nAs for gameplay, EBF is quickly recognizable to anyone who has ever touched a Square Enix RPG, and at the same time found its own way to keep the turn-based combat fresh. Not content with just elemental rock-paper-scisors, EBF ensures stats buffs and status effects/ailments are incredibly critical during the late game, but thankfully the player is slowly eased into it all. There's a great deal of customization, especially if you want to eek out every precious damage point from your foes, but if you feel that you're stopping too often to fiddle with menus the game leaves open the possibility of overleveling yourself (to a point). If you know what you're doing the game will be happy to throw you enough curveballs to keep yourself from feeling overpowered but never tries to make you entirely helpless either.\n\nThe only real thing to watch out for is possible slowdown. Might wanna check how your computer handles Flash, since that's what this game was originally built in, and large numbers of vector images, since that's what the original Flash engine rendered in. My other main complaint is that late-game bosses can be a bit of a slog if you aren't an absolute min-maxer, but in a way that's sort of the point.\n\nOverall, EBF4 is a happy, charming little affair from start to finish. Matt Roszak has stated that he made the series so he can see a game with everything he likes in it, and the level of love put into the product from start to finish really shows through. If you like swords, sorcery, slimes, and squishing the latter with the former, I recommend giving Epic Battle Fantasy a look; chances are there will be a lot you will like as well.", "timestamp_created": 1408519641, "timestamp_updated": 1408519641, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502642", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11790228": {"recommendationid": "11790228", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051835022", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2684, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417053439}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely amazing jrpg style game.

He's also a pirate.. Did I mention he has a guitar and likes Death Metal? I jsut did, you're welcome, reason 1 to buy this game.\nThere's Natalie, whose powers are in her awe-inspiring magical powers, witty remarks, different mindset of the others, and her boobs. No seriously she's kinda the \"Big boobed girl cliche\" of the series, though she's hilariously not jsut eye candy,  dishing out the sage advice and owning remarks. But even more seriously she's literally the only one who can decently heal and revive party members. She's kinda the most important character combat-wise.\nThere's Lance who is a military guy.\nIn a world filled with big demons (like the last villain you kill in #3), sapient cats with no limbs able to wield weapons via unexplained telepathy powers, elementals, magic, Lance is the one who kills things with overwhelming firepower. Seriously though, he melts those who are weak to bomb-type attacks and even has decent fire and electric attacks.\n\nThere's a 4th character, a huntress druid girl for Natalie to relate to.\n\nThis game also has achievements alongside the medals of the game, giving you elevated bragging rights.\n\nYour progress on this version won't be wiped by clearing your cache or cookies.\n\nThere's what I call a Shamievement, an achievement that's more or less a badge of shame like Duke Nukem Forever's Turd Burglar. You'll be rewarded for being a perv by this, though it really could be worse, so in terms of them, it's really not bad.\n\nHere's the part you care about though... The exclusive content.\n\nThis version has more weapons, and more items in general, save for crafting materials (i think) and this game has an entire area called Challenge Mountain. This area is literally filled with enemy encounters which all have 8 enemy encounters each and stronger versions of the bosses in the game which are WAY harder to kill.\nEvery enemy in thise area scales with level, which means you can get past all enemies at level 1, though you do need quest items like the axe or battery to get past some bits.\n\nHow does this game fare? Well for someone who played the first half 3 times on Kongregate, I can say the game fares really awesomely. I mean... never did I once say \"Oh god not this part again\" or the infamous \"Why can't I just skip this\" and I'm one of many who found Diablo 2 monotonous after Normal difficulty.\n\nThis game is very fun, has some funny elements and even gets challenging properly without feeling unfair. This game doesn't have any difficulty spikes... until the final area, but around then you're ready for it. This game is simply a blast, the only thing stopping me from playing it is just the simple fact I'm feeling a bit bored of RPGs in general.\n\nAlongside such big titles like Final Fantasy, Diablo, Torchlight, and even anything else you could really think of, this game holds it's own ground. The game is honestly fairly unique in my opinion.\n\nThis game in my books gets a 7/10. It's pretty good honestly, and I'd easily recommend it to anyone who likes Turn-Based games and RPGs, Despite the fact you can play the game on Kongregate with 30% less content for free.", "timestamp_created": 1407915877, "timestamp_updated": 1407915877, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667670", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11651775": {"recommendationid": "11651775", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040270911", "num_games_owned": 328, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407763024}, "language": "english", "review": "EBF4 is a solidly built RPG with turn based combat reminiscent of Final Fantasy with a dash of self referencial/ 4th wall breaking humor thrown in for good measure.\n\nThe story is simple enough that you don't need to play the previous three installments.

The items are great, the gameplay is easy to understand, and the character interaction is hilarious.\n\nEach weapon/attack/item has it's pluses and minuses. What may be great for one battle may be awful for another. This is nice because you actually need to pay attention to equips, not just get \"the one armor set.\" You actually have to use your brain a little bit to play, but not so much that it's exahausting (for example, you wouldn't go into a battle with light creatures wearing only darkness armor, you'd be screwed).\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you can switch between using your mouse or your keyboard, an option that other games lack. Also, in terms of battles, you have plenty of time to think and do what you need. While some may like time-constraints, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 provides for a more stress-free type gameplay. All your abilities and options are easy to navigate to, and thus far I have not run into a single glitch.\n\nThe characters are great. That's something that could be said about this entire franchise, but especially this and EBF3. There is so much interaction between the characters, enemies, and the environment. Battle after battle can get boring, but the witty dialogue balances this out nicely.\n\nAll-in-all, this game is perfect for those looking for a relaxed RPG experience: no time-constraints or reflex-speed battles, vibrant colors that don't strain your eyes, and lots of easter eggs from Minecraft, Pok\u00e9mon, and more just in case the fantastic characters didn't already have you hooked.", "timestamp_created": 1407098567, "timestamp_updated": 1407098567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11536798": {"recommendationid": "11536798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034199687", "num_games_owned": 683, "num_reviews": 192, "playtime_forever": 1317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1407255565}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun->\nI usually skip over all types of round-bases-battle-RPGs but I'm glad I made an exception here.

If you choose to bump into an enemy the fighting starts, no tedious random encounters after any x steps. Also heroes slowly heal after battle for convenience and most creatures respawn.\n\nThe battle system isn't boring but really fun with lots of different skills, weapons, equipment, usable items. \nSkills are unlocked and upgraded with skill points.

As its title implies, there are also three entries before it... there are also two spin-offs. EBF4 has a flash version that's free to play, but you will have to pay for the Battle Mountain zone regardless, and the flash version tends to be rather laggy at times. Unfortunately, due to the earlier three games containing things that would bring its developer, Matt Roszak, into legal trouble (most notably the first game having a few pokemon for summons, and the final boss of the first game being Goku), they will not be appearing on Steam.\n\n[*]Plot\nIn between the events of the third game and this one, the heroes, Matt, Natalie (Natz for short), and Lance, turn to a life of crime, since they lack the funds to buy food. They think that this is justified due to them saving the world before, although this is a rather flimsy excuse. They finally go too far when they steal an important jewel from Greenwood Village, causing her to seek them and finally deliver justice to them... only to learn that they did not steal the jewel. Anna must team up with the heroes, and track down the thief before he/she/it/they can steal the other two jewels and summon forth Godcat, who will destroy the world.\n\n...It's rather bare-bones, and can rather easily be ignored in the favor of picking fights with wild animals. Aside from a few rather minor references to the third game, you can easily jump into the game's plot without playing any other games in the EBF series. Interestingly enough, the entire series runs on the plot structure of \"Stop this thing by beating it to a pulp,\" although this game diverges itself from this plot a little more.\n\n[*]Gameplay\nGameplay is split up into two areas: The overworld and combat.\n\nIn the overworld, you can walk around, accepting quests to get items for complete strangers with the promise of some stuff in return, harrasing the wildlife, stealing items from treasure boxes, and buying items to prepare for combat. When one wishes to enter the combat phase of gameplay, one simply clicks on an enemy on the map. If one goes to the options tab, one can switch between using the keyboard and the mouse to travel on the map.\n\nIn combat, you have a myriad of standard JRPG skills, including several that are based off of elements. As one of the game's tips says, attack enemies until they die. If red numbers appear, that means the element of that attack is pretacualy effective against that foe. If grey numbers appear, that means the foe is either immune or resists the attack. One can also use the Scanbot summon to reveal the weaknesses of these enemies, revealing their weaknesses and stat totals for all enemies of that type. Battles may be split into multiple waves, too. In one of the lower points of the game, your party's turns are not refreshed at the start of each wave, which can result in up to five enemies getting free attacks if you use your last action to kill an enemy. This is especially bothersome with the final boss, who will \"kill\" itself after a few turns on the waves where it's invulnerable, giving its next phase free, powerful attacks.\n\nAfter winning a battle, one is rewarded with Gold, EXP, and AP, all used outside of combat. Gold is used to buy new equipment, items to upgrade your equipment with, things that hurt enemies, and items to heal your party members. EXP will make your characters stronger. AP can be spent under the \"Skills\" screen to unlock new skills, or upgrade ones you've already learned. Any skills under the \"special\" tab can only be learned by a single character and have to be forgotten if you wish to teach them to another character, adding a layer of strategy as to who gets what skill.\n\n[*]Difficulty\nEBF4 is divided into four difficulties. In order from easiest to hardest, they are: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Epic. The difficulty can be changed on the fly, so unless one is having trouble on Easy, the difficulty can be lowered with ease. By default, the game is set on Normal. If one were to select Hard or Epic, enemies will also recieve bonuses that aren't directly stated, such as some enemies that absorb fire damage entering battle with a status that deals fire damage every turn, or fire-weak enemies starting with a status that lets them resist fire. Bosses that are defeated on Epic difficulty also give medals, which directly corrolate to Steam Achievements.\n\nIn short, do I recommend this game? Yes. I am aware this type of game isn't for everyone, especially considering the rather cluttered interface, but it's a damn fine one. Also, to those who ask where the other party members are at the start of the game, you'll find them as you progress through Ashwood Forest, before finally finding Lance after defeating the Mighty Oak and entering the Crystal Caverns. Each party member also has a different role, which should be relatively obvious looking at their stats and personal skills they can learn.", "timestamp_created": 1405890705, "timestamp_updated": 1405890705, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11328701": {"recommendationid": "11328701", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120438438", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489955994}, "language": "english", "review": "I like RPGs, and this is my favourite one.

Les dialogues sont drole et bien \u00e9parpill\u00e9s afin de ne pas casser le rythme du jeu. De plus l'univers fourmillent de r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au monde du jeu vid\u00e9o en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, qu'il est tr\u00e8s agr\u00e9able de retrouver. Pour n'en cit\u00e9 que quelques uns, on aura l'occasion d'affronter un rafl\u00e9sia, on rencontre un bonhomme de neige ayant la forme d'un djinn de Golden sun et lorsqu'un personnage meurt il est parfois \u00e9cris \"brb\" sur sa tombe.\n\nGameplay : simple et \u00e9fficace on va g\u00e9rer un groupe 4 personnages, trois \u00e0 l'\u00e9cran et un rempla\u00e7ant, qui peuvent avoir des comp\u00e9tences et \u00e9quiper des objets, quelques invocations cach\u00e9 au fur et \u00e0 mesure de l'histoire et les \"limite break\".\n\nL\u00e0 o\u00f9 cela devient g\u00e9nial c'est la gestion des \u00e9l\u00e9ments et alt\u00e9ration d'\u00e9tats, pour cela trois points importants : \n\n - TOUS les \u00e9nnemis on des forces et des faiblesses par rapport aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments et alt\u00e9rations d'\u00e9tat, y compris les boss. Vous vous souvenez de ce sort \"Cyanure\" qui ne sert \u00e0 rien car tuer des \u00e9nnemis au poison est trop long et les bosses y sont immunis\u00e9s, et bien l\u00e0 ce ne seras pas le cas et pour certains boss c'est m\u00eame particuli\u00e8rement conseill\u00e9. De plus tous les ennemis sont analysable et un fois fait vous aurez toutes les informations permettants d'\u00e9labor\u00e9 une strat\u00e9gie.\n - TOUTES les attaques (ou presque, on va dire 95%) sont \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires et bon nombre d'attaque on un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui d\u00e9pends de l'arme \u00e9quip\u00e9e.\n - TOUTES les pi\u00e8ces d'\u00e9quipements sont plus ou moins aussi bonnes lorsque l'on prend leurs caract\u00e9ristiques en compte, elle deviennent donc toutes occasionnelles (sauf le chapeau qui multiplie par deux les soins lanc\u00e9s, celui l\u00e0 j'ai du mal \u00e0 m'en pass\u00e9 tellement c'est bien). On choisira donc souvent une pi\u00e8ce d'\u00e9quipement pour son/ses \u00e9l\u00e9ment(s) que ce soit en attaque ou en d\u00e9fense.\n\nCes trois points font que pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 avancer (je conseille de jouer en mode difficile d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but, ce qui repr\u00e9sente un challenge correct sans \u00eatre franchement difficile), il va falloir pr\u00e9parer son mat\u00e9riel judicieusement en fonction des \u00e9nnemis qui arrivent, voir fuir le combat une fois le boss analyser pour revenir apr\u00e8s une mise \u00e0 jour.\n\nDur\u00e9e de vie : En prenant mon temps (j'aime bien farfouiller partout) et sans finir \u00e0 100%, il m'a fallut plus de 50h pour finir une premi\u00e8re fois le jeu.

You buff, cast magic, and attack - what you would expect.\n\nThe core of the combat is fun, but in the later stages of the game: it becomes a little bit of a chore at times.

I actually died once just to see what happened.\n\nAnyway - this is a fun, classic, RPG style game with a lot of spells, summons, and monsters to fight.

It's powerful role playing essentials prove that an RPG does not have to be made with great graphics or new complicated battle mechanics - it just needs a firm storyline such as this.\n\nThe story unfolds with four heroes that find each other along the journey, fight monsters, and as usual, attempt to claim world peace from this unseemingly harmless boss - the Godcat. Throughout the way, dry R16 humour develops throughout the story, and even when you are engaging in difficult battles, somewhat the characters randomly crack jokes in a light hearted manner. Hmm...\n\nThe system is brilliant. Brilliant in the sense that the forging and money systems go hand-in-hand nicely unlike many other games that introduce poverty into the heroes. Summons actually help a lot, and battle statuses are not just those nice symbols floating on your heads - they actually kill you. Simple but effective.\n\nMusic is fine, although the tunes are reminiscent of popular music. Canon in D - main theme.

At first I thought it might be one of those parody/homage to old RPGs but while this game doesn't do anything revolutionary with the turn based formula it does present an interesting challenge without any of the annoyances of past well known games. \n\nFirst thing you should know that it does contain a lot of references from old school games like Final Fantasy to Pokemon to some less obvious. That doesn't mean this game isn't original. It's got a light hearted story and a charming cast of characters. There are a few references of previous Epic Battle Fantasy games that might be lost on you but they happen more so for comedic effect and doesn't hinder understanding the story whatsoever.\n\nI think what really makes this game enjoyable is the battle system. There's a few notable improvements on the old turn based formula that make fighting more strategic and less of a chore:\n\n1. You are able to change equipment and characters on the fly - In the middle of a battle you aren't bound to the 3 characters and if you're not quite properly equipped to handle the foes you're battling you can easily swap out equipment during your turn. Characters in reserve also recover HP/MP each turn so it makes things slightly easier. \n\n2. Elements and status effects play a prominent role in fights - This adds a bit of challenge. Generally there's 10 elemental resistances and another dozen status effects. Instead of always equipping the stronger weapon / armor you'll find yourself adjusting to weapons of different elements for maximum damage and defense. I find this particularly nice and adds a bit of strategy because depending on the foes you're going to be changing equipment a lot. \n\n3. Limits / Summons - Will do wonders if you know when to use them. You could opt for a blind challenge in which you don't know any of your enemies' weaknesses but, if you're not into blindly hitting anything that moves you'll end up scanning foes a lot to learn what makes them tick. Unlike most RPGs the scan feature in this game is super useful. It also helps that the scanned information is readily available after you scan each foe. It doesn't just disappear for it to be forgotten and spam attacks anyway. \n\n4. Upgrades - You keep all your equipment so it helps that you can use various items to improve weapon resistance and deal added damage. \n\nWhile I do enjoy playing most games with a controller I found using my mouse extremely simple to move, access menus  and fight. Also the environments are vibrant and fresh so you don't get bored too quickly. The side quest Battle Mountain and varying difficulty levels are available for those who love a challenge. There's also 100+ achievements for the would be hunters to come back and 100% this game. I've only been on my first playthrough but I don't think replayability is high but for the price you have a decent 20hr minimum game on your hands. I would suggest if you're a fan of RPGs to get this. It's a bit light on story but it's done a couple of fun things with the battle system that will keep you entertained for a while.", "timestamp_created": 1404855431, "timestamp_updated": 1404855431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.576669", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11119232": {"recommendationid": "11119232", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987456392", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 940, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404942751}, "language": "english", "review": "Easy to play.

Here's a more in depth analysis.\n\nFirst up, I love the inventory.  You can hold every item in the game but there is no problems with clutter.  You never have to worry about a full inventory or wonder if you should sell an item you may need later on.  Huge time saver, I hate managing inventory.\n\nAbilities are chosen with experience points.  There are skills and specials.  Skills are character specific, like the fighter gets sword skills, the ranger gets bow skills.  Specials can potentially be learned by 2-4 characters but only one of them can actually learn it.  For example the skill \"power metal\" can be learned by either of the guys but not both of the guys.  Limit breaks (yes there are limit breaks) fall into one of these two categories as well.  So there's some careful balancing to make sure your party functions well.\n\nEquipment is easy to manage and you will be needing to switch weapons/armor/trinkets from time to time to deal with various types of enemies.  Your mage wont be needing that fire damage staff against fire elementals, for example.  Equipment can be changed during combat at the cost of a turn in case you get caught by something unexpected.  Certain fights you'll be changing gear more then once as different enemies appear.\n\nEquipment can all be upgraded through crafting.  Not the sort of annoying crafting where you have to sort through tons of crap and figure out just how much rough stone you need to make enough widgets to make 20 springs.  Basically you open the upgrade menu, things that can be upgraded with your current mats are highlighted, things that can't are not.  It cuts the crap and simply boils it down to the desicion of, is this where you'd like to spend these materials?  Most of the items I was using were maxed by the end of the game with no particular effort to farm or buy materials.  2-3 weapons per char, 1-2 armors, 1-2 helmets, and a whole whack of trinkets.  \n\nThe real meat of the combat boils down to resistances and damage types.  8 types of elemental damage and 8 debuffs, all with their own counterpart resist stat.  Fortunatley you don't have to memorize 16 stats for every enemy type.  When an enemy typs is scanned with your scanbot, you can hover over them to check their stats at any time for the rest of the game.\n\nThere are also summons, as you'd expect from a final fantasy game, however they are not spammable in this.  You get summoning points for each kill depending on monster strength and use the summoning points to ... summon.\n\nOne thing that always bothered me about Final fantasy and Chrono Trigger was how end game tended to revolve around spamming your biggest AoE, a lot.  It looked like this game was heading that direction in the mid game, but toward the end that was just not possible.  Mixed immunities ensures you aren't just spamming a single AoE forever.  This game really took all the good out of final fantasy and boiled away a lot of the crap.  8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1404691270, "timestamp_updated": 1404973516, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9,

It's an \"old-school inspired\", JRPG-esque game but it's also heavily Western in styling...I know that's a strange sentance but this is a strange game.  The characters and dialogue are cheeky, fun, and likable, and the animations are well done and seem powerful.  The music is pretty good (although repetitive) and there are almost too many collectable and upgradable weapons, skills, and summons to digest at once.\n\nEven with all that said, while playing this game I strangely felt like there wasn't all that much compelling me to keep going.  I got a few hours enjoyment out of it so I don't necessarily regret the purchase but it just wasn't a gripping title by any means.  It's really a glorified web/flash game with a few perks that it picked up when it moved to Steam.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 isn't bad per se, but I don't think I would recommend it to other gamers.  That said, if it looks interesting, I'd recommend playing it for free in its original medium - a web flash game:\n\nhttp://www.kongregate.com/games/kupo707/epic-battle-fantasy-4\n\nIf you like it and/or want to purchase it to support the developer please go ahead, the game works flawlessly as a desktop title and the port from web to client went very smoothly.\n\nAll in all I'd give it a 6/10 - and I would recommend once again that interested parties check out the web version before purchasing.  The game shows potential, but really it seems to be trying to pull off what Cthulhu Saves the World and Breath of Death VII achieve much more gracefully.

What I especially like about the Epic Battle Fantasy games however, is the differences it has that make it stand out as a game. For instance, at the highest levels, your weapons that you've had since the beginning are still options to use for battle, instead of other games where your starter weapon was probably sold at the first shop for some extra cash. For the final bosses as well, unlike the FF games, where simple grinding could make anything easy, this game relies on intelligent strategy to beat a boss. \n\nYou can't simply use brute force to take down an enemy here, it requires actual thinking. You have to consider:\n\n-What weapons do I use?\n-What's their weakness?\n-What armour do I wear to compensate for their skills and mine?\n-What skills do I use, and which special abilities (Only one person gets it, but you choose) gets which skills. \n\nAll of this, a decent storyline, great music, good characters with unique personalities, and a vast world are all reasons why Epic Battle Fantasy 4 should be considered a great buy.", "timestamp_created": 1404290320, "timestamp_updated": 1404290320, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11013203": {"recommendationid": "11013203", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016751832", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1846, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485925029}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u5f88\u5e36\u611f\u7684RPG\u56de\u5408\u5236\u904a\u6232.\n\u5404\u7a2e\u5957\u88dd\u53ca\u6b66\u5668.\n\u773e\u591a\u7684\u83ef\u9e97\u6280\u80fd.\n\u53ef\u611b\u7684\u756b\u98a8.\n\u9084\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u96b1\u85cf\u7684\u60e1\u641e\u539f\u7d20.\n\n\u9019\u904a\u6232\u6211\u5f9e\u7db2\u9801\u7248\u5c08\u6ce8\u5230\u73fe\u5728.\n\u4ed6\u679c\u7136\u51fa\u5728Steam\u4e0a\u4e86.\n\u6211\u5f9e1\u4ee3\u73a9\u52304\u4ee3.\n\u767c\u73fe\u6539\u8b8a\u5f88\u5927.\n\u5982\u679c\u60f3\u4e86\u89e3\u5287\u60c5.\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f9e1\u4ee3\u958b\u59cb\u73a9.\n\n\u7e3d\u7d50:\n\u53cd\u6b63\u5c31\u4e00\u53e5\u8a71.\n\u597d\u904a\u6232\u4e0d\u8cb7\u55ce?", "timestamp_created": 1404273785, "timestamp_updated": 1404273785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "11008543": {"recommendationid": "11008543", "author": {"steamid": "76561198092326788", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504218616}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

The game plays like a traditional RPG, where you walk around the world, find items in chests, complete a few quests for NPC's (and by 'quest', I mean go and find them some junk and bring it back), and fight enemies.\n\nOf course, there is a deeper play to it. Anyone who has played the prior Epic Battle Fantasy games on Flash game sites such as Armorgames or Kongregate will know that equipping the right stuff is key to the game, and even armor and items you find early on may play key roles later on, especially if you upgrade them. No weapon or armor is useless in this game, and it allows for a good amount of customization. Plus, the proper armor and weapons show up on the character as you switch them, which is a fine little bonus~\n\nAnd for those who are skeptical of buying this knowing that there is indeed a Free-to-Play version out there, the money is well worth the spending, because you're not only supporting the creator of this fine series (kudos to you, Matt Rozak), but you get some extra content in the form of new weapons/armor, new summons, and a tough optional area that will test your skills in more ways than one. Plus you get the soundtrack to boot~\n\nOverall, it's a very good game, especially for one made in Flash. If you're looking for a light-hearted RPG, this may just be the one for you.~", "timestamp_created": 1404110823, "timestamp_updated": 1404110823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10961921": {"recommendationid": "10961921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006142323", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405443056}, "language": "english", "review": "Bought this game on Steam sale, always wanted but I'm cheap.

Q.Q;\nMaybe it's intentional, but once all the enemies attack then they all die of poison or whatever, the next enemies come in and they get to go first. Also, if the last (and only) enemy attacks and then die from a counter attack, I start hating my characters' awesomeness since I have to deal with the next wave's attacks before I can heal or something. It'd be great if that were dealt with. :D\nThat's literally my only complaint, with the first sentence in mind, so YES! Get it and play it! Totally worth it!\nLastly: I love the reference to Golden Sun. >.>", "timestamp_created": 1403826529, "timestamp_updated": 1403826529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500006", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10851154": {"recommendationid": "10851154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001561633", "num_games_owned": 302, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3417, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507482024}, "language": "english", "review": "Came for natz's boobs, stayed for natz's boobs...and the plot, the plot is great\n\n\n10/10, Bought for 4.99 R$", "timestamp_created": 1403823957, "timestamp_updated": 1423485967, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502493", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10850674": {"recommendationid": "10850674", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998079161", "num_games_owned": 1209, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 310, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1404875515}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Jogo despretencioso com um incr\u00edvel sistema de batalha inspirado nos cl\u00e1ssicos jRPG.

In short: It is fun, and unique.\n\nJust 10 minutes into the game and you can see everything that has been inspired from games of old. Turn Based battle system, a fun, laid back skill system, and visual cues that darn well give away hints.\n\nIf you're looking for an extremely hardcore RPG, you have come to the wrong place, if however - you are looking for a \"comfy\" JRPG which focuses more on fun, you have come to the right place. Not to say the game is not challenging - far from it. It's just more relaxing to play than other JRPGs on the market. Hence the term \"Comfy JRPG\"; it's something you can play all night without realizing the time, which is exactly what happened to me last night.\n\nEven-though I have some of the best JRPGs ever created in my library I choose to play this for hours instead. Now, you're probably wondering why? The answer is simple: Fun. Literally pure fun. With some of the classic JRPGs you get ups and downs, and sometimes just can't be bothered to keep playing - but with this, it's just all ups and I never wanted to put the mouse down. - Would be nice to perhaps Controller support in the future though.\n\nThe story/plot is very unique, and the game has some nice light humour, which is very nice to see in a JRPG. This is a game that doesn't take itself too serious. It's less about hardcore grinding, and more about fun. The story up to now has been great, but I won't say much as it would ruin surprises for you.\n\nIt's quite funny seeing certain thing's in game and you think to yourself \"Wait a minute! That looks familiar!) - There are clear references to Final Fantasy, Zelda, Pokemon, etc. It was funny seeing that Pikachu on the fire, and other stuff which I won't mention it as it could spoil the surprise. There are plenty of different foes, and might I add - the art style is very good too. Would be nice to see 1080p support in the future for those who can make use of it.\n\nThe battle system is very relaxing. There is no rushing, no stress. You do stuff in your own time. There are a lot of skills and specials to choose from. Items can also give you permanent boosts, as well as your mandatory heal items, etc you would come to expect from a JRPG.\n\nAt first the item collecting seemed weird - but after a bit of time I realized it's another great element to the game, and it reminds me of when I used to be a kid and collected rare items in games. It's nice to have something like that again. Although, it would be nice if there was a few less item quests, and perhaps a few more hunt x monsters quests.\n\nSo what are the final thoughts for EBF4? It's almost the ultimate comfy JRPG, and that's not a light thing to say. This game is VERY FUN. So if you want to sit on the couch or desk for hours and hours and forget about time and eventually grow a beard and never wash again because you are so damn addicted, then this game is for you. Seriously. BUY IT NOW. Feel free to look at my reviews for other games, I normally score most games low, but this get's an 8/10 from me.\n\nAlso; Did I mention you can make bewbs bounce, and play with pussies? :3", "timestamp_created": 1403533920, "timestamp_updated": 1403552199, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766051", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10711409": {"recommendationid": "10711409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067844824", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433250524}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u60f3\u627e\u4e00\u500b\u6311\u4e0d\u51fa\u7f3a\u9ede\u7684\u56de\u5408\u5236RPG\uff1f\u606d\u559c\u4f60\u73fe\u5728\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1403533503, "timestamp_updated": 1403533503, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501528", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10710806": {"recommendationid": "10710806", "author": {"steamid": "76561197991391480", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 91, "playtime_forever": 3512, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1428353512}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't let its Flash game origins fool you, EBF4 is a polished product with lots of features even the big boys can't be bothered with.

Aside from a few quirky bits, there isn't really anything here that makes the game stand out - it's standard JRPG fare. The characters and story are decent enough, the combat/leveling seems fine, enemies are reasonable, puzzles are somewhat easy but can have tricky parts here and there, etc. You can adjust the difficulty level at any time if you feel the game is getting too easy.\n\nThe art style is questionable, but it looks better in-game than it does in the store page's screenshots. I would prefer a different style but this is acceptable.\n\nSome of the reviews mentioned this game being online, so I checked, and yep you can play for free on Kongregate. The Steam version has additional content and more options though, so it's probably worth a couple of dollars (I picked this up for $3 in the summer sale). I played through about half of the first level online to see if the game was even worth playing, and I'd recommend the same to anyone who might be thinking about buying this.\n\nThe first boss is a surprise due to its power level, which is far above anything you've already dealt with. You'd expect that from a boss, but not to this extent. The boss could one-shot the healer, which was slightly annoying. It's still not \"hard\" to beat the boss, but some grinding will be necessary for a few people (depending on the difficulty mode). The other bosses seem easier in relation to your power level, so it seems the power curve is better-adjusted after this first boss.\n\nOverall this game seems worth some money and time if you like RPGs. It's a bit on the casual side and definitely not perfect, but for $3 there isn't much to complain about.

This belongs on Newgrounds.  Wait, this IS on Newgrounds.  Why would I pay for this?  Why would anyone even greenlight this??\"  I'll tell you why: because this is the RPG your oldschool heart's been waiting for.\n\nYou've got your turn-based RPG elements, your enemies rating from the silly to the spooky to the right-out terrifying, your countless tongue-in-cheek Final Fantasy/Pokemon/Zelda/Mana/etc. homages.  But then there's the feeling of being a part of this world: rather than \"exploring\" a \"vast\" world of triumphs and tribulations, you just sort of twiddle around and run into packs of monsters just sitting there on the worldmap.  There's the never-ending bickering and bantering among your teammates as you progress.  There's the range of hints both silly and satisfying that play out as you spar with your foes and try new techniques.\n\nThe challenge is there too--boy, is it ever.  For a game optimized to be played 30 minutes at a go, you can spend a lot of effort fine-tuning your characters' skills and loadouts for tough fights (and it will *really* pay off if you are playing Epic and going for the achievements).  You'll be able to come back to it over time, too--have the satisfaction of clearing the game, take some time off from it, and come back to it anew in New Game+ (or ++) playing however you feel, without having to collect all those non-key items again but with all the damage numbers exponentially increased for more cheesy epicness.\n\nAnd of course, the content you won't find on Newgrounds here--the Battle Mountain--escalates the challenge further (though you could still get through it pretty easily in Easy mode if you went that route).  It's a chance to step off the beaten plot-ridden path and just smash up tons of monsters--plus all-new bosses both uncompromising and unsettling.\n\nIf you are a child of the 90s or late 80s and don't have time to play RPGs anymore but still admire them from afar, this is your chance to see firsthand what happens when nostalgic thrills meet the present day.

If you're a fan of Final Fantasy, Golden Sun or any other RPG along those lines, you'll find plenty of things to like here.\n\nIts a fairly simple system in terms of skills and weapons. Find the right materials and you can forge your equipment to be better. Higher level equipment requires rarer items. After winning a battle you get ability points which you can spend towards spells and skills. Higher levels need more ability points and so on. This is in addition to a standard leveling system (get exp and level up). \n\nThe skill and equipment sets feel very well thought out. No one skill or item is designated as \"crap\" each feels like its part of one option for strategy, and I can say you will probably use every piece of equipment at one point or another. Another cool touch is that each item shows up on the characters both in battle and outside. It's a nice little touch.\n\nThe story is also simple to follow, but its almost like a parody of the traditional RPG plot. It doesn't take itself seriously at many points, yet still keeps you somewhat invested in fighting the big bad guy at the end. There are references galore to other RPG's and internet stuff among other things, and its just a straight up fun ride.\n\nFinally, the music kicks ass. That's all I have to say about that.\n\nAnd this was made by one guy who made flash games in the past.  While the price might be a little off putting to some, buy this to help support the guy.

The story alone makes fun of typical adventure RPG's (like one moment someone gives you advice and your character pretty much says \"well no shit.\") The characters are memorable, there's numerous items you can customize your characters to look different so you're not staring at the same people over and over again, have seperate spells and advantages and even in the beginning of the game they give you a ton of of and the enemies you face actually take some thought to figure out (there's a scanbot in this game who pretty much can show you all the recommended spell types you need to use and etc.) \n\nThe graphics are sort of flash-game looking but very easy to overlook, the music soundtrack is AWESOME. During battles or even walking around I find myself bobbing my head up and down because it's so catchy whether it's playing fantasy music or viking metal. \n\nThe ONLY downsides I can really think of about this game is 1) the fps rate. When you're in battle it doesn't occur but when you're traveling the world you'll find the character looking like its equivelent of lagging. This isn't really a big issue considering the rest of the game is really well conducted and 2) some instances the game can come off as easy but you can change the difficulty at ANY time during the game if you don't feel it's giving you that competative edge, so really come to think of it my second reason isn't really that bad if you can work your way around it just changing the difficulty. \n\nIt's easy to figure out and enjoyable, I played three hours worth when I first got it and it felt like 15 minutes I was having so much fun with it and I definitly recommend this game.\n\nGames in relation to this one: It's like South Park Stick of Truth mixed a little with the beauty of Plants VS.

The art is fantastic, especially for a game of this genre.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, similar to what one would expect from a game of the genre. You've got the exploring aspect and the turn-based combat aspect, both of which are reminiscent of classic RPG flash games (Dragon Fable anyone?). It's nothing too special, but it's fun enough to not warrant a complaint from me.\n\nThe game's music was fantastic. I really enjoyed it and look forward to getting a copy of the soundtrack for future listening. Oh, and the artstyle, which was also very well done. Just like any other RPG, Epic Battle Fantasy 4 comes packed with a massive (and somewhat complex) skill system. It may have taken a while to get used to it, but it's certainly one of the game's positives.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 is a great game, earning my recommendation. The artstyle may turn a few people away, but the game itself is fantastic (and besides, that artstyle should be selling more than it already is, right?).", "timestamp_created": 1396895100, "timestamp_updated": 1396895100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479118", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9749691": {"recommendationid": "9749691", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073460638", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 765, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480643188}, "language": "english", "review": "you get to fight cat gods....... :D", "timestamp_created": 1396828063, "timestamp_updated": 1396828063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500144", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9745686": {"recommendationid": "9745686", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030037937", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1396731223}, "language": "english", "review": "11/10 would buy sequel", "timestamp_created": 1396799897, "timestamp_updated": 1396799897, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494076", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9738001": {"recommendationid": "9738001", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068189672", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3189, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508610288}, "language": "english", "review": "Probably one of the highest value games I've seen, especially an indie RPG.

I'm positive there's some kind of overpowered gear/party setup to be found somewhere/sometime but as far as I have seen there is the complexity where switching equipment to counteract the zones you're currently in will benefit you considerably which is great. It should not be mistaken for an easy game other than being an RPG where you can farm/outlevel zones, because the highest difficulty setting does offer quite a challenge.\n\nThere's a whole lot of fun to be had with just the humorous dialogues and references to popular video games and anime culture. If that's not your thing, then you may want to seek elsewhere. The game may run a little bit slower during intense scenes where there's a lot happening on the screen (depending on your graphic settings) but other than that, the only downside I can possibly imagine is feeling a bit disconnected with the story if you haven't played the previous games.. though in my opinion, even that can be nullified because the story is quite bonkers to begin with.\n\nThe game can be played for free, but the Steam version does offer a lot more extra content.

The art style is very easy to look at and is one of those styles that will never look old. The animation effects during battles are all awesome to look at. The sounds make every hit and effect seem very powerful. It's not something easy to explain, until you experience it for yourself. \n\nAs the title of this game says, the main focus is on the epic battles throughout the game. Lots of care and attention to detail has been put into the battle system. Gone are the random encounters from outdated RPGs. You see every enemy on the screen now and can choose whether to fight it or not. As soon as you touch an enemy, the battle instantly loads. No more waiting around for loading times. \n\nThe combat system has so much depth. There are *a lot* of different strategies you can use to fight enemies in this game. Different equipment, elemental effects/resistances, skills, crafting and items are all very important in taking down enemies. The boss battles are very epic and will challenge you to see if you have been learning how to play efficiently. You will spend a lot of time figuring out what equipment and skills to use for taking down a boss.\n\nPostgame has the optional Battle Mountain area. Always thought it would be a great idea if RPGs would include a way to fight every enemy in the game during some marathon battles? Welcome to Battle Mountain. Where all normal encounters, minibosses and bosses are thrown into some very difficult battles to test just how good at this game you truely are. Not to mention the extremely difficult new enemies created for that section of the game.\n\nLove collecting achievements in games? This game has over 100 Medals/Achievements waiting to be unlocked. The music is some of the best I have ever heard in a game. You will definately find at least a few songs that you think are amazing. It fits every area and encounter so perfectly. There is also a New Game + mode where you can carry over all your equipment and skills. Enemies will level up and everything will be even more difficult this time around.\n\nThere are so many things this game did right for an RPG.

\ndon't worry though the graphics are pretty well done for what they are, with idle animations for both party members and enemies alike, no static combat sprites here! and a lot of the skill/limit break animations are awesome!\nI should mention the entire game was originally designed in adobe flash, but personally this has to be one of the best flash graphics I've seen!\nagain, this version has better graphics quality from the flash game. with resolutions up to 1280x800 and fullscreen! \nDifficulty:\nthis game has an adjustable difficulty from 4 settings, that you can change at ANY TIME. \nbelieve me when I say it makes the difference of a cakewalk 10 hour game, to uber insane Bosses that 1-hit KO the unprepared!!\nthe games difficulty changes the enemy stats by a percentage, making them have more/less HP and do more/less damage to you\nEasy (50%) normal (100%), hard (150%), Epic (200%)\nyou get the same EXP, money and AP regardless of difficulty, some achievements require you to play on epic that's all.\nReplayability:\nother than different difficulties, the game has a \"second quest\" and \"third quest\" mode which is basically the same game again but with higher level enemies. and also has a new game+ so you can play again and again while still keeping your levels, AP, and equipment.\nthere's a bonus area called Battle Mountain, that holds extra bosses and challenge battles, including one that puts you against  multiple bosses back to back! \nalso you can try to finish every quest, learn every skill to max, and forge all your equipment to max, and reach lv99 if you wish to do so.\nSummary:\neven though it started as a flash browser game, it has to be one of the most AWESOME flash RPGs i've played, and in some ways better than a lot of mainstream RPGs.\nthis steam version includes  all the \"premium\" features from the browser version, with better sound and graphics quality, and allows you to transfer saves from the browser game to the steam game! (read in forum how to do this)\nit's pretty damn entertaining, the game makes jokes on itself and the dialog, both in battle and out, can be fun to read. \nbut, damned if your first encounter with \"God Cat\" won't catch you off guard, and it'll quickly remind you why this game is called EPIC battle fantasy!!\n\nTHERE'S ALSO A FREE VERSION ON KONGREGATE.COM, NEWGROUNDS.COM AND ARMORGAMES.COM\ntry that first, this one's an UPGRADED version with all the additional content included!!\nfor those wondering why buy the steam game over the free browser one:\n-second and third quests included (premium only on browser game)\n-higher graphics, and sound quality (1280x800, and fullscreen)\n-Battle Mountain area which holds the \"premium\" items from the browser game.\n-cloud saves through steam, if you realize how easily you can lose your browser game data, this is IMPORTANT!!\n-26 track soundtrack included with the game!!", "timestamp_created": 1394444514, "timestamp_updated": 1394444514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.508484", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9406132": {"recommendationid": "9406132", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053503986", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3781, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413829571}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game a while back for free on kongregate.

Matt \"Kupo\" Rozsak made his debut with a stupid ass fighting game where you pressed SPACE before the ai opponent. it had some nice artwork and it was well made for someone working on his own, but it lacked...everything else. Kupo's next game was something far, far better.The first Epic Battle Fantasy game.\n\n5 years or so later he is STILL working on his own and produeced a game of a godlike calibre.  EBF4 was available (as were Matt's other titles) for free on Kongregate, Newgrounds, Armorgame etc for a while, but people where saying EBF3 was so good they'd pay money for it. One installment later, the Epic Battle Fantasy series had a big enough following that 3 or 4 months after the release Kupo decided to put it on steams greenlight, and so it was lit.\n\nKupo had already programmed an expansion pack for ebf4, so obviously that is included in this version. Some minor changes are the inclusion of grey text that appears when an attack isn't very effective, and putting some new mini-bosses in some places. However, one MASSIVE expansion is that of Battle Mountain. Battle Mountain is a gauntlet, essentially. You fight your way up from the base of the mountain to the top, along the way finding the bosses from the main storyline have returned wit a few...slight twists, aswell as the inclusion of the Dark Players should you get far enough in, which are evil version of the characters you play as, mentioned to be the hardest bosses in the game by Kupo himself.\n\nEBF4 is an rpg, plain and simply. as the ladder part of the name reveals, it's taken inspiration from classics such as Final Fantasy among other popular stratagy games and rpgs. in this game you take control of 4 characters on you mission to smite god herself (yes, herself) before she can do the same to you and all the other living beings on the planet.\n\nThe characters you control:\n\n-Matt: Self-inserted pirate-swordsman, Matt Uses almost exclusively physical, single-target attacks which typically don't give enemies statis ailments unless the equipped sword does so.Completely destroys Bosses and has the strongest Limit Break attack in the game (Even stronger than most enemies attacks i'd say) known as \"Cleaver\", doing 700 Base power(x5) damage without buffs. (The second strongest Limit Break does 550 base power). He also has an ability known as \"Revenge\" that deals more damage the more total-team health is missing (mostly accounting for his, but if an ally is dead the damage is boosted) making him able to shred through anything aslong as he doesn't die (obviously).\n\n-Natalie: The Healer-mage with huge tits, Best used as a healer, but can pull her own weight using exclusively ranged-magical attacks, having the widest move pool she's easy to expiremet with and see whether battle-mage or healer is best suited for your stratagy. For Healer, she has the only ability in the game to heal all party members at once, (without summons) and can set up combos by boosting magic attacks of allies and weakening enemies defenses. As a battle-mage, she has the usual fire-ice-electric-boom setup, but also is able to use attacks like \"Spectrum\" which deals damage and inflicts statuses based on  your currently-equipped staff. Natalie also brings a devestating holy attack know as \"Judgement\" and it's opposite, a darkness attack \"Pulsar\" to make quick work of anything of the opposite element. \n\n-Lance: Gun enthusiast and soldier of an unknown army (maybe) -Uses a mixture of Magical and physical attacks, Easily the most powerful against non-boss enemies.He can unload an entire mag of his freakin' awesome gunblade or maybe call in an airstrike, whatever way he takes enemies out, it's always flashy. Lance is able to fire lazers from space, so clearly he is my favorite to play. Easily his most devastating attack is Hyper Beam, where it requires one turn to charge, then, in the the next 3 turns you may fire it, It hits everyone for massive magical damage and reflects the elemental typing of your weapon. Facing five fire enemies at once? Switch to the water cannon and shoop-da-woop their asses out of existence. Awesome.\n\n- Anna: Nature's whore- personally my least favorite, good for inflcting status effects with her Arrow Rain ability, and she also attacks with a mixture of physical and magical damage, leaning more towards physical. She can also learn healing spells so Natalie doesn't have to do all of it, but none of her abilities heal more than one person, to make up for that she gives healed player \"Blessed\" status, preventing them from being inflicted with status effects. She's the weakest in terms of strength and I find she's only good as a support to set up combos.\n\nThe only negative things about this game-\n1) It's not kind to the uninformed. Not knowing that you're supposed to summon the ScanBot to get information on your enemies' weaknesses and resistences can be devastating during fights. Also, not knowing which skills to get on whom, how to spread your stat boosting items, and other essential things to survival are not taught to you. I suggest playing EBF1 or 2 before attempting this game.\n2) Epic mode is honesty TOO hard. in the older games Epic mode made enemies 40% stronger and gave them new moves. In this game, it makes them 100% harder, and start the battle afflicted with a status they are 200% resistent to (IE- Poison heals instead of damages). This makes the game boring as you are constantly buffing yourself and charging attacks and setting up to do the most damage possible to a level 3 slime because if you don't it will kil you by brushing up against your knees too swiftly.\n3) Items essental to the area you're in being given to you 2 areas ahead. This happens surprisingly often. I recall getting my ass kicked by some ice enemies only to find a staff boosting ice defense and strengthening fire attacks in the next area. \n\nNumber 3 is a personal problem, but 1 and 2 should be headed if you are not a veteran to the RPG style of play. Other than that and a few minor complaints I have about the distribution of critical items, I have no real complaints.\n\nIf you're not in to RPGs, this game may not be for you, as there is little in the way of minigames. If you do not like to spend time micromanaging every bit of equipment, play on normal, if you are used to RPGs in general, play on hard, if you have played through ebf4 prior, play on epic if you choose. The only reason to play on easy is if the Dark Players are making you rage and you just want to kill them already after your 40th attempt...in other words, easy is too easy\n\nTip- Use scanbot during your first move against the enemies, then run away. The flee command never fails, you can use this to get infromation on a new enemy before a fight and allow you not to waste a turn at the beginning of a fight by calling for scan bot after you enter it for the second time.\n\nMeaningless and totally bias score: 10/10 as RPGs go. This is easily my favorite of the RPG genre and I encourage anyone to atleast play the free version if you are a cheap bastard.\nAlso, I did say he was working alone, but that's not entirely true, He also Had the help of HFX who handled the music, and was given some additional designs by various fans (listed in the credits).\n\nI salute you, Kupo, You've come a long way since EBF1.", "timestamp_created": 1394327181, "timestamp_updated": 1394328338, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608193", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9388930": {"recommendationid": "9388930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096183993", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1435335316}, "language": "french", "review": "j'adore\n", "timestamp_created": 1394308715, "timestamp_updated": 1394308715, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9379921": {"recommendationid": "9379921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065348421", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3517, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476224693}, "language": "english", "review": "Even if you've played the flash version and have mastered it, it's still worth it getting the game because there's plenty more to it.

I mean come one  >:O Epic battle fantasy 4 on steam .This is where it belongs >:OOOOOO. Its a flash game but allllllllll that effort put into it is amazing .The art ,music everything and it all works. the combat may be turn based but once you have the swing of things  :D Its not a short game too which is awesome and with all that loot out there youre gonnna have a goood time. I played this on Kong yes the *free version*  ( DONT BUY IT ON STEAM ;=; this man is ripping you off)  yeah right >.>  only people who dont read say that ;ppppp so dont let that stop you from buying this epic game. Cause you have to buy that extra stuff online for more  so why are people saying this is a riff of if its a bit cheaper here >.> even if its the same price its still better on steam and why not support this dev , I mean look at the quality of the game and all the effort put in from this small team maybe even just the dev himslef has done plus no adds, no need to go on  armour games or anything like that . Its just epic battle fantasy and you till ya bored,which will take a very long time) . Another thing i like is how the dev uses fanart  \nand even got one  of his enemies from the fanbase. How cool is that. \n\nStory 8/10 (yes there is a story)= Cats plotting to take over the world!!?? Now thats new.(wierd but it works alright,might need to understand ebf and is preious games to understand some jokes but it does eplain briefly)\nGameplay 10/10= its rurn based combat and it works like silk, you move around a the map from birdseye,play the free version because this can be an issue for some people.\nMusic 10/10= is Ammazing and everyplace has its own theme and combat mode themes adding atmosphere\nFun 9/10=depending on your difficulty, i play epic so there are some boss battles and even access to new areas when you just give up but do return.Ramping up the difficulty does provide and *Epic* challenge and it might seem undoable but with the skills and items you have Victory is always possible and for anyone whos into these types of games you will spend hours on this game.The homour is great among our characters who all have their own traits and since they are silent you can voice them in your own way.(Which can be extremely entertaining)\n\nThe free version itself is amazing anyway and thats all it took for me to throw my money at my screen when this came out.

The combat is heavily based on elemental advantage/weaknesses \u2013 brute force is rarely an option in harder battles, instead the key to victory is using correct skills and gear.\n\nSpeaking of gear, uniquely among RPGs, newer weapons and armor you acquire are not direct improvement of your old equipment. Instead, each weapon and armor has properties that make it good in some situations and mediocre to bad in others. The result is that no equipment becomes useless, and some of early gear may very much be an option for endgame battles.\n\nInstead of acquiring stronger gear, the game features upgrade system for your equipment, allowing you to improve your gear as you progress through the game (most later upgrades require items that are not available until later). And on final note about gear, each item your character wears, from weapons and armor to small badges visibly changes your appearance, which is really a nice touch!\n\nThe story doesn\u2019t even pretend to be serious, but it will accomplish what it sets out to: make you laugh from start to finish!\n\nOverall, Epic Battle Fantasy is all kinds of awesome.

The dialogue is not the best, but it is very light hearted and not intended for the overly serious.\n\nThe game it'self has a large amount of content, which will keep you occupied for hours upon hours. The story alone is 10+ hours, which is double what most \"real\" games have thse days. And that 10 hours is a lower esitimate, only if you are fast and don't go gear hunting etc.\n\nYou may see people complain that someone is daring to charge for a game you can play for free on New-grounds, Kongregate and Armour games.\n\nA couple of points against these naysayers.\n\nFirstly, you are paying to support a developer who already has this game and 3 others out for free (and others of differing genres, like bullet hell?) Don't wanna pay? you can play it for free, so how is that even a relevent complaint.\n\nBy paying for this game, you gain access to extra content, an awesome soundtrack (that I hear costs $12 by it's lonesome), which can be found in the install folder.

And let me tell you, if there is any game on Kongregate that deserves to make it to the big time, its EPF4.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy 4 once again stars the trio of heroic, yet dimwitted adventurers Matt, Natalie and Lance.  This time, however, they're joined by a new character, the ranger Anna, who is easily the smartest of the bunch.  Together, the four this time must travel across the land, searching for crystals and uncovering clues about a new feline menace.\n\nEpic Battle Fantasy has always prided itself on gut busting comedy and intense, over the top action, and this game is no exception.  There are hundreds of weapons, skills and summons to collect and use against literally hundreds of enemies, and the game is full of tongue in cheek moments such as Nat's oftentimes futile efforts to get Matt and Lance to care about the environment, or Anna trying to curb Matt's kleptomaniac tendencies.\n\nAlso, is case you're wondering why you should buy this version, well, its because it grants you access to the Premium Pack.  This pack adds a ton of new content to the game, including new weapons, new armor, new summons, new enemies and bosses, and even an entirely new area.\n\nIf you're a fan of turn based rpgs, of self-referential comedy, or just plain fun RPGs, then you owe it to yourself to try this out.  Check out the free version on Kongregate, and if you enjoy it, you should definitely considering going Premium by buying the Steam version.", "timestamp_created": 1393358369, "timestamp_updated": 1393358369, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463226", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9260660": {"recommendationid": "9260660", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999316457", "num_games_owned": 946, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9609, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512510815}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank goodness I got this game, Matt has always impressed me with his epic battle fantasy series, and when I heard that the fourth installment was going to be on steam I just couldn't keep quiet about it, I was extremely excited for this coming out on steam.

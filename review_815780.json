This is a great and fun tech demo which shows the potential of this gem. \n\nI would suggest the devs to put in a park creator, where players can create and share their own creations, that way, there wouldn't be much of a need to spam out different levels.

This way the game wouldn't die out of players.\n\nAdding small stuff like the \"session marker\" from skate would add to it when trying to get that perfect line, pulling objects etc etc. \n\nEnough rambling on whishes and ideas, I hope this project will get the attention it needs, both from the devs and community, and become something amazing. \n\nWould reccomend!", "timestamp_created": 1521731372, "timestamp_updated": 1521731372, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40975010": {"recommendationid": "40975010", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058703918", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 183, "last_played": 1521736648}, "language": "english", "review": "Best bmx game yet in my opinion, it's got everything it needs physics wise and as this \"pipe\" release is basically a demo of the full game, we can't complain about a lack of content.

Its a demo of the full game, so expect a demo. the purpose of this is to support the dev (one man team - uni student) if you can and in return we get to try the game out, and its physics and alot of fun. So if your not interested in that and want the full game, just wait for that. \n\nbasically, you enjoy this game the more you play it. the more you put in, the more you get out\n\nSooo, how many hours are you gonna get playing this demo?? To my suprise ive racked up around 15-25 hours I would assume, but your milage will vary. Its the same small two areas currently but with the massive amount of tricks you can really just keep playing as you can always do something a little different. Plus i always feel like just going back to do a few runs when im bored irl.\nThe Physics: Really good!!!! At first i will admit, i was kind of dissapointed, i tried to slam bunny hops like in skate 3 and play the game super agresive and sloppy. After some time you will get better and figure out how to play and in no time you will get really good! The game is harder than skate 3 but more rewarding.\nThere are some things that dont work so well, like flyouts, but overall the game plays amazingly is super fun.\nGame is easy to run.\nReally like the different POV's now. ~ if they had a first person adjustment option like mx sim that would be cool tho (like angle, height etc)\nstringing tricks is very fluid\n\nLastly, my favourite thing about this game is the fact that the developer is an absolute legend!! He listens to the community and their feedback, you can ask him questions, etc\n\nTL;DR\nThis demo is super fun, and if you want to support the dev while getting a taste of the game,i highly recommend you get it.", "timestamp_created": 1521285339, "timestamp_updated": 1521285339, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40870042": {"recommendationid": "40870042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044882687", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1521727561}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh boy, the full game is gonna be great!", "timestamp_created": 1521285250, "timestamp_updated": 1521285250, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40869005": {"recommendationid": "40869005", "author": {"steamid": "76561198114013240", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 59, "last_played": 1521624276}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10", "timestamp_created": 1521281789, "timestamp_updated": 1521281789, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40868301": {"recommendationid": "40868301", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043603644", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 99, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 99, "last_played": 1521728076}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing since the release (before steam), hands down the best bmx game around.

Instead of using the button based tricks of the Dave Mirra and Mat Hoffman games, PIPE uses the right analog stick to shift your weight or control the direction of the tricks, the triggers and bumpers controlling your feet and hands, left stick for steering and rotation, and the A button to pedal. Although the controls can be overwhileming when you first start the game up, that is part of the charm. Learning how to pull off different tricks and landing them smoothly is incredibly satisfying. \n\nThis game does feature a small tutorial, but the bulk of your time is probably going to be spent in the titular Pipe arena, which is a large half pipe with a few ramps and rails thrown around the outside of the park that can lead to some creative lines. I do wish the area was bigger, but there is still plenty of fun to be had just trying to come up with new lines, gaps, or just working on nailing the different tricks.\n\nIt is very very very important to mention that this is essentially a demo for the full game, so by purchasing this, you are supporting the developer and development of the upcoming BMX Streets game. Although there is only one park and the tutorial, there's still a lot of fun to be had here as long as you have the imagination. If you've read this far, it's probably worth a purchase for you.  \n\n\n***ORIGINAL REVIEW***\nIf you are really into BMX, this might be for you.\n\nAs a skater, a fan of extreme sports games, a person following Session, and a huge Skate series fan, I was kind of disappointed by this. I think the controls in this game offer the complexity you need for something like this, and learning how to do tricks, pump, pedalling, and setting up lines is extremely fun.\n\nThe reason for the thumbs down is the lack of content. I am aware that this is being pitched as a demo, but (apples and oranges, I know), the free Session demo offers about as much content as this does. The tutorial that is included is kind of unintuitive, which is the opposite of what a tutorial should be. After completing the first objective, it should just go straight to the next one. I could let that slide. What is a bummer is that the tutorial only teaches you the absolute fundamentals of the controls, and the in game menu doesnt show you how the trick system actually works. The screen is there, but all the controls are listed as N/A. \n\nI was able to look this up online and find videos of people playing another build of the game to solve that issue. That still doesn't excuse the lack of content for the asking price. The Pipe park has a giant half pipe that is fun to ride, but the rest of the park feels a bit bare. It has a few pyramids, some ledges, some rails, and a few quarter pipes, but after I did a few lines, I was left wanting a bit more.\n\nI think this game would geatly benefit from putting out a free demo.

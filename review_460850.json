While you won't be able to interact with anything, if you have the room-scale space you'll be able to move around inside of the movie, and view the presentation from many different angles. This is wonderful, because the little town in the sky that Allumette takes place in is lovingly crafted, and both the environment and the characters look like they're made out of clay; which brings back nostalgic feelings for the forgotten art of stop-motion animation.\n\nBetter than the animation and virtual aesthetics, the storytelling here is brilliant. Without going in to too much detail, so as not to spoil the story, Allumette revolves around a mother and her daughter, yet the daughter finds herself cold and alone near an alley under a bridge. The story unravels from there, and it's showcased with both day and night cycles, as well as bright colors. The entire emotional tale is told without so much as even one word of dialogue or narrative, to boot.\n\nIf you've got close to half an hour to kill, and you'd rather kick back and watch a story unfold in front of you rather than play a game, then give Allumette a chance. It has been free since its release in October 2016, so it's doubtful that it will ever be put up for sale. The publisher/developer, Penrose Studios, also created The Rose and I, so if you enjoy what you see here, make sure to give that free short-film a try as well.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\nThe Virtual Reality Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31311814/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thevirtualrealitynetwork]Group[/url] Click for More", "timestamp_created": 1512371938, "timestamp_updated": 1513695649, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38040644": {"recommendationid": "38040644", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966108344", "num_games_owned": 653, "num_reviews": 88, "playtime_forever": 17, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512326800}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great showcase/exploration of the potential VR has to tell stories.\n\nAs a story itself, it's just ok.

There are no options or strategies that make this program in any way a game. It is a very short, non verbal story experience. The beautiful characters and scenes look as if they could be rendered from brightly colored clay. The one ability the user does have in this world is to look around, focusing their attention on different parts of the scene and being able to peek inside buildings and through walls. The story itself can be experienced in 20-30 minutes, just as long as it would take one to read the short fairy tale of \u201cThe Little Match Girl\u201d that it is based on. [spoiler] Just like the fairy tale, this story is sad enough that you will cry into your Oculus Rift. I would recommend this for older children and above based on the art and sad ending. [/spoiler]\n\nReally, it was a beautiful looking piece of VR artwork. In order to be considered a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d as some have claimed I would expect a bit more originality in the story board and incorporation of VR features other than visuals and basic head movement. One has to stand for the duration of the movie as well, which took me some time to feel comfortable with and I also needed to take a break a few times. The occasional black or fuzzy input would displace my vision entirely from the scene and it did not seem to be coming from my end. With how happy, cheerful and bright the art is I found it hard to ultimately feel the hopeful tragedy being conveyed and instead felt a bit rushed and frustrated that this really isn't a game and I can't influence these characters to have a better outcome. Without any words some of the implications of the ending are completely lost in the consideration of loss itself. The story's use of VR fails to give it any modern understanding or complexity. I feel quite neutral about Allumette. I don't see any reason to avoid it, but can't give you a solid reason to play it other than the threat that it won't be free forever.", "timestamp_created": 1507040703, "timestamp_updated": 1507042564, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35412655": {"recommendationid": "35412655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135428146", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 20, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506943890}, "language": "german", "review": "Netter kleiner und gef\u00fchlvoller Kurzfilm.

It also all looks very nice from an art style perspective. Technically speaking, it looks blurry and runs terribly, but in terms of style, it has a nice physical feel to it.\n\nHowever, products like this either have to have a solid story, or excel at visuals to compensate.\nThis does not have a solid story. Everything is way too heavily foreshadowed, nothing's surprising and you're just waiting for it to go through the motions. It gives it a slow dragging feel to the pacing, emphasised by the credits that end like 30 seconds before the film fades to black, so you're just standing there looking at the environment you've been staring at for almost the entire film.\nThe characters are flat 2D placeholders. The heroic caring mother who can do no wrong and the carefree child who doesn't know how to share. There's no feeling that there's anything going on in their lives. I don't actually have any idea what they do. I think they sell sticks? Their lives are a mystery to me because they don't do anything involving their own internal motivations other than the ones prescribed by their archetypes. There's nothing there beyond the surface.\n\nAlso sometimes their actions and motivations are hindered by ... forgetfulness? i don't know, but someone on sound design or animation supervising should have made note that if a crowd can't hear someone because something's being too loud... maybe you should be able to hear what's being too loud. I know that sound was occuring earlier, but when it was really needed, it was silent.\n\nI think i'm so harsh on this because I genuinely see a lot of cool ideas here. this could have been great, but as it is, it's something for other animators to look at and learn from. Learn from the good parts and pick out the bad.\n\nI recommend it since it's free, but I personally wouldn't pay for this.", "timestamp_created": 1476917363, "timestamp_updated": 1476917363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26119967": {"recommendationid": "26119967", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970392008", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513447965}, "language": "german", "review": "Wundersch\u00f6ne Erfahrung.

Look i get it, I'd be wary too but let me reassure you of a few things before you make any rash decisions.\n\nFor starters you're already getting 65%-75% of the product, all that's remaining is the final 3rd episode consisting of 11 levels, additional endless mode arena and a solid build of DuskWorld multi-player which is currently available in it's beta stage. That's not all either, Dusk will launch with achievements, trading cards and leaderboards as well!\n\nConsider this, if you purchase the game in it's current state you could very well be helping with the funding of future content and maybe even a sequel? who knows! I know I'd be down for one. There are already plans for post launch which include a co-op mode, an SDK and Steam Workshop functionality. We could possibly even see some mission packs, who doesn't like mission packs?!\n\nNow as to the existing content? it's fun as hell and totally nails the look and feel of a mid-90's FPS. With polygonal models, full 3D handcrafted level design and a killer soundtrack you'll feel transported back to a time before warfare was modern and your health never regenerated. Dusk is absolutely a love letter to Quake mixed with some Blood and Redneck Rampage aesthetics. All the hallmarks you've come to expect from a retro shooter are right here!\n\nYou want an assortment of badass weaponry? you got'em!\nYou want key cards? you got 'em\nYou want secrets? you got'em!\nYou want power-ups? you got'em!\n\nThis isn't some rogue-like procedurally generated nonsense. It's the real deal!\n\nSo what are you waiting for? It's time to lock and load and get your frag on.\n\nDOPEFISH LIVES!", "timestamp_created": 1516234941, "timestamp_updated": 1516235166, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39422178": {"recommendationid": "39422178", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042369831", "num_games_owned": 422, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 439, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 439, "last_played": 1516237088}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the game I've been waiting for ever since Devil Daggers rekindled my love for fast FPS.

Doom 2016!) and a rudimentary physics engine that is very useful both in combat and exploration.\nIt's also very polished for an early accessed title, with very few bugs.

No story, no over the top action cinematics, not very much dialogue & most importantly no taking away the players control for a terrible scripted event.\n\nDusk takes a lot of inspiration from old time classics like Wolfenstein, DOOM, Blood & Duke Nukem, you now have Dusk! There's barely any variation from these influences, it feels exactly like these games did but in a more modernised attempt at recreating them.\n\nDusk has everything from these old classic titles such as easter eggs to old time movies & video games, references from old movies & video games, good ol' classic old school FPS fast paced action & a plethora of different hidden secrets scattered throughout the maps with lots of goodies in them if you can find them all!\n\n[h1][b]The Gameplay:[/b][/h1]\nGameplay from Dusk is simple, you are an unnamed person, out to kill a bunch of different enemies which have really no background. You are there to kill them just because they stand in your way. There's small snippets of story in between chapters but just like in DOOM it's few and far between and only gives you a very minor amount of detail as to what you're doing there and why.\n\nThe game starts you off right in the deep end (just like DOOM did all those years ago) putting you in a dark cave, with no explaination as to why, you have got 3 chainsaw weilding maniacs running at you and you've gotta fend them off with only your Sickles.\n\nThroughout each of the maps there's many hidden places for you to hunt down & unlock, each of them contains something to aid the player throughout the campaign, whether it be a weapon, ammo, armour, a heath item or (of course) hidden powerups that give the player temporary buffs. Some of these hidden places contain subtle hints to old time classic video game titles & movies. (If you were a gamer in the 90's or a movie watcher in the 80's you'll pick up these right away.)\n\nWhile Dusk takes heavy inspiration from 90's shooters it also has it's own modern gameplay mechanics too. Players can utilize the environment as weapons, for example if a player picks up an item such as a saw blade you can then hurl this & other items at an enemy and it will practically insta gib them, you also have an option to weapon zoom to take pot shots at distant enemies, jump & crouch, etc.\n\nThere's just so much to love about the gameplay of this game that I could talk about it for ages, however it's time to move on.\n\n[h1][b]The Verdict:[/b][/h1]\nDusk is a fantastic attempt at recreating the feel of a classic FPS game but giving the game it's own flavour & of course matching modern mechanics with classic mechanics.\n\nThere's so much that Dusk gets correct, everything from the feel of the game to the asthetic of it is perfect. The game looks great & has many customizable options to make it looks more retro, if you're not happy enough with the retro look you can go super retro with filters that give the game more jaggies, turn off mouse look, and even different colour tones if you want it darker, lighter, monotone, etc. The player tailoring customizations are incredible.\n\nDusk gets an A for effort in its attempt at recreating the feel, look and gameplay of classic FPS shooters from yester year, it gets a lot right & honestly I haven't really got any gripes with the game. The only thing I can REALLY say that I have a gripe with is that sometimes some of the secrets feel like they're a bit rushed & just placed in the map because they needed to fill their secret quota. (Sometimes you'll come across a secret within a secret too often.)\n\n[h1][b]Recommendation?:[/b][/h1]\nSo with ALL that I've said can I recommend this game? It's safe for me to say I can easily recommend this game, \n\nI'm having a blast with Dusk & I can't say that I regret buying this title at all. I love these kinds of games & I think I'll be coming back to Dusk quite a lot in the future!\n\n[h1][b]Closing Remarks:[/b][/h1]\nOnly a few things I can say here and those would be, I hope that the developer keeps on releasing content for this game in the future or gives the community the ability to create user content (Just like Quake & DOOM did) so that this game continues to thrive for years to come. If DOOM can be released in 1993 & STILL be active with a very strong community then this game can be the same in 20 years time with the right commitments from the community & developer alike.\n\nKeep up the awesome work David, really hope to see more of these kinds of games from you in the future!", "timestamp_created": 1516176003, "timestamp_updated": 1516176409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583896", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39381094": {"recommendationid": "39381094", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123039885", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 95, "last_played": 1516232597}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a great game i wasent around in the 90's or early 2000's but i really enjoy this game defently one of my fave games alreddy in the past few years 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1516074548, "timestamp_updated": 1516074548, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529400", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39381016": {"recommendationid": "39381016", "author": {"steamid": "76561198296379786", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 153, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "last_played": 1515913201}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is basically doom+quake+evil dead, with a sprinkling of half life, and it came out 5 days ago.\nif the indie gaming community is kicking off 2018 with this gem, i have a feeling that this is going to be a good year for gamers.", "timestamp_created": 1516074196, "timestamp_updated": 1516074196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506160", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39379757": {"recommendationid": "39379757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198194927381", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 356, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 366, "last_played": 1516239134}, "language": "english", "review": "Is a really awsome shooter,if you want some 90s top of the line gore and smooth gameplay like the old days.\nYOU MUST PLAY THIS PIECE OF ART!

As a seasoned veteran of the 90s FPS genre, with games such as *inhales deeply* Doom, Doom II, Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition, all of Duke's expansions, Shadow Warrior, all of SW's expansions, Blood, Final Doom (both TNT and Plutonia), Quake, Quake II, Heretic, Hexen, Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel, Unreal Gold, Half-Life, Half-Life 2 and probably some others that I'm forgetting *exhales* I can say that this game without a doubt brings back that sweet, sumptuous feel of classic, fast-paced shooter action we FPS vets have been so dreaming of since that golden era came and went.\n\nStarting with the devs themselves; while I have not met them personally, I have seen interviews with them (a group of anywhere between 3-6 people I believe is correct), and heard testimonies of those who have met them, and they sound like a right fine group of people: Extremely responsive and talkative with their fans and fellow 90s shooter fanatics, open to criticism and have an extremely sarcastic sense of humor at times. Always a plus to see devs that care as much about the community as they do about their product.\n\nNow, onto the game. Similar to Doom, DUSK is being released episodically. If you pre-ordered the game before Christmas last year, you got the first episode, The Foothills, along with Endless Arena 1, a small arena where you face a never-ending swarm of baddies until you are killed (called The Farm I think). Recently, New Blood Interactive released the second episode, The Facilities, which is leaps and bounds superior to the first episode in terms of level design and overall fun factor...NOT to say that Episode 1 was bad by any means, but after playing through Episode 2, it becomes clear that the level design has been worked on quite considerably. Every level feels different, visceral and some even horrifying. To add one last note here, per NBI's entry on the game's store page, if you pre-ordered the game before Christmas, you will also get a FREE UPGRADE to the Digital Deluxe Edition, which will include the full OST along with a digital comic!\n\nThe weapons? Just what you'd expect from a game such as this; a pistol which can be wielded akimbo once you find a second one, a Winchester 1887-esque lever-action shotgun which can also be wielded akimbo once you find another one (which looks and sounds SO SATISFYING to use by the way), a Super Shotgun a la Doom II and Quake, so on and so forth, an Assault Rifle (which to me looks more like an LMG of some sort, but I split hairs), a pair of scythes and a magical halberd-style sword which function as your melee weapons (including a nifty, super-powerful special attack from the sword if you have 100 or more HP), a Hunting Rifle which has a nice zoom and is devastating if accurately fired (protip: you may not have used the HR too much in Episode 1...you WILL change that in Episode 2...use it against the Welders), a Heretic-inspired Crossbow which fires penetrating, phallically-shaped, glowing, green arrows at enemies which can be shot through walls and other enemies, giving the potential for massive chain kills if enemies are lined up correctly, a Mortar with grenades that, while slow, can be remotely detonated with the RMB, and the Riveter, this game's homage to the Rocket Launcher of old, which fires metallic, explosive-tipped rivets with a very satisfying metallic \"clank\" noise and can absolutely DEVASTATE bosses and crowds of weaker baddies. Also, a cigar which you can smoke to slowly regenerate your health, because why not, right?\n\nThe enemies? Just as varied as the weapons. Weaker enemies at first, followed by bigger, badder ones (especially in the second episode), and even a fair amount of boss battles to add a little varied spice to the game. The Riveter will make short work of just about any of them.\n\nThe music? Ohhhhhhhhhh my goodness, the music...Andrew Hulshult is a video game music GENIUS. Tracks can vary from outright spooky to headbangingly metal. Seriously, play E2M6 (The Erebus Reactor) at your own risk...if you're anything like me, you'll be too busy jamming to the most deliciously metal track you've ever heard in a video game to focus on gunning down the massive room full of enemies and might find yourself stupidly getting killed a couple to few times because of it. NO SHAME! OST must be released NOW!\n\nSo, to summarize, while not perfect, this game is probably as close to a TRUE 90s FPS throwback as we're going to see for quite a while (and New Blood are publishing another, more Hexen/Heretic-inspired shooter as well called Amid Evil which I am definitely keeping on my wishlist!), and I cannot wait for the third episode, The Nameless City (Quake I reference!) to come out, along with the fully-developed multiplayer...and to top it all off, NBI even said they will have DEDICATED SERVERS, MAH BOIS!\n\nIf you are in any way a fan of the classic FPS genre (Doom, Quake, etc., but mostly Quake due to the fast-paced bunnyhopping you can easily do), then you will absolutely not regret getting this game; I can't recommend it enough!\n\nOh, and one last thing? There's a bar of soap in this game that you can throw at enemies...FEAR THE SOAP!*\n\n*Because it does TEN MILLION points of damage, according to the Dusk Wiki. Ten. Million. Bosses beware.

Sie l\u00e4uft auf der Unity Engine und mal ganz ehrlich, in diesem Spiel geht es nicht um die Grafik sondern ums Gameplay welches einfach unfassbar fantastisch ist.\n\nDas Gameplay erinnert stark an die oben genannten Titel (Bunnyhopping, Rocketjumps inclusive!). Das Spiel bietet wie bei Doom oder Quake etc. 3 Episoden (Early Acess Version Episode 1 + 2), ein sehr gelungenen Multiplayer namens \"Duskworld\" und 2 verschiedene Endless Modes. Wie auch bei den oben genannten Spielen hat Dusk selbstverst\u00e4ndlich auch ein sehr gro\u00dfes Waffenarsenal. Das Hauptaugenmerk geht aber auf das \"Weapon Flipping\" :D (Also an die Entwickler wer sich das ausgedacht hat verdient alleine daf\u00fcr einen Gaming Award^^) \n\nEinzige Manko an dem Spiel ist der Multiplayer. Ich habe das Problem wenn ich auf einen Server joine (obwohl Spieler angeblich drauf sind) keine Spieler auf dem Server hab. Dieses Problem tritt nur manchmal auf aber ich weiss das ist ja alles noch im EA. Das wird sicherlich alles behoben da bin ich mir sicher!\n\nAlles in allem ist DUSK ein sehr sehr sehr nostalgiehaltiger Retro Shooter, der f\u00fcr jeden ein MUSS ist, der Doom, Quake etc. liebt! F\u00fcr 20\u20ac wird einem sehr viel geboten.

The gameplay involves exploring maze-like levels finding health and armor pickups, weapons, ammo, and of course enemies to use them on. Although the gameplay is most similar to Quake or Doom, the combat also feels a bit like Painkiller, perhaps due to the aesthetics and open arenas you occasionally battle big groups of enemies in. The game doesn't lock you into arenas you can't escape like that game does, though: you're usually free to retreat and lure your enemies into a choke point and mow them down as they come through, if that's your thing.\n\nThere are no hitscanning enemies, so those who hated for example the chaingunners in Doom 2 can breathe a sigh of relief. Enemies' projectiles can be dodged easily by circle strafing, but being surrounded can be deadly: combat on higher difficulties is quite demanding.\n\nDusk includes interactive environments akin to Duke Nukem 3D and some humorous superfluous features such as spinning your weapons, eating food, activating sinks, toilets and showers or smoking a cigar. Try throwing the soap at your enemies, if you can find it.\n\nThe multiplayer is enjoyable, but it could be a bit of a brutal experience for a new player, as is generally the case in older FPS games. If you don't mind dying a lot, you'll like it.\n\nIn conclusion: if you enjoy classic 90s FPS games, you'll surely like Dusk as well. If this is not the case, this game isn't likely to change your mind, but it's worth a shot regardless in my opinion.", "timestamp_created": 1516019950, "timestamp_updated": 1516019950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39362039": {"recommendationid": "39362039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198246649084", "num_games_owned": 741, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "last_played": 1516122433}, "language": "schinese", "review": "DOOM\u7248\u751f\u5316\u5371\u673a", "timestamp_created": 1516014522, "timestamp_updated": 1516014522, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39361348": {"recommendationid": "39361348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198036227449", "num_games_owned": 267, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "last_played": 1516081688}, "language": "english", "review": "The game is overrated but far from bad. I think people tend to forget what top-tier FPS games should actually be like after playing years and years of derivative \"cinematic\" and open world shooters. From a purely mechanical standpoint, it's flawless, and the weapons and enemies are some of the best I've seen in a shooter like this.\n\nThat being said, the level design can get pretty horrendous at times. Like Doom 2 Downtown levels of bad. Many levels in this game don't capitalize on verticality like games like Quake did. One of the maps is even a maze in a mineshaft, with zero landmarks, which was hell for me to get around and complete, and was annoying as hell attempting to evade enemy attacks in the tight corridors.\n\nMany dark areas that require the flashlight are also a big issue. I don't know why this game needs the flashlight mechanic in the first place. There are plenty of shooters with dark atmosphere that don't need pitch black areas that require the use of equipment. It's just annoying, and can be a nightmare if you bring the FOV up as much as I did, which reduces the radius of your flashlight dramatically and makes it near impossible to see.\n\nThe core of a lot of these levels are essentially large fields with houses dotted around the map for you to run in between to grab keys and whatnot from. Many of these houses are designed realistically rather than something that would be good for a game with this kind of movement system. So half the time you'll be awkwardly strafejumping around the map and the other half you'll be going from generic room to generic room for enemies, weapons, and keys. The environment itself also rarely poses a threat to the player. There are some acid puddles but no lava or bottomless pits to watch out for.\n\nOne other glaring issue is the rats. Their hitboxes are small as fuck and they're annoying with the chip damage they do in swarms. They remind me of the bugs in Daikatana and that's no fuckin good.\n\nAnother issue would also be the bosses. They require no skill or strategy, and have no tells or weaknesses. Most of the time they'll be turned around, and with no indication whatsoever, they'll do a 180 and fire a bullshit attack at you, so the boss encounters end up being \"strafe and jump and shoot\" which is essentially what I'm already doing with arena encounters anyway. These bosses dont test my skills whatsoever, and are basically bullet sponges to pad out the game. They don't even have weaknesses.\n\nSo basically, yeah, there's a good game at the core here.\n-If you want to try a more traditional FPS, buy it. If you've got rose-tinted glasses on when it comes to shooters of the past, buy it. \n-If you play too many shitty current-year shooters and need a humble palette cleanse, buy it. \n-If you're like me and play metric fucktons of old FPSes in their downtime, wait for a sale or pirate and buy it if you like it.\n\nSo I guess it'd be a reccomend from me, though with heavy emphasis on a sale, because the game is rather short, which combined with the other flaws doesn't give you as much bang for your buck. You have to realize that a purchase of Dusk at full price is equal to like 5-10 other real old school shooters on steam.", "timestamp_created": 1516011860, "timestamp_updated": 1516012505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39360080": {"recommendationid": "39360080", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966882693", "num_games_owned": 2259, "num_reviews": 143, "playtime_forever": 280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 280, "last_played": 1516249984}, "language": "english", "review": "A fantastic throwback to the FPS of the 90's, filled with retro graphics, tons of great weapons and top notch level design, great controls and an incredible soundtrack.

Not perfectly, but closer than most have cared to get.\n\nDUSK leaves the base gameplay mechanics of 90s shooters mostly untouched. It adds a few nice-to-have features like crouch-sliding, unlocked y-axis for flips in the air and in the water, zooming (the Quake 3 kind, not ADS), and some different weapon types. But instead of replacing the core gameplay of something like Quake 1, it adds to it instead. Strafe jumping is kinda here, but it's simplified. Essentially, any time you're moving on a diagonal, you move faster. Jumping diagonally lets you build your speed up to the ridiculous levels you're used to seeing in these kinds of shooters. Anyone who's played these games will be at home after a little adjustment, though don't expect speedrun depth on the level of other shooters.\n\nThe graphics are low poly, but work has been done to make it look like the eerie, decayed style of Quake 1 instead of the standard low-effort stuff you see in a number of indie games that don't have a style outside of looking blocky. Even with the intentionally dated graphics, it has this dark, oppressive atmosphere that can go straight to horror at times and make you jump. You're not ready for the Wendigo. I guarantee it. Also, make sure to turn on the limited palette.\n\nThe soundtrack is great. Andrew Hulshult does a great job of making a soundtrack that's ambient and unnerving at times, which shifts to metal in tense combat situations or entire levels if it fits. It's great stuff and really makes the game stand out. \n\nLevel design is pretty good. While Episode 1 is a little basic, it's definitely fun and has everything you'd expect in a game like this. Find the keys, kill the dudes, backtrack a little, find secrets, you probably know the drill by now. Episode 2 takes a massive leap. Maps are larger, more creative, stranger, and overall a lot more fun. Without spoiling anything, E2M5 will throw a curveball. I'll just say that it's one of the best levels I've played in a shooter in a while. The rest of the package is great as well.\n\nLastly, the multiplayer is somewhat rough right now, which is likely my only real complaint. A lot of features you'd expect in an MP game aren't there yet (fleshed out server browser, map variety, other minor stuff that adds up) but this is to be expected given how there's only one dedicated developer who's more focused on making the singleplayer as strong as possible. As a result, the MP isn't fully formed yet, but it's still fun to play. Just don't make it your main focus quite yet. I'll update this review as it gets more fleshed out. And seriously, buff the mortar. It's not even good in SP and useless in MP.\n\nThat's about all I have to say about DUSK. It really is that good. The singleplayer is already worth it and I can't wait to see what David Syzmanski has in store for Episode 3. If you have a remote interest in old school shooters, play this now.

"last_played": 1516228252}, "language": "english", "review": "DUSK, is developed by David Szymanski and it's a throwback to the days of Doom and Quake.\n\nRight of the bat you can tell that the developer absolutely loves old school fps games, no hiding behind cover, no reloading, fast paced movement etc.\nThe game starts off in a room with no explanation and 3 masked chainsaw wielding guys, from that point on the game is almost a non stop shooting fest.\n\n\nThe game is designed to look and play like a 90's FPS, the levels aren't just a bunch of randomized rooms with enemies walking towards you, the levels in the first episode are small but complex.\nTo complete the levels you are mostly required to find a bunch of keys to open doors or pulling a switch to progress to the next area and solving a puzzle every so often all while shooting down everything that walks in your path.\n\n\nThe game has a good variety of weapons some of which can be dual wielded, you have the pistols, shotguns, super shotgun, assault rifle, hunting rifle, crossbow, mortar and the Riveter.\nAnd honestly no weapon is bad and each weapon feels unique and has it's own place.\nOut of all these weapons the hunting rifle is my favourite because of it's high damage and slow fire rate.\nThere are power-up's as well for example, there is a power which increases your rate of fire for a short period, combine this with the assault rifle and you got yourself a slaughterhouse.\n\n\nThe movement feels like Quake but cranked up, for example after a few jumps you will be able to strafe around the level at maximum speed which feels awesome oh and you're able to do a 180 degree backflip, how cool is that?\n\n\nThe second episode however changes things up a bit, in a good way the levels are still complex but a lot larger and more open.\n\nThe second episode also introduces some new enemies and gets rid of some older ones as well as some new power-up's.\nOut of all of these enemies  the 'welder' is the most common one and my favourite one as well,\nhe is a large opponent wielding some sort of machine gun which shoots fireballs and he can be taken care of easily with one shot from the hunting rifle or a couple of blasts from the shotguns.\nOne of these power-up's allows you to climb quite literally everything, making it easier to reach some secrets or to get a better spot to shoot your enemies.\nThe other one is where the game changes to Superhot for a short period, meaning that time only moves when you do.\nThis power up was fun to use but not really all that useful in my opinion.\n\n\nNow the main problem with these game for me were the boss battles, they are easy to kill and even easier to exploit as well. \nEspecially the battle with Big John, he gave me a heart attack which resulted in me spamming the Riveter while he was still in the corridor which took him down in a few seconds pretty much skipping the fight all together.\nThe only things that I'd like to see different in episode 3 are harder boss battles and maybe nerf the Riveter a bit in terms of fire rate.\nThose are really the only issue I have with the game everything other than that is just perfect for me.\nThe developers pretty much just flipped their middle finger at modern FPS games, no loot boxes, no 60 euro season pass.\nThis game is everything it promises to be, a kick ass throwback to the good days of Doom, Quake, Blood and Wolfenstein.\n\nSo if you are a fan of old school FPS games make sure to pick this game up, it's currently in early access with 2 playable episodes and the Duskworld multiplayer.\n\n\nComing to a verdict I feel like this game deserves a 9.5 out of 10.\nThis is one of the most promising titles of 2018 so far and definitely a must have for FPS fans.\nIt proves that a team of a few people can do way better than mass budget companies without lootboxes or expansion passes for no more than 20 euros.", "timestamp_created": 1515963316,

At the time of writing this, two out of three episodes are available, and while you can technically speedrun through them quickly - there is plenty of content to merit the price tag. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Butter smooth to play, and it's all just so much fun.\n+While I see some minor artistic cohesion issues - the theme is unique and works well.\n+The sound effects and soundtrack work really well.\n+Tons of settings and options.\n+Price-point is good.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-While the devs are great in interacting with the community - the community itself is toxic. They cannot take criticism at all. I watched [strike]two[/strike] three negative reviews get run right off Steam (were these valid reviews? I'm not judging that, they paid their money and left their 2cents). Deleted. From the absolutely cruel and abusive comments those reviews recieved, I will assume that was the driving force.\n-During my first few playthroughs, there were too many moments where I got confused on where to go in a level, and it was just an awkward break in the action. I thought I was alone with this, but another friend later said he had they same issue (and he actually refunded).\n-If you are looking for a modern FPS with modern bells-and-whistles, I think you probably will be slightly disapointed. Not anything wrong with this per-se, but you should know.\n\n[b]If you liked [i]Duke Nukem[/i], the original [i]Shadow Warrior[/i], [i]Quake[/i] or really any of those classic mid-90s FPS games, you [i]need[/i] to get [i]DUSK[/i].[/b] It's great.", "timestamp_created": 1515956343, "timestamp_updated": 1515958733, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717139", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39346339": {"recommendationid": "39346339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029317307", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 120, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 120, "last_played": 1516136461}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un hermoso trabajo que rescata la escencia de los clasicos shooter. realmente una sopresa y un regalo a la nostalgia para quienes llevamos a\u00f1os amando este genero. totalmente recomendado", "timestamp_created": 1515956309, "timestamp_updated": 1515956309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39345699": {"recommendationid": "39345699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075688900", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 240, "last_played": 1515954314}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041c\u044f\u0441\u043e \u0438 \u0430\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0441\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 Blood + \u0434\u0440\u0430\u0439\u0432 Quake = Dusk\n\n\u0414\u043b\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0445 \u043a\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0438\u043d\u043e-\u043c\u043e\u0437\u0433\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0448\u0443\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c - \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043e\u0431\u044f\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e!\n\n\"Another day another corpse.\"", "timestamp_created": 1515954857, "timestamp_updated": 1515954857, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39345364": {"recommendationid": "39345364", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995194702", "num_games_owned": 635, "num_reviews": 182, "playtime_forever": 18, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 18, "last_played": 1515926823}, "language": "czech", "review": "V posledn\u00ed dob\u011b je v m\u00f3d\u011b odkazovat na star\u00e9 dobr\u00e9 hry.

The premise is simple, it's what you wanted STRAFE to be. It does feel like DOOM, maybe not as good as DOOM 2016 but, it does feel like arena shooters of old. Somewhat maze like levels, less mazy than DOOM 1 and 2, a variety of weapons at your disposal too.\n\nOne thing that's severely lacking is good death animations, I wanna see people get shredded and destroyed but the only 2 death animations are A: fall over and die, or B: turn into a bloody pulp. I love a good death animation, especially in my arena shooters. This, simply doesn't have them. When you hit someone with a sniper I expect their head to come off, or at least something, they just look like they're a kid getting hit with a nerf dart and then going \"ah\" before falling over.\n\nThe only performance problem with this game is poor optimisation, on my GTX1080 and 6700K with none of the base graphics settings changed it often has FPS drops, skipped frames and often can't handle more than 8 projectile enemies at one time. It doesn't seem that graphically demanding at all... So what's the deal?\n\nGuess it's just what happens when you get early access games, no biggie. The movement feels very good, very responsive, strafe jumping is pretty easy but at least it's there and makes you move around the map very quickly.\n\nGunplay is spot on, would like a bit more responsiveness from enemies as some are basically bullet sponges, they don't flinch or anything when shot, you just get a little squirt of blood from them, which isn't very exciting.\n\nBoss battles are a nice addition, they don't have much strategy, or multiple stages or anything, but at least they're there.\n\nI recommend raising the difficulty, there wasn't one time on the normal difficulty where I actually felt somewhat threatened by my enemies, the lowest my health has gotten on normal has been 35hp, it makes the activity feel like a leisure, rather than a challenge. \n\nI do recommend this game, probably not for $20 maybe $15 for your moneys worth so far. There's still a third chapter in the works, It's not as good or interesting as DOOM 2016, but it's definitely better than your other alternatives, like brutal doom, old quakes and things.\n\nIf you like arena shooters, go for it. But bring the difficulty up. Also keep in mind things can change, early access after all.\n\nAlso an added mention, they're gonna add mod support with the workshop and an SDK in future, so that's really cool. Maybe make some horror maps, parkour, campaigns and things.

Durden to shame.[/spoiler]\n\n4: Fantastic level design (Majorish spoiler, as I consider the next part to be a good portion of the fun) [spoiler]which is pretty solid and normal in episode 1 but in episode 2 does a cocaine pile big enough to rival Tony Montana in that it keeps getting more ridicious and fantastic with each level.[/spoiler]\n\nAnd finally 5: From what I've heard, a pretty faithful and pretty damn good dev team.\n\nEasily the best early access I've played and possibly my GOTY for 2018 already (because you have to do a lot to rival the fun I've had with this game thus far), if you've got 20 bucks and nothing to do and you enjoy running at cheetah speeds to your enemies with the stupidest of guns rather then hiding behind cover with pea shooters, check it out,

Dusk is now in early access with Duskworld release to the public.\n\nThe game plays like an old 90s shooter if put in a source port. In english term it's classic FPS controls with a modern spin on it instead of enforcing the old MSDOS style of controls (also what's funny is that you can make the game look like it's running in DOS). I guess that can be customized for those who like it that was. The controls are responsive, shooting enemies is satisfying as hell, the bosses while simple are a damn fun challenge (especially Big John). The story as simple as it is, paying homage to the likes of the original Doom, and it works. plus who wants to deal with annoyingly forced scripted events, Quick-time events, and a garbage narrative ala the crappy COD clones of the early 2010s. \n\nEpisode 1 is fun, with it's awesome Redneck Rampage and Blood inspiration to it, musical score and kickass level design and boss fights. I think I'll be regarding episode one of DUSK as my equivalent to the shareware version of Doom that a lot of people had who'd play the living daylights out of Knee Deep In The Dead, because playing the first episode of Dusk feels the same way to me. Episode 2 is a major change from episode 1 in a good way with it's industrial themed, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Half Life 1 inspired scenario until the end. Also dissimilar to episode one, for me at least, episode 2 felt more challenging to me, I got my ass wooped more than normal than I did in episode one and NO I don't mean this as a negative, I like it, I'm being challenged by the game. Either that or I'm a masochistic boob who likes pain. Either one will do.\n\nDuskworld as fun too, a little rickity with some stupid spawns that get you spawn killed but still fun.\n\nThe soundtrack is... MMM... SO GOOD. Andrew Hulshult is a damn good as what he does best: making some heart pumping tunes.\n\nMozel Tov to David Szymanski, and the guys at new blood for this amazing experience of a video game. I look forward to future Duskworld updates and the soon to come nameless city (episode 3). Dusk to me will go down as the Doom of my generation (coming out of someone who wasn't alive when the original doom came out) as a guy who followed it in it's early annoucements, loved seeing the previews and falling in love with the preview build that I got to play after pre ordering the game. In a similar but different process that classic doom fans went through 25 years ago. And as much as I loved Doom 4 (and people might hate me for this), Dusk feels more like a more dedicated and more accurate love letter to what makes a classic 90s style FPS fun.", "timestamp_created": 1515904865, "timestamp_updated": 1515904865, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39327814": {"recommendationid": "39327814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020892211", "num_games_owned": 554, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 173, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 173, "last_played": 1516234359}, "language": "english", "review": "I saw this game at PAX West 2016 in the far-less-crowded indie section, and and this booth was still bustling but a demo reel was playing on a big screen and I desperately wanted to get my hands on this action, but despite not remembering why I didn't get a chance to actually play.

Not yet. Maybe once the third episode has been released, but until then it's over too quickly.\n\nDusk certainly feels like an authentic 90's shooter. The nostalgia isn't enough to carry the game alone, but fortunately the main package is entertaining enough that it doesn't have to.\nThe levels are, for the most part, well designed. There were a few difficulty spikes here and there but not enough to become frustrating. I was a little disappointed with the lack of urban environments though. Once you reach the town of Dusk the first chapter ends rather abruptly and the second chapter takes place in more science fictiony type environments. This is a bit of a shame because the Lovecraftian story lends itself well to a Silent Hill crossed with Stephen King's The Mist type of plot and it could have really benefitted from a modern real world setting.\n\nThe weapons are mainly functional, satisfying enough but nothing to write home about. I did like the railgun style crossbow that shoots through both enemies and walls and the leaver action shotguns were a blast to use. The double barrel shotgun and hunting rifle were a little bit on the dull side in comparison, and the \"riviter\" (rocket launcher) felt a tad overpowered.\n\nPowerups are fun, although one in particular I suspect will be an aquired taste. The \"Superhot\" slow motion powerup is not particularly useful and can get in the way. You have to stand still for it to work which is entirely antithetical to how the game had played up until that point, and you don't fire any faster than the enemy when you're using it. It does give you time to line up shots, but in the cramped environments in which it tends to appear that's not particularly useful.\n\nMultiplayer is, at this time, extremely early access so I won't comment much on that. The deathmatch mode on offer feels rather derivative and doesn't really add anything new. The one server I could get a game on (the others kept bugging out on me) was running a single map back to back, so after 15 or so minuets I was pretty much done.\n\nEndless Mode (survival) feels like an after thought. Currently there are two maps available, with a third on the way. Of the two playable I felt one (the factory) was a little dull and too cramped to be enjoyable.\nThe core mechanic is pretty simple. Enemies spawn in, kill enemies for points, don't die. If the maps were more dynamic and engaging this could have been more interesting, but as it stands it's at best a brief distraction.\n\nFor me the main draw for Dusk is the single player campaign. At the moment two of three chapters are playable, and they're pretty good. The second is lightly weaker than the first and feels a bit on the generic side, mainly taking place in dingy, brown and gray industrial and military complexes. I loved the Lovecraftian bits, but they were too few and far between.\n\nI'm in two minds. I want to recommend this game, but I cant. The campaign is great but not currently long enough to be satisfying. If the third episode lives up to the quality of the previous two I'll have no problem recommending Dusk, but until then it's probably best to hold off until full release.", "timestamp_created": 1515879704, "timestamp_updated": 1515879704, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535035", "comment_count": "10", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39320607": {"recommendationid": "39320607", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010010363", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "last_played": 1516140279}, "language": "english", "review": "Return to true FPS.", "timestamp_created": 1515878153, "timestamp_updated": 1515878153, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39320415": {"recommendationid": "39320415", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052795444", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 437, "last_played": 1516203027}, "language": "english", "review": "This game REALY needs achievements !!! )", "timestamp_created": 1515877615, "timestamp_updated": 1515877615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1515881345, "developer_response": "We'll have them at full launch!"}, "39319810": {"recommendationid": "39319810", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087590801", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 202, "last_played": 1515949306}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is super fun.

The New Blood's DUSK should be considered a master class in how to do a retro inspired FPS.  The title seems to take its inspiration from games such as Quake, Doom, Blood, and even Redneck Rampage.

The speed of movement, hectic gunfights, great level design, a very badass metal soundtrack ... it ticks all the right boxes for me.\n\nAt the time of writing this the game is in early access and currently comes with Episodes 1 & 2 as well as Duskworld the multiplayer component of the game.  Episode 3 will be coming at a later date ... and if the way it ratchets up from Episode 1 to 2 is any indication of what to expect in Episode 3 then things are gonna be NUTS!\n\nI've recently been playing some of the Duskworld multiplayer and while it also is still a work in progress it is quite fun.  It has the trappings of old school arena shoots.  Health armor and weapon pickups.  It has the same movement as in singleplayer so you can HUP up to quite impressive speeds. The result is yourself and your opponents whipping around the map at blinding speeds flipping twitch shots left and right trying to land the killshot.

following games-\nQuake\nBlood\nRedneck Rampage\nHalf Life\n\nWell, then you'll love Dusk. It is an old school first person shooter that, unlike many other shooter that claim to be old school actually is. It's not just the graphics, though- gameplay in every way reflects its origins and influences, with fast movement, no reloading, health pickups,and non linear level design. Control is fluid and intuitive and the art and level design is wonderful. Sound design (aside from the 'take damage' sound, not a fan) especially the wonderful music is fantastic and creates a great feeling.\n\nAs I write this review the first two episodes are available, and it's clear that the devs are lerning as they go along. The first episode was heaps of fun, and the second showed definite signs of them getting more confident with how they design their levels as things got much more interesting.\n\nDusk also has the potential to have a long life- the single player campaign gives you a lot of opportunity to explore, plus there's duskworld for those of you who enjoy deathmatch, endless mode which features you fighting off wave after wave of enemy (much more fun than it seems), and- very importantly- the full game will have mod support which will potentially give the game a huge amount of new content to play with (as it will use Quake 2 format maps).\n\nSo a definite recommend. It's $20 (and apparently always will be $20) and is well worth that small amount of money.

You dont really want to stay far away and be safe like in many modern shooters but to go in close and finish them off with the Supershotgun.\n\nSpeaking of the weapons: you can zoom with every weapon except the granade launcher which uses the right mousebutton to let the granades explode.\nThe weapon models are well made and sound very good. You really have the feeling you are shooting a gun and not some toy.\nWith 10 weapons you have a real wide variety of guns to use on the different enemies.\nThey range from shotguns to powerful hunting rifles and the devastating riveter.\n\nA wide arsenal of guns just makes sense if you have different types of enemies you can shoot with and DUSK provides them.\nYou start off against the weak melee enemies with chainsaws and at the end of episode 2 you face some really strong rocket shooting robots. They all look good and work well even if especially the moose like creatures often run against walls if they cannot find the direct way to the player.\nThe only enemy that really doesnt make fun is the stationary turret. It\u00b4s just standing there and shooting bullets which is pretty lame and in my opinion unecessary.\n\nIm not sure how should I rate the levels because there are some great ones like the first in episode 2 or ghost town in episode 1 but then there are some levels that i guess are supposed to be scary when your flashlight is broken but they just slow you down and leave the best parts of DUSK out. It\u00b4s just annoying to crouch down narrow ways to get a key.\nSo i hope the levels get more open stop trying to be scary in episode 3.\n\nTo be honest the game is really short and you might need just around 90 minutes for your first playthrough of one episode or even less if you know the levels.

That replayability is where DUSK shines you can just jump over the head of a cultist again and again shot dodge and it still feels good.

That app is now deleted as this main one now takes its place. Regardless\n\nDeveloped by David Symanski, with music composed by Andrew hulshult, and published by the tiny new blood interactive, dusk is a game with the express hope of kicking the modern shooter landscape in the gut and hightailing it back to the 90s. Its a game I've been watching over the past 2 years and its finally been bumped into early access, so let's talk about it.\n\nStory:\n\n\nStarting off with the least essential part of any game dusk follows your average unnamed protagonist through the town of dusk as he attempts to figure out what the heck is going.\n\nThere's little in the way of plot as story is told through short paragraphs of text and the visual clutter spattered about the environments, all echoing a greater narrative and it works. Its non intrusive whilst being intriguing in its own right and you constantly get the sense something deeper beyond your comprehension is afoot.\n\nPresentation:\nDusk is a game that attempts to not only harken back to the old gameplay of the 90s fps but also their visual style... And it does the latter quite lackingly. Whilst the game certainly looks like it could've been released in that timeframe the visual stylings are quite lacking. There's little use in comparing the visuals to quake as I feel it does that game a disservice, id software were limited with their tech at the time but it feels like despite that limitation they worked their butts off to make something that looked artistically pleasing, as if though it was more a stylistic choice rather than the limitations of technology. Rather dusk looks like someone with little to no artistic skills trying to do something similar which is basically the case through and through as the dev has claimed to be no artist. Ugly texture work, poorly done modeling, awful animations, they permeate throughout this game.\n\nThat's not to say the game is a complete dud in the presentation department. The game has amazing sound design, with crunchy guns, and spooky noises as well as an amazing soundtrack. Not to mention those elements combined with the lighting do no short work in making dusk rather atmospheric and spooky at times.\n\nTo add to that the only true time I'd consider a game's presentation to be negative is when there's clutter obscuring your vision with crap like motion blur particle effects dof and other schlock being smeared across the screen preventing you from playing and fortunately dusk has none of this. There's little in the way of visual crap and you can always tell what something is supposed to be, at least when you're supposed to that is.\n\nGameplay:\n\n\nBut obviously none of what I just said matters if the game isn't enjoyable to play which it is through and through. Dusk is a first person shooter in which you navigate intricately designed levels hunting for keys collecting weapons managing resources solving puzzles and fighting hordes of malicious opponents. \n\nThe movement feels fantastic, with glorious bunny hopping and a flowing sensation that makes it feel wonderful to control. There are a variety of utilitarian weapons all of which you carry at once and none of which you have to reload. Managing your ammo, health, and armor, accordingly, as for dispensation against hordes of interesting and fun enemy types prioritizing kinds and strategizing on the fly. Hunting for secrets allowing you to be better stocked and prepared for the fight ahead.\n\nIt's all wonderful and incredibly well designed. With some of the best and most memorable levels in all of gaming.\n\n\nIt's an amazing single player experience more than worth the 20$ admission price.\n\nMultiplayer:\n\n\nBut wait there's also multiplayer! And it's good... Yay. To be honest, I'm not a multiplayer guy, so this largely just comes down to it not being my cup of tea but suffice it to say if you love arena multiplayer this should serve ya fine.\n\nEndless:\n\n\nThe only other inclusion is the endless horde mode which is effectively the singleplayer's combat stripped back into a horde mode arena with levels set in locations from each of the games 3 episodes, and its just as enjoyable as the combat in the main game and great for just jumping in and wrecking ham.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\nDusk, in my opinion, is honestly the best fps game to have ever been released and I'm not exaggerating, with the prior best-being doom which this game more than tops in my opinion despite its lacking graphical prowess.

You'll thank me later..", "timestamp_created": 1515790828, "timestamp_updated": 1515790828, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39290555": {"recommendationid": "39290555", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987104069", "num_games_owned": 226, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 980, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 980, "last_played": 1516145772}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game, great singleplayer and great multiplayer, will have good modding (custom weapons, enemies and levels) eventually. only gripe is that the voice acting is really bad", "timestamp_created": 1515790108, "timestamp_updated": 1515790108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39290523": {"recommendationid": "39290523", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041886057", "num_games_owned": 892, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 217, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 217, "last_played": 1515848044}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Muito bom lembra pra caramba os doom antigos , shadow warrior e duken nuken...\nDusk \u00e9 aquele tipo de jogo de tiro frenetico com a aquele rock pesad\u00e3o.\n \nO jogo ir\u00e1 possuir 3 episodios , sendo que o 1 e 2 j\u00e1 est\u00e3o disponiveis e tamb\u00e9m tem um multiplayer(porem eu n\u00e3o testei ainda).\n\n\"EM BREVE UMA ANALISE MAIS DETALHADA...\"", "timestamp_created": 1515790030, "timestamp_updated": 1515790030, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.726141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39290080": {"recommendationid": "39290080", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015288333", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 386, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 386, "last_played": 1516131514}, "language": "german", "review": "was soll ich sagen^^ ich kann leider nicht objektiv bleiben!!!! ich bin verliebt es ist wirklich retro shooter at its best.....\n\nalleine shotgun aufheben und es steht dick und breit GROOVY im bild ob gewollt oder nicht ich habe mich gefreut^^", "timestamp_created": 1515788820, "timestamp_updated": 1515788820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39290058": {"recommendationid": "39290058", "author": {"steamid": "76561197985536821", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1884, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1884, "last_played": 1515937414}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Ensimm\u00e4isen levelin l\u00e4p\u00e4isyn j\u00e4lkeen mit\u00e4 mainiointa wanhan koulukunnan r\u00e4iskint\u00e4\u00e4.

I have already beaten both the first and second episodes and put in some decent time to the endless arenas, around 76 or so hours total if I recall correctly.\n\nDusk looks, feels and plays like an oldschool 90s FPS on steroids. The movement feels tight, the weapons feel and sound like they have a big impact even if they don't necessarily (looking at you, pistols,) and the enemies are familiar yet new in designs and roles. The Leathernecks and Wizards for instance could be considered the two parts of a whole Imp from Doom while the Welders from Episode 2's first level and onwards are more akin to the Enforcer of Quake 1, however some enemies such as the Forkmaiden and Black Phillip use familiar ideas in a way that basically makes them brand new offerings unique to Dusk. The Black Phillip has a quick small spit attack but will always gallop towards you fairly fast in an attempt to ram/bite you to death, for example, but it's one of the weakest if not the weakest enemy in the game and thus always comes in packs of 2 or more.\n\nBoth episodes are great in my opinion, but as with anything they are not without flaw. Episode 1 is considered by just about everyone who played it to be way too easy because you are essentially drowned in ammunition and can have every gun in the game by the second level in it even going Intruder mode (sickles-only start) by going into three secrets that aren't even that far from each other nor hard in the least to get into.\nEpisode 2 has a general consensus of being fantastic and more akin to what you would expect of shooters of the day, as it requires more resource management that's reminiscent of the aforementioned 90s FPSes and far tougher enemies to boot. However, some people may find it to be artificially difficult in a few different ways, namely in that you're given less ammo but you have around the same and in some cases even more enemies to deal with that can end up taking quite the bit of punishment and dishing out even more themselves and with some rather cheap Wendigo placements that will almost always slap you the first time through the episode.\n\nFrom what I've played of Duskworld, you will surely love it if you were a fan of Quake's multiplayer components, and even moreso if you're absurdly good at them as that skill not only perfectly translates into Dusk but is even amplified when you figure out the dirty technical tricks you can pull off with the features Dusk has that Quake never did.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Dusk to anyone who's looking for a brand new 90s style FPS that rings almost perfectly true to the games of that era. I'm looking forward to what they'll do with Episode 3 and I'm glad to have gotten aboard this murder train when I did.\n", "timestamp_created": 1515781049, "timestamp_updated": 1515781049, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523810", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39287173": {"recommendationid": "39287173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058369472", "num_games_owned": 364, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 80, "last_played": 1516020865}, "language": "english", "review": "Fast shooting/action, kickass music, secrets to be found.

great action game of it's own with one third of it being a suspenceful somewhat horror experience and the other two thirds being pure unadulterated action. Episode one is a great introduction in the rural backwaters of Pennsylvania with action packed levels overrun by cultists, episode two is a much more horrific experience with the action, environmental storytelling and fucked-up ness all dialed up to eleven in levels comprised of grimy military facilities and other disturbing locales.\n\nNow the game is very much a fast paced shooter with insane combat pacing and skill based movement that's easy to learn but hard to master. When the game isn't a guns-blazing action experience it has a very good weird and disturbing feel to it with heavily grungy places and scary monsters like cultists, possessed soldiers, demons and inhumane military experiments. Each levels are totally different experiences going from claustrophobic to wide open, all of them have something memorable or special.\n\nNow the soundtrack composed by the great Andrew Hulshult is an exellent mix of head banging combat tunes and great ambient soundtracks that really set the mood for the levels.\n\nOverall I'd say DUSK is equal and sometimes even better than most classic 90's FPSs in everything exepept for legacy.

Yep, we hear about the mouse sensitivty issue a lot. It is actually possible currently to lower your mouse sensitivity in your Dusk or Duskworld.ini files located within the game's Config folder. You can enter a lower number than the UI currently allows you to set the sensitivity to. We ARE planning to allow manual input within the game to make it easier to achieve the perfect sensitivity. Thanks for bringing this to our attention!\n\n\n"}, "39275486": {"recommendationid": "39275486", "author": {"steamid": "76561198245551930", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 15, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 15, "last_played": 1515683241}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0415\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0438 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043b\u044e\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438,Wolfenstein 3D,DooM,Quake,Duke Nukem 3D,\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u0428\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u044b \"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b\",\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u044b,\u0442\u043e \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435:\u0412\u044b \u041e\u0411\u042f\u0417\u0410\u041d\u042b \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443,\"\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043c\u0443\" \u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435,\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u044e\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0432\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0442\u044c:\n\n\u041f\u041b\u042e\u0421\u042b\n\n1)\u041d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438\u044f - \u0422\u0443\u0442 \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e.1 \u043b\u0438\u0448\u044c \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b,\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0432\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f,\u0412\u044b\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d \u043e\u043d \u0432 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435 DOS-BOX-\u0430,\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u044b\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f FAKE-DOS 6.66\n2)\u0421\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c - \u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u044f,\u0438 \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0438 \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0451 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c,\u0413\u0434\u0435 \u0435\u0449\u0435 \u0413\u0413,\u041c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0421\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u041f\u0440\u044b\u0436\u043a\u0435?\n3)\u0420\u0430\u0437\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0435 \u041e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f - \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0435 9 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u044f (\u0432 \u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0421\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0430).\n4)\u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442 - \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u044e,\u0411\u043b\u044f\u0442\u044c,\u0414\u0430 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043e\u043d \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043d \u0432 \u0428\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435 \"\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044b\".\n5)\u0411\u043e\u0441\u0441\u044b - \u0427\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u0411\u043e\u0441\u0441 \"\u0410\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\" \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u041d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0432 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438.\n6)\u041c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0440 - \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u041c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u0435\u0440\u0430,\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u043c \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u0435\u0442,\u0432\u0430\u0448 \u0441\u043a\u0438\u043b\u043b,\u0438 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c.\n\n\u041c\u0418\u041d\u0423\u0421\u042b\n\n1)\u0412 \u043d\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u043e\u0432\n\n\u0418\u0422\u041e\u0413:\u0418\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0425\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0430\u044f,\u0420\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0443\u044e \u043a \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u043a\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1515744294, "timestamp_updated": 1515744294, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578750", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39275477": {"recommendationid": "39275477", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970590773", "num_games_owned": 203, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 207, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 207, "last_played": 1515743820}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're a fan of Quake or BUILD engine games then you'll love this.

Well, to be perfectly honest with you, DUSK is like if DooM, Quake, Heretic, HeXen, Redneck Rampage and Blood had a baby altogether. At once. Yes, it sounds weird, but trust me, it's not.\n\nYou always hear here and there that \"This game is such a throwback to the FPS Genre\" or \"I've never played such an old-school classic\". Well, this time, it's truer than the last ones. For real. I mean, how in 'tarnation could all these references not do something wonderfully awesome when you mix them together ?\n\nThe answer is simple : if it weren't done by these guys (NewBlood if I'm correct), it would be a piece of trash. Fortunately for you, they know what they're doing. Not only they love old-school mechanics, not only they understood what \"WHERE IS THAT LAST F--- SECRET I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES ?\" truly mean, not only they seem like they've been bathed in FPS since their birth, but they also seem to have nailed the level design like no one before -or so.\n\nIf you're looking for what I'd like to call what Old School Made Goddamn Right... Well, sir or madam, look no further, for your eyes will feast on pixels, for your heart will race on the fast-paced levels Dusk has cooked for you and your ears will truly bleed with joy after the magnificent and powerful soundtrack.\n\nI wish I could do a pun saying that if you play this game, it'll get you from DUSK till Dawn, but I think that would be out of place, don't you think ?\n\nAnyway, by buying DUSK, not only you'd give the creators of this masterpiece a smile on their face -and, I'm sure, their endless love and worship for supporting their game- but you'd also do yourself a favor, for this game is truly awesome !\n\nAlso, you may never see soap the same way... Especially when it's bacon-flavored.\n\n\n---\n\n\nVous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu parler des orgies pa\u00efennes ?

Je sais, \u00e7a parait bizarre, mais faites-moi confiance, \u00e7a ne l'est pas du tout.\n\nVous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0 entendu \"C'est le meilleur hommage au FPS jamais imagin\u00e9\" ou \"Je n'ai jamais autant pris mon pied sur un jeu si old-school\"...

Non seulement ils aiment les m\u00e9caniques de jeu old-school, non seulement ils comprennent compl\u00e8tement le \"O\u00d9 EST CE P--- DE SECRET QUE JE CHERCHE DEPUIS 20 MINUTES ?\", non seulement ils ont l'air d'avoir baign\u00e9 dans le FPS depuis leur plus tendre enfance, mais ils semblent \u00e9galement avoir parfaitement int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le level-design comme personne auparavant -ou presque.\n\nSi vous cherchez ce que je me plais \u00e0 appeler un jeu \"Old-School fait avec un sacr\u00e9 talent\"... Eh bien, Madame, Monsieur, ne cherchez pas plus loin, car vos yeux se r\u00e9galeront des pixels, votre c\u0153ur battra la chamade au gr\u00e9 des niveaux nerveux et rythm\u00e9s et vos oreilles saigneront de bonheur \u00e0 l'\u00e9coute de cette OST du feu de Dieu, puissante et bourrine \u00e0 souhait.\n\nJe ferais bien un jeu de mot vous disant que si vous posez les doigts sur DUSK, vous passerez une Nuit en Enfer, mais que vous en ressortirez transform\u00e9, mais je pense que ce serait d\u00e9plac\u00e9, n'est-ce pas ?\n\nEn tous cas, en achetant DUSK, vous ne ferez pas qu'apporter aux cr\u00e9ateurs de cette \u0153uvre d'art un sourire b\u00e9at sur leurs visages -et, j'en suis certain, leur amour \u00e9ternel ainsi que leur v\u00e9n\u00e9ration inconditionnelle pour avoir support\u00e9 leur travail- mais vous vous ferez aussi du bien, parce que ce jeu est juste g\u00e9nial et passer outre serait un crime !\n\nIl se pourrait, accessoirement, qu'apr\u00e8s avoir jou\u00e9 \u00e0 DUSK, vous ne voyiez plus le savon de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re...

The setting and atmosphere feel like a mix of Evil Dead, Resident Evil 4, and even a little bit of Hexen and it all feels and looks great. \n\nOverall of what I've played so far I would recommend this game and would still not recommend STRAFE.", "timestamp_created": 1515709784, "timestamp_updated": 1515709784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39267119": {"recommendationid": "39267119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031371840", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 102, "last_played": 1516126311}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a fun game, better than STRAFE", "timestamp_created": 1515709596, "timestamp_updated": 1515709596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39266769": {"recommendationid": "39266769", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353903417", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 322, "last_played": 1516055026}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.

I still grin whenever I revisit those old pictures from past LAN parties which showed row after row of beige CRT monitors. Doom, Quake and Half Life were but a few of the must have games at the time. However, as time went on the gaming industry shifted away from its older design principles as the hobby moved into the mainstream. Detailed and challenging level design was left in the dust in favor of linear corridors and \"cinematic\" events. Dusk is a true labor of love and a return to what many consider to be the golden age of PC gaming.\n\nDusk doesn't coddle its players. The second the intro screen fades to black after launching the campaign the game immediately throws you into the action. There are no objective markers and there is no minimap. Dusk leaves it up to the player to discover its secrets and to navigate its deadly levels. On all but the easiest of difficulties the games many enemys will hit you hard. Should you parish to a barrage of bullets or have the misfortune of being torn apart by some lovecraftian horror you will quickly find yourself back at the beginning of the level. Unless of course you planned ahead and mashed that quick save button!\n\nThere will be those who will scoff at Dusk's graphical presentation. The game looks old but that was the developers goal. Everything from the chunky, pixelated graphics to the raw power chords of the games soundtrack is all by intentional design to capture the essence of 90's shooters. Dusk is a true doorway back to that era of PC gaming. For those of you who never touched a PC game back then or maybe were too young I strongly urge you to give Dusk a shot, The game sounds good, feels good and is a blast to play.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1515708010, "timestamp_updated": 1515708010, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39266609": {"recommendationid": "39266609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053055161", "num_games_owned": 330, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 10, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1515722300}, "language": "english", "review": "Great fun for the whole family!", "timestamp_created": 1515707978, "timestamp_updated": 1515890802, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39266450": {"recommendationid": "39266450", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118722289", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 766, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 317, "last_played": 1515840298}, "language": "english", "review": "The greatest thing in gaming since Quake 1, even though I was banned from the Discord, I'll still always love the devs and all the hard work that they've put into this beautiful game.

To keep it simple, I'll break it down into all the pros and cons I can think of:\n\nPROS\n-Excellent controls, fluent movement, and meaty, satisfying shooting mechanics\n-Guns feel powerful and useful; no weapon goes unused (other than the starting melee weapon) and each has certain \n enemy types that its better or worse against\n-Superb level design that continuously improves and gets more creative the further you get into the game\n-Becomes a real challenge once the difficulty ramps up\n-Multiplayer is fast, fun, skill based, old-school carnage\n-Great value with 3 episodes totalling 33 levels, numerous secrets, 3 endless arenas, multiplayer, with coop, mods, and \n achievements coming later\n-Nice variety of environments, with distinctive feel and tone between episodes\n-Creepy, sometimes downright horrific atmosphere backed by excellent art and sound design\n-Andrew Hoscholt's (spelling?) Soundtrack is top notch with a mix of heavy metal, industrial, and ambient music tracks\n-Numerous \"wow\" moments throughout the levels where you just have to stop and appreciate all sorts of views, set \n pieces, and other standout moments\n-Honestly just never gets old; I've played the game start to finish several times over and I feel like I could continue to do \n so over and over for quite some time; additionally, there are secrets to hunt for, medals to unlock, and there's Duskmare \n difficulty and intruder mode to provide some extra challenges and new ways to play\n-Despite the incredibly small dev team and the huge undertaking this game has been for them, the game is almost \n completely bug-free in single and multiplayer; the few bugs I have experienced have been minor - no crashes, freezes, \n corrupted saves, or anything of the sort to speak of\n\nCONS\n-Boss battles tend to be overly simplistic; usually only have one attack pattern and, other than for a couple of bosses in \n episode 2, there's no real creative use of the environment in these encounters\n-Presentation is a little TOO simplistic, even for the time period it's emulating; enemy and weapon models are a bit too \n low-poly, and animations are overly simple and unmemorable\n-Episodes are pretty short; for anyone with experience in 90's twitch-shooter FPSs, each episode will proabably only take \n 2-3 hours each, making the entire game only 6-9 hours long; once you get really good and know the level layouts in \n your head you can breeze through each level in a minute or two even on the highest difficulty \n-Episode 1 is incredibly easy even on the highest difficulty; it's not really until episode 2 begins that the game becomes a \n  proper challenge\n-As of now, the multiplayer community is still tiny, and there's usually only a couple of decent sized games going at any \n particular time\n\nOverall, the core of the game is fantastic and the cons have done little to dampen the experience.

I was able to sign up for Duskworld Beta and got my key roughly about 2 weeks after, and have been playing it so much even for a game that wasn't even out. In total I got an extremely fun 15 hours out of the closed beta and I reckon I will be getting a lot more later on for the actual game. I first prepurchased this game in October, thinking it would come out on Halloween but honestly it was worth the wait.

Right off the bat I will say that if you are a fan of old school shooters like DOOM, Quake, Blood, and Serious Sam you MUST buy DUSK! So many games have tried be an old school throwback to 90s FPS games, but DUSK is the only one that NAILS IT! Everyday I am amazed that DUSK actually exists! That is how good it is!\n\nEpisode 1 is a great introduction to the game as a whole and serves as a great first episode with lots of cultists and scarecrows to blast in the face, but Episode 2 is where all my expectations were exceeded. Episode 2 cranks everything up to 11 and offers a more challenging, more fast paced, more scary, and overall better designed experience that blew me away! The level design is simply fantastic and is what truly makes the game so fun! I can't even imagine what Episode 3 will bring!\n\nAs for DUSKWorld (multiplayer) it is exactly the kind of online FPS experience I have craved for YEARS! It is still in BETA and as a result only has 5 finished maps, and one mode which is Deathmatch, but the core gameplay is EXCELLENT and most of the maps flow well and are fun arenas to play in! It is in every sense of the phrase classic fragging goodness! No classes, no lootboxes, no focus on eSports, just FUN!\n\nOh and I have to mention the soundtrack by Andrew Hulshult which in my opinion is nearly PERFECT! It perfectly blends ambience during more slow sections (like Quake) with adrenaline pumping metal awesomeness (like DOOM)!\n\nI have had more fun experiences with DUSK than pretty much any other game and I couldn't be happier! The developers have been some of the nicest, funniest, and most transparent game developers I have ever come across and they truly have put their blood, sweat, and tears into DUSK! I congratulate them once again on the early access launch and I can hardly wait for Episode 3 and the mod tools! DUSK has truly been a bright spot in my life and I am forever thankful. \n\nBuy this game!", "timestamp_created": 1515696340, "timestamp_updated": 1515696340, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39262350": {"recommendationid": "39262350", "author": {"steamid": "76561198378156762", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 129, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 129, "last_played": 1516038472}, "language": "english", "review": "The best throwback to 90s fps games ever with what is possibly the most generous devs you'll ever come across", "timestamp_created": 1515695523, "timestamp_updated": 1515695523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39261921": {"recommendationid": "39261921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077591549", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 320, "last_played": 1515788616}, "language": "english", "review": "*About to go to bed.*\n*Get an email about DUSK being released on early access.*\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDgkrtUlTc", "timestamp_created": 1515694387, "timestamp_updated": 1515694387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39261823": {"recommendationid": "39261823", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971924404", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 69, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 69, "last_played": 1515705456}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a lucky time for a twitch-shooter fan to be alive.\n\nI'll preface this review by saying simply that I'm a long time fan of the genre, and hold QUAKE 1-3, DOOM 1-2, Duke Nukem 3D, Blood, Hexen and Heretic in very high regard. DUSK, what you see before you, carries on their great work in a stylish way.\n\nIt'd be understandable for a game to seek fortune by outright emulating these old masterworks, yet DUSK does something quite remarkable in its interaction with the past. There certainly are overt homages to the days gone by: labyrinthine levels, chunky (in sound, feel and appearance!) guns, vicious enemies and often brutal difficulty are all welcome inclusions. However, I find that the true appeal of DUSK is its manipulation of these themes, preserving the great and making the not-so-great of the old days more accessible. DUSKDUDE is able to interact with his environment by blowing open walls, picking up objects, stacking boxes and quaffing beers. It's hilarious, over the top, and down-right magnificent.\n\nThe guns, level-design, opponents and warped sense of humour all combine to create a wonderfully brooding atmosphere that's wholly absorbing. You'll find yourself entranced by it's devilish charm, gallons of blood and rhythmic pounding.\n\nAll of which is without mentioning the musical work of the legendary Andrew Hulshult. His magnificent score sounds like a combination of Nine Inch Nails, Gary Numan, Killing Joke and so many others, yet retains his trademark grasp of melody and pace. It's the very, very tasty cherry that's on top of a delicious cake. Well done to you, sir.\n\nThe multiplayer is also hilariously fun.

I learned about it from one of [URL=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lA6OOdV4Ve4]LGR's videos[/URL], and went in with the cynical expectation that it'd be another faux-\"throwback to '90s shooters\" that completely misses the mark. Not only was I completely wrong, but Dusk ended up being one of my favorite games of 2017/2018.\n\nThe retro-FPS inspiration that Dusk wears on its sleeve isn't superficial; it can be felt in the gameplay and the level design, which is what immediately sucked me in. Levels are open-ended and immaculately-crafted, each sporting their own memorable set-pieces. The various monsters (which are continually introduced throughout the game) all have their own unique attacks and gameplay gimmicks, which keep Dusk feeling fresh from level to level, episode to episode, Replayability is immense, as Dusk offers unforgiving difficulty settings, melee-start mode, and loads of well-hidden secrets (along with a shiny, meaningless medal for finding all of them).\n\nThe weapons, simple as they look, are all very satisfying to use. None of the guns suffer from any sort of \"obsolescence\" later into the game, and you'll often find yourself switching from shotgun to hunting rifle to machine gun as different obstacles demand different arms.\n\n[i]DuskWorld[/i], the multiplayer component of Dusk, only has deathmatch at the moment. I've played about 5 hours of it, and it gave me some fun flashbacks to HLDM; if you like fast-paced arena FPS gameplay, you'll probably enjoy DuskWorld to some extent, but the single-player package is more than strong enough to warrant a purchase by itself.\n\n\nI'd wholeheartedly recommend Dusk to anyone who has longed for a new shooter that follows the conventions and design principles of the classics like Doom, Blood, and Quake; it really doesn't get much closer than this.", "timestamp_created": 1515692148, "timestamp_updated": 1515692148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.566929", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39260935": {"recommendationid": "39260935", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982324524", "num_games_owned": 1218, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1515690641}, "language": "english", "review": "Fuck yeah!

Were you disappointed with Quake Champions as I was? Well look no further as DUSK IS FINALLY HERE!! ... Well in Early Access at least! I've been following DUSK since it's announcement, and have played all the alphas and demos, and purchased it when it was first available. This is a true love letter to the old shooters and it shows it with pride! Inspired by Quake, Blood, Heretic, Hexen, Half-Life, Redneck Rampage and all the '90s favorites!\n\n[h1] Story: Be Branded a HERETIC [/h1]\nThe main game is the 3 Episode campaign (Episode 3 is still in the works, which is why it's EA.) You will embark on a quest to murder everything in your path such as cultists, possessed militants and even darker forces to discover what dark secrets and horrors are hiding in this world. Much like the old shooters, the emphasis isn't full on story, but more on the gameplay and mechanics. The story is told in little interactions here and there, as well as from the world/map you explore in and you try to piece it together yourself. \n\nYou want some Multiplayer? Where it's here as well! DUSKWorld (See what they did there?) where you can jump and flip around levels playing an actual proper Deathmatch with weapon pickups and no Hero Skills/loadouts.\n\nThere is also an Endless Survival Mode for if you wanted that total carnage to never stop and just keep on killing.\n\n[h1] Gameplay: Rampage Past The Rednecks [/h1]\nThe main focus of these games is always the gameplay. There is a reason why so many people love the old FPS games, cause they were FUN! The combat feels meaty and responsive. There is no bullsh*t or cheap deaths. Each weapon feels useful and powerful. Movement is fast and responsive. The game makes you feel like a badass when you launch off a jump pad, do a sick backflip while shooting a rocket, then landing with a slide while pulling out your double barrel shotgun and blasting the enemy in the face! The combat feels straight out of QUAKE, but with their own little twist! What I'm saying is this is the new QUAKE we were wanting Bethesda!\n\n[h1] Audio: Meet Your DOOM [/h1]\nAudio is perfect. The world has sounds and the enemies have their own unique sounds, but lets face it, the MAIN focus for me was the soundtrack! Made by no other than Andrew F*cking Hulshult! This soundtrack is metal as f*ck! It's another one of those soundtracks that you will listen to more outside the game cause it's just that god damn amazing! Andrew Hulshult knocked it out of the park again!\n\n[h1] Graphics: QUAKE In Fear [/h1]\nDUSK definitely shows off it's retro style. It gives off a strong QUAKE, Blood, Heretic, Hexen, Half-Life, and Redneck Rampage feel depending on the level. Each levels feels new and unique. As it looks like an old shooter, the game isn't graphically demanding and runs super smooth. I don't think this game dipped under 240FPS for me once, and I don't have a super computer! You can tweek the graphics slightly, like making the game look pixelized to make it feel even more older, change the color settings to make it feel like it's from Blood, or Hexen, or even in black and white! You can change your FOV, change the weapon model sizes, and even if you want smooth textures. The options menu isn't a huge choice of settings, but like I said this isn't a graphically demanding game so you probably won't have any issues running the game.\n\nPROS:\n- It's everything a retro inspired FPS should be, and more!\n- Graphics are great!\n- Andrew Hulshult soundtrack is ALWAYS F*CKING AMAZING!\n- Great selection of weapons that are fun to use.\n- Great selection of maps/levels.\n- Lots of secrets to be found.\n- Multiplayer is a great fun to play.\n- [spoiler] Dope Fish Lives! [/spoiler]\n\nCONS:\n- It's EA (still in the works, but not really a con.)\n- *There is some extremely toxic fans, and that's just pathetic!\n- No Achievements (YET)\n- No Steam Trading Cards (YET!)\n\nSummery:\nIn case you can't tell, I love this game to bits, and plan on sinking some major time into it. If the trailers don't give you a hard on, then you obviously don't like good FPS games.\n\nI'm also waiting for them to announce the big box collector's edition that I will 100% buy to have it sit on my shelf. This is a game that I want to happily display on the shelf next to the other great classics... If I owned them. >_>\n\nSo yes, $20, now and forever. Buy it already!\n\n=======================================\nEDIT:\nSo there is a slight edit to this... It's nothing about the game, but more or less the extremely toxic fans that seem to have surfaced recently. The toxic levels of if you say ANYTHING bad or critique the game they come after you like rabid dogs, causing people to delete their comments or review.

The character movements feels unlike anything you experienced even in Quake. You can actually perform flips, power slides and move so freaking fast!!\n\nThe single player campaign episodes are very well crafted and horror inspired as you find scientists experiments everywhere and insane cult members around them. The multiplayer is a killfest as you would expect but It is still too recent for me to mention anything beyond that for now.\n\nThe only 'pale' side I feel for this game is the very low amount of polygons 3D design for some guns, areas and creatures which make them looks quite simple.

So here we go\n\nI don't even know where to start with this game. I've been following it since the reveal and been so excited with every tease or trailer drop. I was lucky to get a key from their discord group (Thanks so much guys!)\n\nFirst off is to say that this game is amazing, I've never really had so much fun in a game as to this. As of this review I have not tried DuskWorld (Multiplayer) bit I'm sure it will be great.\n\nThe movement first of all feels so good as you you zip past everything trying to beat your time or you are taking it slightly slower. Every step you take feels right. The jump pad work so well with unlocking the ability to move your camera anywhere doing flips while shooting just feels great.\n\nBrings me into my next topic, gun play. The guns act so well with any approach to a level. Fast or slow, gun blazing or picking off one by one, each weapon in the game feels so satisfying to use, they all feel like that have a kick which is needed. \n\nThe story so far in my opinion isn't bad. I do like the sense of waking up on a meat hook and killing pretty much anything that stands in your way, reminds me of doom. The levels are designed with a lot of thought and detail put into them, letting there be outcomes to exploring around or just to go for the ending.\n\nThe music. The fucking music. Andrew has done it agian with the brilliant soundtrack. Ever since IDKFA mod for Doom I always waited for the next project he worked on, soon as I saw his name I knew I was going to buy the soundtrack right when it's out. Its outstanding.\n\nAfter I tried a bit of multiplayer I will come back and add that.\n\nSo far this game is outstanding, I recommend this game to anyone who has $20. Yes it's in early access, but for good reason. They said the full game should be out in the next couple of months. Let's hope to see how it goes.\n\nOverall Rating: 9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1515682105, "timestamp_updated": 1515682105, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542160", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39257218": {"recommendationid": "39257218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083896907", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 273, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 273, "last_played": 1515946325}, "language": "german", "review": "Uuuuuunnnddddd Ja! \nDUSK ist ein Retro-Shooter mit einer netten Polygongrafik.\nDer Singleplayer macht Spa\u00df und Motiviert da es einiges zu Entdecken gibt!\nDer multiplayer (DUSKWorld) W\u00fcrde noch mehr Spa\u00df machen.

Well, almost. But it's PRETTY DAMN CLOSE.\n\nI have been following this game since 2016 at quakecon, where I saw this being showcased and met the 3 or so people that worked on this game. I saw this game and was blown away (at that time, they only had the survival mode and let people play) but boy, was it fun. Despite Quakecon being filled with tons of other fun stuff to do, I constantly saw myself going back to the DUSK booth, probably anoyed the crap out of them too. I have been watching this game like a hawk waiting for its release. I played it again at the previous quakecon 2017 and was even more amazed at how much more solid the game became,\n\nMy favorite game of all time is a 3 way tie between Quake I, Blood, and Doom(original). All 3 of those games were clear influences on this one, and it isn't afraid to show it one bit. \nAfter 2 and a half years of me waiting, I FINALLY can play this game whenever I want. \n\nIf you are a 90s fps gamer/fan, I definitely won't be the first to say that this is your wet dream come true. This game feels like a bunch of the big ones: in specific the 3 that I named, as well as other influences like Heretic and Redneck Rampage, mashed together into one. It's even FASTER than Quake, something I never thought would be possible.  \n\nThe singleplayer is broken down into 3 episodes, with a total of 33 levels. On top of that, there is Duskworld (like Quakeworld) for hours of multiplayer fun, and there's even 3 diffrent \"endless mode\" levels. So for 20 bucks, this is a massive bang for your buck. Hours and hours of content for the price of 2 meals. Definitely worth it.\nThis also has soundtrack was in fact done by Andrew Hulshult. If his music is in it, that's already a sign it's gonna kick a$$.\nThe overall gameplay is very 90s at the core; kill anything that moves, find cards/secrets, and find the level exit and move on. But the level design is great, as every level feels diffrent to keep the game fresh, and it feels like true progression instead of random levels; one of the major issues I felt 90s games had. I have only 2 VERY minor complaints. Though I love the level design, there are some points that are a tad confusing and can be irritating for people that aren't used to oldschool level design. Even for me those points were a bit confusing. (very minor complaint). My only other one shouldn't even be worth mentioning because Andrew is fixing it, but it's the timing of the switching between the ambient and metal music is off at some parts. But they're both amazing and very fitting for the level and game. They're good enough to listen to as actual songs on their own, so you might want to do your ears a favor and buy the soundtrack.

New Blood has more than proven themselves to be one of the next great developers of our time with dusk alone and after getting to play a couple of their other titles I'm happy to say I'm eager to see more.\nDuskworld, as well, is a fast paced, frantic multiplayer mode that even in such early stages is a delight to play, and is a nice way to pass the time.

I have played Episodes 1 and 2 before the game launched into Early Access. Episode 1 is pretty much what you would expect from a game like this, there are not too many moments which you haven't seen in other games as well but DUSK delivers them in a really competent way. Episode 2, however, experiments much more with its level design and I think the game really found its way here. Saying anything more would be a spoiler so I'll just say that the game develops its own style in Episode 2 and that style works really well.\n\nAt the time of writing this, my only worries are that DUSK will remain a relatively short game. There are 3 Episodes planned and I have played 2 of them already. Every Episode seems to have about 10 levels (I think), which makes for a good 30 levels to play through, which is fair, but I would love to see even more content for this game. That being said, the developers are apparently planning on releasing a SDK and Workshop support, I think the community around this game might be the key to more levels in the future. \n\nFurthermore, the game also features an endless wave-based horde mode which is good fun if you need a quick session of shooting stuff. Also, the multiplayer is fun as well and it is refreshing to play a multiplayer-mode with weapon pick ups and only your KDR to keep you occupied in comparison to all the progression-system, microtransaction and loadout-laden multiplayer titles out there. \n\nSolid recommendation: 9.5/10 at the time of writing (Day 1 of Early Access release)", "timestamp_created": 1515662908, "timestamp_updated": 1515662908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39251296": {"recommendationid": "39251296", "author": {"steamid": "76561198161015659", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 76, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 76, "last_played": 1516072585}, "language": "english", "review": "Played a ton of this game before it was in early access. This game has probably the best controls I have ever seen in an fps game, everything you do is super responsive and smooth. The level design in the episodes released so far is pretty amazing, each level has perfect enemy and item placement, and the gameplay is super fast paced, like quake and other 90's shooters. Each weapon is unique, and has it's own strengths and weaknesses depending on the situation. A feature I really appreciate is the optional \"intruder\" mode, which makes you start each level with your default melee weapon, which is a really nice challenge for when you've already beaten a level as you must relearn the level's layout and prioritize finding a good weapon and ammo rather than just rushing for the keys and next objective.  Not only is the action amazing, but this game has a really effective horror atmosphere, with episode 2 introducing one of the most frightening enemy types I have ever seen in a video game. I definitely recommend playing this game with headphones, as it makes for a very immersive fps experience, especially in the horror department.

One unique aspect to Dusk's level design though is that the developers aren't afraid to shape tension. Not every corridor and open space is designed with the intention to be the next big side-strafing fight, it makes great use of space to build atmosphere to really throw you into the fact that this game wants to - at times - make sure you know it's horrific. It's one of my favourite things about it.\n\nExpect fun weapons, fun fights, and downright terrifying/tense moments. Seriously. Prepare to have your butt clench.

However, Dusk manages to differentiate itself while retaining that same old classic feeling from those games. Dusk has a cult setting, where you are mowing down cultists and their fellow entities. The game retails for $20 USD and contains 2 campaigns (with 1 on the way) with multiplayer. I have only played 1 campaign so far, so I can't really comment on the rest of the campaign. So far, Episode 1 started off a little rough in my opinion. I like to get straight to the action and mayhem so I can tear apart all my enemies limb from limb with my trusty shotgun in hand. However, you start off with a melee weapon to quickly get your hands on a pistol and shortly after a shotgun. The shotgun for the most part feels fine. However, I wish it was slightly more powerful as it felt a little weak sometimes. The biggest flaw of episode 1 for me is level design. There were several areas that I reached and killed all it's inhabitants. However, I would figure out I would later return and unlock a weapon behind a locked door. Due to the level's design, it seemed like I was supposed to fight some enemies from earlier with the new weapon. However, I already killed them and I didn't get to test it until the next level. Additionally, I felt like levels sometimes broke up the flow of the level at times. I wanted to be overwhelmed with enemies and constantly be on the move trying to mow down my opponents. Instead, I felt like I had \"crumbs\" of the  action I was hoping for. On top of that, sometimes items that I needed were in hidden areas that sometimes were quite difficult to find. The secret areas in this game are very well hidden. However, some stuff was difficult to find and I would get fairly confused. Multiplayer is a fun mode but currently is limited. However, based on the rest of the game I wouldn't be surprised to see more features and tweaks to multiplayer soon. \n\nOverall, this is a good experience if you want an old-school shooter game. It's worth the $20. \n\nWill expand on review eventually.", "timestamp_created": 1515654340, "timestamp_updated": 1515682399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39249605": {"recommendationid": "39249605", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971943314", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1243, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1243, "last_played": 1516167132}, "language": "english", "review": "Did you just scroll down past the buy button to read reviews?

While certainly inspired by old school shooters like Quake, Blood, and the like, the game brings enough new school to the table to change things up quite a bit while still retaining elements I loved from the classics, like exploration, weapons with purpose and personality, and a shit load of baddies to kill.\n\nThe multiplayer is one of the most fun, chaotic experiences I've had with a game in years. If you're a fan of the AFPS genre, you'll definitely find a lot to love here. Personally, using the crossbow to murder people through walls and teleporters with a bit of prediction has probably been the most satisfying bit of multiplayer ingenuinity I've encountered in quite some time. Unlike predecessors like Quake and Q3A, the mechanics are very easy to learn and improve upon, while still difficult to completely master, what with the ludicrous amounts of speed, 100% air control, crouch slides, and the like. Even though there's much polishing to be done, I've already spent countless hours on the multiplayer, and I plan to spend thousands more fragging and getting fragged.\n\nIf you love old school shooters and are sick of the CoDs and Overwatchs, if you love supporting indies, if you love kickass soundtracks, or if you're into the occult, buy this fucking game. It is hands down the best game I've played in years, and the developer is amazing, pouring his blood, sweat, and tears into every bit he possibly can (not to mention the QA team and others involved that are spending countless hours on the MP portion of the game, as well as the SDK).

Genuinely one of the few 'retro' FPS out there that genuinely gets what makes those old FPS games great, without turning it into a damn wave shooter like Serious Sam or Painkiller, or completely avoiding level design. Episode 2 in particular is one of the best FPS levels sets possibly ever. The game actually manages to reach the same level as those top level FPS classics in a lot of respects. If Episode 3 is half as good as Episode 2 there's no way this game won't be a classic, and well worth your money. Even the game's Endless mode never seems to get old. It may look kinda bland at first but with the right settings (texture filtering off, pixelization on 3 or so, limited colour pallet on) it genuinely looks great, especially with the amazing visuals throughout the second episode.\n\nDuskworld is also great. It's pretty early in development but it's just pure old multiplayer FPS fun, but with actual players of all skill levels, not just people who've played Quake for 20 years straight. Multiple 1-hit-kills and easy movement mechanics which let you go stupidly fast make the game go at a blistering pace in a good way. Duels feel fairly unique, with a lot of tension given by how quickly everything can turn around and weapons like the crossbow (which shoots through walls and kills a spawn health/armour player in one hit) give it some neat unique features.

New Blood have taken an approach that many others have tried and failed in the past, and have blown all expectations out of the water with only the first two episodes and an early implementation of multiplayer.\nI will start this review off by saying I have played days of both DUSK Episodes 1+2 and the multiplayer counterpart, DUSKWorld during the pre-purchase beta, along with the Dusk/New Blood community and developers, and will hopefully be playing much more, especially as more content is added and things are changed.\n\n[h1][b]STORY:[/b][/h1]\nYou are a treasure-hunter, simply known as the Dusk Dude, searching for treasure in the mysterious backwoods of Pennsylvania, when you are captured by a group of mysterious, pointy-headed cultists with an affinity for chainsaws and a bad taste in their mouths. Hooked to a wooden pole, three burly masked men with chainsaws enter the dank basement you find yourself in. An ominous voice is heard, \"Kill the Intruder.\", the rest is on you. The story itself pulls heavily from Quake and Redneck Rampage especially, and does so brilliantly.\n\n[h1][b]GAMEPLAY:[/b][/h1]\nFast-paced and always hostile, DUSK will have you pitted against a variety of enemies with a variety of weapons and skills on your side. Spin your weapons like an Old West badass. Do front and backflips with an unlocked Y-axis in the air. Throw sawblades and turn enemies into red mist. Fire green phallic crossbow bolts through walls. DUSK captures perfectly the old school FPS feel, while adding so much to the mix. Multiplayer, while in it's early phases, is quick action fun even in it's current state. Everything available to you in Single Player can play a role online. Dedicated servers are to be added soon, and much later in development mod support will be implemented as well, extending the longevity of the multiplayer component by quite a bit.\n\n[h1][b]GRAPHICS:[/b][/h1]\nThe game is ugly, in a good way. Low-poly models and low-resolution textures, yet stylish and used very well in most cases. If you enjoyed Quake's visuals, you'll love DUSK's. Plenty of graphics options, including something like a dozen color filters, super low resolution modes, etc.\n\n[h1][b]SOUND and MUSIC:[/b][/h1]\nA banging rock soundtrack by Andrew Hulshult, the music we've come to expect from this sort of game. He's a talented individual, and is a perfect fit for DUSK with beautiful ambient tracks, and the drops that kick in during the intense ambushes DUSK has to offer. The sound design for both the enemies and weapons are just as great, with enemies being intimidating, weapons having a lot of feel and power to them, and sounds working as cues to tell you more about the situation. Play this game with sound and headphones on!\n\n[h1][b]CONCLUSION:[/b][/h1]\nI've attempted to avoid any big spoilers or anything, so there are so many more things to be had in the game.

Not only does it capture the feel of games like Blood and classic DOOM and the movement of Quake (HUP HUP HUP), it builds upon them and makes its own beautiful thing out of it. \n\nEspecially the atmosphere and the organic story-telling beyond the initial, rather simple premise make it interesting not only for FPS fans. What makes it even more impressive is that this was designed and coded by literally one guy - the biggest props to David Szymanski to make his childhood dream come true and make the FPS genre live again like it's 1996. \n\nBy purchasing this, you don't only get an incredible game (with the final third episode and the last endless arena still in the works), you also support an indie dev who truly deserves it.

The levels are packed with secrets and neat areas which makes them rewarding and interesting to explore.\n\nAt the time of this review, there are two episodes. They are both pretty lengthy and absolutely worth replaying through (I'm sitting at 10+ hours of playtime but foresee myself coming back multiple times). A third episode is coming, and I'm certain that when it comes out, it will blow away my expectations just like episode 2 did.\n\nIt's obvious to me that the developers poured their hearts and souls into it, and it's a hell of a lot of fun as a result.

I pre-ordered it a while back ([i]before[/i] early access) and have been playing the single and multiplayer as 2 separate games. Right now, there are 2 episodes, the multiplayer, and 2 endless arenas to play with. And episode 3 and\u00a0endless arena 3 are on the way, so the game is not 100% complete, but still has plenty to play with as it stands ([i]I have 90 hours in it so far[/i]). With that being said, DUSK takes what made games like Quake and DOOM great and makes them its own. You can play it fast and kill everything,\u00a0play it passive and let everything live, or slow it down and look for secrets (there is a lot of them). The levels feel great and look great and\u00a0each offer something different while being simple enough to get through with sometimes having multiple ways to complete them. Some of these levels\u00a0have a bit of a horror element to them as well leading to some pretty tense and scary moments. Movement is fast and the weapons feel great and are perfect for the game. Combat can be hectic at times, but everything feels fair. I highly recommend this game.\n\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\nThe story [i]so far[/i] is: You play as \"Dusk Dude\", a treasure hunter captured by demonic cultists. You must escape and kill them all. [i]Simple[/i]. As you progress you discover some truths about what's really been going on.\n\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\n[b][i](for now I will just talk about the single player, as it is the main feature of DUSK, however, a lot of this applies to the multiplayer as well)[/i][/b]\n\n[b][u]MOVEMENT:[/u][/b] DUSK plays how you want it to. It can be played very fast by use of bunny-hopping or explosive jumping, or taken slower for\u00a0those who wish to do so. The important thing is that you are in control. You have complete freedom in your movement both on the ground and in the\u00a0air. Having this freedom allows you to dodge enemy's and get around the levels as you please and feel good while doing it.\u00a0\n\n[b][u]BASIC WEAPONS:[/u][/b] There are technically 10 weapons in this game, but one is a special melee weapon seldom used. The main 9 weapons are\u00a0nothing too fancy, but are perfect for the setting and theme. They feel extremely responsive, sound great, and all serve a unique purpose. I won't go into these\u00a0purposes too much as its better to learn from playing, but they are pretty much what you would expect of them. Pistols for small enemy's, shotguns for\u00a0getting in your enemy's faces or for needing high damage, rifles for medium and long ranges, explosives for crowds or bosses and for jumping to hard to\u00a0reach places, a special crossbow which can shoot through walls and allow the player to hover if shot down, and your trusty sickles for when you're\u00a0in a pinch. The guns follow the retro trend of not needing to manually reload or worry about magazines and a very quick to switch to and use.\u00a0\n\n[b][u]IMPROVISED WEAPONS:[/u][/b] In DUSK you can pick up most small objects in the game, and each of these objects can be thrown to do different\u00a0damages depending on what they are. It makes for interesting fights and allows the player to save ammo if needed.\n\n[b][u]PICKUPS:[/u][/b] There are various health, armor (armor is called \"morale\" in DUSK), ammo, weapons, and power-ups placed throughout each level. Some are\u00a0clearly presented as you move through them and others are hidden to reward exploration. Enemy's can also drop small amounts of health, morale, and\u00a0ammo as well. These pickups feel very well placed and provide a good reason to explore as you can obtain some weapons early in the game.\n\n[b][u]COMBAT:[/u][/b] No crazy AI in this game. If they see you, they will chase you. Rushing into a room guns blazing is the way this game was made\u00a0to be played!\n\n[b][u]SOUNDTRACK:[/u][/b] Badass soundtrack that is dynamic on most levels. No complaints here. Most of the sound design feels very modern, while still having some old school-esque sounds throughout the game.\n\n[h1]Multiplayer:[/h1]\nThe multiplayer is awesome, but it is an afterthought or an add-on to the single player and is still in fairly early stages. It is a standard arena style PvP setup with (at the time of this\u00a0review) only 1 game mode, free for all. However, more game modes are planned (CTF, TDM,etc). To start, you NEED to be fast and have a basic understanding of DUSK's\u00a0movement to do [i]well[/i] in it. Or else you are an easy target for everyone else. But, with that being said, the multiplayer has a low skill floor and\u00a0high skill ceiling. Anyone can easily get a hang of the movement and weapons within an hour or 2 and can take those skills very far.\u00a0It is an arena style fps done right!\n\n[h1]Graphics and Aesthetics:[/h1]\nI figured I would toss this in at the end as it shouldn't be a [i]major[/i] selling point in my opinion. But this game is very 90's. What you see in the\u00a0screenshots is what you get. But don't let its graphics make your choice on this game, it is very tastefully used and is very much part of its\u00a0charm.\u00a0\n\n[h1]Future Features:[/h1]\nThere is still a lot to be added to DUSK during its time in and out of early access. A SDK is currently in the works with planned workshop support, more game modes and features for multiplayer, potential co-op after it leaves early access, and episode 3 are the main things to note. But I'm sure many other small features and tweaks will be added along the way.\n\nAnd that's about it! I'm loving this game so far and am looking forward to episode 3 within the next couple of months! I don't want to talk about enemy\u00a0types or specifics of the levels just yet as those are best experienced by playing the game and are potential spoilers. Maybe after episode 3 comes\u00a0out and I can look at everything as a whole I will add a spoiler section and talk about those.\n\n[b][i]-BTW, This game is probably not going to go on sale anytime soon (if AT ALL) as to avoid the \"I'll pick it up when it's on sale\" excuse. It will also always be $20 no\u00a0matter how much more content is added. This is a dev choice that has been stated multiple times on their Discord as well as on their 2018 announcement: \"Nope. $20 then, $20 now, $20 forever.\" I think it is very much worth the price for the time I got (and am still getting) out of it. I have gotten 90+ hours between the\u00a0single and multiplayer (40 single, 50 multi). It miiiight go on sale eventually, but I would not count on it.

But also the settings menu is actually amazing and has all sorts of options for visual filters and video adjustment.\n\nAfter blasting through the first episode I already feel like I've gotten my money's worth in a game that feels like a full and faithful follow-up to classic 90s FPS while still very much being a beast of its own. The guns are varied and feel great, the environments are rusty yet evocative, and the enemies are the perfect kind of shotgun-fodder. If you've been looking for a classic FPS to dive into but have already beaten many of them, this is the game for you.\n\nFor the uninitiated who may not be familiar with the aforementioned classic FPS, this actually may still be of a lot of interest! While you'll lose the nostalgia and may have to get used to the faster pace of these kinds of games, DUSK feels like the very best of what a 90s twitch shooter can be all hybrided into one. It draws from DooM's level design, Quake's tight and fast play, Rise of the Triad's jump-pads, and Blood's... well you know. All the while DUSK still stands as its own game, bringing new tricks, new weapons, and a treasure trove of extra features (And really doing a barrel roll in mid-air never gets old).\n\nNow this is usually the part where I say \"this is an early access game so you may want to wait...\" But honestly, the single player is already so tight and (seemingly) complete I sincerely recommend buying this game early and diving into the frenzy of carnage and gunfire it has to offer!", "timestamp_created": 1516263514, "timestamp_updated": 1516263514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39430377": {"recommendationid": "39430377", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135634094", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 38, "last_played": 1516253810}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0436, \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0440\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e-\u0448\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0440, \u0432 \u0434\u0443\u0445\u0435 Quake \u0438 Blood. \u041f\u043e\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0432 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0432 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443, \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430. \u041d\u0443, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430, \u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u044b/\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b.\n+\n\u0412\u0435\u0441\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043c\u043f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u044b, \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \n\u0421\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \"\u043a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\" \u0430\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043b.\n\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u044e\u0449\u0438\u0435\u0441\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \u0434\u0443\u0445\u0435 B-movie \u0443\u0436\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432.  \n\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.\n\u0411\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u043e\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432.\n\u041e\u0442\u0441\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0443\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435\u0439 \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u044d\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432 RPG. \n-\n\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0439. \u041e\u043d \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u044b \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u043e \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0442. \u0412 \u0442\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0435 Blood \u0438\u043b\u0438 Duke Nukem \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u044f\u043d\u043d\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0435, \u0430 \u0442\u0443\u0442 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u0425\u043e\u0442\u044f, \u0443 \u043d\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0430\u0436\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u043a \u043d\u0435\u0442. \n\u041b\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e\u0431\u044b \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0435. \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 -

Cada episodio se siente como una minihistoria y ambientancion distintiva. El primero siendo mas libre con escenarios de ciudades, granjas y mostrandote la historia de un culto. El segundo se siente como si estubieras en un ambiente opresivo, industrias cerradas que me recuerdan a la que se sienten en half life o deus ex. Como veo el tercero tendra un ambiente mas demoniaco. Ademas que cada nivel se siente diferente, te ense\u00f1a cosas nuevas, o te encuentras cada vez secretos mas rebuscados (busquen el de E1M2 y le dara una risa entera) que te dan ganas de seguir rejugando hasta tenerlo al 100%\n\nPero no solo es ambientacion, si no como se siente jugarlo, desde el primer nivel empiezas enfrentadote a unos de los enemigos mas comunes, y puedes sufrir algunas muertes si te esperas que sea algo sencillo.

I became a true old school FPS lover since the day I began playing Serious Sam almost three years ago. \n\nWhen I first discovered DUSK, I was very excited and intrigued. This reminded me of Quake mainly in terms of visuals (Like I mentioned a bit ago, I have watched a lot of Quake videos several years ago). Can I also say that I have dreams in my sleep about actually being an old school FPS protagonist? Anyway, months before I got my hands on DUSK, I played STRAFE, another first person shooter game with retro gameplay and visuals. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a major disappointment due to procedural generation, rougelike mechanics, and depressingly weak weapons. DUSK, on the other hand, doesn't have those problems.\n\nNow, onto the game itself. On my first playthrough of Episode 1, I was quickly amazed by how superb the execution was. The environments are great in detail, movement is very fluid, and the weapons were great. This game, to me, is everything that STRAFE was not. Heck, you can even change the game settings to make it as retro as you feel like (Looks visually better without bilinear filtering, in my opinion).\n\nDUSKWorld multiplayer was very superb as well, although I did get some lag from time to time. Like in the older FPS games, you can choose and name your character. In short, go find or create a server, hook up with some people, and start hupping and fragging.\n\nI can't seem to find anything to complain about, other than the fact that DuskDude, as the community calls him, doesn't have a character and backstory of his. I would like to maybe learn more about him someday.\n\nThat's all I have to say for DUSK. After replaying the first and second episodes, I am fully ready for the third and final episode of the main game. I thank Dave and New Blood Interactive for bringing this game to life, and I would be very sad if I've never known about this game at all.", "timestamp_created": 1516570924, "timestamp_updated":

The pace of the game is perfect, you just want to turn the music to 11, and the combat is just fucking great. I cannot get enough of it. There is all of the different types of customization settings, pretty much anything the first person shooter junkie could ever wish for. It has a surprisingly huge amount of replay ability with a crap ton of secrets in each level. The whole cult/devil worship theme to the game makes for a wonderful atmosphere that is easy to get lost in.\n\nIf I would have to nit pick there is one thing I could ask for is that it could use one more weapon like a chainsaw or maybe a hard hitting magnum, but that\u2019s it. It does NOT take away from the game and it is still in early access so they might add something later on.\n\nIf you are worried the late 90s FPS graphics take away from the game, it does NOT. If anything it adds to the whole feel of the game, making everything look gritty and dark. I would for sure recommend this game to any first person shooter lovers, and I would definitely 100% recommend this game for the people who loved killing enemies in Doom or going 100 miles per hour bunny hopping speed running in half life one.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1516826266, "timestamp_updated": 1516826266, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39586956": {"recommendationid": "39586956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139730720", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 292, "last_played": 1516293204}, "language": "english", "review": "It's like every FPS game from the 90's got in a flesh pit and this game is the unholy love child that resulted.", "timestamp_created": 1516818496, "timestamp_updated": 1516818496, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39586667": {"recommendationid": "39586667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011964322", "num_games_owned": 248, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1808, "last_played": 1516858960}, "language": "english", "review": "You know what really tests your love for a game?

If you particularly enjoy games like Quake, Blood, or Half-life 1, you'll be sure to adore this, as it takes elements from all 3 of these games and makes it blend together so perfectly. Currently, the game has 2 episodes playable, with a third being availble upon its official release outside of Early access. This is easily worth the price of admission alone, and I could go on for fucking HOURS upon what makes the current campaign so far good, but I'll save that for my full review when the game comes out. To keep it brief, these current 2 episodes shine not only in having fun and inventive level design, packed to the brim with secrets and tons of ways to beat the level, but also great atmosphere thanks to not only that, but it's music and sound design, ESPECIALLY in episode 2. The single player portion also includes 2 \"endless\" mode maps, which isn't much but is cool reguardless. The other main thing right now is DUSKWORLD, the game's multiplayer componment. Currently, there isnt much to it as of the time of writing, as it only has about 10 or so maps and one gameplay mode (Free-For-All deathmatch), but if you enjoy things like Quake's multiplayer you will definetely get some fun out of it. The devs currently plan on bringing more modes and maps to DUSKWORLD in the future, so don't be disgruntled by what you see right now if it doesn't please you.\n\nAll in all, even if you have moderate doubts about this game at the moment due to it's early access state, get it for the campaign alone. The current 2 episodes are just that damn good. Not to mention, there is a ton more planned for this game in the future, including Coop modes, a completely moddable SDK, Steam Workship support, and much more. Just fucking get this game man.

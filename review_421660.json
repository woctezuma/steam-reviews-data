Harmonia is another good example of what they can do.\n\nHarmonia is a kinetic novel, meaning that there are no choices to make - it's more like reading a book or watching a DVD.  It took me about three hours to complete.  Technically speaking, there is only one slight issue that I can report - when I booted up the game for the first time, an error message occurred telling me that the game's default font was not available on my computer and I had to choose another one.  To be honest, this wasn't an issue as I could choose a new font with ease and it had no effect on the gameplay - I could start the game straight after choosing with no issue.  Just beware that you might have to choose a different font from the in-game menu.  No big deal though.\n\nStory wise, Harmonia touches upon themes that Key have covered before, and a lot of people have criticised it for being too close to Key's other kinetic novel Planetarian.  After playing Harmonia, I can both agree and disagree with elements of that comparison.  When you put it down on paper, the similarities are astonishing; both stories feature a post-apocalyptic world caused by human error, where the protagonist wanders a desolate Earth, dealing with phenomena like acid rain from atmosphere pollution and attack from roving bandits.  Both stories also feature a type of humanoid android/robot/computer that has survived events so far and is attempting to fulfil its original purpose.  Both stories also feature a theme of fixing or rebuilding physical objects.  Both stories ALSO feature the struggle for survival and the emotional connotations of trying to help people even if it seems pointless given certain circumstances.  After reading all that, you'll probably agree that it doesn't look good for Harmonia being an original, fresh experience.\n\nHowever, all of that being said, what makes Harmonia great in its own right is its story and characters.  Despite all of these similarities, as the story progressed and I was introduced to the different characters, their struggles and their experiences, I happily fell victim to what Key do best - making great, 3 dimensional, genuine and entrancing characters that you really grow to care about.  Despite noting myself at the beginning that the themes were similar to Planetarian, I quickly found myself forgetting about Planetarian completely and instead becoming attached to this group of characters that felt authentic and unique to Harmonia.  By the story ended, I felt like I'd really gone on a journey with these people and that it hadn't been like anything else, especially with the twist in the tale I did not suspect.  So in contrast to my earlier comparison, I genuinely recommend Harmonia because its story is its own, and it was very enjoyable.  Its CGs and soundtrack are also up to Key's usual memorable and effective par, and all in all, I'd say that Key are definitely on form with this kinetic novel.", "timestamp_created": 1511383695, "timestamp_updated": 1511383695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36427182": {"recommendationid": "36427182", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071257070", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 315, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1476942172}, "language": "finnish", "review": "A kinetic novel with a nice story that doesn't quite reach the heights of other Key visual novels.

I would recommend this to a first time VN reader.\n\nHarmonia is short visual novel with around 6 hours of read time. There are no choices to be made; it's simply a VN to read and experience. One thing I noticed immediately upon starting the game is that the UI seems rather old what with the overlay of text over the entire image. That's not something you see in a lot of VNs released recently. Thankfully, you can remove the text to see the CG or background simply by hitting the spacebar.\n\nThe art in Harmonia is very pretty apart from one quibble I have; that would be Madd\u2019s sprites. His nose is nonexistent and makes him look extremely unnatural. Everything else is fine and even beautiful, albeit it requires you to suspend your disbelief. For instance, how can Tipi have such long hair and wear such lovely clothes in this dystopian society? I know for sure that I wouldn\u2019t want hair that long in a setting like that\u2026it seems like too much work to take care of when I could be doing something else\u2026but perhaps that is a sign of her true strength.\n\nJokes aside, Harmonia itself is a somewhat sombre game. Whilst there are certainly slice of life elements, it's a tragedy novel at its heart, meant to make you cry. You'll probably be pleased to hear that the ending is actually happy, in a way that fits. It's not overly optimistic but it does fit the themes and it's at least somewhat \"realistic\", as far as realism can go.\n\nThe plot itself is decent but feels a little too similar to Planetarian. There were plot aspects and scenes I could guess simply from reading that VN previously. And, after reading Harmonia, I can say that in my opinion Planetarian is the better of the two, but your mileage may vary. Some aspects that seemed very strange while first reading Harmonia make sense later on after finishing the story and understanding everything.\n\nThe characters in Harmonia are competently written, though they don't have an astounding amount of depth and some are rather unabashedly cliche.\n\nThe soundtrack is hit or miss. Some tracks were very beautiful and fitting to the scene, while I simply didn't care for others.\n\nOverall, Harmonia is a decent visual novel that is a nice read, though I personally think Planetarian would be a better pick even with its shorter length.", "timestamp_created": 1505332351, "timestamp_updated": 1505332351, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493398", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34911641": {"recommendationid": "34911641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198356242134", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505289052}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5b98\u65b9\u4e2d\u6587\u8bf7\u613f\uff01\u767b\u9646PS4\u8bf7\u613f\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1505267556, "timestamp_updated": 1505267556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34736660": {"recommendationid": "34736660", "author": {"steamid": "76561198216095099", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 116, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504540687}, "language": "english", "review": "Another Key VN - I just can't bring myself to like their work. \n\nKey loves to make you cry and make these \"drama VNs\" - but tbh I couldn't even shed a single tear or even had a feeling of sadness while playing this one.

world has been devastated.  The land is dry and barren, the skies are continually sandy (when it's not raining), and humans struggle just to survive.  In Harmonia, you learn about this world from a boy later called Rei, and he awakens from a deep sleep in some sort of factory.  Upon gazing at his mechanical right hand, Rei comes upon the conclusion that he is a Phiroid, an android that looks like a human and is capable of exhibiting human emotions and feelings-pretty much can function as a human although the interior of Phiroids is clearly different from those of humans.  As Rei has woken up without experiencing emotions, he leaves the factory to search for humans who can help him experience them.  Along this journey, a girl named Shiona finds him and helps him to experience emotions along with a few notable townspeople whom Rei encounters and interacts with in the town where Shiona lives.  I'll leave off the summary at that, as I don't want to spoil anything and it's best to get the game and experience the story for yourself.  ;)\n\nNow on to my review of Harmonia.  I found the story to be very beautiful and moving, as Rei got to experience the feelings of joy, anger, sadness, etc.  I was really moved to see how much Rei wanted to help Shiona and the other townspeople-to bring smiles to their faces.  Especially towards the end, I was crying quite a lot and that's because [spoiler]Rei finally experienced love from Shiona and after Shiona died, Rei makes a vow to himself to find a world where humans and Phiroids could live happily together, as the world he is in now is one in which humans (in general) hate Phiroids because they lack love.[/spoiler]  If you've ever played planetarian~the reverie of a little planet~, then you'll understand the emotions that the devs of both games can bring out from those who experience these beautiful stories.  The art was beautiful and I really loved the music.  If there are any criticisms, they're technical things and only a couple of minor ones.  First, I had to play Harmonia in full screen mode because the windowed mode looked weird.  It was kind of difficult to view the game in windowed mode so I had to play it in full screen mode.  However, I think that Harmonia is better experienced in full screen mode so I don't consider this too much of a negative.  Also, when I started up the game, I had to choose a font which was weird since the font should be automatically installed in visual novels.  Fortunately, I was able to choose a font from which I could read the story and then it worked out fine.  Other than those two issues, I have no other criticisms.  I like how you can go back to replay certain chapters, and the CG gallery and music options are unlocked after you complete the game.\n\nOverall, I really loved Harmonia and it's definitely up there with some of my all-time favorite visual novels.  It's a story that will touch your heart, get you to experience feelings like Rei does, and it's definitely worth getting if you like visual novels and a wonderful, beautiful story.  ^^",

While it does not start with the most creative premise, the story soon becomes more complicated and endearing. Unfortunately the story is too short to accommodate for much character development, so most people end up as flat as they started. \n\nPerhaps also due to its brevity, the game is riddled with pacing issues. Individual chapters retain a very sharp focus on only one character at a time. Also, for the majority of the story very little is at stake. Suddenly everything ramps up at the last hour but then each problem neatly and quickly resolves itself. \n\n[b]Visual[/b]\nAnyone familiar with Key's other works will immediately notice a marked improvement on character portraits.

The characters are all drawn beautifully, but the same cannot be said with a lot of the locations; they seemed \u201caverage\u201d compared to the rest of the art work. \n\n[b]Storyline: 7/10[/b]\n\nIt is very much like planetarian from start to finish. It had a very similar setting (a futuristic, \u201cbroken\u201d world where survival is a priority) and the \u2018boy\u2019 coming across a town full of [spoiler]Phiriods[/spoiler] as does the main character from planetarian as he discovers a place where he finds a \u2018non-human\u2019. It\u2019s all too similar and I find that VisualArts/Key didn\u2019t try to come up with something a little different. But that\u2019s not to say that the entire story was \u201cbad\u201d and \u201ccopied over\u201d. Although, the first 5 chapters starts off slow. But it does pick up rather quickly from chapter 6 \u2013 8; almost too quickly because a lot of information gets told in a matter of lines and scenes. I really felt like they rushed the ending. Nonetheless, the story isn\u2019t bad, but it could\u2019ve done a lot better. \n\n[b]Sound: 9/10[/b]\n\nSimply amazing. It doesn\u2019t have that much soundtracks when I checked, but I was still impressed on how they used those soundtracks in the VN. Each specific scene had their own soundtrack depending on the situation. It\u2019s almost has if they were \u2018themes\u2019 dedicated to a character or location. \n\n[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]\n\nSlight issues with the font settings from the start (I fiddled almost 20 mins trying to figure out how to make the fonts even show up, as they could not be read). But once sorted, it was smooth sailing from there.

I've had mixed feelings about [i]key[/i]'s works in the past:  I loved Planetarian, Clannad, and Angel Beats, but wasn't so fond of Kanon, Little Busters and now Harmonia.\n\nThe theme this time is feelings or emotions.  Our protaganist has awoken without his, and most of the early story is about how he rediscovers various emotions.  Most of these chapters end up feeling disjointed, often focusing on a single character, which ends up hurting the pacing.  The end of the story is reminiscent of Planetarian, but feels more like they just needed a plot device to get to the reveal.  Once there, I found that reveal to be even more contrived than the reused plot device.  I do recognize that part of my dissatisfaction here was related to my understanding of the philosophical issues that they're trying to use as the foundation of their story, so it's likely to not be as annoying to most people.\n\nOther people have mentioned that Harmonia reminds them of Planetarian.  We have the post-apocalyptic future with only androids and humans remaining, but that was the end of the similarity for me.  While the setting is certainly a match, the story and characters in Planetarian have more depth than was managed here.  Each character is pretty much limited to a single emotion for the entire story, which makes it hard to grow really attached to any of them.  [i]key[/i]'s works focus on getting the audience to invest in the characters; so if you don't or can't empathize with the characters, the stories just aren't satisfying.\n\nThe artwork was wonderful.  Most of it retains a slight pencil & watercolor look to it instead of looking purely digital.  They also added an subtle effect of moving pencil shading over the images, which I particularly liked for some reason.  The music was simple but sweet and generally fit the scene.  However, I didn't come away terribly attached to it.  Having the full soundtrack for DLC would be nice, but I'm not going to miss it.  The one thing that consistantly annoyed me about the music was that they waited unitl the very end of the game to use the main theme song with vocals.  Despite multiple scenes where it would have been applicable and could have been used to better effect.  Instead it was tossed in at the climax to try to make the ending as emotional as possible.  Disappointingly, we were not given subtitles for the main theme, though we do get them for the ending theme song.\n\nOverall, I don't think it was a bad game--I've seen much worse for more money--but it's not one I'd really recommend either.  $10 for a short novel is reasonable, but the story was just too weak for my tastes.\n\nNote:  Look in the Harmonia\\bgm folder for an Ogg Vorbis version of the soundtrack.", "timestamp_created": 1483225354, "timestamp_updated": 1483227030, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.665017", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28872128": {"recommendationid": "28872128", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158339108", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 516, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483195346}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5267\u60c5\u5f88\u8d5e\uff01[spoiler]\u548c\u661f\u4e4b\u68a6\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c[/spoiler][spoiler] \u540e\u9762\u90a3\u4e00\u53cd\u8f6c\u867d\u7136\u4e4b\u524d\u770b\u51fa\u70b9\u7aef\u502a\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u60f3\u5230\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff01[/spoiler]\n\u97f3\u4e50\u5f88\u8d5e\uff01[spoiler] Harmonia\u4e00\u8bcd\uff0c\u53cc\u5173\u7684\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u5c42\u610f\u4e49\u5e94\u8be5\u5c31\u662f\u8d2f\u7a7f\u5168\u7bc7\u7684\u90a3\u9996\u6b4c\u66f2\uff01[/spoiler]\n\u8fd8\u6709\u753b\u98ce\u753b\u9762\u4e5f\u633a\u8d5e\uff01\n\n\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u7b49\u6211\u9000\u51fa\u8d24\u8005\u6a21\u5f0f\u540e\u518d\u5199\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1483197615, "timestamp_updated": 1483197615, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28736241": {"recommendationid": "28736241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015754860", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482887345}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is about Tipi", "timestamp_created": 1482893174, "timestamp_updated": 1482893174, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28634809": {"recommendationid": "28634809", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070471217", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 405, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482676519}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 A visual novel as beautiful as you can get.", "timestamp_created": 1482675924, "timestamp_updated": 1482675924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28621816": {"recommendationid": "28621816", "author": {"steamid": "76561198107677088", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495940842}, "language": "english", "review": "I purchased it when it was released.

Unlike many people, I didn't LOVE Planetarian, and this seemed like it was going to be Planetarian 2.0. It kind of is, both stories are post-apocolyptic robot fantasy dramas, but Harmonia to me is far more interesting. It deals with a lot of new subject matters for Key, particularly the nature of being human and how we as a species treat the earth we live on. It's not the same old visual novel stuff, it feels fresh, whilst still retaining that classic Key feel. \nThere were many poignant moments and a great plot twist. I have mixed feelings on the ending looking back, but it was definitely very interesting and unexpected. I'd recommend Harmonia to a visual novel virgin, it's a well-paced impactful story, and I'm glad I've finally experienced it.", "timestamp_created": 1479869343, "timestamp_updated": 1479869343,

"language": "english", "review": "Harmonia is a very short Visual Novel by Key, one of most popular and successful VN developers in the business. It's a short story about the relationships between humans and androids in a post-apocalyptic earth. It's a very well executed game, with wonderful production values, memorable music, and some really wonderful HD visuals, but the writing is clumsy at parts. The whole moral of the story, which is intrinsically tied to a rather obvious plot twist, comes across and very forced to an unbelievable degree. I understand that the game isn't very long, so they didn't have much time to flesh out the smaller details, but I found it very hollow and flat.\n\nHarmonia could be said to be a spiritual successor of sorts to Key's previous short VN, Planetarian, which I do believe is the better game, and would recommend reading before this one. Planetarian was another short, atmospheric story, but I found the themes to be better handled in that one. I must admit, however, that Harmonia is one gorgeous game- Probably the most beautiful looking and sounding Key game on Steam, and I think the eye-candy alone is worth the price of admission.", "timestamp_created": 1478111377, "timestamp_updated": 1478111377, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26329805": {"recommendationid": "26329805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340093988", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 71, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505460275}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u6211\u60f3\u95ee\u4e00\u4e0b...\u6709\u65e5\u8bed\u5b57\u5e55\u5417QAQ", "timestamp_created": 1477889267, "timestamp_updated": 1477889267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26320634": {"recommendationid": "26320634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302661509", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477846868}, "language": "english", "review": "Very creative visual novel that explores the concept of artificial intelligence, feelings, and the future of mankind.

The story follows Rei's interactions and development of emotions (which he has lost) and his understanding of new feelings... but he can't help shake the feeling something is wrong, the towns people seem off time to time and Shiona seems to be hiding something, and then there is the lonely girl Tipi...\n\nThe story essentially breaks into 3 small Arcs, Madd, Tipi and Shiona (though Shiona's and Tipi's are sort of merged into a close one, these 3 arcs also are the highlight of the game, for spoiler reasons i wont mention what is what with them but they are essentially your onion cutting moments. The ending for me was great, tear jerking and well told, you really felt like you was involved in the scene and if you have grown to like the characters, you will likely be shedding them tears here, the game does offer and additional epilouge which i felt was a bit 'meh', most commend it greatly and love it but i feel it ruins the previous scenes. \n\nThe art in Harmonia is brilliant to say the least, especially the character designs, i can be picky at times over what i like when looking at characters but this game did an amazing job, this goes equally for sound, the sound commonly sets the mood very well and even when you are in no special situation, you get a feel for the world around you just by the sound.\n\nI wont deny, the game does get off to a slowish start, which it isn't bad, it doesn't really pull you in either, in fact, the Library was the first trigger to my attention as Tipi actually got me interested in her, especially when you see others reactions to seeing her. Needless to say, whilst the first chapter might not be the most interesting, don't knock the game, things get into full swing here and you will find yourself curiously addidicted to finding out what happens. \n\nAs a whole, for the small price you pay for the game i would deffinetly recommend it, the game seems to average an average of about 6-8 hours gameplay (i have played it twice but don't let my time deiceve you, i had no net at first so it didn't log the hours) and the first was about 6-7hours with the second being a little longer (probably due to breaks) but it is 7 hours of great emotional story tellings you wont want to miss.", "timestamp_created": 1476736078, "timestamp_updated": 1476736078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26086984": {"recommendationid": "26086984", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064441627", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480058540}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e5f\u4e0d\u8bf4\u4e86~\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e74\u6b20\u7684\u94b1\u6536\u597d\uff01", "timestamp_created": 1476713473, "timestamp_updated": 1476713473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26074167": {"recommendationid": "26074167", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065776960", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480357713}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't help but compare this to Planetarian.

nada que ver ni cerca, es buscarle el pelo al huevo, la postura del protagonista y de la chica en la historia, que haya mas de 2 personajes, ya es una experiencia totalmente diferente.\n\nno suelo comprar visual novels, pero le tengo mucho aprecio a key, y como agradecimiento del lanzamiento en ingles antes de que salga en japones tuve q hacerlo, como para que de este lado del mundo sepan que tambi\u00e9n apoyamos su trabajo\n\nlos sentimientos es algo importante en la plot, te hace dudar de muchas cosas de la historia constantemente. si los personajes est\u00e1n enojados los sent\u00eds, si est\u00e1n tristes, si est\u00e1n felices.\nmismo el protagonista, representa muy bien sus sentimientos y te los transmite a la perfecci\u00f3n con palabras. \nalguien que esta siempre feliz, alguien que esta siempre enojado, alguien que esta siempre triste, te cruzas con personajes que parecen ser representaciones de los sentimientos a la perfecci\u00f3n\n\nla kinetic novel juega con tus propios sentimientos tambi\u00e9n, las razones del protagonista que lo hacen ir hacia adelante, como una persona que no sabe nada de sentimientos busca que todos sonr\u00edan porque entiende que cuando ellos sonr\u00eden, \u00e9l se siente bien. y en eso se basa la novela, en \u00e9l yendo de personaje en personaje realizando acciones peque\u00f1as pero muy importantes para que el resto sea feliz\n\nlos dibujos de los personajes, con peque\u00f1os trazos negros como si fueran dibujados con lapiz (as\u00ed parecidos a los del juego valkyria chronicles) son perfectos para la est\u00e9tica de la visual novel, y que tengan movimientos y no est\u00e9n est\u00e1ticos tambi\u00e9n hace a los personajes muy vivos\n\nlos tonos de gris, de sombra y luz es muy importante\n\nen cuanto a los dise\u00f1os de personajes, madd no me gusto,no esta muy detallado comparado con el resto. pero en general est\u00e1n bien \n\nlas voces son perfectas y la m\u00fasica tambi\u00e9n, tipi act\u00faa muy bien no la hab\u00eda escuchado en visual novels.\ntipi es un personaje que habla, la vez, y ya te pones a llorar, te rompe el alma y no sabes porque, y eso tambi\u00e9n es un poco el juego que hace esta visual novel con vos, cuando shiona esta en pantalla estas feliz, estas alegre, cuando tipi esta no, la m\u00fasica, el ambiente y los personajes juegan con tu coraz\u00f3n\n\ntiene onda como kinetic novel, no se si garpaba para tener desiciones\n\nno le encontr\u00e9 algo como para criticarla, la historia quiz\u00e1s es lo mas flojo comparandola con el resto de los apartados que te ofrece el juego pero eso no es hablar mal de la historia, que es coherente y firme\n\nsiempre me mantuvo atrapado, en ning\u00fan momento flaqueo, no tiene muchas idas y vueltas al pedo, todo esta bien guionado y armado\n\nuno tiene mas sentimientos cuando se enfrenta a los sentimientos de otras personas.\n\nlas cgs son lindos aunque escasos\n\nmucho de la historia gira en torno a la analog\u00eda de \"reparar lo que esta roto\" que hace feliz a las personas y sobre el amor, la capacidad de amar.\n\na la mitad maso menos te empiezan a poner incomodo algunas situaciones, con suspenso, empez\u00e1s a no entender a los personajes, hay cosas que te ocultan, que no te dicen, eso hace a la kinetic novel mas y mas atrapante.\n\nla historia tiene un pacing tranquilo, no te presenta un camino fijo la verdad as\u00ed que no esperas a que se termine de golpe, los primeros cap\u00edtulos son mucho mas largos que el resto, y realmente el final me gusto mucho, no por los giros si no por como cerraron las cosas realmente\n\ncomo persona que habla los 3 idiomas, ingles/japones/espa\u00f1ol, hay algunas cosas que se pierden en la traducci\u00f3n, pero escuchando a los personajes se entiende mejor.\n\nvale mucho la pena.\n\nsi les interesan mas analisis sobre juegos o animes no duden en buscar mi pagina de facebook A-1 Pergo o seguirme en twitter /elpergo @elpergo",

VN's, but I still think Planetarian is in a league of its own despite its age, regardless I think if you like one you'll certainly like the other.\n\n8/10\n\nShinji Orito once again graces us with a soundtrack for this kinetic novel, which sits quite nicely, even when it takes the centre stage it stands up on its own, but it might do so too often for some, seems like its just the one song that gets the limelight, that said gotta praise the background music, it wasnt at all intrusive and fits the setting nicely, but then again maybe its too subtle if you compare to other Key works which isnt fair agaist 30+ hour VNs like Clannad but against its predecesor Planetarian seems like its been toned down, all the same flavour (every other song is a music box), even with Ryo Mizutsuki's compositions in the mix, or it could be said flows together from one scene too the next very smoothly depending on your on perspective.\n\nThe Art is well suited for the setting, it gives off a rustic, shadowy, post-apocalyptic feel with the shading and yet at the same time manages to keep the brightness of the characters that we see in most VN's giving their expressions that bit of shine to them, along with the backgrounds are particle effects working its magic in the right places to bring the scenes to life and a colour palate to match a dry lifeless world. Although there is one instance of animation throw in which feels quite out of place overall impressions are good. \n\nThe story is well planned, but as some have said the characters at times feel 1 dimensional like theyve just been rolled in without giving them a great sense of depth despite spending time exploring the characters backgrounds, interacting with them throughout and giving them distinct personalities which play into the story it doesnt give a lot of (unforced) memorable drama or tension between them, however the story alway kept me guessing at what is going to happen next although some event are foreshadowed quite obviously the reveals are moments of clarity that you can guess at but not quite reach, hovering just on the edge of your thoughts, a sort of play on the ego that has the potential to leave one feeling quite profound, making it very fun to follow from start to finish.\n\nNot sure how I feel about the shifting layout, yes it fits, its in the right place for each scene but personally Im not a fan of a text box covering the image (as seen in the images been shown) and having to press space bar just to check it out, then fiddling with autoplay wondering if its working on not, squinting to see if the brightness has changed on the symbol made it a little arkward.\n\nA solid VN from Key, and as always a tear jearking story, but hmmm, if I had to say Harmonia or Lucy: The Eternity She Wished For... then, Planetarian... quite hard not to compare the two Key Kinetic novels and when I think of Anderoids/Phiroids in VNs on Steam I also think of Lucy despite it not being a kinetic novel for me a comparison is unavoidable especially with them being the same price, At the end of the day Harmonia comes 3rd place out of these but this doesnt make it a bad VN and is certainly worth experiencing.\n\nMaybe I've made it sound a bit harsh I'd still give it a respectable 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1475920981, "timestamp_updated": 1475921190,

Overtime he reaches a town with people and starts living in the towns church. He attempts to hide his robotic nature so he can be of service to humans, but lacks emotions making it a complicated issue, the story takes you on a journey to discover these emotions and why they are significant while also showing us how to care for each other. It emphasizes good intentions even when it may not always seem to be, but the world heavily contrasts these emotional states. May it be caring for people of the town or strangers, the town gives this warmness, but the world shows only the reverse. \n \nAlike to the above mentioned Planitarian the reverie of a little planet, this story focuses not on the robots or humans. Rather the story is about helping one another. Alike to Planitarian the main character only wishes to provide the most help he can give, at times neglecting himself. As the story progresses emotions change and so does the town and its people as they all grow to some extent. Though there is not much interactivity for the reader being a kinetic visual novel, it's easy to see from the main characters point of view, which in turn allows not only just the characters to go on this adventure, but the reader as well. When in comparison to Keys other works this one is clearly one to grab. My other recommendations include Planitarian my favorite of Keys works, which is now also a film and anime. You also have their biggest and most popular creation Clannad and its addition Tomoyo After, which also have been made into multiple animes and other medias.  You also have Angle Beats and Charlotte which though are amazing are primarily animes. \n \nIn conclusion, this game has the same impact that Key is known for with their Kinetic novels making you feel strong emotions primarily sadness which causes the Novel to be a great and fond memory for the readers. Along with the professional design of the stories many parts including the music, art, and voice. You are sure to have an entertaining and engrossing read that stimulates your mind to think and continue reading till finished. Lastly I would once more like to recommend Planitarian: the Reverie of a little planet, the shortest Key novel, but I think the gem in the rough. Alike to the others it carries the amazing story along with the above elements. Specifically I like to note that the music will never leave your memory after playing it. Planitarian though having no connection in lore to this game goes hand in hand due to their closeness in themes and their design. \n \nThank you for reading this review and I hope that you will find as much joy as I did with this product.\n I also like to thank Key for another job well done.", "timestamp_created": 1475484213, "timestamp_updated": 1475484213, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.599931", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25824942": {"recommendationid": "25824942", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081735165", "num_games_owned": 145, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 8, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475428588}, "language": "schinese", "review": "key\u793e\u7684\nVisualArts/Key Present\n\u7b49\u6c49\u5316\u7b97\u4e86\u2026\u2026\u770b\u7684\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u61c2\u7136\u800c\u4e0d\u4e60\u60ef\n\u6211\u4e3a\u9ebb\u5b50\u548ckey +1s", "timestamp_created": 1475428798, "timestamp_updated": 1475428913, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500227", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25810913": {"recommendationid": "25810913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067557091", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 458, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475363605}, "language": "english", "review": "I read Harmonia, and... I'm not really sure how I feel about it.

The story was... mmm, short but meaningful.\nI read Harmonia mostly because some of the illustrations drew me in and, given that I enjoyed most of Key's other VNs (I read Little Busters!, Clannad and Rewrite) Harmonia being released on Steam gave me a chance to support Key in their latest endeavors without buying something I've already read.\nWrapping up I can say Harmonia was short, but good. It took me about 8 hours to finish it, but you can definitely finish it in less. It felt a little like a children's tale for the first 4 or so chapters, but then abruptly got a bit heavier. Should you buy it? If you like Key's works then yes you should, their stories have gotten me through some tough times. :) If you haven't read a Key VN/KN before, and you're on the fence, then Harmonia might not be a bad place to start, it definitely has a distinct Keyesque style and might give you an idea of what to expect from their longer works.\nThat being said I hope this review was helpful to you in some way and have a good one.", "timestamp_created": 1475367889, "timestamp_updated": 1475368485, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502712", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25805880": {"recommendationid": "25805880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055090237", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475375652}, "language": "english", "review": "[spoiler]Fallout 4 if synth was anime[/spoiler] or [spoiler]real spoiler here[/spoiler][spoiler]If japan finally can makes true lovable android robot[/spoiler]\n\nIf you want feels, you can get it here\nIf you want lolis, you'll get one too\n\nHarmonia is a kinetic novel based on a post apocalyptic world, which have a very good linear story, no choice, no route, but that what makes it best of what it was, it gives you the best storytelling possible, the first four chapter while a little bit boring it's great because it's mainly for developing character and supporting the real good impact on the last bit of the series.\n\nAll and all i can recommend this to anyone that really want to have that feels or just need a good short (kind of) reading materials\n\nAnd i think it will be a good 2 cour (around 24 episodes) of *ahem* anime since the character development is a bit long for you to care about.", "timestamp_created": 1475347333, "timestamp_updated": 1479959313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579861", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25805252": {"recommendationid": "25805252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006455520", "num_games_owned": 950, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 442, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475342642}, "language": "english", "review": "Harmonia is short kinetic visual novel (without choices) from renowed studio Key.\nIt tells sad story of phiroid (companion android) who wakes up in some derelic medical facility into harsh post apocalyptic world. \n\nFirst like 2/3 of game arent very exiting and it mostly consist of protagonist learning about emotions.

Rewrite and Little Busters! are some of my favorite games of all time (despite them just being Visual Novels). I have played most, if not all, of the Key Visual novels (aside from the extremely heavy adult ones because playing the 18+ version of Kanon almost ruined one of my favorite characters.).  \n\nWhen I heard about Harmonia, I was pretty excited to see that It would be getting an official English release on steam, not that it matters to me since I can competently read Japanese.  With English being my native tough, however, there are certainly times when reading a Japanese text can leave me a little lost (mostly due to slang and wordplay).  Unlike many of the Key library, Harmonia is a Kinetic Novel; you don't have any choices, you just read, look and listen.  Also, like Planetarian before it, it is quite short clocking in at about 3-6 hours depending on how fast you read. \n\nThe music is quite amazing, as expected of Key; there are some extremely strong tracks here that are very memorable and really good at setting the mood.  The story follows the usual Key formulae of being a \"crying game\".  The first few acts are slow and mainly for character development. The final few acts are where the emotional \"shit hits the fan\", as they say.  The voice acting is superb as expected and the art is very impactful with some panels being extremely vivid and memorable. Character design follows the typical \"moe\" style that Key is known for though don't be fooled; the characters are designed this way so that you will grow attached much easier.  Then when the story decides to rip your heart out of your chest and stamp on it multiple times you will be even more devastated.        \n\nIf you like Key and like visual novels then this is definitely worth it at 7 dollars.

Fondos: Algo simplones a mi parecer, pero con la animaci\u00f3n en segundo plano (normalmente polvo desplazandose) les da m\u00e1s vida\n[*] Sin animaciones: s\u00f3lo tenemos a final de cuentas unos sprays \"fijos\", a la vieja usanza.\n[*] Barata: 10\u20ac... 10 m\u00edseros \u20ac de precio base, no est\u00e1 mal.\n[*] Corta: He tardado 5h en completarla tranquilamente.\n[*] Lacrim\u00f3gena,

Everything about the production is top-notch. From the visuals to the music to the voice acting, Key is in top-form here. The concept and characterization are both exceptional.\n\nIt's a shame that in the end, the story fails to deliver.\n\nWhich is unfortunate, because everything preceding the story's conclusion is amazingly well-executed. Our main character, who is desperately in search of a way to fix his absent emotions, is a compelling, earnest lead whose desire to help those around him fit his background. The upbeat, yet level-headed Shinoa is a perfect compliment to this goal. The reclusive librarian, Tipi, and the grumpy owner of a general store, Madd, both provide interesting contrats and conclusions one can make from Rei's straightforward, earnest attempt at friendship. Better yet, the story takes several surpsing, yet well-foreshadowed twists that will catch even the most savvy of readers off-guard.\n\nHowever... The ending is emotionally tone-deaf. It has no respect for the events in the earlier portion of the story, presenting readers with an over-the-top resolution that is intended to be immensely satisfying, yet flies in the face of the grounded narrative the story tries to steep itself into.\n\nRegardless, it's definitely worth a read. Harmonia is an experience I won't soon forget. However, in spite of it's good intentions, the ending casts an unfortunate hue on everything building up to it...", "timestamp_created": 1474831211, "timestamp_updated": 1474854958, "voted_up": true,

"[h1]Pros[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Soundtrack[/b] --- Memorable tracks that set the atmosphere for each scene.\n\t[*][b]Art style[/b] --- Excellent and sharp. The art in Key's works continues to improve. Subtle movement of the pencil lines in the character CGs is a nice touch.\n\t[*][b]Sound effects[/b] --- Effects play in scenes with some action that help enhance the atmosphere.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Characters[/b] --- There are three main characters, not including the main protagonist. While two of them are charming and well written considering the limited time for development, the other has a very disappointing presence in the story. Their arc is quickly resolved within the first half when they could have had a major and more appropriate presence in the finale.\n\t\n\tAs for the main character, his limited personality is due to plot constraints. However, there doesn't seem to be consistency with how he acquires emotions. Some of his epiphanies are repeated which makes the whole process seem irrelevant in the long run despite it playing into the main theme.\n\t[*][b]Writing[/b] --- For the most part great and up to the same standard as previous Key novels. In the final few chapters, however, when the plot becomes the main focus of the story instead of the character interactions, a certain group of characters' banter and the main character's internal dialogue is of noticeably lower quality.\n\n\tThe main theme of the story is clear, but the message that the reader is told to take away following a certain event is openly repeated through the main character, who up to that point has remained neutral about the state of the world. It would have been best left to the reader to come to their own conclusions about that particular event.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n[list]\n\t[*][b]Overarching plot & setting[/b] --- Not the main point of Harmonia. The main focus is on the characters. The plot itself is nothing new, and when it does become a driving force in the last half, it comes across as more extreme and jarring than what was needed to get the characters to their destinations.\n\t[*][b]Pacing[/b] --- While the length on its own (6 hours) is fine, the story pacing suffers as a result, especially towards the end.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nHarmonia is a short, linear novel roughly [b]6 hours[/b] in length. It has everything that Key is renowned for; introspective characters, atmospheric soundtrack, and writing.\n\nHarmonia definitely seems like a spiritual successor to Planetarian, Key's other kinetic novel that was roughly the same length. Perhaps too similar. The setting is the same: a post-apocalyptic future where robot servants are struggling to cope with the reality that the remnants of humanity are on an inevitable course for extinction. Even certain plot points are repeated exactly as they occurred in Planetarian.\n\nWhat sets Harmonia apart from Planetarian are the characters. Whereas Planetarian centered on an odd couple, a soldier with no hope for a future and a girl whose mind was stuck in the past when humanity's future still seemed bright, Harmonia brings together a small cast of characters who must come to terms with their limited set of emotions as they interact with one another.\n\nThe missteps that Harmonia makes are a combination of short length and poor plot decisions. It might have been best to remove one of the characters entirely if only to give more time to the other two. The emotional impact of the finale is still there, just as it has been in other Key novels, but the events immediately leading up to it aren't satisfying and the resolutions to the characters are delivered in rapid succession.\n\nOverall, Harmonia is still decent enough to check out if you're a fan of the genre or Key's previous works. Those who played Planetarian may find it a retread and will want to base their decision on how much they enjoyed that story.\n\nUnless you're a major fan of Key who can't wait to read this story, it's best to [b]buy Harmonia when it's on sale[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1474793579, "timestamp_updated": 1481401074, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504161", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25686283": {"recommendationid": "25686283", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098631837", "num_games_owned": 340, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481030962}, "language": "schinese", "review": "key\u793e15\u5468\u5e74\u4f5c\u54c1\u4e70\u4e70\u4e70\uff0c\u7ba1\u5b83\u6c49\u5316\u8fd8\u51fa\u6765\u6ca1\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5148\u5145\u503c\u4e00\u6ce2\u4fe1\u4ef0\u518d\u8bf4\u3002\u795d\u798f\u5927\u9b54\u738b\u5c3d\u65e9\u5eb7\u590d", "timestamp_created": 1474788714, "timestamp_updated": 1474788714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25685775": {"recommendationid": "25685775", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990248552", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474786257}, "language": "english", "review": "KEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!\n\nIf you are on the fence, I urge you, take the plunge. \n\nHarmonia is a powerful, if quick, glimpse into the beautiful form that are Key games.

When it was announced to be coming to Steam in English alongside CLANNAD's English release before being released in Japan, I was excited beyond belief. It was a very unexpected move on VisualArt's part, but a welcome one nonetheless. I knew I would be buying the game Day 1. But the game was constantly delayed due to various conflicts, until finally the game reached the quality VA expected from it.\n\nSo was Harmonia worth the wait? Well, let's look at the story first. A young Phiroid with no memories of the past awakes from cryogenic sleep, and seeks out civilization in order to find humans to serve. He stumbles across the residence of one Shiona, a priestess who takes him in and names him Rei. Quickly growing attached to Shiona's infectuous smile, he decides to help her as she sings to the townspeople and makes them happy. But there are some in the town who are not as happy, and Rei takes it upon himself to solve their lingering regrets.\n\nI won't spoil the rest of the story, but while it does take some pages from previous Key games to make it more accessible to their audience, it does become something all its own. I can at least say that it's a shorter and easier read than Planetarian, although don't let that dissuade you from checking the story out. It's a hard sci-fi story that knows what it wants to do and accomplishes it fairly well, although personally, I've seen this same kind of story before on a few occasions.\n\nEach of the four principal characters leaves an impression upon the reader, setting up an allegory to drive the novel's message of cherishing the human trait of emotion. Shiona represents happiness and warmth, Madd represents anger and stubbornness, and Tipi represents sadness and loneliness. Rei is the vessel that receives these feelings and emotions, learning through his own common sense what is good and what is bad for these individuals. Out of all the characters, Tipi is definitely my favorite, and it's not just because she's a loli~ :P\n\nThe artwork is unique among Harmonia's elder siblings, as it has more of a stencil drawing feel to it. I praised Sepia Tears for this same unique take on spritework, but Harmonia shows you how the professionals do it. The pencil gradient adorning each character sprite moves subtly, giving them an earthen, sketchy feel. Considering that the outside world is very dirty and polluted in Harmonia, this makes sense storywise. Itaru Hinoue's art in general has always been beautiful regardless of how old the game might be, and while she left VisualArt's a few days ago at the time of this review, this could be counted as a fantastic swan song to her days with Key. I wish her luck in her further endeavors, and hopefully this won't be the last time we see her work in a Key game.\n\nThe music is also worthy of note. With Key's in-house composer Shinji Orito and freelance prodigy Ryou Mizutsuki at the helm, the soundtrack is almost exactly what I expect from them. The music paints a picture of a desolate world that yearns to a single ray of hope, and it also captures every emotion Rei experiences while in the town or the outside world. I feel Mizutuski's pieces are much better composed than Orito's, and that's usually been the case even in Rewrite, but here it's especially noticeable. Not that Orito's music in this game is bad, but it pales compared to Mizutsuki-san's softer, simpler tracks.\n\nHarmonia is not a perfect visual novel by any means, but it's a pretty darn good one. It has every right to stand with its elder brethren in the hearts of many a Key fan, and I'm glad it was brought over to English-speaking countries, even if it took a while to get here. If you are a Key fan, you likely already have this game. But for those who have no clue who Key is or have any passing interest in Key, do I recommend this visual novel to you? Almost certainly yes. Be prepared to cry, though. This is one journey you will not come back from emotionally unscathed. :)", "timestamp_created": 1474771500, "timestamp_updated": 1474771500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25679550": {"recommendationid": "25679550", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091098497", "num_games_owned": 5003, "num_reviews": 374, "playtime_forever": 366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477783771}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as planetarian but still worth your time/money.", "timestamp_created": 1474753637, "timestamp_updated": 1474753637, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25677757": {"recommendationid": "25677757", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052214558", "num_games_owned": 264, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 291, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474746967}, "language": "english", "review": "Harmonia made me feel Orange, then Blue, then Orange again, powapowa.", "timestamp_created": 1474747089, "timestamp_updated": 1474747089, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25676629": {"recommendationid": "25676629", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025301333", "num_games_owned": 64, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 155, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474681884}, "language": "english", "review": "The whole game is barely 3 hours long and feels like a rehash of planetarian, with a similar setting, similar developments, and a similar message.

This visual novel has no choices so you just get to enjoy the ride in one way. Finished reading this. I must say I immensely enjoyed it. \n\nStory\n- Post-apocalyptic setting about a boy who wakes up with no memories. Yes, we know it's kind of tropey or not that unique but the way the story builds up definitely makes up for it. The pacing may seem a bit quick as there are little to no fillers for this novel. I frankly believe it's enough for anyone to digest what's happening in the story.\n\nSound\n- Normal ambient music that accompanies whatever is happening in the screen. And does it's job well.\n- BGMs. I think this is probably the strongest part of the novel as it accompanies the scenes well. If you're familiar with previous Key games, you know what to expect as I think Key's in-house music people are the same people responsible for the music in this novel. I'd buy the BGMs as DLC if it were even possible.\n- Character voices is fine. I'm not really into voices but I felt the voices done here were done well as it kinda ties with what's happening. No spoilers but you'd kinda get it if you trek the novel all the way through the end.\n- It's not a Key novel if it doesn't have any orgel/music box in it. I'm a sucker for anything like those.\n\nGraphics\n- Well, graphics aren't really the main point of the VNs but I do like the character designs for it to fit in this novel. Itaru's doing the characters so there's that.\n\nCharacters\n- I think this is the part where it doesn't shine as well as the other aspects of the novel. It felt like the characters weren't that fleshed out very well but nevertheless, it's just enough for you to know and care about them. I've mentioned how the novel has little to no filler so that may be a reason for it.\n\nOthers\n- I don't think it's fair to compare this Planetarian as this one is more about feelings rather than Planetarian's tone of hopelessness (how I felt it). But they do share something common, I guess.\n- I remember Planetarian to be longer. Though that may be because I used to read slower back then.\n- No JP text. So if you happen to be an elitist or just take into consideration that JP text is a must, I'd advise you to skip this or at least wait if they will ever implement JP text in this novel.\n- Can't complain about translation as there is nothing to compare to.

The story begins with you as an emotionless human android (Phiroids) awaken on an abandoned factory, wishing to serve humans to prove your own existence. BUT due to the population of humans declining in a rapid speed, the world is now a wasteland without any signs of life. Later on, something happened [b]*no spoilers*[/b] and you met a girl singing on the other side of door lay a chapel. You started to live with her, exposed to different kinds of emotions trying to learn what it makes you to be more \"human\"...\n\n\n[h1] Should you buy it? [/h1] \n\nI would say YES, the VN itself focus on human emotions. From Happy to Sad, the color of emotions, how would you react to it and so on and ever. I really enjoy every second of it.

As long as you are there, the people will enjoy peace, and I hope I can be the one like you.\"So I want to be a real human like you.\nKeyClub\u2019s games have a special magic that can make you cured after ending the games.It\u2019s the same with this one.Relaxing plot,wonderful music and sweet voice.all of them can keep you sucked in it.tears brim over,smiles of happiness and relief.It makes me believe that the life will better as I expect all the time.", "timestamp_created": 1516516633, "timestamp_updated": 1516516633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39480674": {"recommendationid": "39480674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198403016164", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 497, "last_played": 1516447165}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u82f1\u8bed\u80fd\u6709\u9ad8\u8003\u6c34\u5e73\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u9762\u786c\u4e0a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e0d\u80fd\u8bf4\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u8bcd\u90fd\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u770b\u61c2\u4e2a\u4e03\u516b\u5341\u4e5f\u5c31\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\uff0c\u65e5\u5f0f\u82f1\u8bed\u8fd8\u662f\u50cf\u4ee5\u5f80\u4e00\u6837\u64cd\u86cb\uff0c\u770b\u5f97\u6211\u86cb\u75bc\u3002\u597d\u4f5c\u54c1\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u6211\u5723\u8bde\u7279\u60e0\u5165\u7684\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e3b\u9898\u66f2\u624d\u5341\u51e0\u5757\u94b1\uff0c\u5c11\u5403\u4e00\u987f\u996d\u7684\u4e8b\u3002\u5c31\u4e0d\u5267\u900f\u4e86\uff0c\u53cd\u6b63\u6211\u770b\u5b8c\u4e4b\u540e\u662f\u6709\u70b9\u96be\u53d7\u7684\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1516447570, "timestamp_updated": 1516447570, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}}

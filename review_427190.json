Jogar pela primeira vez com level 1, \u00e9 algo frustrante, o Frank \u00e9 muito lento e o dano dele \u00e9 bem baixo, mas depois de zerar uma vez ou pegar level voc\u00ea vai poder jogar de novo e tentar fazer todas as miss\u00f5es. A intera\u00e7\u00e3o com o cen\u00e1rio \u00e9 incr\u00edvel, voc\u00ea consegue brincar com literalmente tudo no shopping.\n\nAgora o ponto que todo mundo reclama e tenho que concordar, Dead Rising nunca teve uma I.A boa, mas esse aqui ganha o pr\u00eamio da pior I.A feita para um jogo, n\u00e3o importa o level do seu personagem, sempre vai ser uma dor de cabe\u00e7a resgatar os npcs.\n\nDead Rising 2 foi o primeiro que joguei da franquia, eu gostei tanto que comprei o 3, s\u00f3 que ele n\u00e3o me agradou tanto igual o 2, e quando lan\u00e7ou Dead Rising para PC em 2016, eu comprei e percebi que depois dele a franquia s\u00f3 foi caindo. N\u00e3o que o 2 e 3 sejam jogos ruins, mas n\u00e3o chegam nem perto do carinho que tiveram para fazer o primeiro jogo.\n\nComo por exemplo, o enredo do 1 \u00e9 o melhor da franquia, o enredo do 2 \u00e9 fraco com personagens nada marcantes, e o 3 tem personagens ok s\u00f3 que cheio de furos e desculpas ao longo do jogo. Dead Rising 1 fala sobre o consumo de carne dos americanos, que estavam consumindo muito r\u00e1pido que n\u00e3o estava dando tempo dos animais nascerem, mas \u00e9 melhor jogar para entender.\n\nEu prefiro a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o do Dead Rising 1 do que os outros pelo simples motivo de ser mais realista, e n\u00e3o \u00e9 algo extravagante igual o 2. O tema de terror psicol\u00f3gico e drama ajuda a melhorar o enredo do jogo, um clima muito mais triste do que qualquer outro Dead Rising, at\u00e9 mesmo do que o 3, que s\u00f3 n\u00e3o \u00e9 o mais dram\u00e1tico porque a hist\u00f3ria principal vira algo muito infantil em certas partes. Dead Rising 1 \u00e9 o jogo com o enredo mais pesado de toda a franquia.\n\nO jogo \u00e9 dif\u00edcil, e para muitos vai ter partes injustas, tempos nas miss\u00f5es, Psicopatas, e muita coisa vai aparecer at\u00e9 voc\u00ea chegar em algum final de Dead Rising. Mas \u00e9 o mais bem feito de toda a franquia, porque depois daqui o jogo vai piorando aos poucos at\u00e9 chegar no Dead Rising 4 que todos sabemos como \u00e9 \"bom\" aquele jogo.", "timestamp_created": 1519573948, "timestamp_updated": 1519574129, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40371759": {"recommendationid": "40371759", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078818972", "num_games_owned": 190, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 1596, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1492323053}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good.", "timestamp_created": 1519515361, "timestamp_updated": 1519515361, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40260096": {"recommendationid": "40260096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110935733", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520060847}, "language": "english", "review": "     This is an amazing port of the game with everything (from what I know) intact.

Ever since I downloaded the DR Demo off the Xbox 360 Marketplace I was hooked. The game has aged quite a bit but it still doesn't mean its hilariously fun. This game and Dead Rising 2 are probably the best ones in the series by far. This game can be very frustrating if its your first time playing but once you get the hang of the games mechanics you'll learn to enjoy it more especially on your second playthrough.\n\nPros\n- Game looks good for being 10 years old\n- Decent framerate even in highly populated areas. 1080p 60fps flawlessly.\n- Lots of replayability. There are 6 endings you can get and 10+ psychopaths in total in the game and nearly half you can either choose to fight or not. There is also 50+ survivors you can save which can make for a great challenge. Not to mention the achievements which will give you some work to do for a while.\n- Special items after getting achievements + beating the game. Not spoiling though.\n- The soundtrack is great\n- Game can be hilarious and pretty creepy sometimes, good mixture of both.\n- You pretty much have to play the game over again twice to have a better experience and do things you haven't done in your first playthrough.\n- Lots of weapons in this game to choose from even gun wise\n- Lots of different attires to choose from\n- You can do pretty much anything you wanna do in this game, the game doesn't force you to do the story. If you want to just fuck around do side missions and kill psychopaths, you can do that.\nI could go on.\n\nCons\n- The AI is fucking horrendous. Trying to get more than 5 survivors at a time into the safe room is living hell. Good luck when one of them manages to get caught in an endless zombie hit loop and is half their life bar in 10 seconds. I really wanted to die when I did the savior achievement and had to rescue every fucking survivor. A true challenge indeed.\n- Bosses can be pretty stupid sometimes. For example Adam the Clown who is a boss in this game does a move where he can continously have you in the air with his chainsaws and do 5+ blocks of damage. Pretty fucking bullshit. Oh and that Carlito fight with the barrett 50 cal, enjoy that one first try lol\n- Some achievements are a little grindy. You will find that doing achievements will unlock items for you in the next playthrough, but some are very grindy and just plain boring, one even making you grind killing zombies for a good two and a half hours. \n- The AI get a second spot on this list because they're just that bad, waypoints barely work at all.\n- If you pick up 3 different types of books it makes Adams chainsaws (you get it after you kill him) work for like 3000+ hits. Makes the game pretty dull tbh. Also the fact they respawn when you leave the area makes it pretty op.

In one side, the game is extremely fun to play, but it is extremely challenging. This game will kick your butt, multiple times, but it's also hard to not stop playing. \n\nYou play as Frank West, a journalist that travels to Williamette, Colorado for a new story, only to be infested by zombies. Frank lands on top of Willamette's Mall rooftop and instructs his pilot to pick him up in 72 hours. What happens next is up to you.\n\nDead Rising doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's a good thing. Dead Rising also does a good job with its sandbox enviroment. Everything is a weapon, and how you want to go about objectives is all on you. You can also travel to different parts of the mall, go inside most stores, and dress up Frank for no reason. Frank can also use his camera to photograph anything, giving you PP points, a form of XP points. \n\nFrank can also encounter survivors along his trip, and it's up to you to lead them to saftey. However, the AI in this game is horrendous, and the time limit you have to try to save this one or multiple survivors is a stressful, frustrating experience. The boss battles are intense and challenging, but not impossible. \n\nThere's a lot of things i wouldn't want to talk about in this review, as it's best played without knowing things in advance.\n\nDo I recommand this game?

I never got around to playing it due to the lack of a PC port, but when they remastered the game for the Xbox One and PS4 for the game's 10th anniversary, they graced us with a PC port, so I finally got to experience it, and it was quite good.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nYou are Frank West, a freelance photographer always trying to find the next big story. After hearing about something big going down in Willamette, Colorado, Frank hires a private helo pilot to fly him in after all the entrances to the city have been blocked off by the military. After seeing people fighting in the streets, he assumes it's a riot, and orders the pilot to drop him off at the rooftop of the mall, and to come back for him in 3 days. After venturing inside, he quickly finds out that it's a zombie outbreak, and he sets out to find out why the zombie outbreak occured, along with saving anyone he can find.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Great remaster.[/b] This game was older, so it got a refresh for the PC release, and it's a great port. I never crashed once, never dropped a single frame, and never ran into any bugs or glitches. One glitch I know of is almost getting breached out of bounds during a boss fight cause I was in an awkward position. Graphics are clean and solid; I have no complaints at all. MSAA, Borderless Windowed, and uncapped framerate sweeten the deal. Load times are also insanely fast. Load screens never last more than 3 seconds on my PC, and I had this game installed on a hard drive.\n[*][b]Solid story with side missions.[/b] Game's story is solid. It's full of plot twists, and has a bunch of varied characters that are all great in their own ways. During some downtime from the story, you can do side missions, which include killing psychopaths or saving survivors.\n[*][b]Crazy gameplay.[/b] You're trapped in a mall with hundreds of zombies everywhere. You'll be running through crowds of zombies constantly, which can be super frustrating, but also super fun. Boss fights are all different and super insanely fun.\n[*][b]RGB-esque leveling system.[/b] During the rescue of survivors or slaughter of psychopaths, you earn PP, which levels you up to gain useful stats such as Attack Damage, inventory space, health, and even running speed.\n[*][b]Great world.[/b] The mall is full of different shops for you to change clothes or gather weapons. Keep an eye out for the gun shop for some sweet firearms, or the medieval shop for some swords and battleaxes.\n[*][b]Post-game goodies.[/b] After you beat the main story, called 72-Hour mode, you unlock Overtime mode, which is kinda like a post-game story after the main story. You also unlock Infinity mode, which is a new gamemode altogether and is based around how long you can survive.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Mixed[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Not easy at the start.[/b] For newcomers such as myself, the game has a steep difficulty hill before you become a zombie slaughterhouse. You can't hold many items; you can't do any evasive moves, and most of the pathways are gated off until you progress through the story. But, similar to Dying Light, the game gets much better once you level up and get yourself familar with the game.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Super frustrating sometimes.[/b] People who hate this game usually say this is why. The game has difficulty spikes that can make you rage like hell (I'll admit it made me rage a few times), such as being hit and not being able to dodge the next attack fast enough cause some animations are a million seconds long, or how zombies will still grapple you even though you're jumping away from them, causing you to lose some of the relatively limited health you have, or how some bosses are super hard to beat, or they have some sort of insane advantage towards you, [spoiler]such as the Isabela fight with her on a motorcycle or the three convicts on the military humvee with a .50 cal machine gun.[/spoiler] Saving survivors is almost impossible sometimes, with them always getting grappled, and never breaking the grasp themselves, so you have to always go back for them. Sometimes, you can't save survivors due to the time limit you have, which sometimes forces you to leave survivors behind to die since they're so freaking slow. All of this gets super annoying, and will probably turn some people off.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nAside from the negatives and mixed feelings, the game is great, and worth your time. It's a fun and classic zombie game with a great story, great character, and overall a great experience.

So without a pause he charges forth, braves the dangers of the zombie infested mall and does his best to unravel the secrets of the outbreak!\n...Or he just spends 72 hours playing bowling with zombies, sticking lego heads on them or jamming shower heads into the zombies heads just to see a blood fountain. Honestly, its up to you.\n\nIm recommending this game because so much of what it does right, from the map design to the enemy design to the combat to the levelling to the (genuine part of the) difficulty. Especially when taken in the light of how early it was in a consoles cycle this sort of game was damn near unheard of at the time, and no game since (not even DR2) is quite the same. \n\n\n-THAT BEING SAID. There are serious downsides that come to light when going back and playing it more recently. For starters the combat tends to be a little derpy on the players end, from swings going straight through zombies to zombies skipping animations entirely and grabbing you in an instant while youre actively smacking them with something. This is typically offset by simply prioritising handguns, horizontal swing weapons and similar to avoid being in that situation entirely, but it would be foolish to imply that its not a flaw in the game.\n\n-Another small but significant complaint would have to be that you use the same button to interact with literally every single thing in the game. Understandable, but when theres a pile of shite around, npcs following you and youre trying to pick something up or feed one of the npcs in a moment you dont have time to be slow with... you ARE going to do the wrong thing. Its literally unavoidable without having breathing room. Where it doesnt ruin you it adds to the experience of the game, but once again it would be foolish to imply its not a flaw.\n\n-Possibly the most jarring and major flaw in the game (And you WILL experience this if you play) is that the AI are as dumb as a box of rocks. And thats putting it lightly. From getting stuck on bad pathing codes to LETTING themselves get eaten by zombies to just being derpy and useless in general, any situation where you have to guide the AI around becomes nothing but a tedious chore of banging your head against a brick wall. Couple this with the limited ability to save (which in itself isnt a problem) and suddenly youre standing there mashing the \"Get the fuck over here you dumb fucks\" button while watching an AI literally ignore you and get themselves killed. Again, and again, and again and again. The AI unfortunately make a good 75% of the difficulty in this game, and not by intentional design either. its entirely bad design and ruins what would be otherwise a stellar experience. Couple that with the control issues above and, well.... Pain and Suffering of the unfun kind.\n\nOverall, the OG Dead Rising is by all means a game which you should delve into should you have played any of the others, even if simply to see where its roots come from. But if youre someone who cant stand really shoddy AI then id recommend skipping DR1 entirely and just hopping into DR2.", "timestamp_created": 1517891834, "timestamp_updated": 1517892527, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39872906": {"recommendationid": "39872906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023565620", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 2857, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517699789}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the original games I played when I still had an xbox, I remember having fond memories after saving mall goers, foiling a bad guys plans, taking provocative photos and planting shower heads in zombies skulls.\n\nI was overjoyed when I heard the original was coming to steam, a chance to relive one of the great zany, classic zombie games that spawned many sequels, after customising the controls to my liking I set about re-teaching myself the locales of the Willamette mall thankfully most of it came back easily including the hard-to-reach areas containing powerful weapons, sadly once I set about saving the malls occupants and escorting them back to the security room the unbelievably aggravating AI of the NPC's also came screaming back, it was prudent to save frequently as the survivors would often get themselves killed either from zombies or by my own hand as a result of my own hatred for their incompetence.\n\nA game as dated as this one will obviously not have the best graphics but thats acceptable what bugged me slightly was the limited distance fade for objects (Enemies, Items, NPC's etc) which made planning a route difficult.\n\nSo in summary this game has plenty to offer for players who have the patience to put up with the survivors shoddy AI, upon completion new game modes become available, unlockable outfits and countless ways to thin the zombie hordes when you feel like blowing off steam, certainly worth the money.", "timestamp_created": 1517858974, "timestamp_updated": 1517858974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39852879": {"recommendationid": "39852879", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973250531", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507313252}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game.

The game has never ran, or looked this good.\nWhile some facial models and certain textures still look a little underwhelming, the attention to detail for Willamette's Mall, the zombie hordes that are an obstacle in your way, and Jessica's breasts make the game feel not as left-behind graphically as it's sequels (especially Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising 4) will in the future. Playing at 60fps is like shackles have been removed from it, and it now feels all the more satisfying and smooth to play. I'd recommend installing this game on an SSD, as it makes loading times last less than 2 seconds, at most, making it an even bigger upgrade from the original Xbox version.\n\nOfcourse, those such things are expected from a remaster.\nGameplay-wise, I can tell you this game provided me with some of the most tense, exhilirating, and satisfying gaming moments of my life. The feeling of managing to escort around 3-4 survivors after beating a boss, and barely making it in time before the timer on the next Case starts, is just something unmatched by any other games so far.\nThe genius of Willamette Mall's setting is not something I can fully explain on a Steam review, but so many of its aspects resonate together to bring a very memorable experience. At the end of the day, zombies, and even some bosses aren't really that challenging, and you can ignore a lot of stuff while trying to do just the story if you want, but the fact that they are more like obstacles, that try to ruin your day as you help people in exchange for experience or accomplish story objectives as you run against the clock constantly, using anything and everything in the mall as a weapon, is the core of Dead Rising.\nIt's not meant to be a horror game, or even survival horror game. I'd describe it more as an \"action-speedrunning\" or \"timed-sandbox\" game, because that's what it's designed as. The fact that there's tons of hidden secrets and weapons, survivors, strategies, shortcuts, and even more discovered through exploration, serves to train you. So that you keep optimizing, improving, and learning. As most things carry over to your next playthough, even if you fail to do what you wanted or didn't get the best outcome last time, you can try again, with more knowledge, and stronger than before.\nAnd, thanks to it's sandbox aspect, you can ignore all that if you want. Let the timer run and fail scoops as you dick around the mall trying children's clothes, play with toys, and mow down zombies like grass using CD jewel cases from the records store. All up to you.\n\nAlso has some of the most time-consuming, challenging achievements I've ever done, and I still haven't gotten all of them yet.\nFrankly (no pun intended), I loved my time with this game. Though it was filled with frustration at times due to the horrible survivor AI, which hasn't been touched up or fixed at all, in the end, I came away with 34 hours of my life that just flew by thanks to having dumb fun in this zombie playground, or due to feeling ecstacy equal to finishing in a virgin hole by simply making it to the saferoom in the nick of time. I understand if the \"timer\" brings a red flag to many, but overall, I can't recommend Dead Rising enough. One of the all-time greats of Capcom's last-generation library, along with the first Lost Planet, Dragon's Dogma, and many more.\n\n[i]Disclaimer: I have not tested the KB&M controls for this game, as I played through all of it with a controller.

Avoid.\nThe game has a golden core surrounded by a hundred thousand terrible design decisions, most of which were rectified or at least mitigated quickly in far more enjoyable sequels.\n\nOff of the top of my head.\n- The base movement speed is quite slow, and there is no run. You get upgrades eventually, but those first few hours are quite painful.\n- Until you unlock the endless mode, everything is timed. The timers are so strict that I'm fairly certain you can't do a 100% playthrough in a single run without some sort of exploit, and I'd be surprised to hear you could do a 80% playthrough on your first run. For a game with such time pressure, it certainly doesn't respect your time to expect three or four playthroughs to see what it has to offer.\n- About 70% of the missions involve survivors, and survivors suck - flat out, and they ruin the game. Survivor AI is abysmal. The pathfinding is bottom tier, to the point where the simple task of moving across an empty courtyard not only takes ages, but is prone to error, a lot of dropped commands, and a lot of whining. It's one of those games where you are constantly mashing the command button to get the AI to follow you properly. Moving through a heavily infested zone is a chore at best, and just grueling otherwise. Survivors are also prone to getting caught by zombies, which prevents them from following you, and slowly chip away at their massive health bars (massive until you of course, accidentally hit a survivor with a sudden insta-kill move). This is not to mention about a third of survivors do not accept weapons (not that they can use them competently anyways), and half of those need to be carried, preventing you from attacking or helping any survivors inevitably falling behind.\n- Boss fights are weird. They start at a high difficulty level, and then just kinda plateau from there. Dead Rising 2 has this issue too, in boss enemies take crazy amounts of damage, do crazy amounts of damage, have a lot of I-frames, and feel completely separate from the rest of the game, but will die really fast to one or two cheap weapons against them.\n- Whoever designed Cultists needs to be shot. Whoever okayed the idea that cultists can kill a survivor in one or two explosions needs to be shot. Whoever thought of the pocket-sand ability for cultists, also needs to be shot. Twice.\n- The ancient hatred for Otis was 100% justified. He also ruins the game with the radio. The player has to stop everything, attacking, jumping, falling, dodging, triggering cutscenes, going into new load zones, even taking damage, just have to wait out 3 or 4 extremely slow paced text boxes to get a mission - every single time. And if that radio message is interupted? You're punished with an additional text box, and the whole thing has to start over again. Someone else needed to be shot.\n\nIt is a real tragedy to see the original game was like this, because I highly recommend the sequels. Somewhere deep down here, was the core of very fun game waiting to come out. Lots of items to find and use, an interesting plot and setting, campy writing, and intriguing camera mechanic. Shot so close to brilliance, and hit a hundred miles away. PC port also isn't bad at all. Some studdering when you hit a bunch of enemies at once with a sledgehammer, but that's hardly anything to complain about.\n3/10", "timestamp_created": 1515416330, "timestamp_updated": 1515447098, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.396825", "comment_count": "8", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39168458": {"recommendationid": "39168458", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389473161", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 2337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517444962}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u521d\u4ee3\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1515371220, "timestamp_updated": 1515371220, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39137124": {"recommendationid": "39137124", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063957834", "num_games_owned": 237, "num_reviews": 58, "playtime_forever": 1460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516671784}, "language": "english", "review": "He covered wars y'know.", "timestamp_created": 1515289188, "timestamp_updated": 1516683757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498258", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39120043": {"recommendationid": "39120043", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034979883", "num_games_owned": 327, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516669129}, "language": "english", "review": "Carlito and that goddamn fucking sniper rifle.", "timestamp_created": 1515249797, "timestamp_updated": 1515249797, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39115859": {"recommendationid": "39115859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074270480", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1284, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1516310299}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun game if you are into crossdressing and anally raping zombies with a baseball bat.

The only downside is the survivor AI. Their path finding is the worst you will ever see. Later games in the series fixed it fortunately. I love my games challenging, but this is unfair challenge. I managed to beat it 100%, but that survivor AI is random. They get stuck, they take longer routes to areas, even when there is a clear path, and they will run into zombies. They are retarded.

However, should the player accept the game for what it is, and specifically why Dead Rising is what it is, they'll appreciate this as a genuinely fun and unique game.\n\nEffectively, this is Dawn of the Dead: The Game.  You play as Frank West, a photojournalist literally dropped into a shopping mall full of zombies, whose goal is to survive until it's all over.  Along the way, there are a myriad of zombies to deal with, as well as survivors of varying behaviors.  Along with saving certain people, you'll encounter other individuals with their own agendas.  Without giving too much of the story away, it does a great job of balancing the aspects of not taking itself seriously (via the various characters) and the over the top serious plot.  This combines for a campy theme that really works for this game.\n\nThe unique game mechanics specific to Dead Rising is where it becomes a bit polarizing, but there's a method to the madness.  For starters, the player most likely WILL LOSE during their first playthrough.  If they want to keep their level progression, they MUST start over to the beginning of the game.   However, this is a survival game, and it's tough to stay alive against tens of thousands of zombies.  However, what most reviews here seem to not mention, is that subsequent plays get exponentially easier by design.  As Frank gains experience points (called PP), the player gains levels that unlock various abilities.  These include a ton of new moves, health, inventory slots, speed increases, and so on.  This game has tons of side missions that help the player gain levels at a reasonable pace, and this game is very much beatable in no time.  Spend some time with the game, and Dead Rising will reward you.\n\nThe survival aspect shows up in other ways, too.  Some people complain about the lack of save points, but where's the challenge in surviving if the player can save anywhere and anytime they want?  There are several save points throughout the mall, including the safe room that the game directs you to go to numerous times, so the lack of save opportunities are completely overstated.  The in-game time is always going, too, which may prevent players from getting to all the missions they want to.  However, again, this is a survival game, and time is of the essence -- especially in a game that requires survival for a specific period of time.  With each session of play, the player should find more efficient ways of navigating through the mall and progressing through the story.  It's definitely possible to complete all side quests and main missions during the time limit, with ample time to spare.\n\nThe probable highlight of Dead Rising is the important part -- the gameplay.  This game is just so much fun, in that there are so many ways to play.  If the player wants to play the story, go for it.  If they want to do the side quests and forget about the main missions, the game allows them to do that.  If people just want to mindlessly kill as many zombies as they can, Dead Rising allows for that too.  Regardless of the goal, the player has MANY different ways to deal with the various enemies, as Frank can use nearly anything he sees as a weapon or a buff.  Some items are lethal, some items are complementary, some items can help assist with healing or abilities, and other items are just outright silly.  Dead Rising is very free-form in what weapons to use for fights, albeit some weapons are better than others.  Overall, this game just absolutely nails it in this department.\n\nThe controls are a mixed bag.  Keeping in mind that this was a 2006 console game, Dead Rising is admittedly better suited for a controller.  Using a mouse and keyboard is certainly doable, but the control layout is clunky.  However, the controller support is very good.  Movement is good, and attacking enemies is solid.  While the melee tracks and hits pretty well, aiming guns and projectiles can be a chore.  However, the worst thing about this game has to be leading survivors to safety.  It's easier to guide Hellen Keller through a bomb defusal than it is to guide the AI to the safe room.  The AI pathing is just abysmal.  You can equip them with weapons, but it usually doesn't matter; once they meet zombies, it's a chore to free them.  It was the major complaint back in 2006, and it's even worse in retrospect now.  Beyond that, the game plays fine.\n\nThe game shows its age a bit, but unlike Jenny McCarthy's face post-botox, Dead Rising still looks good.  It's well-optimized, and it feels good to play this in 1080p and get 300fps with max settings.  The sheer amount of zombies on the screen at once doesn't really induce any frame drops at all, so the game feels ultra-smooth.  Game looks good for being from 2006, and the sound is serviceable enough, too.  Zombies groan everywhere, sound effects sound like they should, dialogue is intentionally bad and hilarious, and to top off -- Gone Guru (oh, you'll know about it soon enough).  The presentation fits the zombie survival campy vibe it strives to represent.\n\nDead Rising is really fun, but the player needs to start with an understanding mindset to truly appreciate it.  This is not a typical one-playthrough game -- rather, it's a sandbox game.  It is recommended to just play and have fun, but also accept that dying and losing is likely inevitable.  It'll make surviving and completing the game that much sweeter.  Once this is understood, this game a ton more enjoyable.  In my opinion, Dead Rising is a damn good game.", "timestamp_created": 1514789066, "timestamp_updated": 1514789600, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545455", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38915689": {"recommendationid": "38915689", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021778953", "num_games_owned": 174, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514581442}, "language": "english", "review": "HARD AS FUCK", "timestamp_created": 1514756643, "timestamp_updated": 1514756643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38902791": {"recommendationid": "38902791", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377453948", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1507, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 44, "last_played": 1520702959}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is very fun i have been enjoying so much.

Then keep on reading to see if this one is your alley aswell.\n\nDead Rising is an older game from 2006 and you play as a reporter. You've heard of possible big news scoop and thus booked an helitour over the location of the scoop, to take some pictures for the planned article. You end up being so facinated from the situation (outbreak), that you actually want to go on foot-level to investigate into this Willamette Mall. But as while you're preparing to drop into the mall from the heli, military who've quarantined the area, attempts to seize your attempts by trying to bring the helicopter down.\nThe helicopter pilot cannot actually stay for you but has to abandon the place inorder to save their own ass. Before abandoning you, they did make a deal with you that they'd come back for you in 3 days (72hrs) at 12pm and so you've got 72hrs to build your case while at the Willamette Mall. This is Dead Rising.\n\nWhat the game does well, is without doubt [h1]atmosphere[/h1] it delivers. Those zombies do look and sound like they're serious business and that you don't wanna mess with them unless you've got something that's bigger than your fists. When you open up a maintenance hallway door and you'll find yourself from an hallway that is full of zombies and in your inventory you've got 30 bullets on your handgun + couple melee weapons.. you're not really sure regardless of having the handgun, if you really should be there or not. That's kinda greatly done disturbing atmoshpere imo.\n\nIt is safe to say back then when game originally released, it was something quite new and novel. This atleast as far as openworld-ish+zombie combination is concerned. However but as time has passed.. it doesn't really hold up too well anymore. And following is my assestment about it.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1] seems to be just flat out dumb in my opinion. Basically just kill zombies in bunch of different ways with really clunky controls, combat mechanics and limited gameworld possibilities. The mall is big and that is nice but really all you can do there is to kill zombies, try on different clothes, wander around different stores looking to find some health items, photograph different things (yes afterall you are an reporter) or go for these side objectives that are always on the entire opposite side of the mall. \nSince you move really slow.. traveling accross the mall takes quite a while until you reach your destination. So you start thinking [i]why should I really do those side missions since it's just going back and forth the mall for nothing basically?[/i] Really makes you feel like a \"hamster in a wheel\".\n \nThere isn't really that much else to do in here but to mindlessly mow down zombies. So would you like to be killing zombies in location A: water foundation area of mall, or would you like to be killing zombies in location B: outdoors small section with a pack of armed prisoners running over people with a truck, or perhaps location C: dark lit movietheater area where corridors are tiny and cramped? Regardless of the location, possiblities are same. Either run from the zombies or kill them. Pretty boring after you've done that for a while already. \n\nWhen actually playing the campaign, it really feels like you're just a \"hamster in a wheel\" in here. [i]Do this do that go there go here.[/i] And for what? Just to rescue a couple into the safehouse and lose majority of your equipment while doing so? Yeah no thanks. Zombies if you kill from an area and then backtravel even only 5-10meters, those zombies will respawn all and your weapons actually break. \n\nThere is a really dumb and non-practical item system in the game. You have 4-5slots and those you place [u]both weapons and health items[/u] into. It's really nice when you're in a hectic handfight and then all the sudden your weapon breaks and replaces it with an health item. So you pressed the attack key because you were in a fight situation and while the hp item was equipped, now you've just decided to eat an item while youre being attacked. So you not only wasted your valuable item but you also lost health because the zombies managed to tackle you down while you stopped down to eat. \nSo you might say \"well bind hotkeys dude\". Hehe, there isn't any hotkeys. To scroll the items you have, you need to use mousewheel (next/prev weapon) to select an item/weapon. There are no bindable actual weapons.\n\nMovement is really clunky. You press once a directional key and the guy is instantly sprinting fullspeed into that direction. Way too sensitive and hard to reliably and accurately control.\n\nClosecombat is quite horrendous here. There is no lock-on systems or any sorts of [b]fightmode[/b] or whatever. So often times you find yourself missing hits or accidentally punching an ally, since you can't really control where you're hitting once you've pressed the punch key.\n\nAiming anything in this game is actually quite a nightmare to do with traditional PC mouse+kb [h1]controls[/h1]. This game is anything but ideal for that. There is heavy amount of mouse acceleration applied and so you can never really comfortably and reliably aim. On top of there being mouse accel.. there also is this thing how the aiming works in this game. Lets say you're looking up and then press the aim button. You'd think you'd now be aiming into the spot you were looking before pressing the aim key right? Well nope. Here you instead everytime gotta accept that the game auto-centers your aim and then you gotta manually move the camera up again. Imagine this in a hectic situation. Yeah it's not a fun or smooth experience at all. Constantly needing to re-align your aiming because of the auto centering thing resetting it. Tedious.\n\n[h1]Audio[/h1] in this game is quite bad. You can be in a room and eventhough there is absolutely nobody else in this room, you can actually [b]clearly[/b] hear the zombie growls and noises behind the wall. So often times youre walking forexample in an upper level balcony and you keep hearing noises from whatever direction and then you have to look and you see nothing. Then you realize \"oh, it's just them on the ground level floor making noises\". Thats how well the directional audio works in this game. You can't at all tell wether sound is coming from above or below you and due to the lack of any kinda Occlusion sound effects.. you'll never know if someone is right by next to you, or there is an entire wall between you and them. So talk about system being confusing.\n\nDead Rising does a very poor job of introducing how the game works and infact.. it kinda throws everything at you all at once. Making the player WTF as the game starts throwing different things at them. When I started, I didn't really at all know how the objective system worked because the [h1]tutorial/guides/introduction[/h1] were so badly executed in-game. So when the game finally actually began and I started seeing these random names pop-up \"JOE IS DEAD\" \"ANNA IS DEAD\" etc.. I was wondering wether I should care and do I [b]NEED[/b] to prevent this or will Game Over screen come otherwise? It didn't tell me any of this and instead I decided to go where a guy was yelling people from the upper balcony to come over there. Turns out that was the way to go.\n\nThen there's the actual map [h1]UI[/h1] for objectives and game UI in general. It is completely unclear are objectives on which floor and what exactly it is that you have to do there. Missions don't have any kinda mission descriptions but just the mission name and that's it. There was forexample an objective which name was something like \"Investigate the monitor room\". Here I was in the room where the objective was and nothing happened. Even talking to the woman sitting there did nothing. Then I revisited this room sometime later and now the game decided to play the cutscene all the sudden. Seriously! What the hell?

The assortment of weapons is compelling and the fact that Frank levels up as he rescues surivivors, fights psychopaths, and uncovers more of the story is the icing on the cake.

Por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o posso recomendar Dead Rising, por conta de alguns motivos que estragaram a experi\u00eancia para mim. Um dos pontos que tornaram o jogo frustrante para mim foi a intelig\u00eancia artificial, pois um dos objetivos do jogo \u00e9 resgatar os sobreviventes espalhados pelo shopping, e nas minhas tentativas de lev\u00e1-los \u00e0 seguran\u00e7a, observei que eles tinham uma tend\u00eancia a ficarem presos em objetos espalhados pelo mapa, andando no mesmo lugar, a andarem bem no meio de uma horda de zumbis, mesmo quando rotas mais seguras est\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis, a se esquecerem de usar a arma que est\u00e3o carregando, ou a de simpl\u00e7esmente n\u00e3o seguir Frank. Dada a import\u00e2ncia dessa mec\u00e3nica no jogo, n\u00e3o acho aceit\u00e1vel que ela tenha sido aprovada neste estado, n\u00e3o \u00e9 desafiador, \u00e9 apenas frustrante. Outro fator que me incomodou muito foi o fato de que na grande maioria das vezes que Frank sofre dano por um zumbi, ele entra em uma anima\u00e7\u00e3o longa, onde o jogador precisa usar o analogico ou algum bot\u00e3o para se livra do zumbi, e devido ao n\u00famero de zumbis,  \u00e1 falta de clareza em muitos momentos da anima\u00e7\u00e3o de ataque dos zumbis, ao frquente posicionamento incoveniente da c\u00e2mera, e \u00e1 lentid\u00e3o do protagonista, essas anima\u00e7\u00f5es acontecer\u00e3o com frequ\u00eancia, e n\u00e3o demorar\u00e1 para que a repetitividdade as torne tediosas e frustrantes.\n\nMuitas escolhas de design parecem n\u00e3o combinam bem: dada a quantidade de zumbis e o n\u00famero de objetos que podem ser usados como armas, assume-se que o jogo estimula a experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, mas alguns objetos s\u00e3o literalmente in\u00fateis, outros s\u00e3o t\u00e3o desajeitados que seu uso apenas serve para deixar Frank mais vulner\u00e1vel, e Frank j\u00e1 \u00e9 quase t\u00e3o vulner\u00e1vel quanto o t\u00edpico protagonista de \"survival horror\", exceto que ele precisa lidar com um n\u00famero significantemente amior de inimigos, o que n\u00e3o abre muito espa\u00e7o para experimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, infelizmente. Outra contradi\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 o fato de que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel andar por todo o shopping, explorando as lojas e procurando objetos, mas praticamente todas as miss\u00f5es precisam ser realizadas em um limite de tempo, portanto o jogador n\u00e3o pode se dar ao luxo de passar muito tempo explorando um mapa que est\u00e1 pedindo para ser explorado. O sistema de \"save\" manual, onde \u00e9 poss\u00edvel salvar apenas em p-ontos espec\u00edficos, em banheiros, \u00e9 uma mec\u00e2nica que eu geralmente gosto em jogos estilo \"survival-horror\", mas os outros problemas a transformam em mais uma fonte de frustra\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nEsteticamente, Dead Rising envelheceu mal. Eu sei que \u00e9 um jogo lan\u00e7ado h\u00e1 11 anos atr\u00e1s, um t\u00edtulo de lan\u00e7amento do 360, mas jogos lan\u00e7ados para consoles da gera\u00e7\u00e3o anterior (PS2, Xbox, Gamecube) envelheceram bem melhor nesse aspecto (No momento, consigo pensar em Resident Evil 4 e Metal Gear Solid 3, mas existem outros exemplos), ent\u00e3o ter sido lan\u00e7ado h\u00e1 tanto tempo atr\u00e1s n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma justificativa s\u00f3lida. \n\nDead Rising tem boas ideias, mas a execu\u00e7\u00e3o, infelizmente, \u00e9 fraca. O sistema de cria\u00e7\u00e3o de armas da continua\u00e7\u00e3o serviria para aliviar v\u00e1rios dos problemas que eu citei, al\u00e9m de ser muito divertida e combinar mais com o que eu acho que era a proposta do primeiro jogo, portanto recomendo que os interessados pela s\u00e9rie comecem pelo segundo jogo, e pulem essa primeira tentativa que teve boas inten\u00e7\u00f5es, mas foi falha.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1512367421, "timestamp_updated": 1512367421, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38009527": {"recommendationid": "38009527", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038317232", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 14, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512236361}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Este juego ha sido abandonado por Capcom.

Es en mi opinion uno de los juegos de matar zombies con las maneras mas originales y divertidas. Estas en un centro comercial y tienes todo, que quede claro, TODO, a tu disposicion para matar y joder a los zombies de todas las maneras que quieras. No estoy mintiendo cuando digo que lo ultimo que vas a usar para matarlos son armas de fuego, ya que estas no son nada efectivas y escasean mucho. Ademas de los zombies hay personas que han perdido la cabeza por culpa de la invasion, por lo que se dan situaciones muy divertidas y graciosas con estos. \nLa mecanica principal del juego es sin lugar a dudas el manejo del tiempo, tienes un tiempo determinado para ayudar a los supervivientes, matar a esos psicopatas y hacer misiones principales todo en el mismo tiempo. Esto puede entorpecer la aventura un poco ya que el juego es muy estricto en este apartado y tiende a darte misiones encima de misiones con un limite de tiempo muy apreciable, pero una vez sabes que hacer y donde, esto ya no es un problema. \n\nDead Rising es la prueba de que Capcom si que sabia cuidar sus juegos, ya que lo que veo es que le han cuidado hasta el mas minimo detalle, tiene un gran mimo y cari\u00f1o puesto en el y basicamente tiene muchoamor por los videojuegos.\nA pesar de su poco amigable manejo del tiempo y la escasa inteligencia artificial de los NPCs  esto esta mas que recomendado, es dificil encontrar un juego asi.\n\nPD: Muere Otis, muere!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1512166420, "timestamp_updated": 1512166420, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37983868": {"recommendationid": "37983868", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983117069", "num_games_owned": 261, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 171, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512155052}, "language": "english", "review": "Just as awful as I remember it being when it was released.

If you have a good enough PC to play on high it looks real sharp. Fixes the 'text issue' 360 had. This is a real zombie game too, you don't have some 'cool military background' that makes you a special zombie killer with your own special weapon. You're in a mall, use what you can and smash some zombies with a tv/golf club/bowling ball.\n\nControls are nice, but you can't customize. Using a gun in the game is so clunky. There's no smoothness at all, nobody in the developing team was like \"man we should fix that a little, ya think?\" nope, all good boys. It's a zombie game, why shoot 'em?\n\nAI still sucks, you're able to run through a spotty mob easily, but no matter what you do -- your tag alongs will always attract them.

Also a bit of a warning, there will be some spoilers in here so please be mindful of that, all names \n and eventsthat are used in the game will be spoilered to help this. \n\nStory:\nIn Dead Rising you play as photo journalist Frank West, looking for the next big scoop to give hime a breakthrough only to find out that the town is overrun by zombies. The story gave off a good B movie sort of horror feeling to it which gave it some charm with how cheesy some scenes are and what not. But overrall, it was pretty nice and had its moments. \n\nGameplay:\nOh boy this is gonna be a fun topic to cover. The gameplay of Dead Rising can be summed up as: You're in this giant mall with zombies, food, weapons, and other cool shit, now go do things with them. In all seriousness though, the gameplay is surprisingly fun to play with. The timer gimmick is one that I like personally since it makes you use good use of your time and pretty much force you to use time management. There were a number of times during my many playthroughs that I had trouble choosing one thing over the other. THings like \"Should I go off and fight this guy or should I save some suriviors first?\" are what make the time gimmick fun and interesting. Other than that, Dead Rising portrays its bosses in the form of Psychopaths or survivors that went crazy during the outbreak. All the fights are fun and well thought out and have nice strategies to with them. Things like [spoiler]Cliff's gimmick of teleporting around the arena is interesting, Adam's fight being challenging early on if you're low leveled, etc.[/spoiler] Other than these, the game features books which are sort of like stat boosters on certain things. The books can do various effects on things like weapon durablitites, health gain from certain foods, being able to deal more damage on certain things, etc. My personal favorite sets of books to use are the infamous three books that go with the [spoiler]Mini Chainsaw[/spoiler] that everyone else knows and loves. With books, psychos, and time, there are many other things in the game that need to be talked about. One of the main things is its level system where you can gain PP, Player Points, from doing various things in the game. One of the main ways to gain PP is either through completing scoops (Survivors and pyschos) or through taking photos of things, to which I will touch on as well. As you level up, you gain things like new abilities, more health blocks, more inventory slots, and more throwing distance. Now I mentioned earlier that you can take photos to gain PP. Essentially, there's a photography gimmick as well since well, Frank's a photojournalist. Photography has a grading scale with certain genres of things and what not. These genres are things like Horror, Drama, Outtake, Erotic, Special, No Genre. Along with the genres come a thing called Photo Ops, which are special poses some characters will do throughout the game. Certain psychos do these and survivors do them as well. Aside from that, the game grades you based on well you take a picture and rewards PP for your troubles. Depending on how well the picture, it can easily score you either really low amounts of PP or a large about of PP. Moving on, we have weapons and what they basically do. Weapons are literally everywhere in the Willamette Mall, they can be hidden in stores or just lying around somewhere. Now, weapons have a gimmick where if you use them too much they break and are well, unusuable. To combat this, as stated earlier, you can get books with certain effects on certain types of weapons. For instance, a sports related book will provided bonuses on sports related weapons (soccer balls, frisbies, hockey sticks, etc.). And not only that, but you can also stack these effects to make them even more durable so you won't have to worry about getting a new one. Other than that, the combat in the game is fun, simple, and to the point. However there are things like QTEs at certain instances, namely after getting grabbed/attacked too much which can tire Frank out. Essentially what can happen is you either don't take damage at all for suriving the QTE or, you fail the QTE and you take DOUBLE the damage. Now that's enough about the gameplay, I liked it for what it offered and you probably will too!\n\nFinal Thoughts/Conclusion:\nAs a whole, Dead Rising was a fun experience and gave me a lot of memories that will probably stick with me forever. [spoiler]Things like the Convicts making me nearly shit my pants while escorting survivors are one of the many things.[/spoiler] I didn't find myself not hating or disliking any part of the game aside from maybe a few nitpicky things but overall I like the game a ton and give it my 10/10 seal of approval.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful as I had fun writing this and I hope you enjoy the game!", "timestamp_created": 1511506438, "timestamp_updated": 1511506438, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529914", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37240109": {"recommendationid": "37240109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162347671", "num_games_owned": 278, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511485534}, "language": "english", "review": "This game's basically what the first \"tough\" game I ever played back in 2006, and now it's back and it's pretty well optimized for a capcom game.

las batallas consisten en correr en direcci\u00f3n al boss y cuando est\u00e9s cerca golpearlo, que te golpee tirandote al suelo, y estar unos 5 minutos de reloj repitiendo lo mismo una y otra y otra vez. \nLa IA de los npcs es probablemente la peor que vi en mi vida, no puedo entender como pudo salir un juego a la venta con una inteligencia artificial tan pobre, y adem\u00e1s teniendo en cuenta que es tan sumamente importante en este juego. De 50 supervivientes que me abre encontrado pude salvar solo 10, todo por la IA tan mala que tienen, que se quedan trabados con cada uno de los miles de zombis que te encuentras hasta el refugio. Mi decisi\u00f3n para no frustrarme y terminar abandonando el juego fue pasar de largo de los supervivientes y se lo recomiendo a todos que prueben este juego.\nCasi todo en el juego esta muy mal pensado, si me pusiera a nombrar todos los errores no terminar\u00eda nunca, pero una de las cosas que mas me molesto es que cada vez que se te informa de una mision te qued\u00e1s sin poder realizar ning\u00fan movimiento que no sea caminar, y si alg\u00fan zombi o cualquier cosa te corta la animaci\u00f3n de la llamada, hay que volver a escucharla desde el principio todas las veces que sean necesarias hasta que la termines.\nLa limitaci\u00f3n de tiempo fue algo que nunca me gusto en la saga, me parece una estupidez poner un mapa gigantesco con zombis infinitos, y con cientos y cientos de maneras de matarlos, y poner limitaci\u00f3n de tiempo para que se termine el juego, pero en los otros juegos de la saga te daban el tiempo suficiente para completar todas las misiones y relajarse matando zombis por ah\u00ed de vez en cuando, no es el caso de este juego, aunque vayas directo\na las misiones sin distraerte en nada es imposible completarlas todas, tanto por el poco tiempo que dan como la inteligencia artificial de los npcs que te tendr\u00edan que seguir pero no lo hacen.\nEn cuanto al port a pc no tengo ninguna queja, funciona perfecto y tiene bastantes opciones gr\u00e1ficas.\nEn su lanzamiento este juego fue muy querido por ser tan innovador pero hoy en d\u00eda es infumable por las mec\u00e1nicas que tiene, en cambio recomiendo comprar el 2 que vale lo mismo y es practicamente lo mismo que este pero con la mayor\u00eda de problemas anteriormente nombrados solucionarlos.", "timestamp_created": 1511397303, "timestamp_updated": 1511397303, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.469667", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36836564": {"recommendationid": "36836564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086585011", "num_games_owned": 1560, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 204, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508363895}, "language": "spanish", "review": "El mejor juego de la saga.

Took 10 years but finally came to PC in 4K and 60 FPS, ironically most people didn't have HDTVs when this game first came out. In hindsight, the game is still solid if not a bit clunky from odd design choices.\n\nPlay as Frank West, Photographer and Crossdressing extraordinaire. You have 72 in-game hours to uncover the conspiracy behind Capcom using the basic premise of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. Drink copious amounts of Orange Juice, slam dumbbells into Zombies' faces, mash the Y-Button while babysitting mentally handicapped AI Survivors for that precious PP, struggle with every damage sponge boss fight until you learn about the Mini Chainsaw and Books.  Bask in the early-game joys of running around at a snails pace trying to make it to each mission in time. \n\nThe game 'ends' if you miss a main story mission but there are multiple endings depending on certain factors, and you can still free-roam, complete survivor/boss missions, and earn most of the achievements until the Helicopter arrives. However, you won't get the true ending but you'll still get the reward items for your next playthrough if you complete certain achievements regardless.\n\nIf you're not a bad enough dude to handle this: grind the Helicopter section until you hit Lvl. 50, ignore the story, and run around bodyslamming zombies for 8 hours instead. If you're feeling really testy, overhead throw the fat couple you save in the beginning of the game into a pit of the undead mercillessly.\n\nThis is still the best game in the series.

I'll admit that the story is alright, and the psychopaths are decent. However, the gameplay is waaaay too old to be enjoyable. Maybe I spoiled it for myself because I played DR2 before, but the side missions aren't really enjoyable at all because the bosses are bullshit but can easily be cheated, so it doesn't feel like you're ever accomplishing anything and the survivors are soooo stupid and have lead me to so many deaths. Little things like Otis on the tranceiver only calling you when you're in a zone full of zombies, so that when you get caught and he says you're being rude, he takes up even MORE time and to the point where i don't even answer calls 99% of the time.\n\nThe final straw for me was just like 10 minutes ago, with the bomb collector mission, where i accidentally died and didn't know saving and quitting would restart my whole game. Due to the fact that I already restarted the story once through other means (WITH the understanding that it does restart the whole story), I was so angry. Maybe this game was good for its time, but DR2 is waaaaay better cause its not filled with annoying nonsense, for the most part. I think the combat in both games are kinda crap but this is just ridiculous.

The characters are really good and dialogue is well written. Frank West, the protagonist, is really likeable and relatable while not being another super good looking, always joking, all knowing protagonist.\nOne of the game's biggest features are the psychopahts, who serve as the bosses in the game. They are unique enemies with their own personalities, design and themes, which are all absolutely amazing.\nAnothe really big feature and the main selling point of the game is that you can use pretty much anything as a weapon. Chairs, benches, hammers, katanas, chainsaws, guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, machine rifles, toy guns, golf clubs, baseball bats, etc. You also have a very impressive arseanl of amazing melee moves that are unlocked as you gain levels.\nThe graphics are nice and have clearly aged well. The music is well done and is used in just the right way.\nHowever, perhaps the most important thing about the game is the challenge that it presents.\nThe game doesn't tell you how to do everything perfectly and there's a pretty big chance that you won't do everything perfectly on your first run. However, there's nothing more satisfying than escorting a bunch of brain dead survivors back to the safehouse. Even though they're pretty much a liability, you still feel great after saving them and it really gives you the feeling that you've made a difference.\nAnother big part of the game is photography. You're able to photograph all sorts of things for extra experience and to perform certain missions.\nThe game world is done just right, not too big and not too small. It's good to try and get a hang of the area's layout to maximise your effectiveness. All the areas in the game are easily distinguishable from one another and there's always something to do and some new items to find.\nDead Rising gives you some choices to make. Many of your actions have consequences and some missions have multiple possible outcomes. Furthermore, the game features over 6 endings, depending on your actions.\nI really recommend that you pick it up, it's an amazing game and an incredibly well made port.\n9.5/10, with half a point being taken away due to survivors' dumb AI.", "timestamp_created": 1508518323, "timestamp_updated": 1508518323, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544493", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35842888": {"recommendationid": "35842888", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005872436", "num_games_owned": 305, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1719, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508963608}, "language": "english", "review": "Ten years old and looks like it could have come out yesterday.

There rarely zombie games that I like but this is the best IMO. Frank West controls well, the items work well and leveling up makes you actually feel like you level up rather than just getting new things. Voice acting is classic Capcom, survivors are dull but shortcuts make it easier. MAP is perfect THE PERFECT level design. You can play this over and over. Even then they give you 3 extra modes. Not to mention your level, costume, and unlockables carry over. There are plenty of secrets, moves, items and costumes you can get or unlock. This game HAS to be in your Library.

Curieusement, Dead Rising semble ainsi davantage \u00e0 sa place en 2017 qu'en 2006, y compris son alibi narratif: l\u00e0, encore, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, l'\u00e9pid\u00e9mie de zombies provenant d'une exp\u00e9rience cherchant \u00e0 [spoiler]am\u00e9liorer la production industrielle de viande d'\u00e9levage jusqu'\u00e0 l'absurde pour faire face \u00e0 une demande hors de contr\u00f4le[/spoiler] avait beaucoup \u00e9t\u00e9 raill\u00e9e, alors que maintenant cette question \u00e9cologique est prise bien plus au s\u00e9rieux, et la satire fait d'autant plus mouche.\n\nIroniquement, les suites de Dead Rising ont petit \u00e0 petit perdu cette modernit\u00e9 en cherchant \u00e0 \"corriger\" les \"d\u00e9fauts\" du jeu, c'est-\u00e0-dire en reniant ses bases ludiques et en faisant rentrer la s\u00e9rie dans le rang du blockbuster bourrin et accessible. M\u00eame le personnage principal, Frank West, tr\u00e8s riche, mature et nuanc\u00e9 dans le jeu original, est devenu une caricature m\u00e9connaissable dans les jeux qui ont suivi.\n\nAlors \u00e9videmment, il y a malgr\u00e9 tout des choses qui peuvent agacer dans Dead Rising: les fameux appels d'Otis (vitaux puisqu'ils nous informent des objectifs du jeu) qui arrivent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement au pire moment (on doit les \u00e9couter en temps r\u00e9el, parfois au milieu du chaos), les survivants \u00e0 escorter qui s'\u00e9garent et se font tuer b\u00eatement, les combats de boss qui comme on l'a dit peuvent para\u00eetre brouillons, les [i]achievements[/i] parfois lourdingues et chronophages... mais la plupart de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments se contournent facilement ou sont indissociables de l'exp\u00e9rience positive procur\u00e9e par le jeu: les boss deviennent une formalit\u00e9 si l'on sait comment s'y prendre, les survivants sont bien plus faciles \u00e0 guider si on leur d\u00e9signe un endroit o\u00f9 il faut aller au lieu de leur demander de nous suivre (vis\u00e9e puis 'Y', \"over there\", plut\u00f4t que 'Y' seul, \"follow me\"), etc. M\u00eame Otis, \u00e9nervant sur le moment, cr\u00e9e des situations comiques clairement voulues par les concepteurs du jeu, et sa suppression enl\u00e8verait donc quelque chose d'important \u00e0 Dead Rising.\n\nAu final, le premier Dead Rising est un jeu au gameplay et \u00e0 l'univers toujours aussi pertinents en 2017, et il reste le meilleur jeu de zombies jamais cr\u00e9\u00e9 - ou en tout cas celui retranscrivant le mieux les dynamiques, le cadre et l'ambiance des films de zombies sign\u00e9s George Romero, et la version Steam est \u00e0 mon avis la version la plus aboutie de ce chef-d'\u0153uvre. \u00c0 jouer d'urgence!", "timestamp_created": 1505328112, "timestamp_updated": 1511269020, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.598692", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34923370": {"recommendationid": "34923370", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960513931", "num_games_owned": 826, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 1774, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506167601}, "language": "english", "review": "I bought it from a bundle.

They left the game in it's original state and it plays like the xbox 360 version. If you haven't played Dead Rising One lemme break it down, this game is not for everyone. You can mess around in a mall all day but if you want to play the story, it takes an amount of fitting in fun with work in a challenging way. There is a time limit, but in my opinion I think it's a quirky mechanic that allows the Dead Rising Franchise to stand out. Every mission you complete gives a sense of pride and fullfillment due to the fact that the time limit creates tension. Survivor AI is extremely stupid so I suggest you do one run that you ignore the story and have fun, and the other playing the story. Really if you want a unique zombie game this is for you. The Bosses are one of the biggest highlights and you always hear people talking about em.

The timer creates a lot of great anxiety-induced-moments, the music choice is always on point, and there's more seriousness, drama and fear than any of the other Dead Rising games.\n\nWith Dead Rising 2 onward, they introduced a system where you combine weapons; I really, really dislike it. It completely ruins my favorite thing about the first Dead Rising: exploring an abandoned, zombie filled mall and using whatever's around you as a weapon. In Dead Rising you can pick up a knife or a paint can and destroy zombies with it. There was a reason to explore and go into shops, because they might contain a useful weapon. But in the other iterations of the game, if you're not using COMBO WEAPON X or Y, then you're handicapping yourself because that's the overpowered option.\n\nIt's also more of an RPG than the other games. You've got stats, level progression, items that upgrade your stats and affect how well you do in combat in certain ways. You can carry books that boost your followers' abilities, make sharp weapons last longer or do more damage, or allow you to use toys as weapons more effectively. So for me, this provides hours and hours more gameplay time because I enjoy progression, pushing to the next level, and the rewarding sense of reaching the maximum level and becoming a god-like man.\n\nspoilers ahead tho\nMy favorite thing about Dead Rising, without a doubt, is the 3 day limit with events that happen at certain times. It makes the world feel like it's moving, it's alive, and you're experiencing a story. It's hella cinematic. While you're trapped in the mall, within 2 or 3 days a cult begins to appear and post fliers everywhere saying they're having meetings in the theatre. At a certain time of day, the zombies become ultra powerful for a few hours. Prison inmates break free and terrorize survivors in the park.\n\nScripted events happen at certain times and eventually (spoiler) the military busts in and kills all the zombies... There's an incredibly surreal moment where you're exploring the mall and it's DEAD quiet! No zombies, just acres of dead bodies everywhere.

This game was made for 360. A PowerPC 500 mhz processor with max 512mb of video memory. So the fact that it runs like butt on an old card like a 750ti is completely unacceptable, on high. I have a 1080 and it runs fine on that, but it has bad frame tearing issues too. It will also literally crash the game if you kill more than about 50 zombies at a time, which is entirely possible in the maintenance tunnels if you run over a gas canister. \n\nOther than that, it's Dead Rising 1. It has better textures than Dead Rising 2 somehow, and the blood looks better, but literally everything else about it is inferior. You can kill zombies in a variety of ways, but the best weapons pale in comparison to the later entries. There's also the photo mode, which is slightly cool. You can cross dress and wear megaman clothes, put a servbot head on a zombie, walk on their backs, rip their guts out, good wholesom fun. \n\nThe mall has a decent amount of shops and many of them at least become memorable because you encounter psychopaths there - like the grocery, the hardware store, the food court, etc, but in comparison to the later games, at least 2, Willamette mall really does seem to lack soul or give a reason to thoroughly explore.\n\nIt's definitely worth a play through if you never played or beat it, so go ahead and check it out.

AND BOY JEE HOLY FUCJ. I played the everliving (lel) sht out of it. I was sold on the fact you could use anything in this GIGANTIC mall(I mean, it's no mall of america or whatever the worlds largest mall is. Gotta be USA or Saudi Arabia.) \nAnd, well for the most part you could, at least within the realm of reason. Which is a great ton of fun to see all these really cool and really numerous animations and situations with each weapon. It seemed like each single weapon had their own special thing. Sound, effects, animation. (Minus certain similar objects which share obvious similarities.)\nIt was a ton of fun just trying each and every thing. \n\nThen I learned skills.\n\nSo many fun skills. Disembowling, neck twisting, zombie camo walk, walk on a crowd of zombies, spin a zombie around and let go to knock it into other zombies, pick up and throw zombies, face slam zombies to the ground from behind. I have not personally seen ANY game that does combat so well and satisfying with zombies.\n\nFrank West is cheesy as fuck, and he know's you know. Well not really, but he just don't give a f-ck. He's covered wars, he ain't got time for that shiy. He'll make funny grunt noises that are fun to impersonate. (My favorite is \"Woah..\")\nAnd he's got a borderline annoying voice that falls within the realm of where you can't tell if its bad or not but you really dig his style. Especially since most other people in this story are generic fkcin one dimensional twads, having a character who really don't give a shit is cool.\n\nI didn't really like the story mode when I first played(It's alright, only standable since Funk Master Frank West is the main char.)

Pretty fucking good game and an excellent port. Runs very smoothly at 60 FPS. Gamepad highly recommended. \n\nPros:\n- Multiple save slots, a feature not present in the original X360 release. Allows you to experiment a little more with your allotted time limit and lets you easily undo any mistakes by simply loading another slot, saving you a lot of frustration. \n- Decent story. Has a few twists. Not a lot of memorable characters except for Frank, Isabela and some of the bosses. \n- Nice music (WEEEEELLLLLLL)\n- Mall is fun to explore and fun to mess around in, might need more than one playthrough to fully explore everything it has.\n- Combat is extremely satisfying. Plenty of awesome fighting skills to be gained from leveling up. Game rewards experimentation.\n- Very challenging bosses, with some being more bullshit than others. You won't always beat them in one try. \n- Good replay value with multiple game modes and endings. \n\nCons:\n- Has a reverse difficulty curve; starts off really fucking hard and gets progressively easier. Overtime mode, which is unlocked after beating the base game, has difficulty spikes all over it. \n- Controls can feel a little clunky at first (this is a 2006 game after all) but once you get used to it, it feels like second nature. Shooting firearms never feels quite right though. \n- Saving survivors is a crucial part of the game, but their AI is beyond stupid; from not obeying your orders, to not following you, to easily getting stuck in a mob of zombies and dying. They're the most stressful and frustrating thing about the game.

While theres a few irritating points in the game such as the very first part with the camera or the Fact that some weapons after being lost are gone forever, such as the small chainsaws which are easily the best weapon ingame. Another small gripe are some of the fights not being so difficult but rather just a bit annoying, as with the carlito fight he is able to auto lock onto you and if you dont have quick step, a gun or alot of oj you are gonna have a shit time fightin em. as well as the store manager who also has a sorta knock up type thing but is much easier to kill.

Why?\nYou can just ignore it, do nothing to assist anyone and just roam around the mall putting on women's clothing and using CD's to kill. Or you can feel the rush as you dash in a desperate attempt to save all you can. The setting is a favourite of mine, showing a bright landscape that didn't blend with the majority of titles similar to this title that have a grim view of a zombified place. There is nothing like trying to raise tension as you are dressed in Mega Man Boots, a Summer Dress and a Servbot Helmet. Few complaints lie within the survivor AI as since the game tries to paint the protagonist as normal he tends to be a mastermind when tending to the undead as he cleverly pushes a zombie instead of letting it munch on him for 30 minutes, getting someone to get it off him, and then promptly running into a wall. Also I feel like the final parts of 72 hour mode (normal mode) was directed poorly. The atmosphere is great, but due to story reasons there is little to nothing to do.\nOverall I would recommend this game for the experience it provides.

Halo, Grand Theft Auto, and Dead Rising and before buying this game I haven't played the original Dead Rising in years.\nI remember having a ton of fun playing this back on the Xbox360 and playing it on the PC doesn't feel amazing or game changing but definently a improvment from the controller, but playing this game felt refreshing from the games I've been usually playing like PUBG or Overwatch. \n\nThe game is [b]Fun, Hard, and Replayable.[/b]. I say Fun because it's just simply fun, you have almost everything at your disposal. Every different shop has a purpose and a style that fits with that purpose. Weapons to kill, Food to heal, Blenders to blend food together, Magazines to boost certain aspects of gameplay, and just the random sh*t you can do just because you're able to. Also the weapons serve different styles of killing or stunning bosses and the bosses are hard. \nI'm saying hard because each boss is hard in their own ways but sometimes they're just stupidly hard and sometimes are not fun playing which is not a good thing. But defeating most of this bosses/\"Psychopaths\" are fun to try to beat and once beaten will make you feel good about yourself and will help you in a small or big way with some unlocking areas decreasing travel time or unlocking a shop that sells guns and guns are powerful. But again, hte Boss battles can be very  stupid and will probably make you very very angry.\nNow I say Replayable meaning it's very hard to do every single side mission, some will change the game and make it easier but doing them may take a lot of time and time is important and that adds to the difficulty to the game because you need to focus on the main mission cases and if you have time, complete a side mission, save survivors to get PP (xp) to increase your skills, health, and damage. But if your time ends for your mission then the whole game is done if you didn't have another save to save you in that time losing moment. And yes you can't just save when ever you want, you need to go to restrooms to save or sleep in a bed at the safe house, and that just adds to the difficulty to the game.\n\n[b]TLTR: Gameplay is fun, plenty of weapons to fight with, Strategy, unique boss battles, unlockables, story is alright, characters are good, the game is Comfortably Hard (but sometimes stupid hard), and unique gameplay mechcanics.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1501078749, "timestamp_updated": 1503101721, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544619", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33789337": {"recommendationid": "33789337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047085888", "num_games_owned": 146, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2664, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501352182}, "language": "english", "review": "I played it 10 years ago in xbox, and just bought it for PC.

This is perhaps what the intensions were behind Dead Rising as the combat system is so shallow with a fa\u00e7ade of depth behind its agency and comic relief that it makes a game that should encourage the player\u2019s ingenuity with the tools rather than rewarding the only means of play to fight against bosses. It's the Three Stooges' equivalent of Resident Evil as survival horror.\n\nAt first glances when you are experimenting with the tools at Frank West\u2019s disposal, there does appear to be a little more thought behind the gameplay to make it deliberately sluggish and rigid. If you are faced with a horde of zombies blocking an outside door to the lobby, it might be worth it to get a bench or lawnmower to get them out of the way, or it might be more optimal to kick a soccer-ball to knock 20 zombies down from the ricochet of one kick. Had the game continued with this line of thought behind using props like the umbrella as a shield for bullets or alternative means of thwarting bosses and the hordes of zombies, then perhaps I would have fallen in love with the comical displays.\n\nHowever, it quickly becomes apparent the further you delve into the second day bosses that move so quickly and punish the player for getting too close, that the player is meant to rely on firearms and other means of projectiles to win battles that do not take the player\u2019s slowness into consideration. The worst encounter I faced thus far was the motorcycle fight where there is such a short time-frame to aim, much less to run up and swing a melee weapon, that the fight shows how broken the core gameplay is to play. Instead of being inventive, the game rewards conventional solutions that the player won\u2019t know unless they replay the game to anticipate bosses that require guns, so as a result the player will stick with guns the entire time rather than having fun with the props. \n\nThis is a concern even before the other main issue with Dead Rising, and that is the Three Day Time Limit and the way the game enforces a grind not reliant on the player\u2019s skill but rather their arbitrary level.\n\n[h1]At Least Groundhog Day Ended At the End of the Day[/h1]\t\n\nAs much as people complain about the time-limit of this series, the far greater issue with the original is the way it locks behind Frank West\u2019s capabilities behind an arbitrary leveling system that encourages more restarts of the game\u2014or grinding out the game for the 72 hours in-game to get the player at a competent level to get past the difficulty of the bosses. It baffles me how people can praise this system when the problems it creates far outweigh the niche appeal of having effects on the whole narrative by failing parts of the story over the course of several playthroughs.  \n\nFor starters, Frank has specific moves that are unlocked at a certain level that can make fights even within the first day more bearable than if the player is without them such as the dodge-roll. HP bars, extra attacks and maneuvers, item limits and more are all unlocked in a meta-game progression system that doesn\u2019t reward players who earn the upgrade but rather the patience of players to grind out these systems over the course of one or two failed complete playthroughs, or having to restart the game whenever the game pushes you up against the wall that is impossible without exploiting the game. Having to restart the game in this manner is far more annoying than it has any right to be.\n\nAdding a time-limit on top of this mess with side-objectives timers, secondary bosses on timers, story-related timers, etc. are extraneous means of making the game result in failure, which seems like the worst form of padding that makes all the AI pathing issues for escort missions seem trivial in comparison. Had the game utilized these side-objectives to reward players with enough XP to make the restarts a rare occurrence, perhaps the system could be saved; however, in the state of DR as it is, unless you are someone who knows the day-by-day timers as well as the layout of the whole mall to make use of the best weapons in every encounter, the chances are against you to be doomed to start it over again, and again, and in my case, again.\n\n[h1]Cathartic Flagellation of Fun[/h1] \n\nAs much as I despise DR at its core, it\u2019s a game I always wanted to enjoy once I appreciated the appeal of Japanese western-themed cheesiness from Capcom games like Resident Evil 1 and 4. While the story remains so absurd in how serious it takes itself, Frank West is the Americanized action-hero journalist who can suspend the player\u2019s disbelief of his abilities to fight a chainsaw wielding crazy clown or fight of a horde of raincoat cultists exclaiming the doom of the world.  The lunatics and psychopaths of DR offer something of an ironic showcase of the inner demons of humanity while the player engages in the spectacle with any prop they can find to fight them off. It\u2019s a game embodying and displaying pure Catharism that takes itself too seriously in flagellating the player of their errors and time that it forgets to  enjoy itself rather than purging its fears and emotions.", "timestamp_created": 1500756713, "timestamp_updated": 1500759095, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.344358", "comment_count": "13", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33680343": {"recommendationid": "33680343", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015333584", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 7278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519016077}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect port.", "timestamp_created": 1500581499, "timestamp_updated": 1500581499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.529801", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33648177": {"recommendationid": "33648177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104527983", "num_games_owned": 682, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 666, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513631331}, "language": "english", "review": "Frank!\nFrank!\nFRAAAAANK!!!!\n\n10/10 would cover war stories again", "timestamp_created": 1500458087, "timestamp_updated": 1500458087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.489273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33644807": {"recommendationid": "33644807", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147912530", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 2854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502695254}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, escort missions are ass and this game can be difficult at times it shouldn't be but I still completely recommend it.

Also, a zombie is easy to defeat, but beware the horde.\n+ The story and characters are awesome. I won't spoil the story, please experience it yourself. It is deeper than you think. All the (boss) psychopaths are just enjoyably insane (oh pun)! Especially Chapman. I love Chapman.\n+ The sense of progress is ever-present. Every level up matters. New moves are really helpful.\n+ So many great weapons...\n- ...but so, so many of them are practically useless.\n- The survivors' AI can be terrible at times. Some survivors may just randomly die (SOPHIE!), if you're unlucky.\n- Sometimes you just run out of time. Also, failing some missions will permanently remove already saved survivors into the void. Probably not a major problem in later playthroughs.\n-Some glitches are painful. Please save as often as possible.\n\nAnd some random points (no + or -):\n\n*The feeling when you are already stressed out and you hear the Convicts' theme...\n*Seeing zombies faceplanting makes me so happy for no reason.\n*Orange juice for gods\n*Otis is the one friend who doesn't know nobody likes him.

I can see why it's so highly acclaimed but I didn't find myself enjoying it like most others did.\n\nThe game's designed with a controller in mind being originally a 360 exclusive and all. I played with both a controller & KB+M and I found that the KB+M is far more practical overall thanks to the extremely fast & precise aiming when throwing items or using firearms. The skills you can use that require simultaneous button presses are far easier on a controller though. It helps that you can simultaneously use both KB+M and a gamepad.\nLooking at old videos of the classic Dead Rising, this version is a definite improvement in performance; the obvious unlocked frame rate and extremely fast loading compared to the loading screen times I saw on the videos. Graphically, I hardly notice a difference.\n\nThe premise of the game is as it sounds in its popularity, you use anything you find as a means to stay alive against zombies, even if it's just with your bare hands, for at least 72 in-game hours. The plot is about Frank West finding out why an entire town was sealed off by the National Guard. The rest of the story is up to you to decide whether or not to continue the main story or just leave it be whenever and get one of the multiple endings the game has. It's interesting to say the least, even if many elements are rehashes from prior Resident Evil games.\n\nThe entire game is on a time limit where you're to stay alive in a mall for 3 days in-game, supposedly 7.2 hours in real time. It's a hindrance in the fact alone that there's even a time limit to begin with for any kind of playthrough, but also an appeal as it will always give a sense of urgency to encourage the player to think about what missions (called \"Scoops\" in game) to do first or not do at all as every mission, even the main ones, have a time limit on them as well, though it's not impossible to do them all in one playthrough. The side-missions mainly consist dealing with survivors, fighting bosses (psychopaths), or both.\nTo start most of these missions however, you need to be called from the provided transceiver. You get calls during specific times in the game but there are a few things that make it a nuisance. If you get interrupted via a number of possible ways during a call, the dialogue starts right from the beginning if you decide to answer the call again, and it's unskippable. That means you have to find a safe place to take the call from beginning to end without being interrupted, and you'll more often than not get a call at the worst times.\n\nBeing a true sandbox game, you don't actually have to do most anything to progress the game. In fact, I think you can just stand still for 7.2 hours from where the actual game starts and still finish it.\n\nYou can level up for upgraded health, inventory slots, and etc. by taking special photos, killing certain amounts of zombies, etc. etc. Your level progress can carry on towards multiple playthroughs so long as it's coming from the same save file and a new playthrough can be started at almost any time from the main menu, through dying, or by reaching one of the game's wide variety of endings.\n\nThe range of items you can use is somewhat large and there's always something to use nearby that you can kill or, at least, stall with.\nIt's not always obvious though on what you can even use. For example, you see a racket full of tennis rackets but you apparently can't grab them. There's a rack full of food but you apparently can't grab them either. That said, the racks & shelves full of anything offer an unlimited number of whatever they're showing. Unique weapons from bosses always respawn each time you re-enter the area they died in. [i]That said,[/i] everything can only be used for a limited number of times. Books can increase the efficiency of whatever the held book says so long as the book itself remains in the inventory.\nFirearms are among the weakest weapons in the game. They do little damage, each individual gun is only one-use so they \"break\" when their ammo runs out, and you can only stockpile the guns themselves, not the ammo. Against zombies, headshots usually get them down in one hit save for the ones with hard hats on them. All guns practically do chip damage against people. It's a somewhat sensible but still extremely weird balancing issue.\nUnlike the game's sequels, you can't combine items. The only things you can combine are certain food & drinks, which give a drink that provides a special effect depending on the ingredients, though I never found these combined drinks useful in the long run myself.\n\nYou can change up your clothing to your suiting to look nicer or sillier or whatever. Being worse than the mentioned racks of items deal, you can't tell what you'll wear if you find a \"Change Clothes\" option without trying it out first. Even worse, you'll do an animation that you can't get out of each time you try on most new clothes. If you want the default clothing back, they don't make it at all obvious that you can get them back via a pile of boxes in the security room.\n\nThe map for the game is fairly big consisting of at least more than one way of getting inside the main areas. A lot of locations are also interconnected in a sense so if you know what you're doing and where you're going, you can get from A to B in a shorter amount of time than how much a \"regular path\" would take you.\n\nOne of the most common issues that anyone has with this game is the AI for the NPCs with the survivors being the absolute worse.\nThe survivor AI is perhaps the most infuriating aspect in this game. They don't do what you tell them to half the time, they rarely choose the safest of options in a situation, they'll often insist on attacking zombies that are clearly out of their way even regardless of them being outnumbered, they'll run into walls until told to go elsewhere, and really just overall waste your time in a game that insists you to not waste time just because there's something shoddy within their programming or something. Even worse is when you try to escort multiple survivors simultaneously, adding another layer of frustration as they'll keep bumping & staggering into each other. If you're the kind that likes to do \"get survivors to safety\" missions then this can be a serious deal breaker. The only lucky thing about this deal is that you don't actually have to save most anyone to progress even the main story, but just know that trying will mean frustration along the way.\nThe boss fights are both very interesting and very cheaply made. Each boss are easily differential in both character and how they fight. They each have their own unique theme song during a fight when they do have music, giving them a more unique-ness feel to them, even if the songs are a bit unfitting for their character. The fights themselves, however, are either the cheapest fights in the game or the easiest. If you figure out a way to exploit their AI or if you know what to equip yourself with, then they're the easiest. If you're going to fight them \"traditionally\" then you're just trading hits most of the time, and they've got more health than you in a sense.\n\nMultiple playthroughs are encouraged from its very sandbox-y nature. It's a game that gets more enjoyable the more you learn about it so it can get hard to get into at first until you know some ins and outs of how the game works. The tone of the game is supposed to be dark, or at least the story is, but the voice acting and general silliness of what you can do throughout the entire game pretty much overshadows that dark tone.\nIt's a great game in the sense you're pretty free to do a whole lot here, but personally I find it to be a game full of cool ideas with little to support said ideas.", "timestamp_created": 1499765697, "timestamp_updated": 1502155315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33431995": {"recommendationid": "33431995", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028431042", "num_games_owned": 162, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 1095, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502965604}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fuckin' classic", "timestamp_created": 1499696319, "timestamp_updated": 1499696319, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513040", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33421433": {"recommendationid": "33421433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198212310457", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509411810}, "language": "english", "review": "Truly one of the greatest video games of all time.

solo 0,9 horas jugando tengo el juego desde xbox 360\n\nEste juego del 2006 est\u00e1 inspirado en la pelicula \"Amanecer de los muertos\" de george romero,en la cual lo protagonistas como en este juego tienen que sobrevivir a una epidemia zombie dentro de un centro comercial.\nEn este caso el personaje principal es frank west un periodista que se acerc\u00f3 al pueblo de  willamette por los rumores de un bloqueo en el pueblo y ver lo que creia que eran disturbios pero cuando se mete en el centro comercial para saber que pasa descubre que son zombies y que tiene que aguantar 3 dias alli dentro (lo que tardaran en recojerle).\n\nEl objetivo principal de este juego no es desvelar que est\u00e1 pasando ni rescatar a los supervivientes sino que es sobrevivir 3 dias dentro de un centro comercial atestado de zombies.Para ese cometido te dan:Armas,comidas y libros.\n\nPero este juego no es facil ya que las armas no duran mucho;te puedes quedar sin comida y los zombies pueden rodearte y devorarte en cuestion de segundos.Y a eso le a\u00f1ades el enemigo mortal de todo jugador novato en este juego un contrareloj que te hace correr como un pollo sin cabeza por el supermercado Por que las misiones principales desaparecen con el tiempo.\n\nEsto provoca que el juego sea bastante realista a pesar del humor que hay en este  por que el juego no deja de recordarte en ningun momento que tienes que sobrevivir a los 3 dias\n\nA esto le a\u00f1adimos un extra los psicopatas por que los zombies aunque son muchos no son muy peligrosos si les mides bien las distancias pero los psicopatas son mucho mas peligrosos cada uno es un jefe del juego y son especialistas en lo que hacen la mayoria son duros mas por el tiempo que te hacen perder que por la dificultad y algunos dan miedo\n\nCon todo este coctel tienes que ayudar a frank a hacer el reportarje de su vida mientras tratas de sobrevivir a ello", "timestamp_created": 1499443789, "timestamp_updated": 1499443864, "voted_up": true,

And by \"all\" I mean \"beating zombies to death with furniture and stuffed toys.\"\nBut all jokes aside, for those who aren't aware; Dead Rising is a series of games where the main draw is that you can pick up anything that isn't bolted to the floor and use it to kill zombies, whether it be a park bench, a frying pan, a guitar or a gumball dispenser. As a gameplay mechanic, this provides quite a lot of amusement at first, but once you've had your fun and just want to get through a horde... well, you can still throw that bench before brandishing your chainsaw.\n\nOf course, there's more to the game than just mindlessly killing zombies: There are also survivors to be saved, who are about as mindless as the zombies you're fighting. And that's not a joke. The first Dead Rising game features some of the most frustrating survivor AI I have ever encountered. When they're not running straight into a horde of zombies in a poor attempt to follow you, they'll get themselves stuck on each other or fire indiscriminately towards anything even mildly threatening, whether or not you're standing in their way. And they're also really bad at following orders. \"Stay put!\" \"Alright, just let me push this guy over there first!\" \"...Dumbass.\"\n\nBut as stupid as the AI is, you'll still find yourself drawn into the game by the main character Frank West. He's a reporter, in it for the scoop of a lifetime, and he's not afraid to mess with anything that gets in his way to get it, whether it be reluctant policemen or gun-toting maniacs. As if wading through a sea of zombies wasn't already badass enough, he can take on living threats with an equal amount of sass. Think of Bruce Willis in Die Hard, with a penchant for crossdressing and photography, and you have your man.\n\nAnd speaking of Frank, he slowly but steadily grows stronger through a standard character progression system, wherein you earn Prestige Points (PP) through killing zombies, rescuing survivors and taking dramatic photographs. Granted, once you've maximized Frank's power, the whole photography thing can become sort of redundant, save for a few instances where survivors will ask for something related to it... or for getting achievements I guess.\n\nThe story is pretty generic, but it serves it purpose, and it puts pressure on the player to keep up an unrelenting pace. For in this game, you can get certain cues from the helpful janitor Otis to guide you towards both important events and survivors in trouble. Just don't interupt him when he's talking, by being grabbed by a zombie for example. He doesn't like that! And make sure you get there as quickly as possible, because there's a time limit to just about everything, including the chance to get out of there!\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of smashing zombies, you're gonna like Dead Rising. Just remember that it's rough around the edges like most games from its days, and you'll be fine. Also... Watch out for Adam.

I have played every game in the series several times. I say this so you know where I'm coming from when I say that this game has not aged well.\n\nThe graphics hold up surpringly well and performance is a non-issue; Virtually everyone should be able to play this game with the graphics settings maxed and 4K is a breeze on mid-range to high end hardware. Some of the NPC models look blocky but for a 10 year old game it holds up surprisingly well.\n\nWhat hasn't aged as well is the gameplay. The sequel, Dead Rising 2, had so many little, almost invisible tweaks to the formula that really made the gameplay so much more enjoyable. I had forgotten just how frustrating the first game could be. Save points are infrequent; If you don't memorize their locations and plan your trip accordingly, be prepared to repeat long stretches of difficult gameplay. Several of the bosses (called \"Psychopaths\") will have you yelling at the screen and ready to throw your controller in frustration. This game truly was the Dark Souls of its time. \n\nThe Survivors' AI is every bit as terrible as you've probably heard. They'll run into walls, flail about in a crowd of zombies and will push your patience to its limits. It'll take every bit of your resolve not to murder them yourself. And oh god, I'll hear that tranceiver ringing in my sleep tonight. \n\nLike the Souls series, however, there is an immense satisfaction from coming up with a strategy and finally besting that Psychopath who's had you pulling out your hair for hours if not days. The game strongly encourages multiple playthroughs as it is virtually impossible to complete every side quest your first time through. \n\nAt any point, the player can opt to save their current status and start a new game, carrying over their level from the previous playthrough. I actually did this by accident and, while I was a little annoyed by my mistake at first, starting off at lvl 20 does make the game significantly less frustrating. \n\nIf you've never played a Dead Rising game, I recommend watching a few videos of the game as no words I can string together will adequately describe the chainsaw-weilding, judo-throwing, cosplay insanity that comprises the gameplay. It's not for everyone but if you like your zombies hillarious and terrifying at the same time and you're not afraid of a challenge, give Dead Rising a try.", "timestamp_created": 1499304562, "timestamp_updated": 1499305219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33264887": {"recommendationid": "33264887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065278345", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 961, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507183212}, "language": "english", "review": "Very fun game.

shows quite a bit when playing it. I consider this a port being that there is no official mention that this game is a remake/remaster of any sort. I have not played the originally released Dead Rising on the Xbox 360 when it came out but I'm sure that performance, and load times are much better on the PC release than it was on the 360. \n\nThe main benefit of the PC release of Dead Rising is mostly the fact that the game runs at a consistent 60 FPS without ever dipping noticably below that (or at least from my experience). The only drawback to this port is that it is only a port and problems in the original game are present in this game\n\nIssues in the game include dumb AI in the game where survivors constistently get stuck on objects and refuse to walk around them. Also how survivors may or may not listen to your commands when you tell them to go somewhere and sometimes have the tendency to fight every near by zombie and get killed in the process. The quest arrow in the game is also messy to where it will point you towards walls sometimes and direct to in a suboptimal way towards your objective.\n\nThese issues were fixed in the later sequels in the series but remain present even in the re-release of the original title. I wouldn't recommend this to be someone's first Dead Rising game, or atleast not post 2016 anyways.

The fact you can't make your own custom over powered weapons will lead to you feeling weaker and more in danger which is a great feeling that really only the original Dead Rising accomplishes. The map is small enough to remember every inch of it but big enough to feel intimidating and time consuming to traverse. It also feels the most like a living, breathing place.

I save him from the ride and holy moley is his AI COMPLETELY WORTHLESS! He would stand there getting swamped. I save him from that swamp and he doesn't goddamn move. I go right up to him to get him going but he just doesn't budge. It's a clear path man...seriously. And by the time he does get his arse into gear, the horde comes back and gets him again. All while I get hurt and can't find any food in this area.\n\n\"I know a shortcut\" Do you Greg, do you?...It would be rather nice of you to ACRTUALLY get to it then.\n\nThis game is way too clunky to be any fun.\n\n*EDIT* Original post to OficcialKillerSloth\n\nAfter Greg the AI was a lot easier to work with, I don't know why on Earth he didn't budge the first couple of times I found him, no matter how much I called for him. The AI is a bit wonky in this game, it can lead to undesirable results but ultimately when it responds you can guide it alright, even if finnicky through out. Greg just pushed me over the edge a bit after a rough beginning.\n\nBut I had all day, and I ploughed through. I am near the end of the game, the bit just before over time.\n\nI have rather mixed feelings on it so far, some times it feels too hard, now especially where I am, it feels a bit too easy. The game really needs a bit more polish, but for what it is, and for the first game in the series it really isn't that bad. It irks me more than other games do, sometimes its a bit strange, especially when you call someone and they run away. I know it might be meant to symbolise confusion and panic but they end up getting stuck on furniture you have to move for them or they can't figure out how to climb out of the water ways.\n\nAnd that bit later in the game with the car park, when you get the third objective? Why...why does it do that to you!!!! As not spoil anything for anyone.\n\nI like the game, but I also dislike it. I had fun with it in parts, and others it just pushed me the wrong way.\n\n*ANOTHER EDIT* This is yet another post I made in reply to someone, i wish the reply button could go directly to them....pfft. To Rated R\n\nI have finished the game, and yeah, they said the hardest part would be when them ilitary comes into it, but I found that to be a breeze. It was the game befpore this, the general passing days that I found really difficult to get through.\n\nBut yeah, once I learned where the food was it got easier, as well as weapons.\n\nThe challenge in the AI can just get under my skin, for the wrong reasons. Getting stuck on things, not responding and all that. I've had a fair share of enemies AI bork out on me too, leading me to cheese my way through the fight. Sometimes, I am glad this happens as trying to employ strategy often lead me into a spam I couldn't get out of.\n\nBut like I say, I both like and dislike the game. I had fun with it, and I did enjoy it's silly story and characters. It is just a bit of a wonky game that in parts can be really annoying, there are legitimatly challenging parts that are fun to do, then there is the screw up AI that make it a slog.\n\nOverall it is a decent game, it can be lots of fun. However the warning that frustration can and most likely will happen remains.\n\nI managed to get the good ending, which I wasn't sure I was gonna get after the days were up. I thought I might have messed it up. But I got it, and at the very end it became hard again, but less wonky I thought. The final boss took me down a couple of times as I couldn't get my moves on him. Luckily I was only a few points away from leveling up so I could get my health back if needed..still lost. But then I figured out the best way to attack him was to just slightly cheese it with jump kicking, then immediately floor swiping him....can't do squat against that.", "timestamp_created": 1497172391, "timestamp_updated": 1497351154, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.362731", "comment_count": "4", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32326530": {"recommendationid": "32326530", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048583636", "num_games_owned": 441, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 1202, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502773051}, "language": "english", "review": "Best zombie killing sandbox out there.", "timestamp_created": 1497125578, "timestamp_updated": 1497125578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.486262", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32322248": {"recommendationid": "32322248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198281756135", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 2841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1520409811}, "language": "english", "review": "Photo Journalism at its best.", "timestamp_created": 1497113117, "timestamp_updated": 1497113117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545811", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32282366": {"recommendationid": "32282366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066329515", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 1697, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499916193}, "language": "english", "review": "The best Dead Rising\n\n\nSo BUY it", "timestamp_created": 1496979597, "timestamp_updated": 1496979597, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.496868", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32187068": {"recommendationid": "32187068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071293409", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 678, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1496788479}, "language": "english", "review": "Follow me!

One Camera. Three days.[/h1]\n\n[i]Just to note: I've played Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2 and Dead Rising: CtyD. I won't be comparing them, this is just for reference.[/i]\n\nDead Rising revolves around a zombie catastrophe occuring in a small town (with an arguably large populace I might add), and the key area being that of a shopping mall. Frank West, a photojournalist, secures his own way into the now under quarentine town to investigate further into the whole mess. With a promise from his helicopter pilot that he'll arrive again in 72 hours on the dot, Frank has only that much time to gather as much news worthy media and story that he can secure.\n\nThe gameplay focuses around the player making the best use of his time possible to complete the story driven objectives, while at the same time accomplishing whatever secondary matters might show up, such as rescuing other people within the mall, killing hordes of zombies here and there, or dealing with some very unsavoury characters that show up. All the while you have to worry yourself about not dying out there, and making sure to acquire as much PP (the experience points of the game) to level up and become stronger, so you can get more done, faster.\n\nAn interesting part of the game however, is that even if you fail one of the major plot points of the game, you're still allowed to continue playing, just now that the rules have changed is all. You'd no longer be able to advance the plot, but side objectives are still available, your experience can still be accumulated, and the secrets of the mall are still available if you can hunt them down.[spoiler]There's even multiple endings, don't be afraid to experiment with failure.[/spoiler]\n\nBeyond that, Frank himself will actually keep his levels in between playthroughs and the different gamemodes available. You save his statistics onto one of the save slots available, and the next time you load up that save, you'll have the option of continuing whatever run you have going right now, or can start over, this time, locked and loaded with your power now upgraded. It shows the raw beauty of how weak Frank starts out, but eventually how he can be turned into a beast of a machine with enough dedication.\n\nThe mall as the game's location is a prime example of how well local enviroments can be transformed into great playgrounds, you have several sections of the mall to venture through, each with different store outlets and goodies around every corner for you to play with. Improvisation is the name of the game, nothing is too silly or too weak to ignore, a bag of brown sugar might save your life if the situation's that desperate. It offers a lot of fun ways to dismember the undead, and while you can interact with just about everything in sight, some things are sadly just not usable, which can leave you wanting for more when you start running out of things to use.\n\nWith unlockables to acquire and several completionist accomplishments and achivements, there's enough to keep you busy for a good while, though arguably by now, things might be a little easier than they were back in the 360 days. Blame it on controls or blame it on a new idea taking people by storm, but by now, the game can seem very simple, and very easy if you just apply a little bit of forethought into things.[spoiler]The Blue Chainsaw really undermines a lot of the game.[/spoiler]You can always put restrictions on yourself of course, but if the game makes you want to do that early into it, then just be a little wary. \n\nI could go more in depth, but enough space has been used up here.\n\nDead Rising is a unique game, it really settled a good example of the whole zombie survival genre, despite not being about keeping yourself fed or anything. It's a different feeling, it can be very surreal at time, I could draw comparisons to the future like Deadly Premonition, but this was a good pioneer in a lot of ways. Certainly worth a playthough for the experience, but there are a lot of other games to pick from that could fit your niche.\n\n\ntl;dr - A good game, especially if you've never touched anything like it. If you're looking for something to hold your attention for a long time, it's a contender, but not the best.\n\nbtw He ain't my boy, but the brother is ready.", "timestamp_created": 1495702789, "timestamp_updated": 1495704127, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.578495", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31925993": {"recommendationid": "31925993", "author": {"steamid": "76561198270952794", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1104, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507420656}, "language": "english", "review": "After 10 years this game is still fantastic.", "timestamp_created": 1495582584, "timestamp_updated": 1495582584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641549", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31821963": {"recommendationid": "31821963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198116854774", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1407, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1521296148}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0436\u0434\u0430\u043b \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443)\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0435\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0434\u044b\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430. \u0428\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430!\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1495115232, "timestamp_updated": 1495115232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31807102": {"recommendationid": "31807102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052321989", "num_games_owned": 308, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 599, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520530431}, "language": "french", "review": "Ayant ador\u00e9 le jeu sur xbox360, j'adore donc la version pc aussi !\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 rapide : On est enferm\u00e9 dans un centre commercial infest\u00e9 de zombies, nous devons trouv\u00e9 l'origine de cette apocalypse zombie tout en devant nous d\u00e9fendre contre eux !

Jest ona bardziej t\u0142em dla ca\u0142ej rozgrywki. G\u0142\u00f3wnym protagonist\u0105 jest Frank West. Fotograf, fotojournalista , kt\u00f3ry ju\u017c ma na swoim koncie par\u0119 relacji z wydarze\u0144 na \u015bwiecie, wojen oraz innych wielkich historii.

Jak si\u0119 po\u017aniej okazuje tyle mamy czasu na ucieczk\u0119 z opanowanego przez zombie centrum handlowego.\n\nGra wita nas do\u015b\u0107 surowo. Na pocz\u0105tku ci\u0119\u017cko prze\u017cy\u0107 w opanowanym przez zombie wielkim centrum handlowym b\u0119d\u0105c uzbrojonym jedynie w aparat fotograficzny.

Niestety gra jak i ca\u0142a seria zreszt\u0105 znana jest z tego, \u017ce prawie nie da si\u0119 przej\u015b\u0107 jej za pierwszym razem chyba, \u017ce gra\u0142o si\u0119 wcze\u015bniej i zna si\u0119 j\u0105 doskonale. Z jednej strony to dobrze poniewa\u017c gra wci\u0105\u017c bawi i posiada wiele zako\u0144cze\u0144 kt\u00f3re a\u017c chce si\u0119 ogl\u0105da\u0107. I przed\u0142u\u017ca \u017cywotno\u015b\u0107 gry. Z drugiej wiadomo, \u017ce nie ka\u017cdy ma ochot\u0119 gra\u0107 po raz drugi. Jednak Dead Rising broni si\u0119 znakomicie daj\u0105c nam sandboxowy \u015bwiat opanowany przez zombie i trzeba przyzna\u0107, \u017ce jak na gr\u0119 z 2006 naprawd\u0119 daje rad\u0119. Pikanterii dodaje fakt \u017ce naszych przeciwnik\u00f3w mo\u017cemy traktowa\u0107 dos\u0142ownie wszystkim :  desk\u0105, kijem basebolowym, kas\u0105 fiskaln\u0105 a nawet... mieczem \u015bwietlnym. Jak wspomnia\u0142em gra jest z przymr\u00f3\u017ceniem oka.

I wychodzi mu to naprawde nie\u017ale.\n\nOd strony technicznej zmiany s\u0105 widoczne cho\u0107 czu\u0107 tu wiekowo\u015b\u0107 produktu. Tak gra wspiera rozdzielczo\u015bci 4k, dodano opcje zmiany klawiszologii/ przycisk\u00f3w pada, nowy system zapisu kt\u00f3ry ma a\u017c do pieciu miejsc, oraz Zmienn\u0105 cz\u0119stotliwo\u015b\u0107 wy\u015bwietlania klatek  dla monitor\u00f3w 144 Hz z obs\u0142ug\u0105 technologii Nvidia G-SYNC .

W szczeg\u00f3lno\u015bci je\u015bli nie przeszkadza nam fakt, \u017ce wci\u0105\u017c to jest jednak remaster i pr\u00f3\u017cno wymaga\u0107 by gra wygl\u0105da\u0142a lepiej. Je\u015bli nie przeszkadza wam troszk\u0119 naci\u0105gana fabu\u0142a za kt\u00f3r\u0105 nadrabia sam gameplay daj\u0105cy naprawde sporo frajdy. A chcieliby\u015bcie zobaczy\u0107 jak to jest broni\u0107 si\u0119 przed zombie tym co macie akurat pod r\u0119k\u0105.  To zdecydowanie jest to produkt dla was.  Musz\u0119 przyzna\u0107 , \u017ce spodziewa\u0142em sie mniej po Dead Rising 1.

The core gameplay is ridiculously fun but there are a few things that may be dealbreakers for some people. \nThe first thing is that the entire game is set on a timer. The entire goal of the game is to survive 72 ingame hours. All quests are timed and you're on a strict schedule. You only have a short time window to perform quests and if you miss that window, then you fail the quest. This makes it near impossible to complete all the side missions, meaning that you will almost certainly have to pick and choose which missions to tackle and which ones to ignore. \nThe second thing that may discourage some players is the abundance of escort missions. Almost all side missions will involve you escorting survivors to the safehouse, and unfortunately, the survivors are pretty much incapable of doing anything. This makes it very difficult to keep them alive, especially when you have to escort 3-5 of them at a time. It is important to rescue as many as possible as rescuing survivors is the quickest way to level up.\nThe third thing is the difficulty of the game itself. The game is very hard the first time through. It is important to level up as much as possible, which means rescuing as many people as you can. Part of the problem is that you don't get to choose your upgrade for leveling up. Everytime you level up, the bonus that you earn is random. Weapons also break very easily, and you can pretty easily be caught without weapons in a horde of zombies.\n\nIf these things don't bother you, I think you may enjoy this game.", "timestamp_created": 1492810017, "timestamp_updated": 1492810017, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660786", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31261364": {"recommendationid": "31261364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027298007", "num_games_owned": 530, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 662, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474760536}, "language": "english", "review": "The grandaddy of DR comes to PC, and the port is great.

Este \u00e9xito es indudablemente fruto del primer juego que hoy tenemos entre manos. Dead Rising sali\u00f3 all\u00e1 en el 2006 en exclusiva para Xbox360, fue hace unos meses apenas cuando pudimos disfrutarlo en otras plataformas como Steam. \n\n\u00bfY en qu\u00e9 consiste este videojuego? La premisa es sencilla, debes sobrevivir 72 horas (6 horas en tiempo real) en un Centro Comercial lleno de zombis. Puedes utilizar cualquier cosa que est\u00e9 al alcance de tu mano, desde pistolas hasta balones de playa. El tono semi-desenfadado nos da la posibilidad de tomarnos las cosas de forma seria (cual [i]survival horror[/i]) o tomarnos de forma c\u00f3mica. \n\nGr\u00e1ficamente sobresale el potencial que tuvo en su d\u00eda cuando sali\u00f3 para Xbox360, el hecho de ver mover a tal cantidad de enemigos en pantalla era apabullante (hoy en d\u00eda sus secuelas mueven el triple de enemigos). Adem\u00e1s, si tenemos en cuenta que se trata de una remasterizaci\u00f3n, vemos que no ha envejecido nada mal. Para los m\u00e1s quisquillosos se ha a\u00f1adido unos 60 frames estables y 1080p de resoluci\u00f3n. \n\nSin duda es un juego original, pero en las mismas mec\u00e1nicas en las que sobresale puede llegar a ser tedioso para muchos jugadores: el tener un tiempo l\u00edmite para pasarse la historia, el guardado autom\u00e1tico (no hay puntos de control), la dificultad al empezar, la sensaci\u00f3n de no poder cubrir todo lo que quieres en tu primera ronda\u2026 El sistema de niveles est\u00e1 implementado de forma que el juego nos resulte m\u00e1s sencillo pero a la vez se nos ampl\u00ede las cosas que podemos abarcar en el juego como rescatar un mayor n\u00famero de supervivientes o eliminar a ciertos psic\u00f3patas en segundas pasadas que al principio son imposibles. \n\n[h1]Lo mejor: [/h1]\n\n-La originalidad. \n-Poder matar zombis con casi cualquier cosa que se te ocurra. \n-El n\u00famero de enemigos en pantalla (si entendemos que es de 2006). \n-La versatilidad con la que puede ser tomado el juego. \n-La personalidad de Frank West. \n\n[h1]Lo peor: [/h1]\n\n-Algunas mec\u00e1nicas pueden ser tediosas para algunos jugadores. \n-Tener que pasarse varias veces el juego para descubrir todo su potencial puede no entusiasmar a muchos. \n\n[b]Conclusi\u00f3n: [/b] Si te gusta el g\u00e9nero zombi o buscas una propuesta original lo recomiendo.

He finds it in a zombie outbreak that forces him to hide and struggle for a way out of a Mall (This element is the main reference to the Dawn Of The Dead tribute, it is designed based on the Mall in the movie).\nWithout spoiling the story, we can say that what really makes Dead Rising an enjoyable title is the original structure it had back in the day and the charm it still has. The way your character develops in the story, the variety of tools and interactions with the environment or simply the \"boss\" enemies and their characterization, make Dead Rising a funny and entertaining experience which sometimes seems to make fun of the player and gives a lot of reason to smile and laugh about even though you're living a horror experience full of violence and gore.\nI recommend this game to the fans of the zombie genre as well as the players who like a different kind of survival horror mixed with a dose of pure silliness and irony.", "timestamp_created": 1492456535, "timestamp_updated": 1492457529, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31205209": {"recommendationid": "31205209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306007468", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1773, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514795026}, "language": "english", "review": "FRANKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK", "timestamp_created": 1492455388, "timestamp_updated": 1492455388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.559541", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31201439": {"recommendationid": "31201439", "author": {"steamid": "76561198351411233", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1337, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483110569}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Esta cool", "timestamp_created": 1492442622, "timestamp_updated": 1492442622, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31184170": {"recommendationid": "31184170", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155114561", "num_games_owned": 163, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 88, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495230070}, "language": "english", "review": "\nFun survival- type Zombie game.

In DR1 it's more about surviving the zombies--they're an obstacle, part of the \"survival\" factor in this game. Thus trying to kill mass amounts of them at a time doesn't bode well with how intentionally clunky, slow, and weak most weapons/attacks are. You're not SUPPOSED to be killing tons of them you're supposed to be getting them out of the way so you can accomplish tasks. Which, once you realize and get used to that, this game isn't bad. I can see why some people preferred this style of Dead Rising because of how engaging the story is and how challenging this game can be. While your weapons/attacks are slow, movement for both you and psychopaths is very quick. You can move very fast and you need to use that to your advantage. Having beaten this game and gotten the A ending my first try, the story is definitely the main attraction here. That's not to say the gameplay isn't fun, it's fun to throw useless weapons at zombies like CDs and plates and such, and finding weapons like the chainsaw or the small chainsaw or a sword is great for when you need to clear a path.

Willamete, Colorado. Population: 53, 594. Distinguishing characteristics: jack shit!\"[/h1]\n[i]- Ed DeLuca on Willamete, Colorado[/i]\n\nIf you went out onto the street, tackled a random person and asked them what their least favourite gameplay segments are, you'll probably hear about Escort Quests, Timed Missions, and Item Durability. Maybe some other stuff that isn't relevant to this review.\n\nWelcome to this review of Dead Rising, by the way. That's the game. If I had to give it a genre, I'd put it into \"Lament Configuration\". \n\nDead Rising is an experimental sandbox game, a leftover of that era where Capcom was riding high and trying new IPs left right and center. Sort of like that brief era where EA funded new IPs instead of killing studios, but Dead Rising has enough corpses to match. \n\n[h1]\"THIS IS MY STORE.\"[/h1]\n[i]- Steven Chapman, with some exposition about his store.[/i]\n\nCore gameplay involves responding to \"scoops\" or calls (which operate on some weird rules) going out and rescuing the survivors of these calls (who operate on some weird rules) with gameplay itself that involves item durability conservation while trying to minimize the amount of damage that zombies get on you (that has some weird rules of its own) and occasionally doing a plot mission (very standard, not much to note).\n\nDead Rising is a game of weird rules. \n\nOf invulnerability frames to abuse and get abused by, of hitboxes to figure out, of weapon stashes and unlocks to gain and gain again. Combine that with a zero to hero levelling system and you have a game that doesn't just want you to figure it out, it wants you to destroy it. \n\nTo build Frank from a consistently failing paparazzi to a juggernaut freelancer through multiple playthroughs and exploration. \n\nIt teaches you to become used to failure through a rather gentle introduction of inability, and it teaches you to love overcoming it. And sometimes even to court it. In that factor, Dead Rising is a masterclass of design, supported by incredible pacing, complex but distinct level design, a fairly responsive action system full of combos and quirks, and a story that's way more interesting than it has any right to be.\n\nEven if it does kind of fizzle out, beyond the initial presentation and a couple of great moments.\n\n[h1]\"It doesn't hurt. Not even a little. I'm already dead.\"[/h1]\n[i]- One of the better lines in the game.[/i]\n\nNow it's not perfect. Course not. For a game that's a solid 60% escort quests, it doesn't do it any favours that the survivor AI is absolutely braindead. They'll helplessly stand around zombies, get stuck on potplants, corners, and each other, and often need a good kick in the behind to get them moving, even when you've mitigated their AI with the endgame approach of slaughtering everything. \n\nPsychopaths, by far the most interesting part of the game, get trivialized with the same endgame equipment and setups, and the strict time limit means you'll never be putting down an edge to actually fight them. \n\nAny situation that forces you to use your skills and such does show how rudimentary they really are. Cancelling a somersault into a roundhouse sweep sounds great until you find your feet clipping right through psychopaths and zombies because they're not in exactly the right position for the hitbox to connect, or find out the hard way just how useless the dodge is for anything but breaking a stunlock.\n\nIt's okay, fun when it's not breaking, but it's no Ninja Gaiden or DMC or the like. Lament Configuration first, action second.\n\nMost disappointing about Dead Rising is that Overtime, Infinity Mode, and a lot of the superficial stuff (like actually unlocking the Mega Buster) are just chores. They suck. Realtime 14 hours of sitting around hitting a button every twenty minutes, or making the same 3 minute route constantly for 3-4 hours, is exactly as fun as it sounds. \n\nI'm sure a couple of people enjoy it, good on them. Didn't care for it at all.\n\n[h1]\"And yet he complained that his belly was not full.\"[/h1]\n[i]- Final lines[/i]\n\nFor what Dead Rising is, for what it represents, these failings are more than excusable. An insanely replayable, experimental game based around failure and triumph is worth at least one playthrough, even if that doesn't mean getting the most out of it. \n\nIt's worth your time, and is remarkably happy to remind you about how much of that you've got left.", "timestamp_created": 1490455196, "timestamp_updated": 1490488458, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724370", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30710219": {"recommendationid": "30710219", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999299597", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 157, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479813080}, "language": "english", "review": "Dead Rising 1 is so much better than \u00a8Saints Rising 4.\u00a8 Am I rite?

The plot stayed stright faced and melodramatic through and through. This made it laugh out loud hilarious when frank would pop up in cut scenes wearing a stuffed bear head and machine gun ammo belts. There is nothing funnier than watching a grown man discuss a bomb threat with DHS agents while dressed as mega-man. mean while DR2 relies on one liners, DR3 trys to be dark and gritty while also having a jet-pack strapped boss IN A STORY MISSION, and DR4 attempts a revelutionary comidic strategy by just being the joke. \n\n2: No combo weapons. They are not \"bad\" so to speak but they make every other weapon pointless. Part of the fun/comedy of DR1 was being able to fight your way out of a bad spot with nothing more than a trash can and a plastic deck chair. you can still get those two things in other Dead Risings, but the damage they deal is massivly toned down to the point where they are no longer a viable option. Not that it matters concidering you wont leave the comfort of safty without an inventory full of electrified machetes in later games turning every horde encounter into a chore rather than a ludacris fight for survival.\n\n3: Well thought out modes. There are 3 modes in the game. 72 hour mode (the main story), overtime mode (essentially the prologue), and infinite mode (survival). the devolopers relised that the Prologue was way to jarring of a gameplay shift to include in the main game, so rather than pussy out, and make the prologue the same thing you've been playing for six hours, they seperated it and made it its own mode which made the prologue very memorable. infinite mode is a very well thought out and developed survival mode, which i have wasted way to much time in (Check that play time).\n\nDR1 was one of the best games on Xbox 360, and now with better resolution/anti-aliasing/frame rate its one of the best games on steam hands down.", "timestamp_created": 1490155069, "timestamp_updated": 1490155069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.624700", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30626068": {"recommendationid": "30626068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059131251", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1663, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484516343}, "language": "english", "review": "Story, character and atmosphere-wise my favorite entry in the series.

That may just be intentional, though.\n\nWhen this game is only $20 and the abomination that is DR4 goes for $60, you KNOW you have to go with this game. We must make Capcom aware that we want more games like this, not soulless cash grabs made by inhuman monsters (AKA Canadians).\n\n...I'm sorry, that was meant as a joke.

Interesting enough to keep you engaged\n[b] Setting [/b] = Brilliant! A shopping mall and a very nice shopping mall to boot. The open world isn't as huge as most open world games but heck, this is a perfectly sized shopping mall for this game.\n[b] Gameplay [/b] = This encompasses a lot. The combat system is...awkward. I mean, I'd rather use weapons than try and pull of some fancy wrestling move only to be swarmed by 3-4 zombies. The only thing I found helpfull was the flying kick, followed by a roundhouse as I landed, a perfect way to open up for my flurry of sword/dagger/bat swings. \nA suplex? A hammer throw? Wall jump kick? I pretty much got eaten alive by the time I could pull these moves off. This is not Batman, there is no freeflow combat....that's exactly what this game needed to make the hand to hand combat perfect.....zombies dont think too quickly though. \nThe guns are a little better ( headshots work well ), if somewhat limited. \nDon't get me started on the survivor/escorts AI.....There are ample comments about how much more stupid the \"living\" are than the zombies. \n\nTaking photo's is an afterthought eventually....\nSome very entertaining moments!\n\nSo, you really need to put in a little work and try to understand HOW this game works before you get some enjoyment out of it. \n\nNow my 10 cents....\n\nBecause of the stupid amount of games I have on steam, I've started to get through them all with a specific system. \n\nFirstly, decide on a game to play (a no brainer), then dedicate a good 2-3 hours to it. Secondly, if I'm not having fun (because games are supposed to be fun), quit it, delete, leave a negative review but with constructive criticism and put the game in my hidden list. Thirdly, if it's a game I'm enjoying, play it through and repeat the steps.\n\nFunny thing about this game, I got to step 2, hated the game then thought \" I'm missing something here...there has to be more of a point to this...\". I went into Dead rising without knowing too much about it, expecting something like State of decay or Dead island with a combat system that made you feel badass. I didn't get what I was expecting....\n\nYou have to dig a bit deeper to enjoy this game, it's not a jump in and bash the crap out of everything game, though you can do that eventually, you don't do it from the get go. There are things you have to understand before you can get to the point of feeling like a badass....\n\nFor starters, you have to understand this game is based on a \"triage\" system when it comes to completing a \"scoop\" or \"case file\". You are timed in missions but not so much that you're overwhelmed and frustrated. \nSecondly, you have to understand the save system. You can save the game in certain areas only and to a number of different slots. However, anytime you die and save to start again, you have all of your stats and character progress intact! This opens up a hell of a lot of possibilities. The level cap (of 50 I think), can easily be reached in one playthrough. \n\nIf you're at the party looking for the hot girl/guy who's saying all the right things to you and making it so easy for you to take her home....You're at the wrong party or left your invite in your golfer pants. \nNow, if you happen to be at the party where the BBW is kinda awkwardly dancing without co-ordination and she's a bit loud but she's got a  gorgeous face and is giving you the eye, then you NEED to go chat with her, understand her, invite her out for a date, don't care what other poeple think and you'll discover that there's a lot more going on.

Released back in 2006 as what felt like a third party launch title for the Xbox 360, Dead Rising has had a great transition over to Steam in August of 2016 as a part of its 10th Anniversary. It feels great to play on either a Controller or a Mouse and Keyboard, and while it has some dated aspects such as aiming a gun with the left stick when you aim or the stiff mouth movements in cutscenes, it doesnt hurt the experience much at all. The game, while fun, has some pretty big balancing issues, primarily the Small Chainsaw (which Capcom should never nerf). If you gather 2 books from the Bookstore underneath Columbian Roastmasters in Paradise Plaza (The Engineering and the Entertainment books) and then went over to Sir Book-a-lot in Wonderland Plaza and grabbed the Criminal Biography book, it lasts for about 27,000 swings, which is about the entire game. Also, some of the achievements are very annoying to get, mostly the 5 and 7 Day Survivor, Saint, and Transmissionary achievements. They are brutal and require you to know EXACTLY what you're doing.\n\n Other than that, the story is servicable and some people call the best in the series, though I prefer Dead Rising 2's story. The combat is one of the more fun things in this game like performing the special moves which are unlockable by, wait for it --- leveling up. Doing stuff like rescuing survivors (which have the worst AI known to man and made me want to claw my eyes out), completing scoops, case files and defeating Psychopaths gives you experience, where you can max out your level to level 50. Beware though, driving in this game is AWFUL and if you can avoid it, please do so. Frank is a good character, and to me hes just plain awesome. Another unique aspect is that you can also get rewarded for mixing food in blenders, like if you put a Coffee Creamer along with another food, lets say Orange Juice, you will get Quickstep, which makes you run like Sonic in the middle of a bathroom emergency for a short period of time. This game is incredibly hard to 100% though, so beware of that. To sum up what I said, while it doesnt have co-op or a true sandbox mode, if you can forgive that --- its the definition of old but gold.", "timestamp_created": 1487563477, "timestamp_updated": 1487563477, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": -1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29942580": {"recommendationid": "29942580", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210210885", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 64, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1487169084}, "language": "german", "review": "Es sollte auch einen Modus NUR mit Openworld geben, ohne das man von der Zeit gehetzt wird...", "timestamp_created": 1487169061, "timestamp_updated": 1487169061, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523622", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29918314": {"recommendationid": "29918314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271591136", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 2265, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507128197}, "language": "italian", "review": "Il miglior capitolo della saga in assoluto!\nNon ha nulla di negativo, tranne l'intelligenza artificiale dei superstiti che a volte fa venire rabbia\nPorting fantastico (60 FPS fissi + supporto controller PS4)\nConsiagliato al 100%", "timestamp_created": 1487069732, "timestamp_updated": 1487069732, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680928", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29861904": {"recommendationid": "29861904", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125620295", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4135, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517976223}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than The 4th game", "timestamp_created": 1486863145, "timestamp_updated": 1486863145, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.446796", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29856752": {"recommendationid": "29856752", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262062532", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 35, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485613113}, "language": "english", "review": "doesnt work . but dr 2 & 3 do . now i gotta go waste $$ on x1 version", "timestamp_created": 1486845024, "timestamp_updated": 1486845024, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.344626", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29849457": {"recommendationid": "29849457", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007991109", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 231, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474656744}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I've cuddled wild boars, you know!\" - Funk West", "timestamp_created": 1486824851, "timestamp_updated": 1486824873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.474138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29832564": {"recommendationid": "29832564", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122473816", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504000692}, "language": "english", "review": "A good ol classic 10 years old zombie beat em up game.\nit's may be outdated but it does have its own charm if you asked me.\nGo buy this instead Dead Rising 4, this game got no DLC, and hell a lot better than Dead Rising 4.\nIt's worth it.\nI rate it 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1486761196, "timestamp_updated": 1486761196, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608948", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29813271": {"recommendationid": "29813271", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044169478", "num_games_owned": 343, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 3694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514693401}, "language": "english", "review": "I wanted this game so bad when I got my Xbox 360.

The controls made sense even though being forced to stand in one place to aim was frustrating at times it still made sense due to the fact that frank even states he has never fired a weapon at someone before in the intro chapters. The AI for the humans was more than irritating though. And unless you knew exactly what to do many of the psychos were nigh impossible without tons and tons of food. This PC variant doesn't state that it is a remastering of the original even though it is and improves upon many aspects of the original game. The Graphics have improved quite drastically if you do a side by side comparison. The AI has also improved(more so for the zombies than the humans) the psychos react more appropriately to combat and the humans follow commands better. However I find that there are several human survivors more interested in sobbing in the center of a horde of zombies than fighting or following orders(can be a minimal issue with the help of a magazine that improves survivor confidence). It also seems as though all dlc is included and controller support is fully functional. The story for this thing is not entirely required to complete the game but I highly recommend playing through the story as it can be pretty interesting compared to most zombie games. The story pushes you to do things quickly so pathway flow from survivor to survivor to psycho to safe house can and is very important(be sure to plan ahead and map your route). The variety of weapons, toys, abilities, and costumes is almost unrivaled only to its sequels(some special costumes grant powerful abilities or weapons as well).

I did run into some framerate issues with 2x crossfire 290x's, which I'm guessing is probably just an AMD thing (I've come to accept that most of the time, that's all it is), because even thought I play this game in 4k and it runs perfect otherwise, whenever too many zombies are on screen, it drops down to below 30 frames even when I drop the resolution and graphical settings as low as they can go (and I have a n i7 4790k so I doubt it's a cpu issue).\nNow that I've beaten the game and gotten the true ending, I'm wishing there was a mod that added a true sandbox mode instead of the regular Infinite Mode.", "timestamp_created": 1486161620, "timestamp_updated": 1486161620, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601643", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29675390": {"recommendationid": "29675390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084136768", "num_games_owned": 280, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 2006, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518543473}, "language": "english", "review": "The game, that started the series, about killing zombies in funny ways! Originally released in 2006, as an Xbox 360 exclusive.While it was praised, it had a lot of issues:\n-This game had the most notorious A.I. in gaming. Survivors were SO dumb, everyone, who played this game, hated them.\n-Otis Washington.F**k that guy\n-Weird animations\n\n And that's as much as I remember...anyway, after 10 years, it was released to 8th Gen consoles. While the game is not bad at all, all the issues, that this game had a decade ago are still present...the A.I. is still braindead and there's no way to fix them.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the issues, this game is not bad at all. At least, fans of the 2nd,OTR and 3rd games finally get to taste the first one.However, here's what you should consider before buying it.That is, if you played 2nd or OTR games before:\n-Like I said, get used to A.I.\n-NO. COMBO. WEAPONS.\n-Not as much time between the cases,like the 2nd game had\n-You don't have to worry about Zombrex\n-You don't need to earn money\n-Guns are more important in this game\n-Harsher difficulty curve\n-No Skateboards(Optional)\n-No Online Modes\n\nThose who played 3rd game and not/before 2nd or OTR, get used to:\n-Open world is small\n-Again,NO. COMBO. WEAPONS\n-NO. COMBO. VEHICLES.\n-Again.

Needless to say I got to see the \"___has become undead\" message pop up 2 more times before i got to the security room and then i died myself after wasting all but one square of my health trying to save the mentally challenged \"survivors\" i was tasked with rescuing. 10/10 the AI is still shitty and i had to set aim to right mouse button and camera to Q so i didnt get cancer trying to use the default controls but damn this game really makes you feel like shit when people die and actually has a nice balance of difficulty/horror/comedy/mystery/tension/action/artistry in amounts that the sequels all lacked to varying degrees.

I had seen some videos about it when it was an xbox exclusive, but I never had an xbox 360. \n\nThere was a Wii spinoff, which I did not try because back then I was not interested in the series. Just like with other game misunderstandings of how the game was or how it played. \nYears later, I had read and heard good stuff on a remixed version of the sequel, Dead Rising 2 Off The Record. I rented the PS3 version and... \nHonestly? I loved it.\nThe humor,  the design philosophy that was similar to Breath of Fire V, where you are not lost if you lose, but you get to try again, the limits it had.\nAnd the sandbox mode it added. That was important.\nOff The Record was my first experience with Dead Rising. And it was enough to make me a fan of the series. OR  at least a fan of that particular entry.\n\nAfterwards I ctually LOOKED at how this played, I saw videos, I saw a good LP of it (http://lparchive.org/Dead-Rising/). I started to understand what was done for OTR and why.\n\nAnd then I started getting the entire series on Steam. Or at least I did this year. \nDead Rising 2 OTR is  CONSIDERABLY more accessible. The first Dead Rising is VERY strict about what it does and what it wants. The timing to rescue the survivors in the first game is much  more strict than it is in the sequels, but that is how it goes.\nThe first game is  very strict.  Dead Rising 2 eased up the  requirements, even though it  added  a bit more complication with the zombrex, but it was looser, as well as adding new things, like combination  weapons.\nOff The Record did it again there, and even more, added a mode where the  time limit is REMOVED. The Sandbox mode.\n\nDead Rising 3 removed the photography, which is an element I GREATLY enjoyed in OTR and in this one, but made it more accessible, as well as making the weapon combination more important and flexible, but the focus on having to save survivors and managing a strict time table was made completely optional. It is still a very fun game but  what made the first game so special was diluted by then.\nOn the other hand, that does not make me like it any less. Since I started with one that was  MUCH more  flexible. \n\nDead Rising 4 seems to have removed all of that. Seems like its design is a much expanded  Sandbox mode from OTR.\nI will be getting that when it gets on Steam.\n\nThis is a very strict game.\nIt is nowhere as accessible as its sequels.\nBut it is a very interesting experience with a good sense of humor.\n\nAnd you get to dress up Frank/Chuck/Nick/Frank again with a Servbot helmet, I guess. \n", "timestamp_created": 1483419167, "timestamp_updated": 1483419167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.544732", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28965727": {"recommendationid": "28965727", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075154155", "num_games_owned": 155, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500535422}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic!", "timestamp_created": 1483417914, "timestamp_updated": 1483417914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502488", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28954289": {"recommendationid": "28954289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134122075", "num_games_owned": 191, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 959, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482395534}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is literally perfect.

Nowadays we have co-op campaigns like Left 4 Dead to apocalpyse survival games like H1Z1. But Dead Rising (along with Resident Evil to an extent, where the focus was less on zombies and more on horror) is where it all started and it's influence is absolutely felt in every zombie game today regardless of whether or not you played it. It's intelligent game design and time based gameplay make for an extremely challenging and fun experience where gameplay decisions and skill come hand in hand. \n\nYou play Frank West, a photojournalist trying to uncover a strange ongoing mystery happening at a mall in a place called Williamette, a town somewhere in Colorado. He's covered wars you know, so he organizes a helicopter pickup 3 days after he is dropped off in which he'll enravel the mystery that is going on and learn the dark secret of what is causing the zombie outbreak and make his escape. \n\nAs far as stories go, it's as Japanese as you would expect. The lipsync quite frankly is terrible, and you can tell English was a second thought and no effort was made to try and fix this. It's definitely immersion breaking at times but the voice acting here is surprisingly pretty good. The actual mystery itself is pretty compelling and has, while not subtle at all, a pretty disturbingly true message about first world countries and human consumption. The psychopaths that you meet along the way (boss fights) are again, surprisingly intriguing. They all have a specific way of fighting meaning you have to adjust your playstyle slightly in order to combat them which can be quite tricky if you aren't prepared. What's most surprising is the in which these psychopaths are humanized, making you feel sorry for killing them. Cliff especially has a pretty sad story along with one or two others. Of course, there are genuine crazy people who do crazy things because they're crazy but I personally feel that there should have been more emotionally moving psychopaths as opposed to insane people who act in anger for no reason.\n\nAs for gameplay, like I mentioned in the beginning of the interview, time is everything. You really need to manage your time effectively if you want to be able to save all the survivors and unravel the mystery of the outbreak which for most people causes the most frustration. Personally, I think these people are misunderstanding why that is such a good mechanic, it forces you to learn the paths of the mall, where the food is, where the best weapons are, what's the best way to approach a case and so on. Dead Rising is a game MEANT to be played more than once. You will succeed, then fail, but you  will always learn from your mistakes. I think the complaints are from people who just need to, quite honestly, git gud. That being said, the things this game does wrong are quite bad.\n\nThe worst, without a doubt for me, is the AI. The AI half the time get caught on stupid pieces of terrain or stop moving after defending themselves from a zombie attack. Infact, the AI is SO BAD that it's actually easier to carry the injured survivors through a horde of zombies than an able bodied one wielded with a gun because they will not be able to run past all the zombies and rush to the saferoom without getting attacked or failing to defend themselves. This is where the game shows it's age, as well as in the shooting controls. The shooting controls are simiarly like Resident Evil 4, except funnily enough, less clunky as you can move a full 360 degrees which you can't do reliably in Resi 4 without turning your character the whole way. \n\nThat said, even with the frustrating AI, the game is still a lot of fun. The amount of weapons in the game is insane for a game made in 2006. It has more weapons than Left 4 Dead 2 for christ sake, although not all of those weapons are neccesarily 'good', but they are actual weapons that can be used.  There's just something hilariously unique about shoving a horse head mask on a zombie then using a bowling ball to 'strike' them down. All the survivors have different personalities and while they can be annoying to escort at times, it's really satisfying getting a group of survivors to the safehouse and be rewarded for it. What's great is that you can get through the game just fine ignoring them at all but the game makes you feel guilty with it's bright red 'JASON SMITH HAS DIED' in big bold red writing as well as their screams for help that you can't help but feel you have to. The game rewards you with PP (haha pp...ugh) which is basically XP that let's Frank level up and improves how fast he walks, how much damage he does and how many items he can carry. \n\nOne of the most unique things to the character of Frank West is that he's a photojournalist, which means you'll be taking pictures of the events that happen. Certain specific moments like two family members reuniting can give you a ton of PP if you manage to snap a moment of it at the right moment as well as more perverted photos like taking a picture of a zombie womans cleavage (god damn it Japan). These don't feel gimickly at all and it flows really nicely. I found myself taking pictures of things that wouldn't neccesarily give me a lot of PP but I would take them anyway because I thought the image was just super cool.\n\nWith that all being said, Dead Rising is a fun game that sometimes requires you to wrestle with the mechanics a little but is absolutely worth it's price in challenge, story and exploration. It's a game made 10 years ago that is still miles ahead of games being released today, as pathetic as that is. If you're looking for a game that challenges your timing and skill or if you're just looking to see how zombie games got started, this is definitely a game you want to pick up.", "timestamp_created": 1483127462, "timestamp_updated": 1483127490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542169", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28818411": {"recommendationid": "28818411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043998750", "num_games_owned": 499, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474591079}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this game back when it originally came out on Xbox 360.

"playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483149215}, "language": "english", "review": "Surprisingly innovative for a game from 2006, Dead Rising\u00ae is basically ''Time\u00ae Management\u00ae: The\u00ae Game\u00ae''. Or more adequately, ''Escort\u00ae Missions\u00ae: The\u00ae Game\u00ae''\n\nAn entire game consisting of escort missions rightfully gained the ire of some people that gave this a shot back in '06. The escortee's sometimes have their pathing screwed up and get stuck behind a wall; they can't navigate the hordes as easily aas you can, which means as little as 10 zombies can stop their movement; some move somewhat slow -- there's nothing more obnoxious than seeing them 6 miles away from you as you turn around to check up on them.\n\nIt doesn't help that the VERY FIRST escort mission in the game is QUITE POSSIBLY the hardest one, which means a lot of people probably rage quit this game back in the day. Add to that the fact that you have a set amount of time to get these survivors and escort them, as well as doing main storyline missions and some people probably grew exhasperated at such constraints.\n\nBut that's a misunderstanding of how the game was designed.\n\nFor one thing: the game is constantly on a timer that constantly ticks down, even during boss fights. How much real world time does the game have? \n\n6 hours. \n\nThis is a 6 hour long game. And all of your upgrades from one playthrough carry over to the next. Upgrades like improved walkspeed (CRUCIAL) to attack strength and life-meter. Additionally, upon death you can save and restart the game, or reload. \n\nIn other words, the game is made in such a way so as to allow you to get right back to where you previously where. It's meant to be replayed, wherein the game becomes much easier due to upgrades. granted, you CAN save all people in a single playthrough and the only difficult escort mission is the first one, so replays aren't necessary. But missing something  and restarting isn't as obnoxious as you might think since you can get right back to where you where in less than 3 hours.\n\nTell anyone this game is 6 hours long and they'll probably scoff, because it feels much longer and bigger than that. Every mission, including escort missions, are on a timer. You typically get a slew of them with each ''chapter'', and some come in the middle of said chapters. They're all neatly lined up on your screen with their timers displayed; it's all a matter of rushing to save people and bringing them back to the safe room whilst having time to also continue the main storyline. \n\nWith so much running about the game feels much longer than it actually is. The sense of accomplishment in seeing the survivors pile up in the safe rooms is immense. You can completely ignore survivors if you want, but there's really nothing more to the game other than rescuing survivors and doing the story mode. It's all the more exciting if you're juggling time, otherwise the story itself is really easy and you'll never miss any mission.\n\nAt it's core Dead Rising is a game meant to be replayed. If you don't want to replay the game for whatever reason: you can play for an hour or so and purposefully let the zombies kill you, then commence once more with knowledge of the malls layout and your experience poitns carrying over. The main goal isn't necessarily completing the story, as that isn't hard. It's getting all the survivors along with the previous goal-Dead Rising is a completionists game. It's short enough to make replays not feel like a chore to get back to where you were, but has a lot going on so as to surprise you when you realize you reached where you previously were in under 6 hours.\n\nA first playthrough will probably take over 8 or so hours, and thats because of reloads to better manage time. But subsequent playthroughs will most likely take under 6 hours.\n\nOverall A++. There are some flaws in how the ai for the escorts is programmed, but otherwise it's not a big deal and overall highly enjoyable.", "timestamp_created": 1482982562, "timestamp_updated": 1482982562, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534271", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28767613": {"recommendationid": "28767613", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019475315", "num_games_owned": 112, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2718, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509832026}, "language": "english", "review": "Quick review, BUY IT NOW!\n\nPro:\n-The best singleplayer-zombie game ever (Also best in the series)\n-A lot of weapons\n-Fun bosses\n-Mega buster <3\n-Fun achivements (that also unlock things)\n-Different endings & modes\n-Replayability\n\nCon:\n-Otis\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1482961664, "timestamp_updated": 1483350232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537239", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28743790": {"recommendationid": "28743790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044337926", "num_games_owned": 129, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1248, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503266614}, "language": "english", "review": "Step 1: Grab SMG\nStep 2: Shoot Convicts\nStep 3: ???\nStep 4: Profit", "timestamp_created": 1482913506, "timestamp_updated": 1482913506, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.463855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28719702": {"recommendationid": "28719702", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046979223", "num_games_owned": 2999, "num_reviews": 95, "playtime_forever": 643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507913493}, "language": "english", "review": "I absolutely love this game, and am very happy to see it steam (especially since i never really expected it).

the best games on Xbox 360 makes its way to PC, and it's just as addicting now as it was back then.

It doesnt play the same as something like GTA though, its worth pointing out so you dont go in disappointed, but whats here is in a league of its own\n\nIt's also worth noting that outside of adding multiple save features its basically the same as it was on 360. Still looks and plays great for toaster-tier PCs, and whether you're a newcomer to the series, a fan that never got to play the original, or if you want to play through it again on more powerful hardware, I highly recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1482540221, "timestamp_updated": 1482540221, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28568575": {"recommendationid": "28568575", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097861734", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 453, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485787145}, "language": "english", "review": "Otis plz stop calling me you faggot! \n", "timestamp_created": 1482525148, "timestamp_updated": 1482525148, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527285", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28518131": {"recommendationid": "28518131", "author": {"steamid": "76561198347538620", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481191868}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Entretenido.

Think Saints Row, both game series are silly in their own ways. With Dead Rising, you have the main character, Frank West who's just a normal person trying to report an apocalypse, you have a number of fun weapons and clothes to try out, you have the camera system which helps you in levelling up slightly\n\nWith the levelling system present, the game allows you to start a new game using your progress from your previous save, making the game much easier for you, especially to complete the side-missions and defeat psychopaths\n\nThe day/night cycle makes the world feel real rather than constantly having the game at night just because it's a zombie game. It also gives challenge to the player, to either stay inside the shelter and wait out night time or to risk going out at night having to deal with stronger zombies but with a potentially more rewarding experience\n\nThere is a wide variety of weapons to choose from in the game. The game allows you to change Frank's clothing, though in order to do so you'd need to explore the mall and try out the outfits that are available to be worn, in some of the stores\n\nThe combat is not terrible, just that I felt it wasn't very smooth and fluid. Trying to aim with a weapon can be difficult especially since you're not able to move when you're aiming the gun or to throw a weapon. Fighting against psychopaths, especially when you're still starting the game can be very frustrating\n\nThe Survivor AI is just terrible, you encounter survivors who say they want to live but as you try to escort them and look back, they're often standing still or running slowly as if they want to be eaten alive. You can give them a weapon for their self-defense but it's not like they'll be able to use it effectively. It's infuriating but pretty satisfying when you're actually able to escort at least two or more at once to the shelter though\n\nThe waypoint system is sort of a triangle, you're at point A, you want to reach to point C without looking at the map so you trust the waypoint system to lead you there, so you keep following the waypoint until you realise it made you take a detour through point B even though the risk of going straight to point C or taking the detour is more or less the same, just that you wasted an amount of time because of the waypoint system. Seriously, you're better off navigating on your own using the map. It's as if it was designed to waste the player's time as much as possible. Once you've played enough of the game you'll probably remember all the locations of the mall anyway.\n\nDead Rising has a time limit system for the missions, in which you only have a limited amount of time to complete missions. You're able to ignore the missions but with consequences, you might lose survivors when skipping side missions and you won't be able to continue playing the main mission if you skip them. However, you're still able to continue on playing freeroam after skipping and failing the main mission\n\nDead Rising can be quite challenging, especially with the lack of difficulty choices, save locations and the stupid survivor AI, however it is a great start to a fantastic zombie series!\n\n[h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1481237613, "timestamp_updated": 1481237619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.448265", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28260913": {"recommendationid": "28260913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098179366", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1584, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480353290}, "language": "spanish", "review": "One of the greastest game i've ever played in my life, this was one of the reasons why i bough a xbox 360 and a wii, just to try its two versions, so sad this saga died this year and this month.\n\nRip frank west\nRip dead rising\n\n2006 - 2016", "timestamp_created": 1481235222, "timestamp_updated": 1481235222, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.449591", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28237963": {"recommendationid": "28237963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003947790", "num_games_owned": 825, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 187, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481714349}, "language": "english", "review": "Other reviewers: controls are shit, time limit is annoying, AI is horrible and the port is bad.\nMe: I've covered wars, you know.\n\nP.S.: Seriously, AI was this horrible in the original, so you can stop complaining about this.

I've never played the original Dead Rising on the Xbox 360 so this Dead Rising remaster on the PC will be my first time playing it.\n\n[b]Good[/b]:\n\ud83d\udc4d [b][i]Silliness[/i][/b]:\nThink Saints Row, both game series are silly in their own ways. With Dead Rising, you have the main character, Frank West who's just a normal person trying to report an apocalypse, you have a number of fun weapons and clothes to try out, you have the camera system which helps you in levelling up slightly. Of course, like Saints Row, the game can be serious at times.\n\ud83d\udc4d [b][i]Replay Value[/i][/b]:\nWith the levelling system present, the game allows you to start a new game using your progress from your previous save, making the game much easier for you, especially to complete the side-missions and defeat psychopaths you didn't manage to do in your first playthrough. You can play \"freeroam\" to level up Frank and start a new game with that progress when you feel ready to do the missions. You can also unlock the sandbox mode '\u221e Mode'.\n\ud83d\udc4d [b][i]Day/Night Cycle[/i][/b]:\nThe day/night cycle makes the world feel real rather than constantly having the game at night just because it's a zombie game. It also gives challenge to the player, to either stay inside the shelter and wait out night time or to risk going out at night having to deal with stronger zombies but with a potentially more rewarding experience.\n\ud83d\udc4d [b][i]Weapon Variety[/i][/b]:\nThere is a wide variety of weapons to choose from in the game. I lost count after picking up twenty-five different ones. My favourite weapons would probably be the Sickle and Excavator, no regrets going into that hardware store out of curiosity.\n\ud83d\udc4d [b][i]Character Customisation[/i][/b]:\nThe game allows you to change Frank's clothing, though in order to do so you'd need to explore the mall and try out the outfits that are available to be worn, in some of the stores.\n\n[b]Bad[/b]:\n\ud83d\udc4e [b][i]Combat[/i][/b]:\nIt's not terrible, just that I felt it wasn't very smooth and fluid. Trying to aim with a weapon can be difficult especially since you're not able to move when you're aiming the gun or to throw a weapon. Fighting against psychopaths, especially when you're still starting the game can be very frustrating. Maybe it's not the bad combat, maybe I'm just bad at the game, who knows.\n\ud83d\udc4e [b][i]Survivor AI[/i][/b]:\nTerrible, you encounter survivors who say they want to live but as you try to escort them and look back, they're often standing still or running slowly as if they want to be eaten alive. You can give them a weapon for their self-defense but it's not like they'll be able to use it effectively. It's infuriating but pretty satisfying when you're actually able to escort at least two or more at once to the shelter though. Kindell was the best survivor I've encountered in the game though.\n\ud83d\udc4e [b][i]Waypoint System[/i][/b]:\nImagine a triangle, you're at point A, you want to reach to point C without looking at the map so you trust the waypoint system to lead you there, so you keep following the waypoint until you realise it made you take a detour through point B even though the risk of going straight to point C or taking the detour is more or less the same, just that you wasted an amount of time because of the waypoint system. Seriously, you're better off navigating on your own using the map. It's as if it was designed to waste the player's time as much as possible. Once you've played enough of the game you'll probably remember all the locations of the mall anyway.\n\ud83d\udc4e [b][i]Audio Panning[/i][/b]:\nThere were numerous times when a survivor would be crying right in front of me and I'd only hear them from the right side of my headphones as if they were to the right of my character. I don't know if it's just me or it really is the game.\n\n[b]Notes[/b]:\n\ud83d\udc4c [b][i]Time limit[/i][/b]:\nDead Rising has a time limit system for the missions, in which you only have a limited amount of time to complete missions. You're able to ignore the missions but with consequences, you might lose survivors when skipping side missions and you won't be able to continue playing the main mission if you skip them. However, you're still able to continue on playing freeroam after skipping and failing the main mission. Initially, I wasn't the biggest fan of this when I first tried out the Dead Rising series but then as I played more, my opinion changed in favour of it, especially since it's one of the features that makes Dead Rising unique compared to other open-world sandbox zombie games.\n\ud83d\udc4c [b][i]Challenge[/i][/b]:\nThe game can be quite challenging, especially with the lack of difficulty choices, save locations and the stupid survivor AI. \n\ud83d\udc4c The chances of having a perfect playthrough, with all side-missions completed, psychopaths killed and survivors saved, on the first try is very slim. The game was designed with replayability in mind, with each playthrough you do, everything becomes easier because of the progress system works. With this in mind, I would not recommend this game for those who are looking to have a perfect playthrough on their first try, you will fail and you will be retrying numerous times.\n\ud83d\udc4c [b][i]Miscellaneous[/i][/b]:\n\t1. The convicts on the humvee in Leisure Park can be annoying especially after you've already beaten them the first time. (The music too.)\n\t2. You can sometimes get stuck in the 'jumping animation' when you try to jump on some cramped locations.\n\t3.

I'm going to list the pros and cons of the PC version to help clarify to those that just keep disliking this review. This is not a hate review this is a review of what I have physically seen playing this game. These issues should have never made its way to the remastered version. \n\n\nPros\n------\n(+) Better textures and visuals (Increased draw distance) \n\n(+) 60 FPS (Stable)\n\n(+) 4K support (Xbox 360 maxed at 1080i)\n\n(+) Best Dead Rising game in the series \n\n(+) Fun gameplay with great cut scenes\n\n\nCons \n-------\n(-) The prisoners in Leisure Park keep respawing even after you kill all three. This goes on numerous times and makes it nearly impossible to escourt surviors to the security room. I know this was in the Xbox 360 version I just thought it was important to add. This issue should have been fixed but apparently it wasn't since it's in the PC version.\n\n(-) Terrible survivor ai plagues this game like the Xbox 360 version but worse. The survivors never seem to follow you even when calling them. They always seem to walk right into a horde of zombies and die within a few seconds. Try giving them a weapon? Your results will be even worse because now they'll just target any zombie whether close or far and waste more precious time. \n\n(-) Zombie capacity increase. This was something I noticed right away. It appears the amount of zombies have been doubled or even tripled in certain areas making escourting survivors even more challenging. Stocking up on quickstep barely helps avoiding confrontations because it doesn't last long enough. I understand this is a zombie game and all but this was not how the Xbox 360 version was. The Xbox 360 version couldn't possibly have these amount of zombies due to hardware limitations but on PC the amounts are just ridiculous. Even veteran players like myself struggle to complete missions with enough time. It's only logical that if the amount of zombies were increased so should the intelligence of the survivors. \n\n(-) No indicator to determine the quality of your weapons. This was never in the Xbox 360 version but thought it should have been included in the remastered version. When you attack zombies your weapons gradually begin to get weaker eventually breaking. There should have been a percentage bar under each weapon showing how much is left. This would enable the player to have more strategy in fights. \n\n(-) Long dialogue with survivors. In order to have survivors team up you must first interact with them. The amount of dialogue there is before the survivor joins is way too long. There should have been an ability to speed past the dialogue to avoid sneaky zombies from attacking you from behind or even the survivor. \n\n\n\nConclusion \n----------------\nI personally love Dead Rising. I still believe this game is and will always be the best but this applies to the Xbox 360 version not PC. The gradual changes that have been applied have modified this game making it something different then what it once was. If you truly want the best experience play the Xbox 360 version.", "timestamp_created": 1480704193, "timestamp_updated": 1485312029, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.378547", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28129487": {"recommendationid": "28129487", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025113826", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 4312, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513820821}, "language": "english", "review": "In 2006, Dead Rising was a technical achievement and the sole reason I bought an Xbox 360. It felt like something familiar, but still like something I hadn't played yet. This game has a silly tone to start, but quickly shifts into horror as soon as the malls automated power is cut after close. The atmosphere alone is one to be experienced first hand. By yesteryear's standard, the graphics were goofy, sure, but some of the best I had seen a video game offer on a console. Couldn't read the text too well, but ooh what's that sound? It sounds so good! Hearing glass shattering, the difference in running machines, each slice, dice and every single drop of blood hitting the floor, I can honestly say that this is easily one of the best sounding video games I've ever played. I'm still basking in the aural pool of it's warm waves. \n\n\tBut of course the most significant feature was rendering six hundred plus characters on screen at one time without massive dips in frame rate or performance. It was amazing! With Dead Rising, Capcom created a survival horror comedy beat-em up that had introduced RPG elements, photography, time, inventory, resource and human management. It's like, fuck, I can do whatever I want and there's so much to do! Sure, the sequels have opened up the playground, added more in-depth combat systems and packed it all to the brim with more zombies, but the original did it best. It's the simplicity of the gameplay and a variety of activities that helps Dead Rising age so finely, like a nice pack of smokes. \n\n\tNow, old fans and new comers can enjoy this game without having to get an Xbox 360, A decision I was facing a few months before I discovered it's release on Steam. And it runs like my frozen dinner into the toilet. Smooth. Now, if only we can get Saints Row, Conker Live and Reloaded with Halo 2, I might just make myself some bathtub Gamer Fuel. Code Red y'all! Red allert! You gotta pick this up if you're on the fence. It's well worth the twenty bucks. It'll make you laugh, then piss you off, but don't take it too seriously. This game sure as fuck doesn't.

This review is for the badge. Play this game, its really good and once you get past trying to make sense of all the ridiculous things going on and learn the mechanics it's surprising how enjoyable it is.

It was originally developed by Capcom until Blue Castle Games took over developing the franchise.\n\nGraphics- Back in 2006 the graphics for this game were amazing but they have not aged well at all. I personally do not mind graphics as much as I know other people do so this is not a major setback\n\nStory- The story is one of the strong points of this game. It is very good and has lots of amazing plot twists that you will not see coming but it does not do too much. It finds a balence between plot twists and realistic moments to create a very immersive experience.\n\ncombat- the combat is very fun but can be a bit glitchy with zombies. the combat is very varied due to the plethora of weapons at your disposale. the psychopath fights are arguable what made dead rising famous and this game really shows why! The fights are so much fun and each boss has their own special weakness you need to single out in order to secure the victory.\n\nCharacters-the characters are very well made. Capcom makes you care about what happens to the characters. I think by far the best characters are the psychopaths because they are so unique and have such great character devolopment even though you only meet them for a brief time.\n\nPsychopaths- the psychopaths are great in this game with great storys behind why they are doing what they are doing. In my opinion these are the best psychopaths in the dead rising franchise. From cult leaders to clowns, this game truly has everything you could want from boss fights.\n\nSurvivors- The survivors are very good character wise. You can see why they are doing what they are or why they were at the mall but the guide system is a bit buggy and glitchy and the survivors are very slow but after 10 years I personally have grown acustom to it and just see it as another thing to make the game difficult. So Capcom, bring it on!\n\nSoundtrack- the soundtrack is amazing in this game and has a huge variety for different moments. I think the best music stems from the psycho fights. the pyschos all have amazing songs that suit them perfectly. you really can tell a lot of time and effort went into the soudtrack and it shows!\n\ndifficulty- the game is just as difficult as it was ten years ago and for me personally I love that! It should not change. The game is hard but not too hard. it is not dark souls it is just hard by nature. I do like to be op and kill everyone but sometimes a bit of difficulty is a great thing.\n\nOverall, this game has stood the test of time and is still one of the best games on steam and if you have not already I highly reccomend you snatch it up in the autumn or christmas sales! I would give this classic a 8.9/10. It could be better with certain bugs and glitches that can annoy the player but mostly it hits the nail on the hammer.", "timestamp_created": 1480061715, "timestamp_updated": 1480110878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27346058": {"recommendationid": "27346058", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142073945", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 3909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481946828}, "language": "english", "review": "Going for the Genocide achievement is going to be the longest 3 hours of your life, unless you decide to go for the 5 day and 7 day survivors, those will be the longest 14 hours of your life, you will cry, you will shed blood, but in the end you will reing as the ultimate survivor and run around like megaman", "timestamp_created": 1480030677, "timestamp_updated": 1480030677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27342875": {"recommendationid": "27342875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032569678", "num_games_owned": 622, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1420, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482067863}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing port of one of the the best 360 gems from back in the day.\nStill holds up really well for being a 2006 title.

Over time, my Xbox died out and I wasn't able to play the game anymore as getting any game to run on that Xbox was just a nightmare to run, and eventually I moved over to Playstation and PC, and it was a long while since I had played it.\n\nThen I see that Dead Rising was being remastered for the PC and now it's here. It's still just as amazing as I remembered it and it was great to begin playing it again from the start and rexperiencing everything that I did almost 10 years ago. Now, it's not a perfect game. There's plenty of little issues with the game (the AI companions, the shooting mechanics, etc), but the remaster kept all of those features just like how they were in the old games, which is one of the nice things of a remaster; giving the game a fresh look but keeping the exact same feel.\n\nThe port runs very well for me with little to no issues and I've had a blast playing it. If you've never been able to play it before, I highly recommend picking it up when you can, becuase it is a gem of a game to play through and is the best one in the series in my opinion; and always will hold a special place in my heart for me.", "timestamp_created": 1479956302, "timestamp_updated": 1479956302, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26997909": {"recommendationid": "26997909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076115806", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505408065}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0439 Dead Rising", "timestamp_created": 1479955989, "timestamp_updated": 1479955989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.470907", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26981101": {"recommendationid": "26981101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023208016", "num_games_owned": 362, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 87, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480827172}, "language": "english", "review": "Frigggin loved this game on the 360 so glad it came to PC years later as an awesome port!

I couldn't recommend this game any more than I already do, perhaps it's the nostalgia talking, but Dead Rising blew my mind back when I first saw gameplay of it and still holds up as an incredibly fun zombie game. Dead Rising has a pretty good storyline with it's fair share of intentionally cheesy moments, with over-the-top gameplay that was just right.\n\nThe game has a lot of extra features, weapons and costumes to keep you going, giving plenty of incentive to keep going - from defeating a number of psychopaths, saving an amount of survivors to killing a towns population worth of undead. You're left with an entire mall of activities to get up to, with plenty of side quests and side bosses to fight whilst waiting for the next scoop. \n\nThe gameplay is challenging and can be very unforgiving for a new player, but once you get the hang of things you'll be taking down zombies by the hundreds. My only complaint comes with the infuriating AI of survivors, escorting them can be hell at times, but if you power through it you should be okay. \n\nIn conclusion, it's one of my favourite titles and I'd definitely recommend picking it up, it's optimised well and is a ton of fun.", "timestamp_created": 1478232781, "timestamp_updated": 1478232781, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.512922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26401963": {"recommendationid": "26401963", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030853973", "num_games_owned": 572, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 4197, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481013537}, "language": "english", "review": "now i understand why people say its the best out of the 3.\nin this one the zeds are actualy a danger ,not a great danger but still enough the keep you on guard.\nin the 2nd game they barely catch u even if ur surrounded. its ridiculous that u can run through the whole game evadeing all zeds while there more than in the 1st game. but not in this one... here they are at least a little challenge.\nalso the dawn of the dead setting realy nails it.", "timestamp_created": 1478191526, "timestamp_updated": 1478191526, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532094", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26397335": {"recommendationid": "26397335", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963163105", "num_games_owned": 896, "num_reviews": 49, "playtime_forever": 232, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1478165528}, "language": "english", "review": "This game was probably good 10 years ago but it's not anymore.\n\nThe combat is basic and the AI is infuriating.

I love the humor, the whimsy, the silliness but also the story, the gameplay, and while it's much easier on PC with the multiple save slots, I even enjoyed the difficulty of the 360 version back in 2006. It was unapologetically and unforgetably unique. And I believe it's safe to say that it still is. \n\nBy todays standard, zombie games are a dime a dozen. Literally during some Steam Sales. But Dead Rising still stands out. It offers a huge playground full of enemies, a simply insane number of items and systems you can use to fight those enemies, and an entertaining story to tie it all together. \n\nFreelance Photojournalist Frank West is on a mission to find a story he can document and report on. His leads send him to Willamette Colorado to uncover why there is a freeze on information coming out after reports of civil unrest. Upon his arrival, he finds that this is no riot, but an outbreak of zombies unlike anything the world has known... or so he believes. As the story progresses you'll learn the major players, where the zombie virus originates, and how it found its way to this small Colorado town. And you'll have to do so while battling with a unique set of villains, labeled \"Psychopaths' in the game, who will work to thwart your attempts to uncover THE FACTS at all costs. \n\nIf you were a fan of the 360 version, this new PC release is better than ever. It fixes many of the major complaints from the 2006 release. Namely the load times are now tolerable where once they were unbearable and you also now have 5 save slots rather than the original 1. The game looks great considering it's age and it plays as well as ever. Tight controls and a system for upgrading unlike any you've played before. You may start out as a lowly photographer with a gut and a bulbous nose, but by the time you reach level 50 Frank has essentially become a zombie killing machine with ninja reflexes and speed to match. Fight zombies and Psychopaths with anything you can pick up, and you can pick up almost everything, or use your bare hands as your skills moves fill out over the course of leveling up. \n\nFor those who never played Dead Rising back when it was a new game, you should consider picking this game up and get ready for a treat! Admittedly though, as I said in the opening of this review, I am a full blown fan. I'd never pretend that this is a perfect game because it does have it's flaws, but they are minor and in this new PC release many of the old complaints have been fixed completely. \n\nConsider giving this one a try!

While I never owned an Xbox 360, I did watch a 100% let's play of it (Shouts out to OatmealRaisin). So my perspective with the game is different than someone going into it blind.\n\nSince I had seen the Let's play years ago, while I didn't fully remember all the details I knew a general plan of what to do. So while this was my first time playing the game for real, I was able to get the true ending in my first playthrough. \n\nNow if you've never played Dead Rising before, or don't even know what you do in the game it's simple: \nYou\u2019re in a mall with zombies and you either do missions or mess around killing zombies. But why is there the reputation of the game being confusing or overly difficult to beat? Well it has to do with the time mechanic.\n\nThere is an in-game timer, counting down for the end of the game. Missions as well have a time limit to them and appear at specific times. Sometimes there\u2019s even hidden missions at certain times you'll most likely miss too. This whole timing mechanic adds stress and tension onto the player to get their shit done quick. For people who want a pleasant sandbox stroll through a mall this is the turn off for the game, but the timer is what makes the game special from any other zombie game. Sure the zombie horde isn't too much of a threat to you, but if you want to save all survivors especially during some clutch situations than may lady luck be on your side. Cus the timer will show you that there are no heroes in a zombie apocalypse, unless they are in megaman armor.\n\nBut the survivor AI can be annoying. They will go to waypoints pretty well, and they can handle themselves when they have a good weapon, but they can freak out to a frustrating degree if they are following you.\n\nThe tone of the game is very Japanese. Meaning while there's really weird dumb humor and dialogue, everything is treated seriously. Which in turn makes it pretty funny. I think it's a fine enough middle ground, allowing the player to say be in their underwear during cutscenes if they really want to. \n\nThe size of the mall isn't actually that big. It may feel big at the start when you are at LVL1 meaning your walk speed is slow (yes, there is no sprint in the game unfortunately, but there are some alternatives) and you have no shortcuts, but once you learn the layout it's pretty easy to get around. Since it was the first console game to be a sandbox game with like 50 NPCs on screen at once, some sacrifices had to be made. While there are a couple unique landmark shops, in general the stores are tiny and have a couple items lying around. It makes exploring the landscape alone not that exciting cus it can feel samey, but technically they do want you to find hidden items and missions instead.\n\nDead Rising, while old console gen-wise, gives a zombie survival experience you can't really get anywhere else. \n\nPC PORT REPORT: Runs fine. It looks like a 360 game, and that is what you\u2019re getting. An \"issue\" you may face is when you hit stuff with a blunt weapon there is \"hitlag\". AKA The game will appear to freeze for a moment, looking like the game is stuttering when on contact. This is an intentional feature of the game and was in the original as well. I'm hoping for a patch that'll give an option to turn it off, but honestly it's probably the biggest downside to the game.\n\nGENERAL TIPS AND ADVICE:\n*USE THE WAYPOINTS FOR SURVIVORS! Put a waypoint at whatever door your heading to and they'll actually be able to navigate through the zombies.\n*Survivors have infinite ammo so, especially if you're trying to move a big crew, give them some guns. \n*Make sure to do the Out of Control scoop. The rewards are invaluable. \n*Colombian Roastmasters has infinite orange juice, stock up!\n*Servbot mask = epic cutscenes.\n", "timestamp_created": 1477715160, "timestamp_updated": 1477715160, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497214", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26276511": {"recommendationid": "26276511", "author": {"steamid": "76561198267654567", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 941, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510859539}, "language": "italian", "review": "Dead Rising, semplicemente uno dei migliori videogiochi mai creati, nel lontano 2006, grafica innovativa. tanti nemici a schermo, storia originale e ben narrata e una colonna sonora da far invidia....\nNel 2016 il \"Remake\" segue alla perfezione l'originale, lasciando tutto come fu un tempo ma allo stesso tempo aggiungendo una grafica fantastica....\nConsigliato agli amanti dei survival....VOTO 10 SU 10.", "timestamp_created": 1477690709, "timestamp_updated": 1477690709, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26271411": {"recommendationid": "26271411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025104723", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512751986}, "language": "english", "review": "A REVIEW ABOUT THE PC PORT?!?!?!?!1/1!?!?!?!?!?ONEQUESTIONMARK?VVVVVVVVVVVVV\n\n7/5 day survivor MAKE SURE TO SAVE OR IT WONT\nTIIIIIIIIIIPS: 9 health blocks = 15 minutes = 3 hours in game\nEAT AS SOON AS YOU GET TO 3 or 1 BLOCKS DONT WAIT ITS NOT WORTH IT\n8 full health items = 1 day game time IF YOU DONT MOVE\nDONT TOUCH MALL FOOD.

north white truck and i hit a shopping cart and did a bunny hop then it force closed no save was doing the 53.5k SAVE EVERY 5K\n\n\nOVERALL: 8/10 IF YOU LOVE IT WORTH A BUY\n\ni ramble\nplease forgive me this will be a full review i will update as i play\n\nFirst off SAVING:you need to complete the first 4 cases with brad in the food court and seeing the old man then when you save it will create a continue button for you \nit saved my level and the points i earned but after a survivor died and i restarted before completing the 4 main quests it had no continue button\nonly new game BUT SAVING AFTER THE FIRST 4 CASES IS CONFIRMED\nidk about doing the 53.5k ill play more AND GET BACK 2U\n\nLOAD TIMES: very fast\n\nTHE DOWNLOAD IS 4.8 GIGS\nITS ADORABLE\nthat being said its not an HD version or retextured, THERE IS ANTI ALIASING AND A WHOLE PAGE OF GRAPHICS OPTIONS JUST FOR PC \nbut im sure they would say HD if it was but then again you should support this i mean its dead rising and its capcom theyll come limping back with something if this sells and they are the ones who created super ghouls and ghosts a very long time ago but hey i dont judge\n\nGRAPHICS:10/10 NOT HD MOD THO OK? very nice to look at\nit looks alot more smooth than i remember and the hordes seem bigger in the tunnels and the center courtyard IDK IF ITS JUST ME THO\ni had a small hdtv when i played back in the day so its not that \nfor those of you who know the blurry text\n\nCONTROLS: feels like a direct xbox 360 port on keyboard\nmy favorite thing in dead rising is being bored and trying to spin standing in one place for as long of a burst as i can and on keyboard it seems impossible but just from how it handles it feels like a direct port could probably spin for days with a controller unsure if this has controller support tho\nJUMP/SLIPPING zombies still works the keyboard feels kind of chunky tho you really need to line up your jumps correctly BUT AS I PLAY the controls become more natural maybe 5.5/10 KEYBOARD FEELING but NOT BROKEN VERY PLAYABLE\n\nhavent found a key i couldnt bind yet\nthe default scheme is werird but everything can be personalized 9.1/10 ILL COME BACK TO THIS\n\ni cant find how to change the FOV\ndidnt even look up if it can be changed or not\n\nthe sound is okay? i watched a cinemassacre live stream on launch day and the audio was choppy in some places but i havent

meaning that every specific time a story elements happens if your not at the designated area at the specific time you ruin the entire story and cant get the good ending anymore.\nBeing that Dead Rising is a semi-open world game, some people could really dislike this, I thought it was pretty interesting but also restricts you from exploring the world.\nHaving said that, it's a really enjoyable game with smooth controls.", "timestamp_created": 1477233914, "timestamp_updated": 1477233914, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0,

I will talk about the pros and cons of the game and finish with my conclusion.\n\nPro:\n     Its a sandbox game in the mall. I really like that idea because it reminds me of the old dawn of the dead movie, a classic. Actually funny thing is the developers had to mention that the game was not ripping off or copying the movie....something like that.\n\n      Anything can be a weapon. A plant is a weapon, boxes, advertisement stands, frying pans, Litterally anything can be used as a weapon to fend off the zombies. Alot can be classified as useless but nothings funnier than using a toy laser sword to fight zombies.\n\n       Great story. I enjoyed how the story played out and the characters dialog. It was nice and classic.\n\n       Rpg elements. So the more you do in the game the stronger you get. This opens up more replayability. You get exp or what this game calls perstige points (PP) from doing tasks like killing zombies, saving survivors, and killing bosses.\n\n       The music is nice. Dont know what i can say about it though.\n       \nCon:\n       Clunky controls. Even using a controller the game feels clunky. Aiming is with the right stick, aim with LT. Things just felt awkward. Not to mention the special moves frank can use. Yes you will see press A and X at the same time quite often. Thats an issue because A is to jump and X is to attack. Most of the time when i try to do the sumersalt kick i end up doing a jump kick. Its hard to get fully into the game when i have to fight the controls to do more stronger hand to hand attacks or even aiming.\n\n        AI are really dumb. The survivors tend to fight all the zombies or get stun locked so easily. Its frustrating for reasons i will explain in my conclusion.\n\n       AI navigation is poor. Alot of time when trying to move 3 or more survivors there navigations get messed up....really bad. I had to sit there and watch 3 survivors try and jump over the counter in the gun shop....they couldnt even do that. I had to see 5 survivors trying to jump onto the concrete slab near the air vent. It took 20mins for one to get on. Sometimes the survivors just stand there for some odd reason even though i am shouting at them to move. They only get out if I do damage to them. Sometimes that doesnt even fix the issue which means i have to kill them.\n\n       Survivor death cutscene. Ok it was cool the first time but it gets annoying when they die from being just bad. It breaks the flow of the game and really kills my mood to continue. Its like the game is rubbing salt in the wound that i messed up and should of protected the survivor better. I would if they could protect themselves when they have a weapon like a shotgun. With a shotgun the AI should never be stun locked.\n\n        Respawning psychopaths. Not all are bad but the prisoners are the worst. They spawn back and normally thats when i am trying to move a survivor to the safehouse. Its annoying having to deal with them.\n\n       Player stun lock. Yes there are points that you can get stun locked super easily. I got stun locked when in the maintence tunnel doing the bomb mission. Carlito was running me over constantly that i couldnt do anything. Thats fair.\n\n        Bad achievements. Why is there an achievement to save 50 survivors that is very up tight for a game with poor maintence like this. You have to be pretty perfect to get the achievement and that is no fun.\n\n        Zombie spawns are bad. The zombies spawn when you walk roughly like 15 ft from the end of the spawn zone. Got to love the moments where you accidentally spawn a horde of zombies on a survivor just because you were too far.\n\n        Zombie ammounts during night time parts are just tedius. Not only do you have agressive zombies but a tone to deal with. Normally you get missions that net you a large number of survivors to save during these parts. Always fun to slowly kill your way through a ton of zombies with clunky controls.\n\nConclusion:\n         Dead rising isnt a bad game but here being some number of years after its original release. It is sad how clunky it is. You play something like DR2 or DR3 and they are more mechanically sound with the combat. What makes me sad is that i played DR1 on the WII and people swear up and down the streets that the WII port was the worst. Sadly they are wrong, in the WII version the AI was competent, the zombies didnt respawn in mass because i ran out of their spawn zone by 15 ft. I actually dont remember if they respawn when in that section of the map after killing them all. The controls for the WII version was simply amazing, i didnt struggle to do the special moves at all. In turn can I say I enjoyed the game....NO but thankful for the chance to play the original version. Massively dissapointed how poor the game is when they could of fixed the issues, its been over 10 years I think so I wouldnt believe it would be too much to ask to make the HD remaster of the game play better than slap on an HD coat of paint and call it a day. Can i reccomend this game....NO rather buy DR3 i loved that game and played DR off the record on PS3 and enjoyed it. Dont know if i will do off the record on steam since no controller support. If you want to do DR1 wait for a sale or play the WII version. It is better and i find more enjoyment for that version.", "timestamp_created": 1477209327, "timestamp_updated": 1477209327, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.386331", "comment_count": "2", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26171964": {"recommendationid": "26171964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040099643", "num_games_owned": 147, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1651, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1508524813}, "language": "english", "review": "Has everything that the Xbox 360 version has.

I first played this game on the xbox 360 7-8 years ago and I absolutely loved it... but I was always too afraid to do anything in the game for some odd reason so I never got past backup for brad. The zombies were fun to kill, the environment was fun to explore and the psychopaths scared the crap out of me. I played this game for hours upon hours just staying in the first part of the mall killing zombies and even doing just that; this game was entertaining and very fun to play\n\nNow fast forward to present time. When I heard this game was being ported to PC I was friggin HYPED. I didn't preorder it but I did buy it a day or two later after it's release. I must admit, I was a bit skeptical of a port for a game this old with it also being an exclusive for the 360. But boy, I have never felt happier to be wrong. This game does NOT feel like a port from the 360, it feels like something that was meant for PC all along. The game handles great, the graphics still hold up and I haven't crashed a single time. Unlike the young and afraid pony that used to play this game, I was able to beat the game and enjoy it and BOY did I miss out. The story was wonderful, the character development was perfect and the psychopaths... still scared the crap out of me. This game has a hair pulling amount of challenge to it and that's another reason I love it; this game does NOT hold your hand much, unlike a lot of modern games, so if you're not up for a fun challenge and don't want to be pulling out your own hair at times, then you should stay away from this game and if you do play it, remember to save frequently! Because getting your face nommed off or getting wrecked by a psychopath and then having to go back because you forgot to save is never fun. (trust me) \n\nNow while this port is excellently delivered the cons from the original version still stick out like: The A.I that feels the necessity to run up to zombies that aren't even posing much of a threat and fight them, thus getting crowded by like sixty of them, resulting in you having to waste time and resource to help them.\n\nAnd the BANE of my playthrough, which is still about the A.I: The friggin hand holding. Yeah, that may sound stupid to anyone who hasn't played this game before, but once you try guiding one of the survivors back to safety and you have to hold their hand, you'll understand soon enough. I don't know how many times I had to scream at my monitor because they suddenly just let go of my hand and then got crowded by zombies. It's an annoying aspect that you can get around if you don't have a heart for fellow survivors! But you can't avoid it forever.\n\nAll in all this game is and will always be magnificent and at the top of my favorite games list. I completely recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it before and to the people who have played it on the 360 but may be a bit skeptical to buy it. This is definitely worth the price, so get it, have fun and remember to drink your mixed juice!\n\nThis game is FAN-TASTIC!", "timestamp_created": 1476221908, "timestamp_updated": 1476305111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676958", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25979549": {"recommendationid": "25979549", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083889544", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2143, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482582549}, "language": "italian", "review": "Signori e signore questo credo che sia se non il miglior videogico di zombie ma uno dei migliori, la storia \u00e8 curata e molto coinvolgente nonostante che dobbiamo ricordare che questo capitolo ( infatti \u00e8 il primo della bellissima serie Dead Rising) \u00e8 uscito nel 2008 , quindi la grafica come giusto che sia lascia un p\u00f2 desiderare, nonostante tutto lo considero ricco di contenuti.\n\nVoto : 9,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1476178360, "timestamp_updated": 1476178360, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25978802": {"recommendationid": "25978802", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984128670", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5133, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497128667}, "language": "finnish", "review": "Dead Rising 2 is garbage", "timestamp_created": 1476172505, "timestamp_updated": 1476172505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25974657": {"recommendationid": "25974657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160331742", "num_games_owned": 339, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479602516}, "language": "english", "review": "This is so stupid and over-the-top, me and my brother are having a blast.

La pel\u00edcula original es una obra maestra con una gran cr\u00edtica al consumismo (zombies en un centro comercial, guiados por un impulso, un recuerdo de su anterior vida) y este juego es un homenaje brutal a esto y mucho m\u00e1s. Si nunca habeis visto esta pel\u00edcula, debeis, las similitudes son muy claras y se agradecen ya que todo el juego es un homenaje a la misma con su toque personal (Por cierto, debe ser una de las \u00fanicas pelis de terror donde el negro se salva de verdad, sin pegas).\n\nPensemos en la situaci\u00f3n, apostados en un centro comercial... Una manada de zombies se aglutina en las puertas; Debido a alguna especie de impulso o antiguo recuerdo/instinto, estos no muertos a\u00fan recuerdan el centro comercial de su peque\u00f1a localidad como algo importante en sus vidas, un lugar donde pasaban mucho tiempo y que estaba lleno de personas. Por desgracia los \u00faltimos supervivientes de la matanza en el pueblo de Willamette (Ahora totalmente acordonado por la guardia nacional y el ejercito) pensaron lo mismo y se han atrincherado en el mismo. Frank West es un reportero de primera l\u00ednea y cree que su contacto puede haberle dado la exclusiva de su vida, decide as\u00ed ir a la peque\u00f1a ciudad para cubrir un supuesto \"disturbio\" generalizado; El lado bueno es que Frank va a conseguir la exclusiva de su vida... el malo es que el no pensaba que estar\u00eda todo lleno de \"zombies\"... Frank tiene 3 d\u00edas para descubrir como se inici\u00f3 la infecci\u00f3n y cubrir la noticia, hasta que le recoja el helicoptero el \u00faltimo d\u00eda. Por el camino, salvar\u00e1s supervivientes, descubrir\u00e1s la verdad, segar\u00e1s zombies con un cortac\u00e9sped y razonar\u00e1s con payasos psic\u00f3patas. Realmente este juego, incluso tratando sobre zombies hacia cosas de una forma muy distinta a los dem\u00e1s pudiendo utilizar multitud de cosas como arma y teniendo muchos retos que afrontar dentro del mismo ( Vigila el tiempo !); Adem\u00e1s el juego cuenta con multitud de finales y es bastante rejugable.\n\nEn 2006 no hab\u00eda nada como Dead Rising y a\u00fan en 2016 sigue siendo un juego que se siente bastante innovador en un g\u00e9nero muy saturado, recuerdo ver la car\u00e1tula del mismo a\u00f1o de su lanzamiento y flipar en colores con la cantidad de zombies; El juego sigue luciendo muy decente en 1080 y a 60 fps y desprende una atmosfera cuidada por cada uno de sus lados, desde la m\u00fasica relajante en las tiendas mientras los zombies andan por el centro comercial, hasta el TEMAZO del combate con los presos.

jugabilidad, en donde el jugador tenia un acceso al entorno mucho mejor, en donde cualquier objeto llegaba a ser un item utilizable.\n\nPresentandonos ademas al fan-tastico Frank West!

I've played all 3 and this is probably my favorite of the three. That said this game takes some serious dedication to complete. You are the original protagonist Frank West and you get choppered into Willamette Colorado where a zombie outbreak has just taken place. Some things right off the bat, there are no combo weapons in this game like the others so if you played 2 and 3 before this, then you might be a little disappointed at first. Other than that, almost all the items in the game you will recognize and you can still craft beverages and you must rely more heavily on the hand to hand combat system in certain boss battles. \n\nSome key points: \n1. Don't worry about completing all the cases on your first playthrough, feel free to explore and familiarize yourself with the ins and outs of the game. \n2. Go to the maintenance tunnels early through Leisure Park \n3. Do take out the convicts at least once so you can get the enjoyment of the heavy machine gun. This is best done from afar with the sniper rifle. \n4. Make sure you take lots of pictures and change batteries often as this will help with prestige points, and get the photography book in paradise plaza bookstore because it will help with taking the most valuable pictures\n5. Once you level up your inventory space, you'll be able to carry more books especially the health ones, criminal biography, and skateboarding\n6. Get the mini chainsaw no matter what from the Adam the clown battle\n7. Take a picture of the air ducts at the security room because you'll need that later to give to the survivors who take over the hunting shack in the north plaza. \n8. To get the Mega Blaster, grab a car in the maintenance tunnels and spend some time mowing down zombies. \n9. Be careful where you leave your survivors. \n10. Go to Rippers Blades and get katanas and broadswords until you can get the more powerful melee weapons. \n11. Keep some sort of health on you at all times, this is vital once you unlock infinity mode. \n\nOverall great game and it took way too long to get to Steam. I'm still working on 100% but will update this review later.", "timestamp_created": 1475753219, "timestamp_updated": 1475753219, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25872815": {"recommendationid": "25872815", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023540221", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1741, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475871031}, "language": "english", "review": "It is a REALLY fun game! 9/10 ^^", "timestamp_created": 1475689498, "timestamp_updated": 1475689498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25866787": {"recommendationid": "25866787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129299024", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 141, "playtime_forever": 123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477234554}, "language": "french", "review": "Un grand classic du survival horreur !\n\nDead Rising s'inspire fortement du grand classic cin\u00e9ma qu'est \" Zombie \" !

When the PC version was released over 10 years later, I decided the time had come to give this game a proper go. I'm glad I did, this game is unique, intense, challenging and an absolute blast to play.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n+ In game clock keeps you moving and makes you think about your next moves\n+ The graphics have aged well and the game is great to play compared to the 360 version (144FPS, 1440p :))\n+ While tounge in cheek the story is actually pretty good\n+ Loads of weapons and ways of killing zombies\n+ Great risk/reward system with survivors\n+ Just when you are getting comfortable the game throws new things at you\n+ Most of the bosses are fun\n+ Extra save slots are a welcome addition\n+ Great reaply value, lots of modes and extras to unlock and lots of ways to play the game\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n- The inventory can be fiddly to manage\n- The in game clock will annoy some (not me, I think it adds to the game)\n- Some boss battles are a bit of an anti climax\n- Some boss weapons are so powerful that they make using many of the other fun weapons obselete\n- The survivor escort AI is poor, but manageable\n- The early challenge and inevitable failures will put the impatient off\n\n[b]OVERALL[/b]\nThis game is great, it's a great example of how older games still grip me and how most newer games just plain bore me as they play it safe with game mechanics. The in game clock will annoy some, but it makes this game as it keps you on your toes, every second counts. If you don't mind slightly clunky controls, occasionally annoying AI and a good challenge (you will fail to start with), then this game is for you.

You don't even really have to follow the story, and I would actually recommend first time players do just that; run around the mall, save a few people if you want, and experiment with the various means of zombie smashing; your level can be carried over to new games, even if you restart in mid-game.

Little does he know the town he fly's into is invaded by zombies. Frank lands on the roof of a mall which he thinks is safe but finds out that there are survivors along with him, who help him out. Frank learns that this is the opportunity that he needed so investigates further what is going on. You have three in game days to find the truth about the zombies and who caused all of this, but, failure in doing so will result in the truth vanishing. If you can survive the three days then the military will come in for \"clean up\" which does not mean only killing zombies, but also any survivors that lived including Frank. Two DHS agents will help you out through the game and together figure who caused the outbreak. After a while in the game a researcher named Isabella will tell you the truth about what happened. Her evil brother Carlito will try to stop you multiple times throughout the game and Brad, a DHS agent will help you. Frank can use anything in the mall as a weapon and also vehicles that can be found in the maintenance tunnels. While also finding out the truth about what happened you will have to lead several survivors into the safe room so that the helicopter can come in three days to rescue everyone you save. If you cannot complete every mission on time you will not be able to save everyone. Leading the AI can be difficult and it is highly recommended to give them a weapon.\n\nAnother thing you should know, not only do you have to worry about thousands of zombies chasing after you, you will have to deal with psychopaths that will try to kill you. You will recieve calls from Otis, which is a janitor who helps you out in giving you missions on where to locate survivors and help them and the main story. Otis will tell you certain survivors are being held hostage or \"something doesn't seem right\" sort of calls that will give you a hint you are going to fight a psychopath. Do not stress on not being able to save every survivor as you can always carry your saved data to a new game which will benefit you as you can start a new game as a higher level than before. Also, if you choose not to do any story missions there are several different endings that you can get.\n\nDead Rising has left a big impact on zombie games as it came out in 2006 everyone loved it.

I hadn't played the game since 2009 or so, and seven years is a long time in game development. But I quickly got right back into the zombie-eviscerating swing right from the get go.\n\nThe original Dead Rising nailed something that the others never quite replicated. It's a gamer's game, not a zombie killing sim (at least, not in the 72 hour story mode). You're more focused on evading and quickly dispatching of zombies rather than mashing the kill button. This is due to the unforgiving time system, which you'll either adapt to and see as part of the experience or grow to hate. If you're in the latter camp, there's always the survival mode. \n\nMyself, I happen to like the time system, because it really focuses you on getting through the mall. I feel a great sense of satisfaction as I rush back to the safe zone JUST BARELY IN TIME in order for the next story mission to start, with 2 practically braindead survivors in tow. When coupled with the difficult saving system, it makes the game at times frantic, nerve-wracking, and immensely satisfying to pull off well. \n\nObviously, some aspects haven't aged well. Standing still to shoot a gun sucks. You should remap the PC controls as soon as you start playing, because who the hell wants to aim a gun by pressing Q? That said, mouse and keyboard is a welcome addition to this game. You can actually aim weapons quickly and competently now, which greatly reduces the frustration I used to get with boss battles.  \n\nThe AI also sucks. Consider it part of the game's charm. If you don't try to break it, it functions. The floaty camera controls might irritate some people. \n\nBut then there's the cheesy, over the top dialogue, the hilarious moments in cutscenes where you're wondering what the f*** is going on, the conspiracy storyline running through it all that never takes itself too seriously, and the insane boss battles and cinematic death-scenes that cap them off. There's the smooth weapon animations and awesome combat combos. There's the viscerally satisfying \"SWIIIIISH\" of bladed weapons as they cut through zombie flesh and spray fountains of blood. There's the dozens of easter eggs, hidden weapons, and other secrets hidden throughout the sprawling mall. There's a day night cycle that makes you fear the dark, when zombies' eyes glow red and they seem to be 3x deadlier. \n\nAbove all, there's the overwhelming sense that this is a GAME. It often doesn't make sense. It doesn't need to. Frank the photojournalist has covered wars, y'know, so when he performs a flying judo kick or breaks zombies in half with raw strength, you shouldn't question it. You shouldn't question why so many people have become psychopaths after a zombie apocalypse, or why there's a mini-uzi lying on top of an awning outside a jewelry store, or how Frank can see after putting on a giant lego head that covers his entire face (best way to go through cutscenes IMO) \n\nReally, the only thing you need to know is that this game will reward you, if you give it the chance.

Max photos to have is 30 so lock them in to save the ones you want to keep. Also there is a battery changer on the first store to the right when exiting from the security room.

There is great diversity in the weapons that you can choose from, and it's balanced in a way that no other zombie game is. Almost every weapon in the game is useful, so even if your mini chainsaw (the most OP weapon in the game) breaks in the middle of a zombie horde, you can grab that mannequin torso from the nearby clothing store and still be fine. The timer is a fantastic addition, but it's not for everyone. It adds a certain level of stress to the game, however if you're interested in exploring instead of the quests or subquests, just ignore the timer and you'll be fine.\n\nThe setting is incredible. This is one aspect that the sequels to this game failed at. DR1 combines seriousness and spookiness with just the right about of silliness. It's a goofy game at times, but at other times there is a very serious horror/drama undertone. I personally think that DR2 and 3 took the silliness to the extreme and ruined the tone of their games. \n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game enough. As a port it had a few issues at launch, particularly with saving, but I've updated to the latest patch and it runs like a dream. Up to 4k resolutions supported and uncapped FPS.

This is one of those games that is traditionally considered \"hardcore\" like Demons Souls and Battletoads. It is 100% unforgiving of your mistakes, and even small errors can net you a huge loss in progress.\n\nBUT.\n\nIf you are willing to let the game punish you for your errors, you will find that the lessons it teaches you will ultimately cause you to fall in love with its hardcore quirkiness. Since it was practically a launch title, it feels like a game designed for the PS2 that had extra horsepower to play with. The animations, and the janky \"gaminess\" of it all, is all set to the backdrop of a SUPER well realized fictional mall that, for all the years I have been playing this game, has never ceased to amaze me with how its aesthetic and audio tone feels 100% authentic. The crowd tech that powers this is obviously inferior to that of later Dead Rising games, but they designed the game to minimize the showing of those limitations. Obviously on PC at higher resolutions these limitations become a little more obvious, but when you're wading through a swarm of smoothly animated zombies all clustering and clawing at you and you can see them in the distance huddling over and chowing on a psychopath or survivor that just died... it just feels so authentic and cool.\n\nThe reason why I think I can forgive how hard this game is is the simple fact that you keep your character progress between games. So you can fail as much as you like, but you will always be making at least a little progress.\n\nAs you can see from my playtime and my achievements, I am REALLY into this game (having unlocked a lot of the hardest  ones in a cluster), because once I gave myself in to its flaws, I have never since been able to replicate the feeling it has given me. The closest would probably be Red Dead Redemption, but I have strong doubts we'll ever see that come back. :(\n\nSome things I must address, though, in the interest of full disclosure, is that it has some REALLY strong flaws that may make you smash something (maybe even something expensive). For one, AI is TERRIBLE all around, the only reason that bosses are as hard as they are is because they clearly have superpowers and the game pretty much clears all zombies from the area that you fight in so they are a non-issue for most bosses. Plus, they have incredibly powerful weapons that are always guaranteed to take off a significant amount of health. Some of them even have insanely high defense to even the most powerful of weapons and can block almost all attacks, leaving TINY windows of oppotunity that only the most hardcore players of this game will be able to take advantage of. For survivors, the AI makes them do INCREDIBLY STUPID S***. ON YOUR FIRST PLAYTHROUGH YOU WILL LOSE SURVIVORS TO THEIR OWN STUPIDITY LIKE THEM GETTING IN THE WAY OF YOUR ATTACKS, RUNNING DIRECTLY INTO A SWARM OF ZOMBIES, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IF GRABBED. TAKE IT FROM THE GUY THAT LITERALLY SAVED EVERY POSSIBLE SURVIVOR. THEY ARE INFURIATINGLY DUMB. My advice? Carry queens (essentially grenades that only affect zombies) at all times, and carry food. Also, if you can equip them with shotguns, DO IT.\n\nThe second huge thing that may put people off is the time limit. The whole game runs on a universal time limit, and essentially the game is 6 in-game hours long (8-9 if you do the first 6 perfectly). Everything that can happen in the main story of the game happens in that 6 hours, and everything is always counting down but it never tells you SPECIFICALLY when a mission will expire. On your first playthrough, you may have to sacrifice survivors to get through more story missions.\n\nThe third huge issue you may have is death is unforgiving. If you have not been diligently saving your progress, you WILL lose all story/side mission/achievement progress since you last remembered to save. This is going to be a hard lesson to accept at first but THANKFULLY the character progress transfer is there. That last fact is why I could stand all the difficulty this game threw at me.\n\nAll my own personal reasons aside (I swear I could make a thesis out of this), I have two reasons why I hope you will buy this game right now, sale or no sale.\n\n1) To support developers going through their backlogs and porting their games over to the one, truly sustainable platform that will guarantee their games can be enjoyed for generations to come. \n\n2) I honestly feel this is a landmark game for the 360/PS3 generation onwards, it did zombies and it did zombies RIGHT before the market became saturated with them.\n\nIf you have a penchant for games that will not hold your hand and force you to earn their endings, this is a must-have. I feel this game gives me almost endless replayability, and whether that's nostalgia or whether this game may really be that good? I can't objectively say. What I can say is, there really isn't anything like this out there anymore.\n\nPRO TIP: Get the \"Zombie Genocider\" achievement (it's easier than you think, it's mainly just time consuming) before making a real run at the game. You'll see why.\n\nEDIT: I now have all the achievements.

This is the best game i have ever played.  After 10 whole years...10...years...Im so happy it finally came out on PC.\n\nGameplay 10/10\nThe gameplay is FANTASTIC!  It is so much fun to play this game.  So much fun.  There is so many weapons, guns, and more.  Sure some weapons you have to spend hours to get (i.e. laser sword and Mega Buster) but they getting the achievements for them are well worth it.  The laser sword just destroys everything, and the mega buster...well i mean its the mega buster you know what it is.  \n\nHow Long the Game is\nThe game lasts as long as you want it too.  What I mean is that there is so many endings (6-7 i think) and scoop chances!  The game is not meant to beaten only once, it is meant to be beaten many many times.  If you want even more to do, try and get all the achievements; I can think of atleast 2 that takes over 20 hours (7 Day Survivor and Zombie Genocider.)  So 20 dollars for at least 50 hours?  Thats more hours than most games!  Its only 20!?\n\nMicro-Transactions and DLC?\nNope.  None.  Thats right, a game that doesn't have MT and DLC.  You spend 20 dollars, and you get the FULL game,  not tiny bits or unfinished story bits.  The FULL game.  \n\nIs It a Good Port?\nYes, it is a great port!  The option menu is okay, but it has the essentials (also it is by far, the best Dead Rising port.  The others run like garbage.)  I've seen people running it at 4K, 1440P.  You also do NOT need a beefy PC for this game, a low end will work just fine.  Like 60FPS Ultra fine.  So almost everyone can play it.  NOTE:  SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPORTING ISSUES LIKE DIRECTX FAILED TO INITALIZE!  I HAVE NOT HAD THESE ISSUES.\n\nStory 8/10\nThe story was alright.  It had interesting moments and has many memorable scenes.  Whether it is the best story between all the games is debatable.  But no DR has come close to the memorable scenes and characters.\n\nWhat About DR 2, OTR, and DR 3?\nForget them, Dead Rising 1 is the best out of all of them.  None of them have as great of story, gameplay, or value.  Also!  Dead Rising 1 does not have GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE!!!  Dead Rising 2 and OTR do.  DR 3 though is...not great, it is okay but its 10 dollars more than 1 and it is definately not work that extra 10.  The value of getting the Mega Blaster or the Laser Sword is something unmatched by the other 2.  Especially Dead Rising 3, I got the Mega Buster without any difficulty in 3, like it uses the same save stuff from DR1, and thats about it.  You just have to beat the game.  Not that hard.\n\nCommon Cons That Are Easily Fixable\nTime:  sigh, really the time?  The thing that adds the sence of fear of failure?  Well heres the thing, as long as you dont continue with the \"Save Brad Mission\" at the beginning of the game, you can do whatever you want.  The game isnt restricted, you dont want to play the story?  Go right ahead.  If the 3 days end, just restart the game.  You still have all your progress (like levels and achievement items.)\nSaving Sytem:  I see this one, this one kind of makes me mad aswell.  Nothing spells anger than getting knocked out by The Cultists.  As long as you save after every scoop/case or two you're fine. Not that bad.  Just find a bathroom or go to the security room.\nTechnical Issues: Every game has technical issues.  You either get it or you dont.  The DirectX thing is one and some people have reported of having no sound.  But from what I seen, the devs have been trying to fix that and I really hope they fix that stuff.  We can only wait and see.  \nPychopaths are hard:  Some are and some arent.  Some guides say \"Use the Mega Buster!\"  and thats not right.  So, you have three choices.  A) Get the mega buster, its just tedious takes like 6-7 hours of constant grinding.  B) Use this guide http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=764247343 (this guide will help you out alot, I didnt need it since I know all the bosses strats, but I still learned a little from this guide.)  C) Learn the strategies yourself.  \n\nTL;DR  10/10 game buy it now\n\nOVERALL RATING:  10/10 This is MY favorite game, of all time, no game comes close for me.  But if you like the movie Dawn of the Dead or zombie games with humor, then this game is for you without a doubt.  Buy it now, trust me, it is hands down the best zombie game out right now (only other good zombie game is Left 4 Dead) so please, get the money and the time and sit down play the game.

This made me especially curious when I was confronted with case making gameplay.\n\nOverall for me it was a fun game, not to be taken seriously and relieves your itch for mass zombie killing with the tool of your choice.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z1oOfhVW-g", "timestamp_created": 1474406785, "timestamp_updated": 1474406785, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25609921": {"recommendationid": "25609921", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997577421", "num_games_owned": 388, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 2374, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498321434}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't try the activities Frank does here in a real shopping mall!\n\n\nI missed you DR.", "timestamp_created": 1474406419, "timestamp_updated": 1474406419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516940", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25607941": {"recommendationid": "25607941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041656877", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6577, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500485560}, "language": "english", "review": "Every self-respecting gamer should own this classic game.

But in 2006 zombie survival meant running around a mall with 2 bottles of orange juice, a bowling ball, and a dangerously undersized chainsaw while killing zombies and saving people.\n\nWell it looks like its 2006 again cause I'm playing this game and still doing nothing with my life. \n\nDead Rising is a game that was initially pitched as a joke. \"Lets make a game that focuses on escort quests, bullshit boss battles and a time limit\". Capcom thought it was so funny they greenlit it for the bants but then the devs were like \"lol lets make it really good\" and they fucking did.\n\nYou play as Frank West a photo journaliser who takes pictures and gets scoops. He's also a walking army. Together with Jessie, Brad, Otis, and Isabella, you attempt to find out the secret behind the zombies, and this terrorist guy. During this you can also do lots of optional rescue missions, and fight psycopaths including a clown, a cop, a store manager, and a father-son hunting trip.\n\nAnd it fuckin rocks. The gameplay is pretty solid, the atmosphere is fantastic, the story and characters are great, and the game just althogether feels tight and makes you want to play more. Grabbing random shit off shelves to fight zombies is great, but the game also has a learning curve and after a few runs you'll be optimising routes, finding the best weapons, and trying to get that dumbass fucking saint achievement while the stupid fuckers stand in the pond and you spam Y but no they dont come.\n\nIt has its flaws such as the survivor AI role being filled by a battery and two gerbils, but honestly this just adds to the experience and tension as you really feel it is your responsibility to step up, fuck up the zombies, and get these people home safe.\n\nSo before you buy any of that Early Access shit, buy this instead and play a legit good game. You never know, you might become a bit more cultured from it.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1474396833, "timestamp_updated": 1474396833, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505650", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25605198": {"recommendationid": "25605198", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976090763", "num_games_owned": 545, "num_reviews": 92, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489460735}, "language": "english", "review": "10 years after and this game is still the best game i played  !!!", "timestamp_created": 1474388440, "timestamp_updated": 1474388440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503441", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25605162": {"recommendationid": "25605162", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042005278", "num_games_owned": 578, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1644, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512843865}, "language": "english", "review": "\"WHAT'S HAPPENING?\"\n*sob*\n\"I UNDERSTAND\"\n*sob*\n\"WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?\"\n\n10/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1474388303, "timestamp_updated": 1474388303, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500416", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25605147": {"recommendationid": "25605147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045323407", "num_games_owned": 108, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 254, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1477847817}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430!", "timestamp_created": 1474388264, "timestamp_updated": 1474388264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.383390", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25604602": {"recommendationid": "25604602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014521404", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7549, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512348884}, "language": "english", "review": "Played this game when I was a kid long ago when it game out :) The port is very good and the game is exactly as i remember it...yes including the aweful AI.

Even after 7 years, the nostalgia held up better than I expected while I was reminded of what the Dead Rising series used to be. The zombies, though far sparser than in the sequels, present a much more dangerous and present threat within the environment than they did in DR2 and especially DR3. The pshycopaths are more unique than I ever cared to remember back then, and they kept every single tiny element from the original game(excluding the save slot, Hurrah!), which i find both infuriating and but even more absolutely love(\"Don't cut me off like that! It's rude!\"). This game is for lack of a better description a perfect port, forgiving the frame drops from when you gib multiple zombies with weapons like the sledgehammer. I would highly suggest this to both returning players as well as anyone looking for a solid game with replay value and a linear story that you can just flip the bird and ignore for some good ole slaughter and rescueing to get that level up. It's the best in the entire series in my personal opinion(and im sure many others), and provides a guaranteed 7-8 hours of awesome story, zombie slaughter and if you wanna try and rescue everyone, it can also be one hell of a challenge(Courtesy of the perfectly ported atrocious AI). Buy it and love it.\n\nOne other thing of note for fans, the remastered graphics were fantastically done. Not in the sense that the textures were out of this world(they look damn good though), but because for a seasoned fan like me used to more graphically intense games these days, the textures and fps made it feel like the game hadn't aged a day, hell it looked clearly better even.

Period.\n\nMyself like many others got this game back when it was released on the Xbox 360 in 2006. I was TEN years old at the time and I remember the day I got it being amazed at how no other game was like this. Keep in mind there was no zombie games like Left 4 Dead (2007) or Killing Floor (2009) around at the time or any of these other Zombie Games that could potentially compete with it, they all came out afterwards. You ever had that conversation late at night with a friend where it's along the lines of \"I wish there was a zombie game where you could run around and survive in an open world and get clothes and guns and do whatever you want\"? That was what I was like during the time and then I found this masterpiece. What's funny is that when I first got this game, I never finished it. I always hid in the saferoom or on the rooftop and waited for the helicopter. Browsing on the early days of youtube, early in the morning, watching youtubers play the game. A year later after building up the courage to play it my Xbox broke down, I never got it repaired and that was the last time I played Dead Rising 1. I switched back over to PC Gaming and years on I would search for a Emulator of a sort so I could play it on my PC, never found one. ;(\n\nThen on September 13th 2016, as I was browsing the Store Page I saw this masterpiece featured. Such a good feeling.\n\nAnyway, story time out of the way. I'll list the pro's and cons below!\n\n[u] Pros\t[/u]\n- Great Story\n- Great Characters\n- Lots of Replayability, so many different endings, one that leads to further progession of the game ;)\n- Manages to capture that comedic effect at certain times which is a great touch to a Zombie game.\n- Interesting Psychopaths, all of them are different and require different strategies to beat.\n- Best map out of the franchise, I do wish it was a bit bigger but still it is great.\n- Interesting Protagonist\n- Great Port, surprising since many Developers can't do that right. Feels very smooth and crisp.\n- Infinity Mode.\n- Wide range of weaponry and clothing.\n- Interesting and fun missions.\n\n[u] Cons\t[/u]\n- Terrible AI, nothing more frustrating than escorting 4+ survivors back to the saferoom only to have them run into walls, bump into each other, stop, fall behind and die.\n- Game mechanics are quite clunky at times.\n- Rare occasions of crashing (Has happened to me twice, hopefully will be fixed soon)\n- No CO-OP, I wish for the 10 Year Anniversary they added it. I mean they have CO-OP for DR2/DR3.\n- Hit Detection on Zombies can be annoying at times.\n- Otis calling you every single time you're in the middle of doing something important, he doesn't stop calling until you answer either and if you hang up, he'll call back. This disables jump, attack and makes it hard to defend yourself\n\nI rate this game a 9/10, It is truly a masterpiece and EVERY gamer should at least play this. Don't worry about playing the sequels, they are good but will never touch the original. BUY IT.\n\nCurrently on my second playthrough right now, got my megaman buster and I'm max level.

Dead Rising is one of my favorite zombie games of all time and with the remaster it finally deserves, I was genuinely excited to dive back into this game, so while I may sound like I'm reviewing this game from the perspective of someone who's a die-hard fan of the game, please understand that while I think the game is fantastic, I still know the game is not without its flaws, so without further ado, lets get started.\n\nIt's been approximately 10 years since the original Dead Rising debuted on Xbox 360 and it still reigns supreme as one of my favorite, if not favorite, zombie game of all time, despite it's problems with various aspects of the game itself regarding AI and time management. However, despite its flaws, I still consider Dead Rising to be my favorite zombie game of all time, so just a heads up in case you haven't figured it out yet, this will be a positive review on the game, so yeah.\n\nSo what is Dead Rising?\n\nDead Rising, as I have said already, is a zombie \"sandbox\" game released as a console exclusive for the Xbox 360 in 2006 and became one of the first games that really tested the power of the console itself with the amount of zombies the game could render on screen. As freelance photojournalist Frank West, you are tipped off about a potential story taking place in the small town of Willamette, Colorado and find yourself in a fight for survival and a fight to uncover the truth behind the events taking place. With 72 hours to uncover the story and an endless amount of zombies around you, you have to use your wits and your resourcefulness in order to survive.\n\nStory:\n\nWhile the story of Dead Rising is nothing really special or memorable, the game's story does take itself semi-seriously even though it's a zombie game. With a story that is interesting and clear, although the theme's and messages of the story are pretty much black and white, it's still a good and followable story.\n\nGameplay:\n\nDead Rising's gameplay is broken up into 3 aspects: Zombies, survivors, and camera work. Being a zombie game, you of course need to have a means of defending yourself, and as advertised immensly in the game's marketing, anything and everything is a weapon. Set in an open shopping mall, you have access to a variety of weapons ranging from the standards such as guns, knifes, and home hardware, to the more oddball such as teddy bears, boomerangs, and gems. In addition to the insane amount of weapons, you also have access to a variety of books scattered around the mall that can increase the efficiency of certain items. Suffice it to say, there's a lot of weapons in the game, but what if you get bored just killing zombies? Well that leads us into the second aspect of the game: Survivors. While wandering through the mall, you will occasionally recieve calls from the safe room regarding the spotting of survivors located in the mall and if you have the time, you can choose to try and save them, and while I want to talk abou the AI of the game, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT YET, as I will discuss that aspect later. Regardless, the survivors mostly vary in personality, ranging from the physically and emotionally traumatized to the strong and resilient, giving the game a more challenging and realistic approach to them. The last aspect, the camera, is the most underlooked aspect of the game. Being a photojournalist, you can use your camera as a means of capturing the events taking place right before you, and doing so can also give you immense experience for leveling up Frank, but sadly the camera is more than less just an added feature to the game that doesn't really enhance or lessen the experience of the game.\n\nAtmosphere:\n\nIf I can appreciate anything in a game is how well it establishes tone and atmosphere, and boy does Dead Rising set a unique setting for itself. Taking place in the Willamette Shopping Mall, the interior design's of each area in the mall all give off an eerie and hopeless feeling that perfectly matches with the feeling of dread and mystery that is present with the story. Areas populated with the sounds of the dead and the cheerful and informative mall PA system to accompany the sounds of said dead all add immensly to the game.\n\nDifficulty/Bugs:\n\nAlthough I don't find the game to be particularly difficult, going into this game for the first time, you are going to be frustrated. Starting the game you are basically powerless; you have no good attributes, you're slow, don't have much inventory space, low on life, essentially you're nothing. However, what point is there to a game that gives you no challenge? Now depending how you play the game it can either be somewhat challenging or a nightmare. Playing the game vanilla, the game is somewhat challenging as there is little to no stress pressed upon you, but playing the game with the intention of saving survivors, you're going to find yourself immensly frustrated, which leads us to the bugs portion of this review. Now as I have said already, most of the difficulty in Dead Rising comes from the bugs and design decisions in the game. With piss poor survivor AI and a somewhat poorly constructed time system, it's easy to find the game to be overly challenging, but with a little bit of dedication and experience, it can be a rewarding experience. Overall, the game is challenging but not to a point where you can't find enjoyment in the game.\n\nChanges:\n\nBeing a remaster, the burning question about what the remaster has done to improve the original comes to mind, and in all honesty the remaster is an excellent improvement on the original game, with the game now rendering at 1080p quality at 60fps, with the original on Xbox 360 rendering at 720p at 30fps. In addition to the improvement in quality, the game also introduces multiple save slots, which if you have played the original, you'll be thankful for. Other than that, the original game still remains intact, and that's the point of remastering a game: to improve the quality of the original.\n\nOverall:\n\nDead Rising still reigns supreme as my favorite zombie game of all time. Dark, addictive, challenging, replayable, and fun, Dead Rising is a must own for the zombie gamer at heart. The story is a perfect blend of cheese and dread, something that most zombie games don't do nowadays sadly, and the gameplay is challenging and variable. However, the bugs present in the game are very noticeable and can take away and somewhat ruin your experience with the game.\n\nOverall, 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1474235983, "timestamp_updated": 1474236108, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590275", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25576956": {"recommendationid": "25576956", "author": {"steamid": "76561198079460449", "num_games_owned": 242, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 286, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474332581}, "language": "english", "review": "The nostalgia is enough to make a grown man cry.

I loved this game when it first came out on the 360, and this game still looks pretty good despite the age.  Load times are very short when moving between different sections of the mall.\n\nIs this game perfect?  No.  The AI issues that were present in the original release are still here, as survivors are not very good at navigating various areas in the mall.  It can be incredibly frustrating to guide them back to your safehouse, especially when it's hard to determine when they are within a close enough proximity of you in order to move to a different area in the mall.  In addition, the psychopaths and boss battles can be incredibly tedious and sometimes fall victim to various glitches and bugs.  I've been stunlocked a good number of times now in situations when I'm given no reaction time to how some of them maneuver and attack.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this game to fans of the series who may have never had a chance to play the original version.

I'm still gonna gush over this game though.\n\nFor starters- The game is built on MT Framework. It's the same engine behind most of Capcom's games from the gen, and it means this port is beautiful. No discernable problems at all. \n\n Wilamette Mall is cozy. You can decide to just roam around and explore, and while the game penalizes your story progression for it, you can just ignore the scoops. There's alot of nooks and crannies to explore, and while the mall stores themselves are somewhat sparse with what you can actually use, there's still alot of novelty weapons and items. \n\nThe story hits that perfect spot between B movie cheese and a legitimately interesting storyline with memorable characters. This entire game is a commentary on consumerism, much like the Romero movie it pretty heavily \"borrows\" from. There's depth in the characters, surprisingly. \n\nOST is cozy. Mall Music 3 is still amazing. \n\nThe difficulty in this game is all over the place, which can be good and bad. You will almost immediately be smacked in the face with a limited save system and a punishing difficulty spike the second your first nighttime switch happens. The missions are all doable though, and you can actually save nearly every survivor in the game in one playthrough (though this is almost impossible without NG+). DR is not really a game you can just jump into and breeze through. The rough survivor AI and some of the ridiclous Psychopath fights are enough to cause rage quits. There is a reason people remember the \"WEEELLLLLLLLLLL\" meme. \n\ntl;dr - DR is a fantastic game. It has a ridiculous amount of content, high replay value and an atmosphere that you can't really find anywhere else.

For those of you who have played the subsequent Dead Rising games but never played this game I have a word of warning: it has aged some and if you've never played this one before you might not like it based on that alone.\n\nBut, on to the good stuff. This is a rather loyal port with few issues so far. The main one was the save data corruption that's already being patched (and I was able to get around by launching steam as an admin). Weapons will be where you remembered and encounters will happen where you know they would. This does also mean that there are some negatives. Once you get that certain weapon that respawns you're pretty much set for the game (you know which one) with most bosses falling to it in a matter of a few hits. You're still planted firmly in place whenever you aim a weapon and the defualt aiming is with the stick you'd use to move (if you use a controller). This can be changed in the controls menu but it's not an obvious option. \n\nCompared to the second game in the series I have to say that this one was definitely harder when I came back to it. The hordes were denser and the survivors like to get stuck on a few zombies only to promptly be swarmed by dozens more. Unfortunately, the only way to get them out is to slice at all the zombies around them and hit them in the process. During the final few side missions for rescuing the survivors this became especially apparent and rather tiresome. \n\nDespite all this, I still found myself enjoying the game and wanting to play it. Running around with a chainsaw is still fun and using the silly weapons here and there is good for a chuckle. The psychopaths are still memorable and a very nice change of pace. The story is still there (though only picks up in the latter half) and now you have five (5!) save slots so you don' get fucked hours in by a deadline.\n\nTLDR: If you played this game when it came out and enjoyed it then you'll enjoy it now. If you've never played it before but liked the second then you'll probably like this one, just keep in mind that this game is ten years old and it shows in certain mechanics.

The game does hold somewhat nostalgic value to me, and for 20 bucks it's a great game. NOT A REMASTER, it does carry bugs over from the 360 version I.E there is a fps drop when using blunt weapons and hitting one/multple enemies, that chops it down to 10fps for a split-second. This has been a problem since the 360 version, How they handle through update is up to Capcom. \nThe game does support controllers. But I am using a generic 360 controller and have had multiple problems with the forward ananlog. It acts like it wants to walk instead of running and thats running at diaganol directions.

Kept the very same CD and case until about a month ago, when I'd finally decided to pawn in all the old stuff I'd played. Knew this would be coming out, so I wouldn't miss the game much.\n\nI'm pleasantly surprised at the stability of the game. I clocked in 17.3 hours in a SINGLE SESSION of gameplay, just because I was so addicted to playing the game again. Although the game is improved for PC and looking fine, framerates kinda drop when facing a horde of zeds. Oddly enough, this only really happens outside of the Maintainance Tunnel, so I guess there are a few points of optimization missed during the port. Performance will chug if you find yourself in the middle of particle effects like explosions. From what I've seen, though, mostly everyone can expect decent framerates.\n\nControls are the same as ever, which will bug anyone that's gotten as used to the newer controls of Dead Rising 2 and so on- particularly the ability to move while aiming a weapon. If you play through with a controller like I have, you'll also be annoyed by the fact that your crosshair will drift further than the slightest nudge you tried to give it to correct your aim. I'm assuming this isn't an issue for anyone using a mouse and keyboard, but just keep in mind that, as I've said before, the controls are the same as ever.\n\nYou can't complain much about the graphics, especially given the fact that you can run on resolutions not offered by the 360's hardware. Everything looks sharp unless you zoom in on certain textures with the camera, and you could expect just about the same level of detail as Dead Rising 2 + OTR. Just don't go into this expecting co-op or item combinations.\n\nAll in all, this has been worth it. If a game can squeeze me for time all in one go like that, I'd call it a success. Unlike when I was a little kid and too intimidated to go very far into the game because late-game difficulty always seemed like such a grown-up thing to tackle, I've gotten used to and even enjoy challenge in games now. To top it off, I have a lot of experience in wading through this game's difficulties in the past, so some of the tricks I'd long forgotten ended up resurfacing mid-game in a satisfying way.\n\nGrab this game, especially if you haven't played anything earlier than DR2. The story and atmosphere of the first are superior to the later entries, especially given the tone put off when faced with psychopath conflicts and the deaths of certain characters.

What's up.\n\nCons\n-You'll still scream at survivor AI and laugh at stupid psychopath movements (prisoners)\n-You still have the annoying and poor clock/timed missions which don't exactly tell you how much time you have left unless you've got like a wiki open\n-No combo weapons, but who needs it when you've got an inventory full of small chainsaws and real megaman blasters?\n\nHonestly there should be no reason why you shouldn't own this game, it's the best thing that's hit the 360, and now it's 1000% better on PC.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1474059717, "timestamp_updated": 1474059717, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.654866", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25533967": {"recommendationid": "25533967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018998181", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 3859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512447479}, "language": "english", "review": "This is coming from a person who has played it for the first time ever in 2016, never owning the original on the Xbox 360.\n\nI must say, the day I heard this is coming to PC I was exhilarated. Having played all the other available titles on PC (2, OTR, 3) I believe this one is the best in the series.\n\nFor starters, the first entry in the franchise was developed by the core japanese team of Capcom. Japanese humor and quirks are noticable here and there, and some cutscenes feel that way. It's not bad nor obnoxious though. It's what made this game fun and memorable back in 2006. It has its own charm. It feels and plays very differently from the ones made by Capcom Vancouver (2 and onwards).\n\nI think I'll pass on reviewing all aspects of the game as much more professional reviews are available from when the game was released, instead I will focus on the port quality.\n\nMy experience with the port was flawless. I have used only keyboard and mouse controls which I found to be easy to use and comfortable, but skill moves might be tricky to initiate at first. The camera movement needs some time to get used to, as it feels like you're dragging it around. That \"effect\" can only be disabled for aiming, sadly. There seems to be no negative mouse acceleration either, which plagued other entries in the series on PC, but even on max sensitivity the camera might turn a bit too slow for someone.\nEventually one can get used to it, and doing swift movements becomes second nature.\nI haven't stumbled upon any gamebreaking bugs either, which really made me happy.\nGame supports 4k resolution, MSAA up to x8, uncapped frame rate, a motion blur toggle, and fully rebindable controls, so most needs will be satisfied.\n\n\nNow the bad things, because this game is not THAT perfect.\n\nThere is a feature called \"hitstop\", which freezes the game intentionally on one frame when hitting zombies with blunt weapons. It was supposed to enhance the impact of blunt weapons, but for many it can be jarring, especially running at a significantly higher framerate than it was designed for. The effect itself amplifies the more you hit in one swing, making it appear like your game completely freezes for a second if you charge into a group with a bench. Luckily mods will be available soon so it's likely it can be modded out.\n\nEven though I haven't experienced any bugs doesn't mean they don't exist. There are multiple reports of the game not launching at all due to lack of a specific Windows update, no audio issues which are apparently fixed by updating Internet Explorer, or higher framerates resulting in more damage taken, even allowing the player to be one shotted. The team is aware of those issues and as far as I know, they're working on fixing them. Apparently those are mostly occuring on Windows 7.\nI was lucky enough to not suffer from those issues.\n\nThere's also the problem of the game's infamous really stupid survivor AI. It's so annoyingly dumb that it can make you want to throw your computer out of the window. Just be aware that escorting survivors back to safety will raise your blood pressure.\n\n\nIn summary, I dare say this is a high quality port, probably the best Dead Rising PC port that exists in this franchise. I want to thank Capcom for going forward with decision to allow Dead Rising 1 to reach current generation consoles and Q-LOC for doing excellent work on the port. I believe the original experience from 2006 is available here, right now.

It was probably good back in its day, but it does not hold up as a modern PC game. Reasons are:\n\n1. The game is Nintendo Hard. It uses save points (vomit), and the save points are few and far between, and often require killing dozens, if not hundreds of enemies to reach them. You can easily lose hours of progress trying to get to a save point. Everything is timed, and you sometimes are not given tutorials until AFTER you needed to do something, there are things you will never get right the first time, making it necessary to restart from your last save and lose hours because you did not know a needed gameplay mechanic ahead of time.\n\n2. The AI of your allies is terrible. You have to escort characters back to the saferoom, but if you don't give them a weapon, they wait til you get about 50 feet away and run straight toward you, usually right into zombies, OR if you give them a weapon they go full Leeroy Jenkins and charge at the enemy zombies, and get swarmed.\n\n3. The gun system is terrible. Not only are they impossibly weak, but they are all auto-aim, and there's no way to know what your character will shoot at. A zombie could be two feet from you and you'll shoot the gun only to hit an enemy standing 15 feet behind it.

Normally I would abhor this, but I found it benefitial to my build to adopt these new drivers as they were better than the last one.\n\nBasically, the core of Dead Rising is p good. Some will defend it to the death, some will abhor it; it's definitely an acquired taste. That being said, if you complain about the controls or the fact that you can't move and shoot, kys. No really, go commit sudoku if you cannot be pressed to rebind your kb/controller and learn how to adapt being stationary while shooting. It's 2016, you had all this time to git gud, my ni[i][/i]gga.\n\n\nNow for the autistic part: the breakdown of this PC port. \n\nThis port has numerous incompatibility issues. Putting anecdotal evidence aside, the discussion forum is literally flooded with topics asking for technical assistance or to complain about the issues on their end. Every other topic is a complaint about a common techincal issue because some people are too dumb to read the stickies. And the tech-support thread that does exist got flooded within the first day.\n\nAt first, I thought the game had incompatibilities with the 2014 C++ Redistributable, but I checked the files and saw it utilized the 2012 Redistributable. So that was obviously not the problem. The issue was the driver. If you're on a legacy Nvidja card, be prepared to di[i][/i]ck around with drivers that are compatible with the game and - at the same time - won't make your card poop out early. For the record, any video card older than the GTX 1000 series is considered \"legacy\" by the Nbidia - The Way You're Meant To Be Played. So what's the deal? Why do we need to adopt new drivers that could potentially gimp performance in other games but Dead But Not Phallic Rising? Could a Capcom rep care to explain?\n\nThe game runs on the MT Framework engine, the most scalable and efficient engine created in the last generation. It could be herald as Capcom's Barry-magnum opus. It was capable of squeezing Marvel 3 down to the Vita, and it was responsible for making DMC4 and Lost Planet 1 the best PC ports Capcom had ever produced. It pretty much made all of Capcom's games run smooth like butter on the PC, barring Tameem may Cry which used a build of the UE3 that was capable of rendering different hues of grey (DM me for the color values if you're interested). So why is it that Dead Rising 1 doesn't run the same as DMC4 and LP1, ports that came out in 2008? I looked at the menu in the graphical buffet, and I was poorly disappointed in the servings. You get the standard, no, barebone, settings for a PC game. The textures cannot be scaled at all; you have to deal with 2006-tier textures that reek of a 3megapixel camera importing its dump to Photoshop or Green Is My Pepper 1.2. At the very least, we can turn motion blur on and off, but I would keep it on since the animations look tramautizing with the blur off. Compare and contrast DR1's graphical settings to the DMC4's graphcial settings. DMC4's original PC port had several different options and went up to extremes with anti-aliasing. If you downloaded the update that supported DX10, you were playing on what was considered next-gen, ala 2010. \n\nThe game also has terrible aiming acceleration. It's just really bad, especially when you jerk your mouse around at the highest dpi settings. You could potentially break the game by bending the mesh; its values might have been null. \n\nIn addition to that, the game has a lot of mission bugs. Very first side-mission with Kent, I snapped a 4000pp photo of him and the dude wouldn't shut up. Obviously the if statements were coded to be introspective, instead of just werks. What disappointed me was the fact that Capcom half-assed this PC port. They had a good track record of producing amazing PC ports since the beginning of last gen; the failures of the original PC ports of RE4 and DMC3 motivated them to git gud. They squandered our good will, and sold it to GoodWill for tax breaks. \n\nDon't listen to that elitest homo known as Totalbizkit, who would say all Japanese games have bad PC ports. That dumb rand doesn't even realize that a majority Japanese games at the arcade run on PC's, and that a lot of developers have to use Winblows PC's for toolkits. In particular, the Sega Lindbergh uses Montavista, an enterprise distro that you have to pay for - similar to Red Hat, but not a Fedora. Biscuit brags about being PCMR, but in reality he's a tech-illit, so he's uses Ubuntu; in that case, he can apt-get f[i][/i]ucked. Either that, or we can wait for London's new mayor to establish a caliphat so Sharia patrols can throw Totalbiscuit off a roof for being a bundle of twigs.  \n\nAs of now, I give this port of Dead Rising a 3.2/10 because it still has a lot of problems that need to be fixed in a patch. I would suggest waiting a month before buying the game; go ahead and spend your twenty-twen on 2 gams of dank, or 4 gams of dirt you can buy from a 12 year old Mexican kid in front of a 7-11.\n", "timestamp_created": 1473974947, "timestamp_updated": 1473974947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "4.975124", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25517645": {"recommendationid": "25517645", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081552055", "num_games_owned": 386, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515132120}, "language": "english", "review": "I played this 10 years ago and loved it.

The only performance problem I've run into is that a few weapons (like the sledgehammer) cause massive stuttering when you kill zombies. This appears to be a problem with the remaster itself and not the PC version as this issue exists on the XboxOne/PS4 version as well. \n\nAs for the game itself, it's brutally difficult with some poorly done AI and outdated controls/graphics. The map design is great with some interesting locations and lots of secrets to explore. The story is a typical Dead Rising story with terrible voice acting, stupid plotline, and terrible boss fights. \n\nSo why bother with this game? Well, it's the original open world zombie game that started it all. It's a lot of fun to explore the mall and kill zombies, but just know now that it's a stupid, silly game that should never be taken seriously. The missions are poorly done and are often frustrating to complete so only the most dedicated players will even get to the end of the main questline. \n\n\nOverall, the $20 asking price is not high and the game is definitely worth it for that price. Though the micro-stutter issue needs to be fixed immedietly. If it's not, then you're better off waiting for a sale. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZR1t4rm7Gw&index=1&list=PLTxgzJqWtkFaUmC2PUuGngkm1K-KX4Ym6", "timestamp_created": 1473953881,

the definitive zombie game was released for the Xbox 360 in all of its clunky, infuriating glory- I was in high school. Now it's a decade later, i've graduated college with a full time job- plus hundreds of zombie games- and three (soon to be four) sequels later its still the best in the series and possibly the best zombie game i've played yet.\n\nGetting into the port itself, it runs like a dream. The kb+m controls are practically seamless, but you can change the settings if you need to if the bindings don't suit your motor skills. It looks better than ever, adds multiple save slots to make you want to tear your hair out just a little bit less when you die trying to get a survivor to walk through an automatic door for the nth time that day, and even more impressively, the soundtrack remains the same! That means being able to relive the stomach-churning apocalyptic trumpets once again as they begin the minute your feet touch the grass of the courtyard in all their glory.\n\nSome people have reported having saving issues, troubles with directx, and audio problems. I have personally not had a problem with any of those, but my sympathies go out to those who do and I hope there's a fix released for it soon. So... the port isn't perfect. But it's pretty damn good. In retrospect, it could have turned out much worse.\n\nThe bottom line is, if you feel as if zombie games have oversaturated the market and become passe, do yourself a favor and return to one of the classics.

Haven't played any of them? Do yourself a damn favor and get this game. This port of the original from 2006 runs perfectly, and it is a blast to run around in the confines of Willamette Mall once again. Although its more serious in tone than 2&3, I feel that Dead Rising is the best one and always will be because of that serious tone. As you play through the game you need (well not really but you should) to rescue any survivors that you see and are told about, while completing the main quest line, taking some pictures and dealing with psychopaths. The game truly makes you feel on edge in certain moments, like you're racing against the time that has been given to you in order to complete all the tasks that you have been put up to. And just when you think you've caught up, the clunky AI will have the 6 survivors you're transporting back to the safe house sprint endlessley into a potted plant as they get horded by zombies and scream your name for help. And then some of them die and all is lost because you really wanted to save all of them. And now your last save was an hour ago, and in Dead Rising you can only save in the bathrooms (or security room), and there's rarely auto saves (unless it's for a main quest). Frustrating, but it's part of what gives Dead Rising its charm. Having to not only deal with zombies, psychopaths, survivors and the main storyline but also the games little nuances is enough to make anyone drop the game and say \"This sucks!\" But for me it makes me appreciate it that much more, because it's just another challenge that you have to adapt to and tackle. So if you get this game, don't give up easily, or early. Keep on trying to play and beat the game.

The game allows you to switch between KBM and controller schemes on the fly, and controls are completely rebindable.  Good selection of graphic options, including borderless windowed and choosing between 30, 60 or unlimited framerate.  Entire time I've been playing I have experienced no crashing or game stopping bugs, except for the infamously idiotic survivor AI, which isn't a result of a bad port but more a lack of polish on the original thing.\n\nAs for the game, the first Dead Rising I played was 2, and I must say the lack of the more gimmicky features of the later games makes DR1 refreshing to play.  The later changes to include more and more powerful weapons comes at the price of making the zombies feel less threatening; one combo weapon in DR3 makes entire zombie hordes a complete joke, letting you simply mash X in large groups and get immense amounts of PP.  Combine that with being able to create said weapon at any point, so long as you have the parts (which get brain dead easy later), and the game loses an incredible amount of tension, making the game a lot more boring as a result.  It's almost a reverse effect: the crazier the weapons and attacks get, the less interesting the game becomes.  In Dead Rising 1 this isn't the case; zombies are a bigger threat due to not having overpowered weapons readily available, and the zombies themselves being more aggressive and not so easy to shove aside, espeically in large groups.  The zombies being an actual threat make the game a hell of a lot more interesting to play.  This is looking waaay far into the future, but if a Dead Rising 5 happens, I only hope the zany combo weapons get toned down so it feels there's at least some resistance to moving around.\n\nLike I said earlier, the first Dead Rising I played was 2, because I had never owned a 360.  This port is my first time ever playing this game, and if this port had never happened, I might've never played this game.  Same goes with Dragon's Dogma (although it was on PS3, I'll take 60 fps any day).  I'm very thankful for Capcom putting money into gambling a rerelease of a 10 year old game, and I hope they decide to make more smart moves in the future, either with great port jobs or WHERE THE HELL IS DEEP DOWN CAPCOM", "timestamp_created": 1473920270, "timestamp_updated": 1473920270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "4.980100", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25506688": {"recommendationid": "25506688", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062479406", "num_games_owned": 548, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482458230}, "language": "english", "review": "How survivor AI pathfinding is programmed in this game:\n\n[quote]\nwhile (NOT next to Frank) {\n  walk towards Frank\n  if (there is obstacle) {\n    turn random degrees\n    walk 1 meter\n  }\n}\n[/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1473918629, "timestamp_updated": 1473918659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.626963", "comment_count": "3", "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25506666": {"recommendationid": "25506666", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162852012", "num_games_owned": 678, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1488065359}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game but the time system is really annoying, someone please make a mod to freeze it.", "timestamp_created": 1473918411, "timestamp_updated": 1473918411, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25506661": {"recommendationid": "25506661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236837348", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8053, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1507233674}, "language": "english", "review": "If the other reviews haven't sold you then at least know this.

The game ran solid 60 FPS throughout my whole playthrough without crashing.\n\nThe good old stuff that this port brings along with it are some of the clunky mechanics, occasional bad AI, constant race against time, character progression, amazing soundtrack, FANTASTIC bosses(psychopaths) and interesting story with multiple endings. After completing the main playthrough you can work on your 2nd playthrough to level up Frank to the max level or to hop on to infinity mode, which is tons of fun and adding a lot of play value.\n\nIf you have ever played this game on the Xbox 360 and you enjoyed it, this is a fantastic nostalgia ride for only 19,99 \u20ac, totally worth it!", "timestamp_created": 1473900527, "timestamp_updated": 1479974580, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 86, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803503", "comment_count": "5", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25503962": {"recommendationid": "25503962", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010574907", "num_games_owned": 216, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 97, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1473757720}, "language": "english", "review": "Old but gold. \nFAAAAAAAAANTASTIC.", "timestamp_created": 1473900505, "timestamp_updated": 1473900505, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493421", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25503889": {"recommendationid": "25503889", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998133593", "num_games_owned": 404, "num_reviews": 119, "playtime_forever": 1620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518722971}, "language": "english", "review": "Fantastic port that runs silky, smooth without any issues.\nIt's pretty much the same Dead Rising experience we got back in 2006, just running in a higher resolution and 60+ fps.\n\nThey did fix/improve some things, for an example you get the level 2 speed upgrade much sooner now which is great, you can have multiple save slots too and some of the rare crashes that were present in the old 360 version have been fixed according to other players. \n\nAlso, the game supports Playstation 4 controllers, even has button prompts and everything which is a big plus for me since i love using the Dualshock 4 controller more then my old 360 controller.

Even during busy sections with hundreds of bodies on screen the game runs smoothly, absolotely no issues with the visuals save for a few graphical glitches which were also present on the xbox 360 version, which usually effects shadows and hairlines and this is without running crossfire, nothing major. \n\nThe graphics settings are functional but lacking, you can change basic stuff like Shadow Quality, Anti-Aliasing, V-sync and Texture Filtering but not much else. All keys are fully rebindable and the game has controller support, in fact you can switch between both K+M and Xbox Controller on the fly and the game will update the icons instantly. I have found that the game won't allow me to bind anything to Mouse 5, something to bear in mind if you like using mouse buttons. One issue with the keyboard controls is that there is no animations for turning, moving Frank with WASD makes him snap in a direction so holding W+A for example will start you running instantly northwest with no inbetween turning animation, it's not a huge issue but it does look ugly and it's worth mentioning that in the latest Dead Rising 3 on the PC, this does not occur. I personally use a controller which I think has better movement.\n\nThe in-game graphics are very dated but they are a huge improvement over the 360 version, there's a lot less screen tearing and the character models seem to be more detailed, there is an issue with the depth of field at higher resolutions, it's especially noticeable during cutscenes where the game will render low-fideltiy models of certain areas which weren't meant to be seen clearly but in this version they are a lot more noticeable, it's not a deal breaker by any means but it threw me off when I first saw it. The save system is the same as the Xbox version i.e. terrible, this version does offer seperate save slots for starting a new game, which is a very welcome addition, but still remembering to save often is a must otherwise you can lose a lot of progress. It's worth mentioning that other reviewers have found an issue with their save corrupting, I tested out saving and loading in different areas but I haven't encountered this issue.\n\nAs for the game itself; the story is bad, but not unenjoyable. It's the good kind of bad that plays out like a cheesy, unitentionally funny B-movie and it's pretty endearing. You play as a journalist en route to Willamette, Colorado to cover a zombie story and uncover the truth behind the outbreak, the game has a good balance between serious heavy narrative elements that contrast with dressing up like a transsexual Guy Fieri and caving in a Zombies skull with a dumbbell. The plot won't blow your mind, it's heavy handed, badly written and completely absurd but for this type of game it actually works pretty well and Frank is a very likeable character.\n\nThe game is a sandbox set in the Willamette Parkview Mall, Each section of the mall is divided by areas with different features and stores, the player can pick up common objects and use them to kill zombies, you can also find food and drink to replinsih health, The game has a leveling system which uses Prestige Points (PP) as experience, you get PP from Killing zombies, taking photographs and rescuing survivors amongst some other things and you're reawrded with more health, item slots, abilities etc. The Mall is an excellent map which has a lot of different secrets, shortcuts and variety, every area feels unique and I've come to know the layout of the whole game like the back of my hand, really nicely designed and a great setting for the game. Combat is very satisfying and in my opinion the best in the series. One little detail is that the game intentionally stutters when you hit a zombie which makes the whole experience visceral, bloody and very satisfying, the absurd amount of weapons, items, food and cosmetics is fantastic and each item has it's own moveset, even different guitars like bass guitars and electric guitars will have different heavy attacks. The controls take some time to get used to but they work, you can't move whilst aiming a gun which is quite frustrating. \n\nThe game facilitates players who fancy a shameless zombie murder spree, even if you fail the main missions you can continue playing and recieve the 'bad' ending, the game has multiple endings with the 'true' ending leading to an epilogue of sorts. The game also features additional weapons and clothing which can only be accessed after completing the game whilst meeting certain pre-requisites. Dead rising incetivises repeat playthroughs and caters to different play-styles, whether you want to scope out secrets or play zombie genocide you'll find that the game will reward you differently. However if you want to save survivors it's rather unfortunate the AI in the game is nothing short of abysmal. You have to escort survivors to the security room but they will frequently run into objects, get stuck, stand still and cry, get stunlocked by zombies and be generally infuriating. This is a huge black spot on the game, saving survivors isn't always neccessary but it gives you a huge PP boost and other useful stuff like shortcuts. There's a item which is supposed to make survivors less stupid but even then it's still unbearable, and god save your soul if you try to save 4 survivors at once because it's a total mess. \n\nThe game has boss battles which add variety and challenge, the difficulty level varies a lot in this regard; some bosses are straightforward in that you tank damage, heal and hit them back, some require more thought and strategy, you can cheese the bosses with cheap tactics if you don't like them, I think they're a nice addition and add a lot to the game, but without going into too much detail the bosses can use very cheap, very unfair attacks and be extremely frustrating to fight, some of them are just very poorly designed. remember to save often.\n\nThere are a couple of little annoyances about the game; the transciever will incessantly ring until the player answers the call, the conversation which ensues lasts far too long and prevents the player from attacking and if the player is interrupted whilst receiving a call such as being attacked by a zombie the conversation will restart with the player being scolded by a support character for 'hanging up.' Two handed weapons are dropped if the player gets hit, uses an item or switches to a different item as well as removing the players ability to cliimb ledges, so they're almost not worth using at all. The second game in the series did iron out these gameplay wrinkles but personally I think that this game is more enjoyable than Dead Rising 2, the combat is more satisfying, the Map is nicely designed and the protagonist is more interesting. \n\nIn closing, Dead Rising is a very flawed game but it's also very inspired and extremely fun to play and re-play, once you start to learn all the nuances and odd quirks the game has you're rewarded with a unique experience, I can't think of another game series that let's me don a floral pattern dress and MegaMan helmet whilst glefully mincing up black friday shoppers in a lawnmower.", "timestamp_created": 1473897981, "timestamp_updated": 1478541279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.604607", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25503132": {"recommendationid": "25503132", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998730992", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 2047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506505032}, "language": "english", "review": "It's fucking great since 2006, they did a great job porting it to PC.", "timestamp_created": 1473895624, "timestamp_updated": 1473895750, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.467035", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25503114": {"recommendationid": "25503114", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990088225", "num_games_owned": 590, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 172, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503839709}, "language": "english", "review": "Completed the game when it first released 10 years ago, the game itself is great...

F**k you! You saved at a bad point and missed a critical deadline?

And all those things I mentioned above? They're all a part of that.\n\nDead Rising knows when it's fun to be fun, and when it's fun to be annoying. And it is some of the funnest fun you'll ever fun! The saving system, the timed events, the escort missions... They are all annoying enough that you'll notice them, but almost never annoying enough that you'll get tired of them. They keep you on edge. They make you care. They make you think about the way you play. They make me... Make me scream your screams (pointless Muse reference).\n\nIt's good to play a game today, besides Dark Souls, that understand that true player empowerment is equally about what makes you strong and what makes you weak. Being/getting good at a game is only empowering and fun if there's always something to be bad at. Upsides can't exist if they never have downsides.\n\nDead Rising 3, while I personally loved it, forgot that. It just took out any and all \"inconveniences\" found in the first two games without realizing that those where critical to the challenge and fun of those games. It threw all of the gameplay's stakes and tension out the window.\n\nThis port is perfect. It doesn't pretend to know any better than the original, it keeps everything intact and, while that might seem lazy on the surface, I have to applaud the devs for that. So many people, even hardcore fans, blindly complain about the s**t mentioned above, without realizing just how bland the game would be without them (Dead Rising 4). It would have been so easy for them to \"go the extra mile\" and \"fix those issues\". But, they didn't. Thank you devs for being lazy, it's highly appreciated.\n\nI am so thankful for this port. No matter how many times I tried, I could never get into Dead Rising because of the limitations of the 360's hardware. I'd just play it for a bit, get bugged out by it and go back to DR2 or 3 on PC. But, now? It's amazing. I honestly didn't think 1080p144fps would make THAT MUCH of a difference. Much like when I played trough Halo 2: Anniversary, I finally \"get it\". I finally see what people saw or, maybe, what I always thought I saw. It's finally as good as it always seemed to be. It- It's just so good... So.

(well not really, I only became PCMR like 3-4 years ago), but still.\n\nThis game runs relatively well, supports basically all resolutions, and up to 144Hz (for my monitor). It has VSync toggle, antialias options and a motion blur toggle, and anisotropic filtering I believe, with options for shadow resolution.\n\nThe game looks significantly better and feels significantly smoother than it's 360 counterpart, the textures weren't updated, but the overall resolution and FPS update help breathe new life into an otherwise dated title.\n\nNow, I'm a HUGE Deead Rising Fanboy, I played this game back on 360 endlessly and 100%'d every facet of the game, 7 day survivor, genocider, Frank the Pimp, you name it, and I've been needing an excuse to go through and do it all again, and now I have it. With a respectable 25 dollar price tag, you will easily get endless hours of fun. This will be a better game than Dead Rising 3 (or even 4) will ever be, and I'm so grateful they re-released it, considering the way the franchise is straying from the path, hopefully sales of this game make everyone see that we want the true DR experience back. Not the casualized, \"streamlined\" \"focus group\" Dead Rising it's becoming.\n\nThe time mechanic is an interesting system, as it encourages play management and prioritization. Making the player choose between events and encouraging replayability if the player finds they run out of time to do certain objectives. This allows for different and multiple play throughs with different goals or aspirations. Maybe a true end playthrough, or an achievement playthrough, or maybe you want to get all the psychos in 1 playthrough and not worry about survivors, or maybe you just want a playthrough where you run around killing zombies in the sandbox. The time mechanic really is at it's core what Dead Rising has always been about, replayability, managing your objectives, and thinking/playing intelligently. It also adds difficulty, as if you run out of time, and you didn't save back when you had plenty of time, you will never have enough time. This doesn't end the game though, as you can still screw around doing scoops saving survivors and ultimately getting rescued, you just won't uncover the truth, and instead will end up with one of the game's many alternate endings! Events in each playthrough always take place at the exact same times, so you can plan for specific survivor scoops at specific times and locations, as well as psycho battles.\n\nLeveling is mostly organic and passive, you level as you play by rescuing survivors, taking photographs (He's covered wars you know) and of course, killing boatloads of undead zambies. Progression is interesting, as instead of choosing perks or abilities as you level on your own, the game grants you them in a specific order, as to maintain balance through leveling. You will become stronger with additions to your combat repertoir, increases to your movement speed, health bar amount, inventory slots and stuff like that. All these enhancements are given at precise levels so you aren't completely overpowered in any way by, say, level 10 or 20 (like in DR3), but by the cap of 50 you feel like quite the badass.\n\nSurvivor Escorts are one thing I wish they'd improve. I LOVE survivor escorts, it feels very rewarding to get multiple survivors back to the safe house, and gaining 2-3 or more levels in a single instance. And it's difficult enough that escorting a lot of survivors successfully takes patience and some degree of skill at navigation and zombie slaying, while barking out commands to go to a specific location or to \"follow me\". The main issue though, that sours the escort experience a LOT... Is the downright retarded AI, I had hoped they'd improve the AI code at least a bit, but it's 10 years old and it was even BAD by 2006 standards. So you'll have survivors who you are trying to save running headlong into hordes of the undead with 25% HP, or they'll get grabbed and be stuck way back not being freed until YOU hit the zombie. This is somewhat mitigated through a book you get in-game that helps with survivor escorts by improving the AI, but you get it fairly late in the game as a drop from one of the psychopaths.\n\nThe story is pretty simple, you are photojournalist Frank West who heard tell of a goings on in a small town in Colorado, so you fly in to figure it out and get the scoop. You get dropped off at the town's main attraction, the gigantic Mall, you have nothing but your camera and anything you can find, survive, get the story, make it out alive, all in 72 hours.\n\nOverall the combat is fun, there's exemplary weapon variety (literally everything), and the zombie types are varied enough to feel different, but models and such do repeat, but this game is 10 years old.\n\nI LOVE this game, it's one of my favorite games of all time (Not most favorite though), and I push everyone to pick up the copy, especially considering the price. I'd actually prefer it if you bought this over Dead Rising 3 or 4 (especially 4, they CHANGED FRANK'S VA, WTF!?), 2 is fine because that game stayed true to the roots of the series, and kept the DR magic and enjoyment (whilst adding juicy co-op). This game is the pinnacle of the franchise, and an outright amazing game by it's own merits, I can't recommend it enough.\n\n(Sidenote, this might be a weird bit of censorship, but I recall Jessie having a subtle amount of boob jiggle in the 360 version, it seems it's absent here.

Plus, changes can be made on the fly and don't require restarts or launchers, which is always nice. \nThe framerate is uncapped if you so desire and the keyboard controls can be completely rebound, which is excellent.\nEven during the most hectic of moments I found that the framerate was very stable, only noticing the occasional minor drop as the screen is completely flooded with zombies.\nLoading screens are nice and fast too, barely giving you enough time to register the image on screen before you're instantly loaded back into the next location, which is superb as you will be passing through loading screens quite often throughout the game.\nLastly, the addition of 5 save slots is very welcome as the original only had one, but being able to save onto multiple slots throughout allows for you to split off from the story and try out other possibilites without having to start over, which I adore due to the always ticking clock and time management aspects of the game.\n\nIn terms of negatives, I personally don't have any, but I wish to include some anyway just in case they affect you.\n- It has been reported that save files have known to become corrupted on a number of different systems, I'm not entirely sure of what causes this, but I hope they fix it soon.\n- It has also been reported in other reviews that occasionally the user is greeted with a \"Failed to Initialize DirectX\" message when trying to launch the game, which affects a number of systems and is fixable, however, this issue really shouldn't be here at all and I hope they get around to fixing that too.\n\nWhile none of these issues affect me, that doesn't mean that they don't exist and it's possible that they will affect you as a result, so please do a little bit of research prior to purchase so you know what you're getting into. The Steam Refund is there for a reason, after all.\n\nFinally, in terms of Dead Rising itself, I adore it.\nIt's one of my favourite games of all time from \"way back\" on the 360 over 10 years ago, and to this day I still feel that it holds up remarkably well despite it's problems, boasting some over-the-top violence while still sporting a well thought out story with lots of neat little ideas to boot.\nI have played through this game so many times in the past, and I fully intend to play through it many more now that it has finally come to PC.\n\nI'm giving it a very solid recommendation, for both newcomers to the series and to those that played it when it was first released.", "timestamp_created": 1473786439, "timestamp_updated": 1473786507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny":

The port itself is quite good. Not perfect, but it has been perfectly functional for me.\n\nGraphics options are limited, though you can uncap the framerate and enable/disable vsync. MSAA at varying levels is your only antialiasing option. The textures are noticably aged, but are fine for a game that's a decade old. Hopefully some mods can provide some higher resolution textures. \n\nSound works fine most of the time, though some audio samples are of varying quality. I think this may have been the original quality though, not an issue with the port.\n\nThe game performance is good, with stable framerates when running around grabbing stuff. Hitting a big cluster of zombies with a big object may cause a lag spike, however it is very brief. Loading times are monumentally improved compared to the original.\n\nThe game itself is a joy to play. It is simplistic compared to DR2 and beyond, but I prefer this. No running around for money like a neurotic Hebrew; no overpowered combo weapons from \"Wrestlemania meets backyard warriors;\" just you, a mall and a big bunch of zombies in your way with some believable psychopaths for you to overcome. \n\nThe game is more serious compared to the other games, though it can be goofy if you choose to dress up and use silly items. This humour contrasts nicely against the gravity of the situation, which can make it all the funnier. The other games tried to play the humour straight and it was overbearing.", "timestamp_created": 1473778115, "timestamp_updated": 1473778180, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25494960": {"recommendationid": "25494960", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076511931", "num_games_owned": 329, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 49, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1474809879}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8bb0\u5f97\u5934\u6b21\u73a9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5b9e\u57288\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u521d\u4e09\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u5728X360\u4e0a\u88ab\u60ca\u8273\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u65f6\u9694\u591a\u5e74\u53c8\u91cd\u65b0\u6478\u4e86\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5f88\u591a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e00\u4e0b\u5b50\u91cd\u56de\u6211\u7684\u89c6\u91ce\u91cc\uff0c\u611f\u8c22\u5361\u8868\uff01\n\n\u53e6\u9644\u6c49\u5316\u5730\u5740\uff1ahttp://bbs.3dmgame.com/thread-5279402-1-1.html", "timestamp_created": 1473777773, "timestamp_updated": 1473914910, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706432", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25494916": {"recommendationid": "25494916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034066623", "num_games_owned": 254, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1130, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514844013}, "language": "english", "review": "Excellent port of an excellent game. 10/10 would recommend for fans of the original and anyone looking to murder thousands of zombies with whatever you happen to find in a shopping mall.", "timestamp_created": 1473777602, "timestamp_updated": 1473777602, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25494755": {"recommendationid": "25494755", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025708902", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3964, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511326460}, "language": "english", "review": "The best in the series is now on Steam.", "timestamp_created": 1473776945, "timestamp_updated": 1473776945, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586207", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25494500": {"recommendationid": "25494500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029616528", "num_games_owned": 1470, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1499461886}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\ucea1\ucf64\uacfc\uc758 \uae34\ubc00\ud55c \uad00\uacc4\uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \uacfc\uac70 \ubd80\ud130 \ub370\ub4dc\ub77c\uc774\uc9d5\uc744 \ubc00\uc811\ud558\uac8c \uac00\uae4c\uc774\uc788\ub5a4 \uc720\uc800\ubc0f \uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc758 \uc785\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c,\n\uc0dd\uac01\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubc84\uadf8\uac00 \uc880 \ub9ce\uc740\uac70 \uac19\uc74c\n\n\ub2e8\uc810?!\n1. \uc138\uc774\ube0c \ubc84\uadf8  (\uc885\uc885 \uc138\uc774\ube0c\ud30c\uc77c\uc774 \uc624\uc5fc\ub418\uc11c \ud130\uc9d0)\n2.

Defintley something capcom has done right in the past 10  years. this game, is the best out of the series. it just has a certain shine and touch to it that no other could emulate. frustrating at times, but in the end it defintley reminded me why i played it so much back in the day and why  it IS sooo worth the memories playing through it again. give it a go, at full price or during a sell if you are on edge. thanks for reading my review!", "timestamp_created": 1473763203, "timestamp_updated": 1474600714, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.000000", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25491887": {"recommendationid": "25491887", "author": {"steamid": "76561198221594388", "num_games_owned": 52, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 4395, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502014747}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u043f\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0442 \u042d\u0434 \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0435: \"\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0445\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438: \u043d\u0438 \u0445\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0435\u0442!\"\n\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0443.\n+\u041d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446-\u0442\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\n+\u041e\u0442\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\n+\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0444\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438, \u0434\u043b\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u0441 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043a\u0438 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\n-\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0441\u044b \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u043a \u043e\u0440\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0443 - \u0418\u0418 \u041d\u0418\u041f\u043e\u0432, \u0437\u043e\u043c\u0431\u0438, \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0443 \u0431\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0432\nP.S. \u0412 \u041c\u041e\u0415\u041c \u041c\u0410\u0413\u0410\u0417\u0418\u041d\u0415 \u041c\u0410\u0420\u041e\u0414\u0415\u0420\u0410\u041c \u041d\u0415 \u041c\u0415\u0421\u0422\u041e\u041e\u041e\u041e\u041e\u041e\u041e\u041e\u041e", "timestamp_created": 1473762900, "timestamp_updated": 1480163987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608344", "comment_count": "1", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25491850": {"recommendationid": "25491850", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008006950", "num_games_owned": 617, "num_reviews": 89, "playtime_forever": 633, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475594189}, "language": "english", "review": "An amazing port for a FANTASTIC game.", "timestamp_created": 1473762628, "timestamp_updated": 1473762628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.379180", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25491663": {"recommendationid": "25491663", "author": {"steamid": "76561198220233176", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 1023, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1475219074}, "language": "japanese", "review": "XBOX\u306f\u975e\u6240\u6301\u3001Wii\u306e\u30ea\u30e1\u30a4\u30af\u306f\u5225\u7269\u3068\u904a\u3076\u6a5f\u4f1a\u304c\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u81ea\u5206\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\nPC\u3067\u904a\u3079\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u611f\u52d5\u3082\u306e\u3067\u3059", "timestamp_created": 1473761482, "timestamp_updated": 1473761482, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.438768", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25491589": {"recommendationid": "25491589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022094406", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511415480}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite the pleasant surprise, I thought this would be an 360 exclusive forever!

So, let's see on how the PC port is, shall we? To start, oh my good lord, IT IS SO SMOOTH!! Whoever Capcom hired to make this port come alive, did an absolute fan-tastic job with bringing this game to PC.. I can call my life seriously complete now, honestly. And the pricing for this game? It's no $30, it's not even $60, it's a solid wonderful and worth it mind you, $20. Consider me SOLD! I love this game so dearly, it keeps my heart pumping. This game is nonetheless the BEST Dead Rising game in the series, I do like the other games, but the others can't beat this classic. Great gameplay, awesome main character, hell even the story is intertwined so well. I love how the story unfolds as you complete each Chapter per-se, it makes it that much more of a mystery. As I'm very proud to say, this game and it's outstanding port to the PC deserves a rating of 10 out of 10.. Please, do everyone who is a fan of this marvelous game a favor and buy this game not on sale or on sale, it's very much worth the price.

It's one of the earliest killer app titles for the console and was the game most people bought a 360 for prior to Halo 3. At the time it blew people away with how groundbreaking it was in terms of technology and continuously remains on top ten lists to this day.\n\nIn Dead Rising you play as Frank West. A journalist who enters the small town of Willamette Colorado by helicopter. Dropped onto the roof of the local mall, he has 3 days to figure out the origin of the zombie apocalypse that has befallen the town, and return to the roof alive in the process. Frank is the anchor the game hinges around, he's a loveable selfish scoundrel who has a ton of lines that are instantly quotable. While the rest of the characters are kind of forgettable, you want to finish the game purely because you wanna see what Frank does next. \n\nCompared to the later games in the series and even other zombie survival games Dead Rising is very different, and infact feels foreign and hostile to the player. For starters, you have a very strict time limit. Frank has 72 hours to complete all of his objectives, and the game enforces this harshly. You can only complete your objectives within a certain time period. And this leaves very little time to explore the mall or screw around. Likewise, most of the player's weapons are household objects like baseball bats and power tools. And they break very quickly. The mall is entirely filled with zombies, and you can see up to 800 zombies on the screen at once. But the zombies aren't the player's objective, they're an obstacle. And the inherant fun of the game is finding unique ways to get around them. It is very enjoyable to carve a path through a bunch of zombies while saving all of your weapons and healing items for a tougher encounter later. \n\nAfter completing the game's initial 72 hour mode, there's an additional \"Overtime\" mode that lasts an additional day, and a more interesting \"Infinity\" mode. Infinity mode spawns Frank in the mall, and you continuously lose health due to hunger. And the objective is to continuously find more food items in the mall so you can keep yourself alive. It's a really fun mode and I was slightly disappointed in later Dead Rising games they removed hunger entirely in their sandbox modes. It's one of the most immersive optional modes to a game I've ever played. \n\nWhile Dead Rising was liked for it's technical innovations, it was remembered for its humor. Frank is a joy to play as but there's also this Japanese style of humor. Frank can wear silly costumes and use silly weapons like toy megabusters. This is all juxtaposed with a mostly down to Earth and relatively serious story. Compared to the later Dead Rising games, this contrast feels the most amusing and works the best. \n\nLastly the game was not ported to PC until 2016. I can safely say the PC port feels just right, with only a slight handful of bugs. It also allows you to play in mouse and keyboard with rebindable keys, along with gamepad support and support for higher anti aliasing, framerates and resolutions up to 4K. It also includes the relatively pointless cosmetic DLC from the original 360 version, so you can sleep easy knowing this is now the definitive version of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1473744900, "timestamp_updated": 1473745168, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.601820", "comment_count": "6", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25489481": {"recommendationid": "25489481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104983761", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481126300}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u042f \u0436\u0434\u0430\u043b \u044d\u0442\u0443 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443.\n\u0418 \u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u043c,\u044f \u043d\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443,\u044f \u0434\u0443\u043c\u0430\u043b \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a RE4. \u041d\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442.\n\u041f\u041e\u0420\u0422 \u041f\u041e\u041b\u0423\u0427\u0418\u041b\u0421\u042f \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0421\u0422\u041e \u041e\u0424\u0418\u0413\u0415\u041d\u041d\u042b\u041c.\n60 FPS. \u0423\u0434\u043e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435. \u041d\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0438. \n\u0412\u0441\u0451 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438 CAPCOM \u0432 \u044d\u0442\u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438,\u043a\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0441 DR3 \u0438 RE4.\n\u041f\u043e\u044d\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u044b \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0410\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043d \u041b\u043e\u0433\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432:\"\u042d\u0422\u041e \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0421\u0422\u041e 10/10\"", "timestamp_created": 1473744869, "timestamp_updated": 1473745759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 186, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694932", "comment_count": "14", "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25489471": {"recommendationid": "25489471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043886393", "num_games_owned": 220, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 995, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485650235}, "language": "english", "review": "Great port, at least in my experience. Runs great on both my high end rig and my laptop. Haven't tried keyboard controls, but usually Gamepad is better for Dead Rising anyway.

I only really recommend it if you:\n\nA) Have nostalgia for this game. Again, it's a great port, go for it if you want to relive this classic. Hell, it's why I bought it in the first place.\nB) Are a fan of Dead Rising as a whole, and have never played this title before. THis is still a great game and definately worth playing if your a fan of 2 and 3.\n\nApart from that, this game has a massive difficulty curve and lacks the combo weapon mechanic the series later became known for, and no co-op. However, it has Cheesy (but lovable) voice acting, Mega Man references, and of course, Frank \"Fucking\" West.

This is done by making the silliness and humor feel incidental, by letting YOU be the one that ends up causing the things that are fun and enjoyable to happen, in this game everything it's a weapon, from pretty standar stuff like chainsaws, axes, and baseball bats, to more rare stuff, like frying pans that you can put on top of stoves to then melt zombies faces with it, or maybe even throwing at them some oil so you can see how they fall down and take pictures of them.\n\nDead Rising is in my opinion one of the few games that while not being \"genre defining\" it's certainly a game that holds a place in a lot of people's hearts, if you're getting this game it's probably going to be because of the nostalgia that brings to you, or simply because you wanted it to play it again, in my opinion the asking price it's excellent and in that sense capcom has really outdone themselves, remember what happened with something like the ol dlc on disc, and all the other controversies.\n\nI like the fact that i can actually finally feel like i own this game, even if i still have my old copy from way back in the day.\n\nP.s.
